0,POLITICS,GOP Doing All It Can To Keep Pennsylvania's Gerrymandered Congressional Map,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-gerrymandering_us_5a8f3094e4b01e9e56b9b243,Republicans are pursuing every possible legal avenue to try to keep a congressional map that benefits them.,2018-02-22,This 2011 file photo shows the state Capitol in Pennsylvania. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f326b1e0000fb077ac8f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pennsylvania Republicans took another stab at blocking a court-ordered congressional map on Thursday by filing a new lawsuit that asks a three-judge federal panel to step in.The suit comes one day after GOP leaders in the state said they had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block the new map. In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the congressional map that had been in place since 2011, saying it gave Republicans such a considerable advantage over Democrats that it violated the state’s constitution. The state Supreme Court gave lawmakers and the governor three weeks to agree on a map, and then stepped in to draw its own when the two parties failed to do so.In their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and in their Thursday suit, Republicans said the state Supreme Court didn’t give them a meaningful chance to come up with a new map and that its decision to draw its own plan was unlawful. They argued only the U.S. Constitution grants legislatures the ability to draw congressional maps, and said they want the federal court to instruct the state to use the 2011 map for congressional elections this year.The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that argument earlier this month, when it declined to step in and block the state Supreme Court’s order. Republicans are hoping the courts might be willing to take another look now that the map is in place.Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said her agency was already working on implementing the court-ordered map and would continue to do so unless otherwise ordered by the courts.Lawyers representing the 18 voters who got the 2011 map struck down say the officials have no case in federal court because the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map based solely on Pennsylvania’s constitution. In a statement Wednesday, lawyers for the plaintiffs accused Republicans of taking frivolous legal action and wasting taxpayer money.The Republicans are suing Robert Torres, the acting secretary of the commonwealth, and Jonathan Marks, the commissioner for the bureau of commissions, elections and legislation. Lawyers for Torres and Marks have said they can run elections smoothly and on schedule with the new congressional map, but Republicans say it will cause chaos. Nominating petitions for congressional races are set to go out on Feb. 27, so the Republicans are asking the court to step in immediately.“Our concerns stem from the attack on the constitution initiated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ― not the design of a map,” Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jacob Corman (R), one of the people who filed the suit on Thursday, said in a statement. “What is at stake here is larger than the makeup of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation.”“We are unwilling to acquiesce to the court’s attempt to hijack the functions of the legislative and executive branches,” he added. President Donald Trump also encouraged Republicans to challenge the new congressional map earlier this week. The map the court drew is considerably more competitive than the 2011 plan the GOP is fighting for. Under that map, Republicans consistently won 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats ― despite winning around 50 percent of the vote. Republicans have expressed little interest in getting a new congressional map in place. Senate Majority Leader Joseph Scarnati (R) told the state Supreme Court that he wouldn’t hand over data it had asked for because he believed the court’s decision was unlawful. Republicans also moved to disqualify the vote of a Democratic judge on the court because he expressed opposition to gerrymandering when he was a candidate running for office.Corman filed the federal suit on Thursday with state Sen. Michael Folmer (R). GOP Reps. Lou Barletta, Ryan Costello, Mike Kelly, Tom Marino, Scott Perry, Keith Rothfus, Lloyd Smucker and Glenn Thompson also joined it."

That doesn’t sound like news, until you consider which think tank it is ― and exactly what it’s proposing.The think tank is the Center for American Progress, which is based in Washington and has close ties to the Democratic Party establishment. The proposal, which its authors call “Medicare Extra for All,” would create a new public program, based on Medicare, that would be open to anybody.The proposal, which Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar of The Associated Press first reported Wednesday evening, also calls for automatically enrolling the uninsured, among others, in this new program ― in the hopes of finally achieving universal coverage.Some will call this plan a single-payer proposal, because it’s easy to imagine, someday, everybody being part of this new version of Medicare. Some will say it’s not a single-payer proposal, because it envisions a permanent, potentially large role for private insurance ― as a provider of highly regulated plans that would function more or less the way private plans for seniors on Medicare operate today.But whatever the proposal’s label, it’s plainly a more ambitious ― and more progressive ― health plan than the Democratic Party’s most influential thinkers have embraced in the past. And that’s what makes it noteworthy.It’s a reflection of how far the party’s internal conversation has shifted in the direction of government-run insurance ― even since the 2016 presidential campaign, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made a pure single-payer system the cornerstone of his Democratic primary run. It’s also a leading indicator of how Democrats plan to approach health care as they start thinking about the 2020 presidential campaign.The shift is real ― and an outgrowth of changing circumstances in politics and policy. For most of the last few years, and especially in 2017, Democrats were preoccupied with trying to defend the Affordable Care Act from repeal at the hands of the Republicans. The architects of the 2010 health care law, including President Barack Obama, understood that it didn’t go far enough ― that it didn’t cover enough people and that it didn’t offer sufficiently good coverage to enough people. They had hoped to revisit and improve the law, but never had the chance. Instead, they’ve ceded power to President Donald Trump and the Republicans, who, unable to wipe Obamacare off the books, have tried to undermine it instead. Amid that environment, many of the program’s problems have lingered ― and some have gotten worse.But with the threat of full repeal receding, at least for the moment, Democrats are starting to think about what comes next. And increasingly they are thinking about public insurance as a supplement or substitute for private insurance. Discussions are underway among wonks and scholars, including a group that the Century Foundation and American Prospect magazine convened last month for a day of intense policy discussion in Washington. Discussions are also taking place in Congress, where some Democrats have proposed opening up Medicaid to more people, others are talking about doing the same for Medicare and a third of the Democratic caucus endorsed the latest proposal from Sanders ― which would actually eliminate private insurance altogether and give everybody a more generous version of Medicare.Now comes the Center for American Progress, known for reflecting and shaping the Democratic Party’s consensus, with a proposal that would be among the more ambitious ideas out there ― while still less sweeping than what Sanders has in mind.CAP’s plan envisions a public insurance program that looks vaguely like Medicare but with a more generous benefit structure. (Medicare doesn’t have a limit on out-of-pocket expenses, for example.) The new program would eventually absorb, through some kind of automatic enrollment, all Americans who have no insurance, are in Medicaid or buy private coverage on their own through HealthCare.gov or directly from insurers.Employers could continue to offer coverage and, because of the plan’s structure, it’s likely most would ― at least for the short- to medium-term future. But employers would have the option to buy coverage from the new Medicare plan and, critically, individual employees could opt into the new plan even if their employers were offering coverage.In these respects, CAP’s proposal bears more than a small resemblance to some other plans in circulation ― including one that Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker and the Economic Policy Institute first sketched out in 2007, as well as a scheme that writer Jon Walker put forward in the pages of Shadowproof just a year ago.“There is a broad consensus within the broad progressive debate that health care is a right and that everybody should have health care,” Neera Tanden, president of CAP, told HuffPost. “And we recognize the virtue of a strong public plan available to all the people.”The center’s plan has other provisions ― including a call to limit payments to the providers and producers of health care ― that would ultimately raise some of the same questions Sanders plan did during the campaign. Cutting those payments too dramatically can cause major disruptions in the health care industry, but without those dramatic cuts, any plan can quickly become too expensive.  CAP’s idea does not envision everybody with private insurance giving up their current coverage, as Sanders has proposed, but at least some people would end up losing their existing coverage. If the experience with the Affordable Care Act proved anything, that transformation is frequently a traumatic experience ― for the people who go through it and for the political system as well.The center’s plan is still just a vague framework, which means it leaves lots of unanswered questions ― starting with the exact financing mechanism. And to conservatives, of course, it would be exactly the wrong way to approach health care ― increasing spending, regulation and taxes, rather than decreasing all three.But this may be a case in which a plan’s details matter less than the signal it sends ― about the future of the Democratic Party and maybe about the health care system as well.

The tragedy, the 17th school shooting so far in 2018, has prompted a wave of activism in recent days and an outpouring of anger directed at lawmakers who have refused to pass gun control legislation.Such frustrations were on full display Wednesday as several people asked Florida Sens. Marco Rubio (R) and Bill Nelson (D) what they plan to do now. Ryan Deitsch, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, asked Rubio about Congress’ failure to rein in gun access and why its the students themselves who “have to march on Washington just to save innocent lives.”“You’re right,” the senator replied. “What you’ve lived through, and what you live through, is not supposed to be a part of your high school experience.”In a heated exchange, Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter, Jamie, was killed last week, demanded Rubio tell him that he would “work with us to do something about guns.”“Sen. Rubio, my daughter, running down the hallway at Marjory Douglas, was shot with an assault weapon, the weapon of choice,” Guttenberg said. “It is too easy to get. It is a weapon of war. The fact that you can stand here and can’t say that, I’m sorry.” Ashley Kurth, a teacher who sheltered nearly 70 students during the attack, addressed President Donald Trump’s suggestion earlier that day that educators in schools be armed to help prevent more shooting deaths.“When I had those hundreds of terrified children that were running at me, my question to that is, am I supposed to get extra training now to serve and protect on top of educate these children?” Kurth asked. “I mean, am I supposed to have a Kevlar vest? Am I supposed to strap it to my leg or put it in my desk? How am I supposed to go on that way?”Rubio broke with the president and said he didn’t believe teachers should be armed, saying, “Teachers that are armed with a weapon is not something that, quite frankly, I’m comfortable with.”Another teacher at the school, Diane Wolk-Rogers, defended the actions of the outspoken survivors of the massacre, some of whom have already become subject to derision from conservative commentators.“Our kids have started a revolution. I’m proud and I’m inspired to be a part of never again,” she said.The latter half of the town hall grew increasingly tense as students began asking questions of National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch. In response to a question about efforts to make semiautomatic weapons harder to obtain, Loesch said the NRA was against such legislation and said she was standing up for Americans.But Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, whose police force responded to the Feb. 14 shooting, lambasted the NRA’s role in quashing common-sense gun control legislation.“You just told this group of people that you are standing up for them,” Israel said, prompting a wave of applause. “You’re not standing up for them until you say, ‘I want less weapons.’”He continued: “We do need to have some gun control and reform. ... Anybody who says different, I don’t know about other people, but Emma [Gonzalez, a student survivor] and I ― we’re calling BS on that.”Loesch later noted that the suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, should not have been able to obtain a firearm, even though the gun used in the massacre was purchased legally.“People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” Loesch said. “People who are dangerous to themselves and other individuals should not be able to obtain a firearm.”The NRA’s influence came up earlier in the evening after high school student Cameron Kasky directly asked Rubio if he’d continue taking campaign donations from the group after the shooting.“Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?” Kasky asked, before the senator effectively said still he’d accept future contributions from the group.“People buy into my agenda ― and I do support the Second Amendment,” Rubio replied.The senator has received more than $3.3 million from the NRA over the course of his political career."

Students have appeared on national television to urge lawmakers to act; they’ve organized and inspired rallies in Florida, Washington, D.C., and across the nation; they’ve taken on trolls on social media and have stood firm amid a torrent of conspiracy theories aimed at undermining their activism.As students gathered at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Rep.

To take back power and build a more just country, they argue that Democrats and liberals must go beyond merely focusing on Trump and the prejudices he espouses.“We will resist Trump. But resistance is not enough,” the introduction to the pledge reads.“We therefore pledge that: We will fight for good jobs, sustainable prosperity and economic justice. We will work to build a movement that can make that agenda a reality.”In addition to endorsing “Medicare for all” and free college, staples of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, the pledge calls for a comprehensive infrastructure investment program, a green energy economy, a reversal of the Trump tax cuts and appropriate taxation of the wealthy, the empowerment of labor unions, and tougher regulation of Wall Street. It also calls for reduced economic inequality for women and communities of color, and reforms like public campaign financing aimed at “rescuing democracy from the special interests.”Few, if any, of the policies in the pledge are brand new ― a fact that its organizers freely admit.What makes the pledge notable, however, is the diverse array of figures who have signed it and the debate it represents over the future of the progressive movement and the Democratic Party. Signers range from Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, and United Steelworkers president Leo Gerard to Ai-Jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and Eddie Glaude Jr., chair of Princeton University’s center for African-American studies.Progressives, particularly those who backed Sanders’ presidential bid, have argued since the election that growing income disparities and the dominant role of money in politics left a populist void that Trump manipulated to his advantage. The theory holds that as a candidate, Trump’s outsider status, hawkishness on trade and grandiose claims about “draining the swamp,” won over some working-class voters ― particularly white families in the Rust Belt ― who typically voted for Democrats, including former President Barack Obama. At the same time, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s deep ties to financial elites and her history of changing positions meant she failed to turn out more liberal members of the Democratic base, including millennials and people of color.Soon after the 2016 election, there were signs that Democratic Party leaders were willing to heed these progressives’ advice and strike a more populist tone. In a platform unveiled over the summer, the party’s leaders in Congress embraced proposals to make it easier to unionize, crack down on corporate consolidation and reduce prescription drug prices. But with headlines about Russia-related indictments dominating the 24-hour news cycle and the anti-Trump “Resistance” movement often embracing the president’s neoconservative critics, progressive leaders are worried that Democrats will once again drop the ball.“There’s a large number of people who think all we need to do is oppose Trump, who think all we need to do is find an attractive candidate who runs on the platform of ‘I’m not Trump,’” said Roger Hickey, a co-director of the progressive Campaign for America’s Future and an architect of the pledge.“We can’t just emerge from this battle saying, ‘We are not crazy, we are not Trump.’ That’s what we did after [Richard] Nixon, and it got us one term of Jimmy Carter,” Hickey added.Acknowledging the unique factors at play in every election, Hickey emphasized that the pledge is not intended to be a “litmus test” for Democratic candidates as much as a framework for moving forward.“If the Democrats don’t start talking about a fundamental restructuring of the economy, either they will lose, or when they win, they will fail,” he said.The most common critique of the political theory behind the pledge is that progressives who claim that Trump’s victory was motivated by anything but blind racism are offensively naive. These critics argue that any attempt to win back the votes of white working-class people who switched from Obama to Trump would entail unnecessary concessions to those voters’ insensitivities to racial injustice and other issues.But Hickey, a native of Kentucky who began his career as a civil rights movement organizer in Southside Virginia, insisted that fighting for economic equality and racial justice is a “both/and,” rather than zero-sum, proposition.Support for the pledge from prominent African-Americans like Glaude, Heather McGhee, president of the think tank Demos, and Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, the legacy organization of Sanders’ campaign, could dampen this criticism.“A bold change in the economic system is the best way to generate economic opportunity for the most disenfranchised. It’s adding that economic argument to the anti-racism argument,” Hickey said."

Two of the clip’s steamy smooches take place between same-sex couples. Lead singer Nick Brown told HuffPost he and bandmates Justin Wilson and Jordan Young wanted to remind fans that “there is joy in being yourself” with the video. “It is very important to us ― not only as musicians, but just as humans ― to let the people in our lives, especially the listeners, know simply that no matter what walk of life you take that you are loved and accepted and have our support,” Brown said. As for showcasing same-sex couples against a backdrop of Norman Rockwell-esque Americana, he quipped, “We love tying in classic, timeless vibes. Who doesn’t love a good scene with a motorcycle?!”Music critics have applauded the gesture. Billboard called the video “a queer make-out celebration,” while Atwood Magazine praised Brown, Wilson and Young for sending a “true American message of love, freedom and acceptance.” “Kiss Like a Woman” is the first single from MONA’s forthcoming, and as-yet-untitled, new album. It will be the band’s first full-length release since 2013′s “Torches & Pitchforks.” Meanwhile, MONA ― which has opened for the likes of Arcade Fire, Kings of Leon and Robert Plant ― will kick off its latest era with performances in New York and Los Angeles next month.

Bhalla discussed the threats in a statement issued after a security breach at Hoboken’s City Hall last Thursday. No one was hurt in the incident, but a police investigation was launched and the city reached out to the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force to evaluate security procedures. “This incident, along with death threats to me and my family, is an unfortunate reminder that we need to take security seriously,” Bhalla said in the statement.According to the city’s statement, the incident occurred just before 8 p.m. Thursday, when Bhalla was not in the office. A man reportedly passed through the metal detectors at Hoboken’s City Hall and told security officers he was going to the restroom. Later, Bhalla’s deputy chief of staff, Jason Freeman, saw that a “bag with an object” had been thrown at a secretary’s desk. Freeman made eye contact with the man, who then ran out of the mayor’s office. Officials did not disclose what was in the bag.The mayor’s office has reportedly been working to implement the task force’s recommendations for “physical and procedural changes” to improve security in City Hall.Hoboken police did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment about the incident.“We take incidents like these incredibly seriously and will continue working to ensure the security of the mayor and everyone who visits City Hall,” Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante said in the city’s statement."
14,POLITICS,Democratic PAC Makes 6-Figure Ad Buy For Conor Lamb In Pennsylvania,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/end-citizens-united-conor-lamb-pennsylvania-special-election_us_5a8dd81ae4b0617d46395dac,The group End Citizens United is hitting Republican Rick Saccone’s spending habits.,2018-02-22,"Conor Lamb gestures as he delivers a speech at his campaign rally in Houston, Pennsylvania, on Jan. 13, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8dd90e2000008806eaf92d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic political action committee End Citizens United is buying about $250,000 worth of advertisements in support of Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate in the special election for Pennsylvania’s vacant 18th District.The ad buy will include digital video ads and a 30-second television spot attacking Republican Rick Saccone for reportedly questionable use of his expense account as a state representative.“Rick Saccone, promised no legislative perks in Harrisburg ― called them lavish, then gobbled them up, spending $435,000 taxpayer dollars on himself,” a narrator in the TV ad, “Clean House,” intones as black ink splashes a white canvas.The ad is drawn from a report in The Intercept detailing Saccone’s liberal use of his taxpayer-funded expense account since his 2010 election to the state House. Saccone, who won during the Tea Party wave, still touts his fiscally conservative bona fides.The ad notes that Lamb, by contrast, has refused to take campaign donations from corporate PACs. “We’re committed to making sure voters know Lamb’s record of integrity and Saccone’s history of exploiting taxpayers,” said End Citizens United President Tiffany Muller in a statement about the ad.The TV ad is due to appear on Monday and continue through March 4. The digital ads, which address similar themes, begin Friday and will continue through March 13, the day of the special election.The ad buy makes End Citizens United the only outside group currently taking to the airwaves on Lamb’s behalf. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $224,000 on a television ad supporting Lamb in late January but has since been off the air.End Citizens United, named for its opposition to a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that got rid of limits on corporate electoral spending, has also leveraged its sizable email list to raise $175,000 for Lamb’s bid. The group said it has 3,700 members in the southwest Pennsylvania district where Lamb is running.Lamb, 33, needs all the help from outside groups that he can get. Although he has outraised Saccone, a 60-year-old former military intelligence officer and diplomat, GOP-aligned outside groups have poured millions into the race on Saccone’s behalf. As of earlier this month, four conservative groups, including the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), had outspent Democratic outside groups by a 17-to-one margin. They have tried to paint Lamb as a stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whom conservative voters loathe. Lamb has already said he opposes Pelosi as the party’s House leader.However, the level of national Republican attention and resources flowing into the district reflect GOP leaders’ anxieties that a solid red district is so competitive. President Donald Trump, who won the 18th District by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016, is due to campaign for Saccone between now and the election day. The president already plugged Saccone’s candidacy at a January visit to the district ostensibly aimed at promoting GOP tax cut legislation.In a bid to win over swing voters in the blue-collar district, Lamb has mixed a kitchen table-pitch to protect Social Security and labor unions with more conservative stances on issues like gun control and coal energy. Thus far, Lamb has welcomed House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) to the district to campaign for him. Former Vice President Joe Biden is also slated to hold a rally for Lamb in the district before the election.If Lamb does not win this time around, he will have another shot at a House seat in a more competitive district in November. As a result of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s redrawing of the state’s congressional districts, Lamb now lives in the 17th District, where Rep. Keith Rothfus (R) is running for re-election. Trump won Rothfus’ old district by 21 percentage points, but would have carried the new one by just 3 points, according to The New York Times."

Considering it’s never been colonized, it represents an Afrofuturist, unapologetic blackness rarely seen on screen.From the looks of their fevered tweets, social media users were beginning to pack their bags for the fictional nation, too.Flooded with requests for more details, the airport played along. One person asked what the menu on the flight looked like, and the airport responded, “Sorghum, millet, rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes, beans, yams and okra.”Another person inquired about connecting flights to Zamunda ― the fictional African nation from the 1988 classic “Coming to America” ― and of course, ATL had them.Even “Black Panther” star Lupita Nyong’o joined in, asking if the in-flight movies would include titles such as “T’Challa’s Angels” and “Killmonger Bill.”The reactions highlight how African culture is celebrated throughout “Black Panther.” Since the movie’s release, Wakanda has come to represent the possibilities of a fully decolonized continent. Director Ryan Coogler, production director Hannah Beachler and costume designer Ruth E. Carter teamed up in envisioning Wakanda, making sure to represent a specific aspect of the continent’s culture in every step.To do so, Beachler created the Wakandan Bible, which ensured the movie stayed true to African traditions. Wakandans speak the Bantu language Xhosa, while each of their five tribes represents a real African people. For example, Carter fashioned the Jabari tribe in the movie after the Dogon people of West Africa.This dedication to accuracy and Afrocentrism has left audiences ― and especially black audiences ― no choice but to dive headfirst into the fantasy.And while ATL’s flight isn’t real, that doesn’t mean future Wakandans aren’t still hoping to book one-way flights back to their fictional home country."

Eric Greitens was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on charges of felony invasion of privacy.Greitens, a Republican, was embroiled in a scandal last month after a local news report alleged he had an affair with a woman and then took compromising photographs of her to use as blackmail. The details of the report were provided to a St. Louis CBS affiliate by the woman’s ex-husband, who told the station that there was “no worse person” than Greitens.The governor later admitted he had an affair in 2015 before he was elected to office, but he denied there was any blackmail and he didn’t identify the woman.A call to the governor’s office Thursday was not immediately returned.Thursday’s indictment involved a March 21, 2015, incident that was not specified. Missouri law states that invasion of privacy laws include the taking of photos of a person without their consent while they’re in a state of full or partial nudity. Individuals can be charged with a misdemeanor if such images aren’t disseminated, but the charge is classified as a felony if the photos are distributed by any means.Greiten’s indictment lists his charge as a Class D felony, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. It has a three-year statute of limitations.“The defendant knowingly photographed [the victim] in a state of full or partial nudity without the knowledge and consent of [the victim] and in a place where a person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy,” the charge reads. “The defendant subsequently transmitted the image contained in the photograph in a manner that allowed access to that image via a computer.”“As I have stated before, it is essential for residents of the City of St. Louis and our state to have confidence in our leaders,” St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardener said in a statement announcing the charges. “They must know that the Office of the Circuit Attorney will hold public officials accountable in the same manner as any other resident of our city.”Greitens has so far rebuffed calls that he resign, even though several members of his party have told him to step aside after the blackmail allegations first surfaced. Republican lawmakers quickly echoed such sentiment after the indictment, including Republican state Sen. Rob Schaaf, who told The New York Times the Missouri House would act to remove the governor if he didn’t step down.A reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said he saw Greitens being led away in custody at the Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis on Thursday. The newspaper confirmed that the governor was booked at the St. Louis Justice Center but was expected to be released on bond. This article has been updated with details about the indictment and the blackmail allegations."

The attack is the 17th school shooting in 2018 alone. Since then, student activists including Calderon have organized and called on Trump and legislators to enact stricter gun laws.

Because right now I’m pretty sick of having to talk about teachers being armed. Because that is not even a possibility in my mind.”Trump elaborated on his idea in a series of tweets Thursday morning, writing that he “never said ‘give teachers guns.’” He went on to write that “only the best” teachers, as in ones “with military or special training experience,” should be given guns. “Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this,” Trump tweeted. “Far more assets at much less cost than guards.

The report, compiled each year with information from U.S. embassies around the world, typically details the lack of contraception and abortion access in various countries and sheds light on racial and sexual discrimination.This year, a senior aide to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly directed the department to remove much of that information from the document. The new report will focus instead on forced sterilization and abortions, and the “Reproductive Rights” subsection in the report will be renamed “Coercion in Population Control.”The section on racial and sexual discrimination will be pared down, according to the Politico story.The move follows a string of attempts by the Trump administration to de-prioritize women’s rights and roll back women’s access to contraception and abortion around the world. “This development is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to not only deprioritize reproductive rights, but effectively erase them from the broader conversation on human rights,” said Tarah Demant, director of gender, sexuality, and identity at Amnesty International USA. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the department is “better focusing some sections of the report for clarity,” and sharpening it to spotlight “the most egregious issues.”The administration’s proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year, released earlier this month, would cut nearly $2.5 billion from the Global Health Programs Account, slashing global family planning funding by half.Trump also reinstated and massively expanded the Global Gag Rule, restricting $8.8 billion in U.S. foreign aid funding for international health programs that provide or even mention abortion services. And he defunded the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), a global maternal health organization that provides contraception and pregnancy care to low-income women in 150 countries. Women’s health workers around the world are already seeing the effects of Trump’s policies on women and girls, who are seeking dangerous and sometimes deadly back-alley abortions as family planning clinics are forced to shut down. Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal mortality globally. “Girls aren’t able to get contraception, and they’re starting to come back pregnant, suicidal, bereft,” said Lisa Shannon, a global women’s rights advocate who works with reproductive health clinics in East Africa. “They’re desperate, and they’ll do whatever it takes.” "

The actor believes one of the reasons his career hit a standstill was because of an alleged incident with Philip Berk, a former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which hosts the Golden Globes. Fraser told GQ that Berk groped him at a luncheon in 2003. “His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around,” Fraser said. “I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry.”He added: “I became depressed ... I was blaming myself and I was miserable—because I was saying, ‘This is nothing; this guy reached around and he copped a feel.’”Fraser later demanded and received a written apology from the organization, but he wasn’t satisfied with it. Berk maintains the interaction was in jest, calling the actor’s version of events a “total fabrication.” “My apology admitted no wrongdoing, the usual ‘If I’ve done anything that upset Mr. Fraser, it was not intended and I apologize,’” Berk told GQ. As in many accounts similar to Fraser’s that have come to light as Hollywood reckons with sexual harassment and assault, Fraser said that at the time of the incident he didn’t possess “the courage to speak up for risk of humiliation, or damage to my career.”  “I know Rose [McGowan], I know Ashley [Judd], I know Mira [Sorvino]—I’ve worked with them. I call them friends in my mind. I haven’t spoken to them in years, but they’re my friends,” he said. “I watched this wonderful movement, these people with the courage to say what I didn’t have the courage to say.” While Fraser said there were a host of reasons why his work suffered ― he went through a contentious divorce, underwent multiple surgeries after injuries on film sets, his mother lost a battle to cancer ― he says job opportunities “withered on the vine for me” and he was rarely invited back to the Globes after the incident. As for his career, it’s seemingly gotten back on track in recent years with roles in the third season of “The Affair” and a role on Danny Boyle’s upcoming FX series “Trust,” but the experience with Berk still looms large. “Am I still frightened?” he said “Absolutely. Do I feel like I need to say something? Absolutely. Have I wanted to many, many times? Absolutely. Have I stopped myself? Absolutely.”To read Fraser’s full interview, head over to GQ. "

Fraser told GQ that Berk groped him at a luncheon in 2003. “His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around,” Fraser said. “I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry.”He added: “I became depressed ... I was blaming myself and I was miserable—because I was saying, ‘This is nothing; this guy reached around and he copped a feel.’”Fraser later demanded and received a written apology from the organization, but he wasn’t satisfied with it. Berk maintains the interaction was in jest, calling the actor’s version of events a “total fabrication.” “My apology admitted no wrongdoing, the usual ‘If I’ve done anything that upset Mr. Fraser, it was not intended and I apologize,’” Berk told GQ. As in many accounts similar to Fraser’s that have come to light as Hollywood reckons with sexual harassment and assault, Fraser said that at the time of the incident he didn’t possess “the courage to speak up for risk of humiliation, or damage to my career.”  “I know Rose [McGowan], I know Ashley [Judd], I know Mira [Sorvino]—I’ve worked with them. I call them friends in my mind. I haven’t spoken to them in years, but they’re my friends,” he said. “I watched this wonderful movement, these people with the courage to say what I didn’t have the courage to say.” While Fraser said there were a host of reasons why his work suffered ― he went through a contentious divorce, underwent multiple surgeries after injuries on film sets, his mother lost a battle to cancer ― he says job opportunities “withered on the vine for me” and he was rarely invited back to the Globes after the incident. As for his career, it’s seemingly gotten back on track in recent years with roles in the third season of “The Affair” and a role on Danny Boyle’s upcoming FX series “Trust,” but the experience with Berk still looms large. “Am I still frightened?” he said “Absolutely. Do I feel like I need to say something? Absolutely. Have I wanted to many, many times? Absolutely. Have I stopped myself? Absolutely.”To read Fraser’s full interview, head over to GQ. "

Wong - Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c26399f260000c10584fa26.png?ops=100_100,"Janelle Monáe made a triumphant return to music Thursday, dropping two new songs and their accompanying videos from her hotly anticipated new album, “Dirty Computer.” The first, “Make Me Feel,” has shades of early Prince, and shows Monáe making suggestive eyes and gyrating between a man and a woman in an ’80s-style club. Meanwhile, “Django Jane” is an ode to black women’s empowerment. That video, which can be viewed below, finds the singer-actress seated on a throne, surrounded by an army of fierce, militant-looking background dancers. She drops rhymes like, “We gon’ start a motherfucking pussy riot/Or we gon’ have to put them on a pussy diet.”Of the two tracks, “Make Me Feel” has generated more buzz, possibly because the video feels like a musical celebration of bisexuality and winks at ongoing speculation over the nature of Monáe’s relationship with her co-star, Tessa Thompson.  However, Monáe eschewed labeling her sexuality in a Guardian interview on Thursday, calling “Make Me Feel” a “celebratory song” but defining herself simply as “sexually liberated.”Due out April 27, “Dirty Computer” is Monáe’s first album in five years. In the meantime, the star has been focusing on her film career, turning in acclaimed performances in “Moonlight” and “Hidden Figures.” Still, the six-time Grammy nominee blamed her own perfectionism for making her take so long to complete the follow-up to 2013′s “The Electric Lady.” “You know this is an extremely vulnerable album and it took me a while to make it because I’m a self-editor. I self-edit myself a lot,” she told Zane Lowe of Beats 1 Radio. “I know that there are a lot of things that I haven’t discussed and I think this is the album that you’ll get an opportunity to get a closer glimpse into my mind and into my heart.”"

In her lawsuit, Viktor said she was approached by a Marvel set director and a public relations firm on behalf of Marvel to collaborate on “Black Panther” in November 2016 and again in January 2018. The critically acclaimed artist said she ended up declining to work with the teams both times.But after the “All the Stars” video dropped on Feb. 6, the lawsuit says, friends told Viktor that they had seen what appeared to be her art in the clip ― specifically three original works titled “Constellations I,” “Constellations II” and “Constellations III” ― and the press noted the apparent collaboration.The lawsuit calls the music video an example of “willful, brazen, and extensive unlawful infringement” and asserts that Viktor’s creations are “being used by Defendants to promote the soundtrack to the latest multi-million-dollar budget Marvel film.” “[It] is both an egregious violation of federal law and an affront to the Artist, her livelihood, her legacy, and to artists everywhere,” the suit states.The legal complaint provides examples of Viktor’s art and the problematic art used in the music video ― specifically, a scene that begins at the 2:59 minute mark and lasts for about 19 seconds. Below is one side-by-side example from the lawsuit, with Viktor’s work on the left and an image from the video on the right: You can watch the entire video below: “Why would they do this? It’s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it’s about black empowerment, African excellence — that’s the whole concept of the story,” Viktor told The New York Times earlier this month. “And at the same time they’re stealing from African artists.” Representatives for Lamar, SZA and TDE did not return requests for comment.On Monday, Viktor thanked her fans for their support on her Facebook page and told them that she was “seeking justice.” “We believe that the copyright infringement is irrefutable,” Viktor’s lawyer, Christopher Robinson, said in a statement to HuffPost. “We are confident that Ms. Viktor will prevail.” "

Experts say a decline in overdose deaths in 14 states is due in part to increased use of the overdose antidote naloxone. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8ef4551e000048057ac875.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Christine VestalNew provisional data released this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths declined in 14 states during the 12-month period that ended July 2017, a potentially hopeful sign that policies aimed at curbing the death toll may be working.In an opioid epidemic that began in the late 1990s, drug deaths have been climbing steadily every year, in nearly every state. A break in that trend, even if limited to just 14 states, has prompted cautious optimism among some public health experts.“It could be welcome news,” said Caleb Alexander, an epidemiologist and co-director of Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness.“If we’re truly at a plateau or inflection point, it would be the best news all year,” he said. “But we’re still seeing rates of overdose that are leaps and bounds higher than what we were seeing a decade ago and far beyond any other country in the world.”The reported drop in overdose deaths occurred in Wyoming, Utah, Washington, Alaska, Montana, Mississippi, Kansas, Rhode Island, Oregon, California, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Arizona and Hawaii. That compares with declines in only three states — Nebraska, Washington and Wyoming — reported for an earlier 12-month period that ended in January 2017.But even as more states saw a drop in deaths, several saw death spikes of more than 30 percent, most likely due to the increasing presence of the deadly synthetic drug fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, drug experts say. Those are Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the District of Columbia.Published monthly since August, the new CDC statistics are a compilation of death certificate data from all 50 states for a rolling 12-month period ending seven months prior to release of each report. The seven-month delay is roughly the amount of time it takes for states to complete death investigations and report causes of death, and for the CDC to compile the data.Previously, the CDC only made death data available once a year and it was 12 to 14 months behind. In a fast-moving opioid scourge, epidemiologists say the increased frequency of overdose death reporting is a welcome improvement.Farida Ahmad, a public health expert with the CDC, cautioned that the monthly provisional death numbers are subject to change because as many as 2 percent of death certificates for the time period have not been reported. A final death count for 2017 will not be available until November, she said.Increased VolatilityIn Alaska, where deaths declined more than 11 percent between the 12-month period ending July 2016 and the 12-month period ending July 2017, the state’s public health chief, Jay Butler, said the trend has been cause for some optimism.The greatest portion of that decline was in prescription opioids, drugs such as OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin, Butler said.“And we may be seeing a plateauing, if not a decline, in overdose deaths from heroin,” he added. “The bad news is that we’re seeing more deaths from fentanyl.”Indeed, fentanyl-related deaths spiked more than 70 percent nationwide in the 12-month period ending July 2017, according to the report.“Using illicit drugs has always been a game of roulette,” Butler said. “There’s just more bullets in the chamber now.“When the epidemic was driven primarily by prescription opioids, we saw a smoldering and chronically escalating problem,” he said. “Now we’re seeing outbreaks and clusters of death resulting from bad batches of heroin or counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl.”Still RisingThe recent drop in opioid deaths in some states might be significant, experts say, but they caution it should be seen in the context of the worst drug death epidemic in U.S. history.In 2016, the annual overdose death count reached nearly 64,000, more than three times as many as in 1999. It surpassed the number of fatalities from automobile crashes and homicides, becoming the No. 1 cause of death among Americans 50 and younger.Aside from the 14 states seeing declines, there are few signs of relief ahead.Nationwide, the death toll is still rising, although possibly at a lower rate than in the past two years. According to the CDC’s current provisional report, the total number of overdose deaths increased 14 percent in the 12-month period ending in July 2017, compared to a 21 percent increase in the 12- month period that ended in January 2017.One reason could be a decline in the availability of prescription painkillers. Even as overdose deaths spiraled over the last five years, the rate of prescribed opioid consumption began to decline.That could mean lower rates of heroin use, addiction and overdose deaths in the future, Alexander said. A vast majority — 86 percent — of young, urban injection drug users started misusing prescription opioids before turning to heroin, according to surveys by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.Another likely reason for a tapering in death counts is the widespread use of the overdose antidote naloxone, public health experts say.“It’s hard to imagine how high the death toll would be without naloxone,” said Michael Kilkenny, the Cabell-Huntington public health director in West Virginia.“It’s a little too soon to tell,” he said, “but we may be seeing the beginning of a decline in the number of deaths in Huntington,” a small city that has the highest overdose death rate in West Virginia, the state with the highest overdose death rate in the country.Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

The president recommended arming teachers, while one parent suggested that undercover police officers pose as teachers and school staff. Several parents called for more security officers at schools.There’s scant evidence that more cops and security guards on campus actually stop school shootings. There’s an abundance of evidence suggesting that more school security means more vulnerable students getting funneled at an early age into the criminal justice system.Black children are already more likely to get arrested at school. In 2012, black children represented only 16 percent of school-aged children, but 31 percent of those arrested. And when more cops are in school, these arrests are more likely to take place, even for minor misbehaviors. It’s a phenomenon that advocates call the school-to-prison pipeline. “The more we add security or police forces and so on to schools, the more likely it is the students who are already at risk of being seen as potential trouble makers get swept up into the justice system or suspended and pushed out of schools,” said Aaron Kupchik, a professor at the University of Delaware, who studies this issue. “The risks are even higher for students who are already more vulnerable.” There have been scattered instances in which school security has helped foil an armed intruder. And some studies have found clear benefits of having cops in schools, as these schools are more likely to have emergency crisis plans in place and receive regular safety inspections. But these benefits come at a steep price ― one that could disproportionately impact black and brown students who are already more likely to face overly harsh discipline.One study found that schools with police are more likely to refer students to outside law enforcement for a range of behaviors ― including offenses that are more minor, like vandalism. Another study found that schools with cops had more school arrests for minor misbehaviors like disorderly conduct. And there is also the possibility of police brutality. A HuffPost investigation previously found schools with cops had officers that used Tasers over 80 times on children between 2011 and 2016. The instinct to increase school security after shootings makes sense University of Florida professor Jason Nance previously told HuffPost. Adding measures of security is a “tangible” action that “school authorities can do to demonstrate to a worried constituency that they are trying to make schools safer.”“However, so far we don’t have any hard evidence that more police officers in schools make schools safer,” said Nance. Judith Browne Dianis is the executive director of The Advancement Project, a civil rights group that works to curb the school-to-prison pipeline. She said enhanced security measures at schools can make buildings look more like war zones and prisons than nurturing environments. “We’re worried this continues to be the knee-jerk reaction that politicians have after a school shooting -– to not deal with the gun violence issue but instead to throw more money at law enforcement giving parents the perception of safety, instead of getting at the root cause of the violence,” Dianis said.

29,IMPACT,German Cities To Trial Ambitious Free Public Transport Plans,"Senay Boztas, On assignment for HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/free-transport-germany-tallinn_us_5a8d5f3ae4b00a30a25117a4,In a bid to cut air pollution and make cities more livable.,2018-02-22,Tübingen Mayor Boris Palmer speaking on one of the city's buses. The city is trying out a program where public transit is free for passengers on Saturdays.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d626e210000c300601dd8.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The university city of Tübingen, in southwest Germany, is testing free public transportation for all residents. Two weeks ago, the city began a two-year pilot project using its own funds to provide free rides on Saturdays.For seven years, local authorities have been trying to provide unlimited public transport, free at the point of access, for a flat 15-euro monthly tax for all residents, Mayor Boris Palmer explained. To do so would require a change in law.“We already have a decent system in Tübingen, with 89,000 inhabitants and 20 million rides a year,” explained Palmer, who doesn’t own a car. “One in three people uses public transport regularly; a third sometimes; and we are looking at the third that never uses it.”“If you ask them, they don’t know how the system works and are not prepared to pay 5 euros when they have a car in the garage and can ‘do it free.’ In attracting these people, the price barrier is very important.”The aim in Tübingen, he says, is twofold: to lower emissions and reduce travel costs for people on low incomes. A municipal memo reportedly put the cost of zero-fee public transport for all at 14.5 million euros ($18 million).There is a proposal to test free public transport in four other cities in Germany, which faces EU fines for breaking air pollution laws.So, could this simple — but costly — measure work for other cities, using free buses, trams and trains to help cut private car use, reduce emissions and make cities less congested and more livable? The question takes on more urgency in Europe, where the European Commission found in November 2017 that 400,000 citizens die prematurely every year due to poor air quality.Estonia’s capital city, Tallinn, introduced fareless public transport for residents in 2013, although people from outside the city and tourists must still pay. Allan Alaküla, head of the Tallinn EU office and official spokesman for the project, says that five years later, “no one seriously thinks it can be reversed.” There are 140 million trips a year, the vast majority by Tallinn’s 450,000 residents.Introduced by populist mayor Edgar Savisaar after a referendum, the measure is viable because under the country’s fiscal law, Tallinn gets 1,000 euros of each resident’s income tax each year. And as a result of the transit program, population numbers have increased.“The lost ticket revenue from residents is 12 million euros ($15 million), and the gain from additional revenues from the increase in the residential population, at the most conservative estimate, is well above 20 million euros ($25 million),” Alaküla explained. “So the city budget has gained, service quality has improved constantly and in the surroundings of Tallinn, the demand for public transport has increased.” So much so that on July 1, the whole country will roll out free bus travel thanks to central government subsidies making Estonia, Alaküla says, “the first public transport nation.”But while the city center has benefited from reduced congestion, and people who could not afford public transport before have greater access to jobs, shopping and leisure facilities, says Alaküla, there are downsides.Alaküla said Tallinn’s free transportation has resulted in a 10 percent decrease in traffic in the city centre. “But at the same time, we have observed a slight increase around the city center,” he said.Contrary to what you might think, people also walk less. “Particularly in the city center, where the tram stops frequently, some people are taking the tram out of convenience instead of walking,” he said.Dr. Oded Cats, assistant professor in transport and planning at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, who has studied Tallinn’s project, said it has achieved two goals: to increase the mobility of the unemployed and low-income groups and the city’s total residents.“However, there is no evidence suggesting there has been a shift from car to public transport usage,” he said. “We do see an increase in public transport usage, though, from people who would otherwise walk, which is not necessarily desirable.”He is doubtful that free public transport in Germany would do anything to reduce car use or emissions. “We know car users are very sensitive to the price of the car trip, not public transport prices, so increasing parking fees or congestion charges would be more efficient,” he said.Environmentally speaking, he adds, cities should invest in a mix of transport options and encourage conscious choices: “Walking and cycling are unbeatable, and public transport should take longer distance trips or [transport] groups that cannot walk.”Norman Garrick, visiting professor in transportation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, believes that to tempt people onto public transport, it must be time-efficient, convenient and comfortable — not just free. “It’s also to do with how cities are designed,” he said. “If you widen streets to accept cars, that’s what you are going to get. Longer term, you could convert cities to places where you don’t need to get a car.”The cost is another potential dealbreaker. No details have emerged about how Germany might fund its free city transport. The city of Hasselt in Belgium had to reintroduce fares after 16 years of free rides because it became impossible to support financially. Cost was also given as the reason for Seattle’s decision to shut down its 40-year-old free downtown bus service in 2012. But back in Tübingen, the mayor is optimistic. “The public discussion has been intense and 70% of people support [the German government’s idea],” he said. “The debate has created a pressure not to do nothing, and my intention is to be on board and convince them.” Clarification: After publication, Alaküla contacted HuffPost to say that a quote about “contamination from traffic” as a main issue for changes to public transportation was in error. That part of the quote has been removed and the post updated accordingly.For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.

To do so would require a change in law.“We already have a decent system in Tübingen, with 89,000 inhabitants and 20 million rides a year,” explained Palmer, who doesn’t own a car. “One in three people uses public transport regularly; a third sometimes; and we are looking at the third that never uses it.”“If you ask them, they don’t know how the system works and are not prepared to pay 5 euros when they have a car in the garage and can ‘do it free.’ In attracting these people, the price barrier is very important.”The aim in Tübingen, he says, is twofold: to lower emissions and reduce travel costs for people on low incomes. A municipal memo reportedly put the cost of zero-fee public transport for all at 14.5 million euros ($18 million).There is a proposal to test free public transport in four other cities in Germany, which faces EU fines for breaking air pollution laws.So, could this simple — but costly — measure work for other cities, using free buses, trams and trains to help cut private car use, reduce emissions and make cities less congested and more livable? The question takes on more urgency in Europe, where the European Commission found in November 2017 that 400,000 citizens die prematurely every year due to poor air quality.Estonia’s capital city, Tallinn, introduced fareless public transport for residents in 2013, although people from outside the city and tourists must still pay. Allan Alaküla, head of the Tallinn EU office and official spokesman for the project, says that five years later, “no one seriously thinks it can be reversed.” There are 140 million trips a year, the vast majority by Tallinn’s 450,000 residents.Introduced by populist mayor Edgar Savisaar after a referendum, the measure is viable because under the country’s fiscal law, Tallinn gets 1,000 euros of each resident’s income tax each year. And as a result of the transit program, population numbers have increased.“The lost ticket revenue from residents is 12 million euros ($15 million), and the gain from additional revenues from the increase in the residential population, at the most conservative estimate, is well above 20 million euros ($25 million),” Alaküla explained. “So the city budget has gained, service quality has improved constantly and in the surroundings of Tallinn, the demand for public transport has increased.” So much so that on July 1, the whole country will roll out free bus travel thanks to central government subsidies making Estonia, Alaküla says, “the first public transport nation.”But while the city center has benefited from reduced congestion, and people who could not afford public transport before have greater access to jobs, shopping and leisure facilities, says Alaküla, there are downsides.Alaküla said Tallinn’s free transportation has resulted in a 10 percent decrease in traffic in the city centre. “But at the same time, we have observed a slight increase around the city center,” he said.Contrary to what you might think, people also walk less. “Particularly in the city center, where the tram stops frequently, some people are taking the tram out of convenience instead of walking,” he said.Dr. Oded Cats, assistant professor in transport and planning at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, who has studied Tallinn’s project, said it has achieved two goals: to increase the mobility of the unemployed and low-income groups and the city’s total residents.“However, there is no evidence suggesting there has been a shift from car to public transport usage,” he said. “We do see an increase in public transport usage, though, from people who would otherwise walk, which is not necessarily desirable.”He is doubtful that free public transport in Germany would do anything to reduce car use or emissions. “We know car users are very sensitive to the price of the car trip, not public transport prices, so increasing parking fees or congestion charges would be more efficient,” he said.Environmentally speaking, he adds, cities should invest in a mix of transport options and encourage conscious choices: “Walking and cycling are unbeatable, and public transport should take longer distance trips or [transport] groups that cannot walk.”Norman Garrick, visiting professor in transportation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, believes that to tempt people onto public transport, it must be time-efficient, convenient and comfortable — not just free. “It’s also to do with how cities are designed,” he said. “If you widen streets to accept cars, that’s what you are going to get. Longer term, you could convert cities to places where you don’t need to get a car.”The cost is another potential dealbreaker. No details have emerged about how Germany might fund its free city transport. The city of Hasselt in Belgium had to reintroduce fares after 16 years of free rides because it became impossible to support financially. Cost was also given as the reason for Seattle’s decision to shut down its 40-year-old free downtown bus service in 2012. But back in Tübingen, the mayor is optimistic. “The public discussion has been intense and 70% of people support [the German government’s idea],” he said. “The debate has created a pressure not to do nothing, and my intention is to be on board and convince them.” Clarification: After publication, Alaküla contacted HuffPost to say that a quote about “contamination from traffic” as a main issue for changes to public transportation was in error. That part of the quote has been removed and the post updated accordingly.For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.

Overexposed and castigated after the ruckus surrounding “Erotica” and the carnal coffee-table book Sex, she’d forged a reverie about disconnecting from reality. “Today is the last day that I’m using words / They’ve gone out, lost their meaning.”But by 1998, Madonna had awoken again. On “Sky Fits Heaven,” the seventh track from the enlightened electro-rock masterpiece “Ray of Light,” she repeated a familiar phrase ― except here it ended on an upbeat: “Traveling, traveling / Watching the signs as I go.” This time, pop music’s doyenne of reinvention was anything but unconscious. Her footpath from the “Bedtime Story” era to “Ray of Light,” which turns 20 on Feb. 22, places Madonna at the nexus of celebrity culture circa 1997 (when she spent five months writing and recording the album) and early 1998 (when she released and promoted the album, which went on to win three Grammys and six MTV Video Music Awards). Nearing 40 and competing with a fresh generation of A&R-packaged teenyboppers, Madonna had risked aging out of mainstream stardom, one of the many sectors of society that isn’t kind to mature women. Instead, the ambient fizzes and mystical flurries on “Ray of Light” formed a cutting-edge benediction that rehabilitated Madonna’s image ― a coup few legacy acts could hope for today. She was a new mother, animated by Kabbalah and Ashtanga yoga, but uninterested in maternity leave.Madonna’s late ’90s eminence can be further distilled through one morsel about the creation of “Ray of Light,” her seventh studio disc: On July 15, 1997, the day she recorded the gritty meditation “Swim,” Donatella Versace called Madonna to report that her brother Gianni had been shot outside his Miami mansion. William Orbit, the English producer who helped shape “Ray of Light,” has related this anecdote at least twice. The first time was in 1998, during an interview with Music Week.“The day she [recorded ‘Swim’] she got a call on the way to the studio that her next-door neighbor Versace had been murdered,” he said. “Lyrically it was written before that, but it is topical.”And again in 2002.“We were recording ‘Swim’ on the day Versace was murdered,” Orbit told Q magazine. “Madonna was very friendly with him and his sister, Donatella, who was in the street, distraught, on her cellphone to Madonna. But she did the vocal, which is probably why it has such an emotional impact.”Earlier this month, I emailed Orbit to ask for more details. “There’s quite a story around that,” he confirmed, declining an interview in the same breath. Representatives for Madonna and Donatella Versace did not respond to my inquiries.Madonna was famously chummy with the Calabria-born Versaces, first posing for their fashion line’s ad campaign in 1995 when, as Orbit indicates, she and Gianni both owned townhouses on 64th Street in Manhattan (though they weren’t next door to each other). A month and a half after recording “Swim,” she penned the couturier’s eulogy for Time magazine, recalling, among other lavish details, the days she borrowed his well-staffed Italian villa. “I’ve got a pocketful of memories in my Versace jeans, and they’re not going anywhere,” she wrote.On the surface, as it relates to “Ray of Light,” Versace’s murder at the hands of spree killer Andrew Cunanan ― also chronicled in the ongoing season of Ryan Murphy’s stirring FX series “American Crime Story” ― is an ill-timed coincidence. Madonna didn’t compose “Swim” in response to Versace’s death, but she had to perform it ― an anthem about the world's ""sins"" ― on the day one of her most famous friends informed her that another of her most famous friends had lost his life. Madonna grieved in the studio, just like you or I must still show up to the office after awakening to bad news.These events positioned her, however privately, at the center of an international tragedy ― just as she was throughout the AIDS crisis, when, for example, she crafted the “Erotica” balled “In This Life,” dedicated to her longtime chum and collaborator Martin Burgoyne, who’d died from the disease in 1986. Of all people, Donatella thought to call Madonna, a celebrity among celebrities, with the news of her brother’s scandalous death. And what episode of Madonna’s career better fits that narrative than the one dedicated to her spiritual fortification?“Put your head on my shoulder, baby / Things can’t get any worse / Night is getting colder / Sometimes life feels like it’s a curse,” Madonna croons on “Swim,” which opens with a melancholic serenity and settles into a guttural anger that’s impossible to underestimate even without knowing Madonna’s mood on the day of its recording. “Swim” is one of the few “Ray of Light” tracks that doesn’t offer a glimmer of Zen in its heady rumination, so Madonna instead follows it with the glittering title song, whose lyrics become a salve: “Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder / Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun? / ... / She’s got herself a little piece of heaven / Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one.”Life will go on, despite the country’s anger at her provocations, despite Versace’s demise, despite the fact that the music industry is stacked against luminaries reaching arbitrary sell-by dates after being crowned American royalty when they were dewy teens or 20-somethings. (To that last point: Madonna had a Top 10 hit as recently as 2012. She was 54! Almost none of her peers can claim that feat at such an age.)In fact, the entirety of “Ray of Light” feels like a renewal following some kind of death ― a tangible loss of her youth, a fleeting sense that her yearning to get into the groove had faded. (It would soon return, of course, because Madonna is nothing if not an expert in brand management.) That’s why her existential primping ― “Nothing takes the past away / Like the future / Nothing makes the darkness go / Like the light,” she sings on “Nothing Really Matters” ― further acts as a metamorphosis. Her interior life was laid bare, and the results were an extended tone poem.But here’s something else that strikes me about this album: Even with a track that morphed into a response to a fellow artist’s death, Madonna didn’t find it as personal as the rest of us did. Because its lyrics were more sophisticated than, say, “Holiday” or “Lucky Star,” the fawning reception implied that the dance-floor invitations on which she’d built her career were too fluffy to be taken seriously ― a tired, vapid, persistent appraisal of female-fronted pop.“But my other albums were personal too,” she told Spin magazine in a 1998 cover story. ”‘Bedtime Stories’ was personal, believe me. ‘Erotica’ was personal. Maybe I’m a better writer now. I hope so. I think on my last few records I’ve been operating from a place of anger and frustration and bitterness and feeling like a victim and being very defensive. I don’t feel that way right now.”This quote mirrors something Madonna said when I interviewed her about her most recent album, “Rebel Heart,” in 2015: “A lot of people say, ‘Oh, you’ve written so many personal songs on this record,’ but I think that I wrote a lot of personal songs on my last record, [‘MDNA’], but people didn’t pay attention to it. But anyway, it’s OK. Things happen for a reason.”It’s verification that Madonna must forever prove herself, that because she is a woman who came to New York as a classically trained dancer chasing fame, her songwriting will often be denied the gravity afforded of her male counterparts. But the Versace tidbit tells a deeper story: the story of someone around whom the ebbs and flows of mass culture orbit, and who poured her own evolution as a human being into her contributions to that culture.It’s as if everything Madonna had done, artistically and commercially, had been leading to “Ray of Light.” She was more conscious than ever before."

While walking the red carpet at the 2018 Brit Awards on Wednesday, Sheeran shut down rumors that he’d already tied the knot and spoke about his new bling.“I never saw why men didn’t wear engagement rings,” Sheeran said during an interview with Dan Wooten of The Sun and the ITV show “Lorraine.” “It’s the same commitment either way.”“Cherry made it for me herself out of silver clay,” the singer added. “I really like it.”Sheeran also spoke a little more about the ring and his upcoming nuptials in an interview with Sky News. “It’s an engagement ring, cause I feel like ... it’s good to both do things,” he told a reporter who inquired about the ring’s meaning. When asked about a wedding date, Sheeran played coy. “I don’t know, but I don’t know if I’ll [tell],” he said. “But it will be a situation like this [the engagement ring] where no one knows.” Sheeran announced his engagement to Seaborn in a sweet Instagram post in January. “Got myself a fiancé just before new year,” the singer captioned a photo of himself kissing Seaborn. “We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well xx.”The two, who grew up together, reconnected in 2015 over the Fourth of July holiday. He invited her to a celebration at friend Taylor Swift’s home.“I’ve known Cherry since I was 11,” Sheeran told People magazine in 2017. “She worked on Wall Street in New York, and I had like six shows [in the New York area]. It was around then, and we reconnected. I went on tour again, and then I went to Taylor’s Fourth of July party. I was texting [Cherry], and she was like, ‘I’m in Rhode Island at a 4th of July party,’ and I was like, ‘So am I.’ I kinda said to Taylor, ‘Can I invite one of my old schoolmates?’ The rest is history.” Indeed it is.

For some black activists who have long been mobilizing around gun violence, the current wave of public attention and outrage over the issue is welcome. But it also invites the question of why there’s been comparatively little attention and outrage focused on the even more common reality of routine gun homicides in the country, which disproportionately affect communities of color, and specifically black Americans. Prominent black organizers and public figures have also noted the largely positive public response to the student activists from Parkland ― most of whom are not black and who attended school in a largely white, relatively affluent Florida suburb ― compared to the frequent vilification of young black activists protesting gun violence, particularly police shootings. “It’s complicated, but I would encourage us to lean into the complicated,” Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said on a panel with HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen on Wednesday. “Why don’t black people get to be victims? That’s the question we have to ask ourselves ... It’s a question not just for elected officials but it’s a question for us ... Who gets to be a victim?”“I’m so grateful these children are getting the support they need,” she added. “And where is our support?”In the wake of the Florida shooting, students from Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have led a bold wave of mobilizations ― organizing school walkouts, speaking at rallies and planning the nationwide March for Our Lives protest next month. The teens have been justifiably celebrated on social media, featured in the news (including at HuffPost), and some were even invited to the White House.HuffPost reached out to March for Our Lives, but did not immediately receive a response.Importantly, those bringing up this disparity are not criticizing the Parkland students’ activism ― quite the opposite. The only people seeking to discredit the teens so far seem to be right-wing conspiracy theorists claiming the teens are “crisis actors.” Still, the different public responses are telling: There’s justified, universal outrage at a shooting in a largely white, affluent area, but not so much at the frequent shooting deaths of black Americans; the public is praising Parkland’s student activists, but not so much Black Lives Matter organizers.“I’m excited these young people are getting attention, which they deserve, and they’re driving amazing social change,” Dante Barry, co-founder of anti-racist, anti-violence organization Million Hoodies, told HuffPost on Thursday. “But I’m also disheartened and a little shocked to see folks like Oprah give $500,000 to [March for Our Lives], while she’s seen black folks in the streets for years.”“The way people are responding to predominantly white communities is notable: Whose movement is more valuable to support?” he added. “Other communities that have been devastated by gun violence are still fighting for crumbs.”Young black activists who have been mobilizing around gun violence, including police shootings, for several years are generally perceived negatively by white Americans, are often arrested for protesting, and have been labeled as “extremists” by the FBI.When black activists have taken to the streets to protest police shootings, members of law enforcement have met them in full riot gear, and at times attacked them with tear gas. By contrast, the largely non-black student activists from Parkland have been invited to a CNN town hall event with lawmakers.“What happens is white people get to be everything ― they get to be victims, they get to be heroes,” Cullors said on the Wednesday panel. “Black people unfortunately continue to be criminalized for our moments of courage, mourning or grieving. When we go out to the streets to protest for our lives that matter, we’re given heavy police repression. This is a race question.”Mass shootings like the one in Florida often spur an important national conversation on gun control, particularly when shooters target schools, like at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, or when there are high death counts, like in Las Vegas last year. Yet while mass shootings have been on the rise in recent years, they represent just a portion of overall gun deaths in the U.S. annually.In total, there were around 12,500 to 15,500 gun deaths per year in the U.S. from 2014 to 2017, not including suicides, according to the Gun Violence Archive. According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of just over 100 people died each year in mass shootings from 2009 to 2016 ― with mass shootings defined as incidents in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter.The steady drumbeat of gun homicides that take place across the country every day disproportionately affect communities of color ― especially black people, who make up around 14 percent of the U.S. population but account for more than half the country’s gun homicide victims. There were also close to 2,000 police shootings annually in the past few years ― and black people are far more likely than their white peers to be killed in encounters with police.“I’m very impressed and inspired by what I’m seeing these students do. Fighting for gun control ― I take my hat off to them,” Cobe Williams, deputy director at Chicago-based gun violence prevention organization Cure Violence told HuffPost on Wednesday. “I like what they’re doing, and we’re doing this on an everyday basis,” he said. “I applaud them, but we see this violence on an everyday basis. It could be one person or 24 people ― one person shot and killed is too many.” "

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hiv-prevention-drug-insurance-claim_us_5a8d9e5ae4b0273053a6e92f,"The New York Times spoke to gay men who said they were denied insurance coverage for taking PrEP, an HIV prevention drug.",2018-02-21,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, taking PrEP every day can reduce the risk of sexually contracting HIV by more than 90 percent.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d9f372000007d06eaf896.jpeg?cache=aRu0tnCcY7&ops=crop_0_915_2400_1841%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"New York state financial regulators say they plan to investigate claims that gay men have been denied life, disability and long-term care insurance policies after revealing they were taking HIV prevention medication. Maria T. Vullo, the state’s superintendent of financial services, told The New York Times last week that companies making such denials could be penalized for illegally discriminating against those clients. The announcement followed a Feb. 12 New York Times article in which journalist Donald G. McNeil spoke with Dr. Philip J. Cheng, who had begun taking Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP ― an HIV prevention drug ― after injuring himself while prepping an HIV-positive patient for surgery. Cheng, who is gay, later attempted to apply for a disability insurance policy, and said he was told that he could only have a five-year policy because he was on PrEP. McNeil also interviewed LGBTQ rights advocates, insurance brokers and staff at medical clinics, who said they’d heard of various insurers who had denied policies to gay men after learning they took PrEP. Some men, they said, even stopped taking the medication to get insured. “This is tantamount to penalizing applicants based on sexual orientation,” Vullo said on Feb. 14. She encouraged any New York residents who believe they had been denied coverage on those grounds to contact her agency, adding, “Insurers cannot choose to deny coverage based on discriminatory reasons.”Though Vullo wasn’t sure if other states would follow suit, she believed that California regulators “will be aligned with me on this issue,” according to the Times. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using PrEP every day can reduce the risk of contracting HIV from sex by more than 90 percent. Still, the drug has remained a lightning rod for controversy, possibly because people associate its use with gay and bisexual men, who remain disproportionately susceptible to HIV infection. Last month, Florida-based supermarket chain Publix faced public backlash for reportedly refusing to cover PrEP for an employee through its insurance plan. By Feb. 6, Publix ― which operates 1,169 stores in seven Southern states ― changed its tune after a meeting with Florida Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D).Smith, who is openly gay, said Publix officials confirmed to him that they were “absolutely denying” insurance coverage for PrEP, in part because medication used “to treat a medical condition that someone might get in the future” was not covered in their existing plan.A day after the meeting with Smith, a Publix representative tweeted that the company had “made the decision to expand our health plan’s coverage” to include PrEP, and was “working with our pharmacy benefits manager to implement this change as quickly as possible.” "

A survey the newspaper conducted in partnership with Women in Film and Television, The Creative Coalition, and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center found that 94 percent of women in Hollywood have been sexually harassed or assaulted while working. Most of the women said the offensive behavior was perpetrated by an older person in a position of power. USA Today surveyed 843 women who work in the industry, including producers, directors, writers, actors, about their experiences with sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo movement. A questionnaire was sent via email to members of Women in Film and Television and the Creative Coalition between Dec. 4. and Jan. 14. Of those women, 87 percent said they had experienced “unwelcome sexual comments, jokes or gestures” at least once, and 75 percent said they had witnessed other women experience “unwanted sexual comments.” Sixty-four percent said they had been propositioned for a sexual act or relationship, and 21 percent reported they had been forced to perform a sexual act. One in four women said they reported inappropriate conduct to their superiors, but only 28 percent of those said their workplace improved after reporting. One-third of the women surveyed said they weren’t sure whether something that happened to them was sexual harassment. Because the survey respondents were self-selected, the results may not be “scientifically representative” of the entire entertainment industry, the report noted. Still, the findings are “credible and important,” Anita Raj, director of the Center for Gender Equity and Health at the University of California, San Diego, medical school, told USA Today.“The percentages are higher than what we typically see for workplace abuses, but we know there is variation by the type of workplace,” Raj said. “But it makes sense to me that we would see higher numbers” in the entertainment industry.The industry’s reckoning with misconduct has already taken down some big names, like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Matt Lauer. In January, a group of women in Hollywood created the Time’s Up initiative to combat their industry’s systemic problem with sexual harassment and assault.

As accusations pile up, lawmakers are searching for ways to keep their most vulnerable workers safe.",2018-02-21,"<p>Georgia legislative interns receive a tour of the state Capitol in 2015. The #MeToo movement has drawn new attention to the workplace rights of unpaid interns, who often don’t have the same civil protections as employees. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d8da61e00000a087ac60b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jen FifieldNear the end of the Colorado legislative session last year, one of Democratic state Rep. Dafna Michaelson Jenet’s interns revealed something she had been holding inside for months: A male lawmaker had been harassing her.According to the then-18-year-old intern, who did not want to be named out of fear it would harm her job prospects, the male lawmaker’s unwanted comments and glances bothered her so much she stopped going to the Capitol. The experience led her to turn down another position in the Statehouse, and to drop her political science major.The #MeToo movement has revealed a long-standing culture of harassment in state legislatures. Since October, about two dozen male state lawmakers have resigned, said they will resign, or been forced from their leadership roles after being accused of harassment or assault.As legislative leaders grapple with how to create a safer environment for everyone, legislative interns remain among the most vulnerable and the least protected under workplace harassment laws.In most states, unpaid interns — in legislatures or other workplaces — aren’t considered to be employees and therefore aren’t protected against workplace sexual harassment under the federal Civil Rights Act.Some legislatures have sexual harassment policies that allow nonemployees to file claims to the legislature of sexual harassment against legislative staff and lawmakers, according to a Stateline review of policies from nearly all states. But only a handful of states specifically mention interns, and even when they do, that doesn’t necessarily give them legal standing for filing a civil lawsuit.“The legislative policy could be used to discipline a legislator maybe, but probably doesn’t do anything for the victim,” said Minna Kotkin, director of the Employment Law Clinic at Brooklyn Law School. In an effort to protect interns in all workplaces, at least seven states enacted laws between 2013 and 2015 that made all unpaid interns “employees” under the law.This earlier movement began after a New York City judge in 2013 threw out a case in which an unpaid TV intern said a supervisor had assaulted her. The judge said because the intern wasn’t an employee, she wasn’t covered under the state’s civil rights protections.State lawmakers at the time said the case revealed a loophole in the law concerning protections for unpaid interns. But the movement to pass this type of legislation has died down in the past couple of years, leaving unpaid interns in most states unable to collect legal damages for workplace harassment.The lack of protections for young, unpaid female interns worries some advocates for women in politics, such as Erin Hottenstein, founder of Colorado 50-50, a group that tries to get women elected in Colorado. Women are more likely than men to take unpaid internships, according to a recent study by Intern Bridge, a national consulting group, and women also are more likely to be victims of harassment.These women may be less likely to stay in politics if they experience harassment, Hottenstein said. And while most male lawmakers are well-behaved, she said, the culture needs to change.“I find it very disconcerting to be encouraging women to run for office knowing that they are going to go into a cesspool where they may not be safe,” she said.No Clear ProtectionsWhile there has been pushback about using unpaid interns, the practice is still common in governments and legislatures.Whether interns qualify as employees, and therefore have legal protection against workplace harassment, depends on many factors. An intern is more likely to be considered an employee if she is guaranteed pay during the internship, or a job after her internship is over, or performs work normally done by an employee, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor.An intern who receives academic credit in exchange for her work is less likely to be classified as an employee with the normal workplace protections.In Kansas, for example, college students who participate in a legislative internship program run through the University of Kansas receive academic credit as well as a $600 stipend for their twice-weekly work in the Capitol.No interns have come forward with complaints of harassment in 30 years, according to Burdett Loomis, political science professor and internship coordinator at the university. Tom Day, director of legislative administrative services in Kansas, said the same.Recent news reports, though, revealed that interns there have faced pervasive harassment in the Capitol. And Loomis said he would be naïve to think that interns haven’t been harassed. “It’s a pretty sexist place, and it has been historically and it still is now.”Loomis said he has always talked to his students about harassment, but this year he is trying to be more vigilant.“I think I’ll check back with my students in the first week in March,” he said. “I’ll say, ‘Without naming names, tell me how you sense this is all going. If you have specific issues, come and see me.’ ”He said his program has high enrollment this year, despite allegations in statehouses, because students see the value in the program.“They are doing real work,” Loomis said. “They are tallying surveys for legislatures. They are researching policy.”Across the state line in Missouri, the Legislature made changes to try to prevent harassment two years ago. But Democratic state Rep. Courtney Allen Curtis is not happy with the progress. There have been six harassment complaints since then, he said.In December, he proposed suspending the Legislature’s internship program, which he thought might “reset the culture.”Interns’ yearning for status, he said, along with the power dynamics in the Legislature, creates an environment ripe for exploitation. While halting the program would decrease opportunities for aspiring politicos in the state, Curtis said it would be better than the alternative.“If we could prevent other future leaders from being harassed — I felt it was our duty to do that,” he said.Protecting InternsSome states, such as New York and Washington, limit interactions between state lawmakers and interns, according to a recent review of legislative intern policies by the National Conference of State Legislatures. New York’s policy does not allow “fraternization.”Other legislatures are reviewing their internship or page programs in response to ongoing allegations. In Rhode Island, the Senate chief legal counsel is conducting an immediate review of the page program after Republican state Sen. Nicholas Kettle was charged Monday with extorting sex from a teenage legislative page in 2011, according to the Providence Journal.In Colorado, Robert Duffy, a political science professor at Colorado State University and the college’s legislative internship coordinator, said his students are shuttled to and from the state Capitol, which helps to keep them from attending after-hours events. He also is present in the Capitol when the students are there, which he said may make it less likely that lawmakers will misbehave.But several lawmakers have been accused of harassment there in recent months. A letter addressed to the legislative council’s executive committee and signed by more than 40 interns and aides said that “aides and interns are often subject to abuses of power, sexual harassment being one.”The aides and interns requested more security in the Capitol, especially around the offices of the accused lawmakers, and the installation of panic buttons in the Capitol and other legislative buildings.“Please understand: we cannot work from home, we cannot avoid sitting in on a member’s committee or walking past a member’s office on our floor if that is what we have been asked to do,” they wrote.Interns there were required to attend an anti-harassment training for the first time this year. The Legislature also hired a human resources director, hoping that a nonpolitical appointee would help women feel more comfortable and prevent retaliation.Duffy said that while he has always talked to his interns about what appropriate behavior should look like, he has expanded on that discussion this year.“I’ve told them we have a zero tolerance policy,” he said. “So if there is something going on with one of your colleagues or something that makes you uncomfortable, then bring it to me and we will take care of it.”"

They face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to defraud the United States and failure to file as foreign agents for lobbying work they did on behalf of the pro-Russian Ukrainian Party of Regions. Both have pleaded not guilty.It was unclear when any new charges would be announced publicly.Last Friday, Mueller’s office revealed in a court filing that it had uncovered “additional criminal conduct” by Manafort in connection with a series of “bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies” related to a mortgage on his property in Fairfax, Virginia, a Washington suburb.The Special Counsel’s office declined to comment on the new court filing. Attorneys for Manafort and Gates could not be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.Mueller is probing Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia and whether the Republican president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the investigation. Russia denies the allegations. Trump denies any collusion.Manafort has been under house arrest since he was charged. He and prosecutors have struggled to agree on bail terms to permit him to leave his home, though some of those details have remained under seal.However, on Friday, Mueller’s office revealed that it is concerned about alleged bank fraud in connection with one of the properties that Manafort pledged as collateral.In Friday’s filing, prosecutors claimed that Manafort secured his mortgage from the Chicago-based Federal Savings Bank by doctoring profit and loss statements from his lobbying firm and “overstating its income by millions of dollars.”Prosecutors said they plan to offer the court more evidence about the alleged misconduct at the next bail hearing.The Federal Savings Bank is led by Stephen Calk, who served on a Trump campaign economic advisory panel. Calk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mueller on Tuesday stepped up pressure on Manafort and Gates to cooperate in his investigation, unsealing a criminal charge against a Dutch lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, for lying to Mueller’s investigators.The charge arises from work that van der Zwaan, the son-in-law of one of Russia’s richest men, did on a 2012 report about the trial of Ukraine’s former prime minister while he was employed as a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.The report was used to justify the pre-trial detention of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by her rival, and Manafort’s client, pro-Russian former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.Manafort and Gates lobbied in connection with the rollout of the report, and are accused by Mueller’s office of facilitating secret payments for the report through off-shore bank accounts.Mueller’s office last Friday also indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their alleged involvement in a criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to support Trump and disparage Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.(Reporting by Sarah N.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8dd320210000ef06601ece.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) ― New sealed criminal charges have been filed in federal court in the criminal case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and campaign aide Rick Gates, a court record indicated on Wednesday.The single-page document, filed at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, did not reveal the nature of the new charges.Its inclusion in a binder in the court clerk’s office that is routinely updated with new criminal charges signals that Mueller’s office may have filed a superseding indictment replacing a previous one from last year against the two men.Manafort, who was Trump’s campaign manager for almost five months in 2016, and Gates, who was deputy campaign manager, were indicted by Mueller’s office in October. They face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to defraud the United States and failure to file as foreign agents for lobbying work they did on behalf of the pro-Russian Ukrainian Party of Regions. Both have pleaded not guilty.It was unclear when any new charges would be announced publicly.Last Friday, Mueller’s office revealed in a court filing that it had uncovered “additional criminal conduct” by Manafort in connection with a series of “bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies” related to a mortgage on his property in Fairfax, Virginia, a Washington suburb.The Special Counsel’s office declined to comment on the new court filing. Attorneys for Manafort and Gates could not be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.Mueller is probing Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia and whether the Republican president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the investigation. Russia denies the allegations. Trump denies any collusion.Manafort has been under house arrest since he was charged. He and prosecutors have struggled to agree on bail terms to permit him to leave his home, though some of those details have remained under seal.However, on Friday, Mueller’s office revealed that it is concerned about alleged bank fraud in connection with one of the properties that Manafort pledged as collateral.In Friday’s filing, prosecutors claimed that Manafort secured his mortgage from the Chicago-based Federal Savings Bank by doctoring profit and loss statements from his lobbying firm and “overstating its income by millions of dollars.”Prosecutors said they plan to offer the court more evidence about the alleged misconduct at the next bail hearing.The Federal Savings Bank is led by Stephen Calk, who served on a Trump campaign economic advisory panel. Calk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mueller on Tuesday stepped up pressure on Manafort and Gates to cooperate in his investigation, unsealing a criminal charge against a Dutch lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, for lying to Mueller’s investigators.The charge arises from work that van der Zwaan, the son-in-law of one of Russia’s richest men, did on a 2012 report about the trial of Ukraine’s former prime minister while he was employed as a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.The report was used to justify the pre-trial detention of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by her rival, and Manafort’s client, pro-Russian former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.Manafort and Gates lobbied in connection with the rollout of the report, and are accused by Mueller’s office of facilitating secret payments for the report through off-shore bank accounts.Mueller’s office last Friday also indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their alleged involvement in a criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to support Trump and disparage Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.(Reporting by Sarah N.

It was arranged two weeks before Pence’s five-day trip across Asia after the CIA was informed the North Korean’s hoped to meet with the vice president, according to the Post.However, North Korea decided to cancel the clandestine meeting just hours before it was set to take place at the South Korean president’s residence in Seoul. The country reportedly withdrew after Pence used his visit to repeatedly condemn North Korea, including through his meetings with defectors from the country, a visit to a memorial honoring South Koreans killed in 2010 and his hosting of Fred Warmbier at the Opening Ceremony, the father of the American student imprisoned for 17 months by the regime, who died last year soon after his return to the U.S.Pence’s office defended his actions in a statement Tuesday and questioned the motives of the North Koreans, accusing the country of trying to “whitewash their murderous regime.”“North Korea dangled a meeting in hopes of the Vice President softening his message, which would have ceded the world stage for their propaganda during the Olympics,” Nick Ayers, the vice president’s chief of staff, said in a statement obtained by HuffPost. “As we’ve said from day one about the trip: this administration will stand in the way of Kim’s desire to whitewash their murderous regime with nice photo ops at the Olympics. Perhaps that’s why they walked away from a meeting or perhaps they were never sincere about sitting down.”Ayers noted that Trump agreed to the meeting but only to reiterate that the U.S. would be uncompromising in its calls for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programs, saying the president “made clear that until they agreed to complete denuclearization we weren’t going to change any of our positions or negotiate.”Tuesday’s report follows a days-long campaign of icy disinterest between Pence and the North Koreans. During the Opening Ceremony, the vice president and his wife were seated just in front of Kim Yo Jong and Kim Yong Nam, but they never spoke or even appear to acknowledge each other.On his way home from South Korea earlier this month, Pence told the Post the U.S. would be willing to speak with North Korea, but he continued to say that the White House would maintain a “maximum pressure campaign” on the country.North Korea was able to score some diplomatic points, however. Kim Jong Un extended an invitation to South Korean President Moon Jae-in to visit Pyongyang for a summit.While Moon hasn’t confirmed if he’ll accept, a spokesman told reporters that the two countries should “work together to create the environment to make it happen,” The New York Times reported."

I am happy with setting a new personal record,” said Medvedeva.“I’m good friends with Alina, I practice together with her and talk with her all the time.”Japanese skaters Satoko Miyahara and Kaori Sakamoto were in fourth and fifth.America’s Mirai Nagasu had come into the event with high expectations but fell on her triple Axel after becoming the first American to nail it in the Olympics during the team competition and bobbled her triple loop to end up in ninth.“Today wasn’t my day, but my triple triple was still pretty good so I’m happy about that,” Nagasu said.The free program is on Friday.

Read about them here.PREVIOUSLY: Student survivors and others trying to drive reform in the wake of last week’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, have passionately denounced the National Rifle Association. Amid rising outrage over gun violence, public opinion may be finally turning against the nation’s leading opponent of gun control.Companies don’t have to agree politically with their clients, but those that partner with the gun rights group may want to ask themselves: Are the profits worth the headache of being linked to an increasingly controversial brand?Many big-name businesses work with the NRA to sell their products and services to its 5 million members. The group’s annual $40 membership fee unlocks “five-star savings” on a surprising range of things ― from banking to shipping packages to prescription drugs.Members may apply for a special NRA-branded Visa credit card through the First National Bank of Omaha’s First Bankcard division. The card “offers 5 percent back on gas and sporting goods stores purchases, meaning every time you pack up and head out on a hunt or to the range, or stock up on gear at Cabela’s, Midway USA or other sporting goods retailers, you’re putting money back in your pocket,” says an NRA blog post announcing new perks.Another option is the NRA-branded prepaid Visa debit card, made available through NetSpend.In a statement sent to HuffPost, Visa suggested the responsibility lies with the First National Bank of Omaha, which provides the cards. FedEx is another household name that offers significant discounts to NRA members ― from 18 percent off international express shipping to 26 percent off domestic express shipping. A representative did not respond to multiple requests for comment. HuffPost reached out to more than a dozen other organizations that give discounts to NRA members: Hertz, Avis, Budget, Alamo, Enterprise and National for rental car discounts; Allied and North American van lines for moving discounts; HotelPlanner for travel discounts; TrueCar for auto discounts; ParamountRx for prescription drug discounts; LifeLock for identity theft protection; Reliastar Life Insurance Company for life insurance and MetLife for auto and home insurance. We did not immediately receive any responses.But some brands and public figures have ended their association with the NRA in the last year.A Wyndham Resorts representative told HuffPost that the company cut ties in 2017, having previously offered NRA members 10 percent off reservations at more than 6,500 hotels. Celebrities previously listed as supporters of NRA Country ― including the duo Florida Georgia Line and singer Thomas Rhett ― have disappeared from the website for the group’s lifestyle arm over the past year.Meanwhile, students protested in front of the White House to demand gun reform on Presidents Day Monday. Students across South Florida staged walkouts on Tuesday and Wednesday. And busloads of Stoneman Douglas High students who survived the shooting traveled to Tallahassee, the state capital, to speak with policymakers this week.A larger anti-gun protest, dubbed March for Our Lives, is set for March 24 in Washington, D.C.Clarification: Due to an editing error, a subheadline in a previous version of this story indicated Visa offers discounts to NRA members. Those discounts come from a bank that uses the cards."

The Pulse survivors traveled to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland where 17 people were killed last week by a 19-year-old gunman using an assault-style rifle. The small group of Pulse survivors were there to give support and comfort to the teen survivors.“Y’all got this, y’all strong. Make sure your voices are heard,” India Goodman, a survivor of the Pulse massacre in which a gunman killed 49 people.The Pulse survivors met the group of around 100 students in Parkland before the teens left for Tallahassee on Tuesday to confront lawmakers about gun violence. The Pulse individuals met up with the Parkland shooting survivors again on Wednesday at a rally on the steps of the state capitol.“We’ll be with you guys, alright?” another Pulse survivor told the teen survivors on Tuesday. “Your voices are heard!” Pulse survivor Sylvia Serrano echoed that sentiment to AJ+.“I am a Pulse survivor and we come here to show love and support to the children of this tragedy,” Serrano said. “We’re gonna speak loud ... We’re not gonna knock on doors, we’re gonna knock down some doors. And we’re gonna make sure that we are heard.” The Parkland attack was the 17th school shooting incident in 2018. On Wednesday afternoon, thousands of protesters gathered outside the state capitol to hear Parkland survivors peak. The rally, which lasted around an hour, featured students calling for stricter gun laws and other local activists urging lawmakers to act on gun violence. Several students spoke at the rally including Florence Yared, a junior at Stoneman Douglas. “No longer can I walk the halls I walked millions of times before without fear and sadness. No longer can I walk the halls without imagining blood stains and dead bodies ― all because of the damage that a single AR-15 rifle caused,” Yared told the crowd.“The only purpose of an assault weapon like this is to kill ― and to kill as many people as possible,” she continued. “I’m not trying to take away your Second Amendment rights, nor am I trying to eliminate all guns. But we cannot protect our guns before we protect our children.”On Tuesday, the Republican-led Florida House of Representatives refused to discuss a ban on assault weapons. Several Parkland students were in the gallery, visibly distraught at the lawmakers’ decision.Anthony Lopez, a Parkland shooting survivor and junior at Stoneman Douglas, was utterly enraged when he heard the news.“That’s infuriating. They’re acting inhuman,” Lopez told The New York Times on Tuesday. “The one fear we have is that nothing will change.”"

Kushner holds one of these interim clearances because of mistakes he made on his forms and the complexity of his financial holdings, the Times reported last week.Kelly released a memo last Friday saying he would revamp the granting of such clearances after one of the president’s top aides, Rob Porter, was forced to resign after allegations of domestic violence from his two ex-wives were revealed. The women told the FBI interviewers that Porter had physically and emotionally abused them, but he was able to continue working in the White House with a temporary security clearance.“We should ― and, in the future, must ― do better,” Kelly wrote about the overhaul, which was first reported by The Washington Post.Kushner’s close relationship to the president has given him access to highly classified information despite his own interim clearance, and he is able to read Trump’s daily presidential brief. But as the Times noted, his official duties, which include managing Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and revising the North American Free Trade Agreement, likely don’t require a top-level clearance.Kushner has reportedly become frustrated with Kelly’s new effort, saying he felt personally targeted by the memo, the Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The White House, addressing questions about Kushner’s future clearance, said Tuesday his work would be unaffected by the overhaul.“I can tell you that no decision within the memo will impact anything that Jared Kushner is working on,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. “In terms of specifics on security clearance, I can’t get into that.”Kelly himself released a statement later Tuesday saying Kushner would still be able to continue his duties, although he didn’t specify what level of clearance he would retain.“As I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico,” Kelly said in a statement. “Everyone in the White House is grateful for these valuable contributions to furthering the president’s agenda. There is no truth to any suggestion otherwise.”Kelly’s new plan will revoke any top security clearance to aides whose background checks have been stalled since June 1 or before. High-level clearances will also be reviewed every month.The changes will be implemented Friday."

The administration billed the event as a listening session in the wake of the Florida mass shooting, but it quickly turned into a powerful and heartbreaking moment in the decades-long debate over gun control as survivors and family members stood up and called on lawmakers to come up with solutions to gun violence.“We’re here because my daughter has no voice. She was murdered last week and she was taken from us. Shot nine times on the third floor. We as a country failed our children. This shouldn’t happen,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.“I’m very angry that this happened, because it keeps happening,” Pollack added, while speaking directly to the camera. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here with this administration and me. I’m not going to sleep until it gets fixed.”Vice President Mike Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky joined Trump at the event, as well as dozens of parents and survivors of the Florida shooting and the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting.Trump listened while survivors spoke during the event, but he later used the school shooting in Florida to make a case for looser laws on concealed carry permits. He proposed that arming 20 percent of teaching staff at schools may be effective at quickly ending attacks.“If he had a firearm ... he would have shot and that would have ended,” Trump said about Stoneman Douglas coach Aaron Feis, who was slain.Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters Wednesday that last week’s shooter bypassed the school’s armed officer. In addition to suggesting ending gun-free school zones, Trump proposed opening more hospitals for the mentally ill and toughening background checks. “We’re going to go very strong into age — age of purchase, and we’re also going to go very strong into the mental health aspect of what’s going on,” he said. Some of the participants at the session made the case for stricter gun control laws.“How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon?” Stoneman Douglas student Sam Zeif asked of the ability to purchase an AR-15, the assault-style weapon used by the Parkland gunman. “How did we not stop this after Columbine? After Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening,” he said, tearfully gesturing to Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. “After Sandy Hook, they said we wouldn’t let this happen again, yet it has continued to happen for five years. How many more deaths can we take as a country?” Hockley said.Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, which represents 3 million educators, rejected the idea of arming more people on campuses. “Bringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms. ... We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that.”“We owe it to the students and school personnel, who’ve lost their lives at schools and on campuses across the country, to work together so that we can thoughtfully and carefully develop common sense solutions that really will save lives.”The National Education Association represents 3 million educators.This is one of many recent media appearances by groups of Parkland students affected by last week’s shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 students and faculty members. It marked the 17th school shooting incident so far in 2018.Many have made strong calls for Congress to act on gun control legislation, and students and adults plan to participate in the March for Our Lives next month, a protest they’re organizing in Washington, D.C., and several sister cities. Several of the students seated around Trump thanked him for his leadership on mass shooting issues but made few remarks about gun access, marking a sharp tone shift from the Parkland students behind next month’s march. One of the students, Cameron Kasky, tweeted after the listening session that he, student organizer Emma Gonzalez and the other Parkland students calling for gun control were “not invited” to the White House on Wednesday.

By 8:30 a.m., the students were entering the building to begin meetings with state lawmakers from both parties.“A tragedy like this can never happen again, and ... we will never let it happen again,” Suzanna Barna, a senior at the high school, told CNN on Wednesday. “Today, we’re really just hoping that they will be receptive to what we’re saying and listen to what we went through,” she continued. “We obviously want them to listen to our ideas on policy, but for now, if we could just get them to actually care about the matters we’re talking about, that’s probably the first step.”At least one GOP lawmaker postponed a scheduled sit-down with the group until later Wednesday. State Sen. Kathleen Passidomo (R) had to reschedule because of an appropriations meeting, her aide Jared Willis told HuffPost.State Rep. José Oliva (R) met with a group of students for an off-the-record discussion on gun legislation, reported CNN. Other students hoping to meet with state Senate President Joe Negron (R) were turned away at his office because they didn’t have an appointment.People affected by previous mass shootings, including survivors of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, planned to join a rally set to begin around noon on the steps of the Capitol.By noon, thousands of people had gathered outside the Capitol to hear Parkland survivors and local activists speak. Many at the roughly hourlong rally held signs in support of tighter gun control, and chanted, “Never again” and “Throw them out,” referring to legislators who receive financial contributions from the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups.Florence Yared, a junior at Stoneman Douglas High, was one of the first shooting survivors to address the sprawling crowd.“No longer can I walk the halls I walked millions of times before without fear and sadness,” Yared said. “No longer can I walk the halls without imagining blood stains and dead bodies ― all because of the damage that a single AR-15 rifle caused.“The only purpose of an assault weapon like this is to kill ― and to kill as many people as possible,” Florence continued. “I’m not trying to take away your Second Amendment rights, nor am I trying to eliminate all guns. But we cannot protect our guns before we protect our children.”“Many students throughout the country can’t wait to go vote, can’t wait to run for office, to make a change, to make a safer world,” Florence said. “You adults have failed us by not creating a safe place for your children to go to school. So we ― the next generation ― will not fail our own kids.”Inside the Capitol, other survivors from last week’s Parkland shooting held a press conference after meeting with lawmakers. Lorenzo Prado, a junior at the high school, described the harrowing experience of being mistaken for the gunman on the day of the shooting.“I am here to demand change from our government because the lives lost, who shall not be lost in vain, shall then be used as a catalyst for change in our country today,” Prado said.“We’ll make change in our country, and if not today, tomorrow. And if not tomorrow, the day after that and the day after that until we achieve the change that we want in this country — until the day that safety is preserved in all schools in our beloved country of America,” he continued. “We students will keep fighting for our right to live.”Meanwhile, hundreds of students at schools in Florida’s Broward and Miami-Dade counties organized walkouts Wednesday in solidarity with the Parkland survivors.Gov. Rick Scott (R) planned to meet with “small groups” of the Florida shooting survivors “for 20 minutes each” around 5 p.m. on Wednesday, according to MSNBC.Students calling for stricter gun laws faced a setback Tuesday, when the Republican-led Florida House voted against debating a bill that would ban assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. Later in the day, many of the same lawmakers discussed at length a bill that declares porn a public health risk.President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet at the White House on Wednesday afternoon with high school students and teachers for a “listening session” on gun violence and policy.Willa Frej contributed reporting."

The Oscar-winning actress wore an eye-catching black dress with a plunging neckline and hip-high slit, while the men wore coats. People on social media pointed to the photos as an example of entertainment industry inequality, and one of the images quickly went viral. Lawrence, however, said the criticisms were “not feminism,” and were “creating silly distractions from real issues.” She said she wore the dress outside for only five minutes, but would have “stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”“This is sexist, this is ridiculous, this is not feminism,” Lawrence continued. “Over- reacting about everything someone says or does, creating controversy over silly innocuous things such as what I choose to wear or not wear, is not moving us forward. It’s creating silly distractions from real issues.”Helen Lewis, deputy editor of New Statesman, a British political and cultural magazine, said she found the photo of Lawrence baring her skin while surrounded by men in coats bothersome.“This is such a quietly depressing (and revealing) image,” Lewis wrote in a tweet. “Not least because I’ve been outside today and it’s bloody FREEZING.” AccuWeather logged London’s high on Tuesday at 48 degrees.“True equality means either Jennifer Lawrence getting a coat, or Jeremy Irons having to pose for a photocall in assless chaps,” Lewis said in another tweet.Another person on Twitter suggested that Lawrence could have simply refused to wear the dress. Lewis, however, pointed to comments the actress made in November about harassment and power dynamics in Hollywood.“I finally made the decision to stand up for myself … and then I was punished, and I got afraid that I wasn’t going to be hired again,” Lawrence said at the time, during a roundtable discussion for The Hollywood Reporter. “I was called difficult and a nightmare. I think a lot of people aren’t coming forward because they’re afraid they’re not going to work again.”A lot of people on Twitter agreed with Lewis.As a result, the photo went viral. Last week, Lawrence told “Entertainment Tonight” she is taking a yearlong break from acting to work with Represent.Us, an organization that she said aims “to get young people engaged politically on a local level.”"

He was 99.A family spokesman said he died from natural causes, ABC News reported. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association confirmed his death on Twitter. Born in 1918 in Charlotte, North Carolina, William Franklin Graham Jr. was the oldest of the four children of William and Morrow Graham. He was raised on a dairy farm, and little in his childhood suggested he would become a world-renowned preacher.Then at 16, Graham attended a series of revival meetings run by outspoken evangelist Mordecai Ham. The two months he spent listening to Ham’s sermons on sin sparked a spiritual awakening in Graham and prompted him to enroll at Bob Jones College. When the conservative Christian school’s strict doctrine didn’t align with his personal beliefs, he transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College of Florida) and joined a Southern Baptist Convention church. He was ordained in 1939.Graham received additional training at Illinois’ Wheaton College, where he met his future wife, Ruth McCue Bell. They were married for 64 years, until her death in 2007, and had five children.After serving briefly as the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, Graham launched his first radio program, “Songs in the Night,” in 1943. Although he left a year later, Graham liked the idea of sharing his message with a wide audience. As noted on his website, Graham took Jesus Christ literally when he said in Mark 16:15: “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.”Graham was still in his early 30s when entered the public spotlight by giving a series of well-attended “sin-smashing” revival meetings that were held under a circus tent in a Los Angeles parking lot. The press took interest in the charismatic young preacher and began writing articles about him. To get his message to even more people, Graham founded his own ministry, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.Graham viewed the Bible as the infallible word of God. He believed that Jesus led a sinless life and that all men were lost and would face God’s judgment.Such a strict interpretation of scripture also led him to condemn homosexual relationships.More recently, detractors blasted Graham’s continued belief that homosexual behavior was a “sinister form of perversion,” and his intolerance against the very presence of gay and lesbian couples within Christianity.“From Genesis on, the Bible praises the marriage of a man and a woman, but it speaks only negatively of homosexual behavior whenever it is mentioned,” Graham’s website states.Graham’s sermons also promoted evangelism and railed against “godless communism,” drugs, sex and violence. He was convinced he must use “every modern means of communication available” to spread the Gospel throughout the world, and did so in print, on radio and television, online and in person.And for the next five decades, his electric personality connected with audiences in more than 185 countries.Graham was the first evangelist of note to speak behind the Iron Curtain, and during the Apartheid era he refused to visit South Africa until the government allowed integrated seating at his events. He published dozens of best-selling books, including Angels: God’s Secret Agents and The Jesus Generation, and wrote a weekly column that was syndicated in hundreds of newspapers.Graham received numerous honors, including the Horatio Alger Award, the George Washington Honor Medal, the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award and the Congressional Gold Medal. A highway in Charlotte bears his name, as does part of Interstate 240 near his home in Asheville, North Carolina. In 1989, he became the first clergyman to be granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as a minister.Graham also had a major effect on the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s. His early crusades were segregated, but once the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954, which found public school segregation unconstitutional, Graham integrated the seatings at his revival meetings.Graham befriended the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as well, and together they preached to more than 2 million people in New York City.King once remarked on their partnership: “Had it not been for the ministry of my good friend Dr. Billy Graham, my work in the Civil Rights Movement would not have been as successful as it has been.”When Graham was questioned about his views on faith and race, he argued there was no scriptural basis for segregation.“Jesus was not a white man; He was not a black man. He came from that part of the world that touches Africa and Asia and Europe,” Graham once preached. “Christianity is not a white man’s religion, and don’t let anybody ever tell you that it’s white or black. Christ belongs to all people; He belongs to the whole world.”As his message spread, Graham was granted personal audiences with royalty, dignitaries and many sitting presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama. Three presidents were even on hand in 2007 for the dedication of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte. Despite being a registered Democrat, Graham opposed the candidacy of John F. Kennedy, and actively encouraged other religious leaders to speak out about the dangers of having a Roman Catholic in the White House.Though beloved by millions, Graham was not without his detractors. Some fundamentalist Christians took issue with his ecumenical approach to evangelism, and after his 1957 crusade in New York, opponents of Graham’s more liberal theology began calling him “the Antichrist.” According to the biography Billy: A Personal Look at Bill Graham, the World’s Best-Loved Evangelist by Sherwood Eliot Wirt, one Christian educator even said that Graham was “the worst thing to happen to the Christian church in two thousand years.”As his health began to fail, Graham decided to announce his retirement in 2005.

He was 99.A family spokesman said he died from natural causes, ABC News reported. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association confirmed his death on Twitter. Born in 1918 in Charlotte, North Carolina, William Franklin Graham Jr. was the oldest of the four children of William and Morrow Graham. He was raised on a dairy farm, and little in his childhood suggested he would become a world-renowned preacher.Then at 16, Graham attended a series of revival meetings run by outspoken evangelist Mordecai Ham. The two months he spent listening to Ham’s sermons on sin sparked a spiritual awakening in Graham and prompted him to enroll at Bob Jones College. When the conservative Christian school’s strict doctrine didn’t align with his personal beliefs, he transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College of Florida) and joined a Southern Baptist Convention church. He was ordained in 1939.Graham received additional training at Illinois’ Wheaton College, where he met his future wife, Ruth McCue Bell. They were married for 64 years, until her death in 2007, and had five children.After serving briefly as the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, Graham launched his first radio program, “Songs in the Night,” in 1943. Although he left a year later, Graham liked the idea of sharing his message with a wide audience. As noted on his website, Graham took Jesus Christ literally when he said in Mark 16:15: “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.”Graham was still in his early 30s when entered the public spotlight by giving a series of well-attended “sin-smashing” revival meetings that were held under a circus tent in a Los Angeles parking lot. The press took interest in the charismatic young preacher and began writing articles about him. To get his message to even more people, Graham founded his own ministry, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.Graham viewed the Bible as the infallible word of God. He believed that Jesus led a sinless life and that all men were lost and would face God’s judgment.Such a strict interpretation of scripture also led him to condemn homosexual relationships.More recently, detractors blasted Graham’s continued belief that homosexual behavior was a “sinister form of perversion,” and his intolerance against the very presence of gay and lesbian couples within Christianity.“From Genesis on, the Bible praises the marriage of a man and a woman, but it speaks only negatively of homosexual behavior whenever it is mentioned,” Graham’s website states.Graham’s sermons also promoted evangelism and railed against “godless communism,” drugs, sex and violence. He was convinced he must use “every modern means of communication available” to spread the Gospel throughout the world, and did so in print, on radio and television, online and in person.And for the next five decades, his electric personality connected with audiences in more than 185 countries.Graham was the first evangelist of note to speak behind the Iron Curtain, and during the Apartheid era he refused to visit South Africa until the government allowed integrated seating at his events. He published dozens of best-selling books, including Angels: God’s Secret Agents and The Jesus Generation, and wrote a weekly column that was syndicated in hundreds of newspapers.Graham received numerous honors, including the Horatio Alger Award, the George Washington Honor Medal, the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award and the Congressional Gold Medal. A highway in Charlotte bears his name, as does part of Interstate 240 near his home in Asheville, North Carolina. In 1989, he became the first clergyman to be granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as a minister.Graham also had a major effect on the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s. His early crusades were segregated, but once the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954, which found public school segregation unconstitutional, Graham integrated the seatings at his revival meetings.Graham befriended the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as well, and together they preached to more than 2 million people in New York City.King once remarked on their partnership: “Had it not been for the ministry of my good friend Dr. Billy Graham, my work in the Civil Rights Movement would not have been as successful as it has been.”When Graham was questioned about his views on faith and race, he argued there was no scriptural basis for segregation.“Jesus was not a white man; He was not a black man. He came from that part of the world that touches Africa and Asia and Europe,” Graham once preached. “Christianity is not a white man’s religion, and don’t let anybody ever tell you that it’s white or black. Christ belongs to all people; He belongs to the whole world.”As his message spread, Graham was granted personal audiences with royalty, dignitaries and many sitting presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama. Three presidents were even on hand in 2007 for the dedication of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte. Despite being a registered Democrat, Graham opposed the candidacy of John F. Kennedy, and actively encouraged other religious leaders to speak out about the dangers of having a Roman Catholic in the White House.Though beloved by millions, Graham was not without his detractors. Some fundamentalist Christians took issue with his ecumenical approach to evangelism, and after his 1957 crusade in New York, opponents of Graham’s more liberal theology began calling him “the Antichrist.” According to the biography Billy: A Personal Look at Bill Graham, the World’s Best-Loved Evangelist by Sherwood Eliot Wirt, one Christian educator even said that Graham was “the worst thing to happen to the Christian church in two thousand years.”As his health began to fail, Graham decided to announce his retirement in 2005.

The reuploaded video also used the same title as the CBS affiliate: “Confrontation Between Lifeguard, Bodysurfer Caught On Camera In Redondo Beach Goes Viral.”The difference came in the new video’s description, where the uploader, who identified himself as “mike m” wrote, “DAVID HOGG THE ACTOR....” Hogg, 17, has become the focus of a growing number of conspiracy theories in response to his media appearances following an attack at his Parkland, Florida, school that left 17 dead last week. He is among a number of Stoneman Douglas students calling for the government to act on gun control.Some of the theories surrounding the student are a result of Hogg saying his father was an FBI agent; some began because people believe he and others have been coached by gun control advocates; and some are a result of people believing the students are paid “crisis actors.”It’s the last of the three that the trending YouTube video played into, apparently to the delight of many of the video’s commenters. This is, of course, bogus. Hogg’s status as a Stoneman Douglas student has been confirmed. At the time of the video, he was visiting California, where his family used to live, he says.YouTube eventually removed the video, but not before it had been viewed more than 200,000 times and reached No. 1 on the company’s trending page, where the most popular videos at any moment are on view.The company said in a statement that its system “misclassified” the video because it “contained footage from an authoritative news source.”“This video should never have appeared in Trending,” a YouTube spokesperson told HuffPost.“mike m,” the YouTube user who uploaded the video, has a penchant for conspiracy theories, based on his video page. Of the 10 videos he has uploaded, three have to do with Stoneman Douglas, including “David Hogg Can’t Remember His Lines When Interviewed for Florida school shooting.” Another video is titled “BREAKING Disclosure! First Govt NASA Close up UFO Video! They ARE HERE!!!” Others focused on chemtrails, a conspiracy theory favorite of InfoWars creator Alex Jones. “As soon as we became aware of the video, we removed it from Trending and from YouTube for violating our policies,” the YouTube spokesperson confirmed. “We are working to improve our systems moving forward.”YouTube says it has been working hard to clear its site of such videos. Late last year, CEO Susan Wojcicki announced the company planned to bring the number of “people across Google working to address content that might violate our policies to over 10,000 in 2018.”But the system clearly still has cracks that YouTube is having difficulty filling. At publication time, the top three search results for “David Hogg” on the video sharing site weren’t related to the student speaking up to combat mass shootings. They dealt in Hogg-related conspiracy theories."

Claudia Tenney said.",2018-02-21,Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) did not offer any evidence to back up her mass shooter claim.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8de023210000eb06601edf.jpeg?cache=OiogZrnQDm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) claimed Wednesday that people who commit mass shootings are often Democrats.The first-term Republican congresswoman made the comment at a discussion about last week’s Florida school shooting after criticizing the government for failing to act on several tips that might have prevented the deaths of 17 students and adults.“It’s interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats. But the media doesn’t talk about that either,” Tenney told WGDJ Talk1300 radio.Although law enforcement officials said there were “no known ties” between Nikolas Cruz and a particular white supremacist group, the 19-year-old suspect in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre had repeatedly expressed racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic views in private group chats, CNN reported.“I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy,” Tenney said in a subsequent statement on Wednesday. “While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists.”The fact-checking site Snopes found that an online list purporting to show that assassins are more likely to be Democrats was, in fact, wildly flawed: Among other errors, it simply ignored any mass shooting known to be committed by someone with Republican or conservative views, and it identified shooters who were not Democrats as Democrats.In her interview Wednesday, Tenney also lamented that legal gun owners might face restrictions after mass shootings. “I think that’s what scares me most is, a lot of these legal gun areas are going to be targeted now,” she said. “In their demographic, they have the least amount of crime than virtually any other demographic.”Tenney is a top-tier target of the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections. She was criticized last week after she deplored the focus on domestic violence allegations against former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned after one of his ex-wives released photos of a black eye.“I’m not saying he’s innocent, but I’m saying we don’t know,” Tenney said. “He could be the worst guy in the world, but now we’re getting into prosecution as far as I know. I guess there was an issue about, maybe the FBI knew about it, but really, is this what we’re talking about at this point?” Evan Lukaske, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Wednesday that Tenney’s comments will hurt her at the polls. “Once again Congresswoman Tenney has demonstrated how completely unfit she is to serve in Congress,” Lukaske said in a statement. “Two weeks ago she called Democrats ‘un-American,’ last week she defended alleged domestic abuser Rob Porter, and now she blames Democrats for mass murder — she is an embarrassment to New York and our country. Tenney’s comments are unhinged, shameful and disgusting, and show why voters will replace her next November.”This article has been updated to include statements from Rep. Tenney and DCCC spokesman Evan Lukaske."
64,ENTERTAINMENT,There's A Sad Callback Coming On 'The Walking Dead',Bill Bradley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carl-grimes-walking-dead_us_5a8c6c03e4b00a30a2500fe4,"The show's chief content officer, Scott Gimple, confirms this episode is gonna be hella sad.",2018-02-21,"Actor Chandler Riggs plays the character Carl Grimes on ""The Walking Dead.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c6e2c2000008806eaf707.jpeg?cache=jPJFCUb617&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Warning: Spoilers for “The Walking Dead” below!Dear “Walking Dead” fans: If you haven’t already heard, Carl (Chandler Riggs) is dying this week.So say goodbye to that guy. No more pudding. No more cowboy hats. Carl is dead. He’s dead, dead, dead.But a simple death is never enough for “The Walking Dead.”They’re going to drag this one out.We already know the show’s midseason premiere is going to be extra long ― reportedly 82 minutes ― and that it’s going to send Carl off into the sunset as he dies a slow, agonizing death from a zombie bite.If that doesn’t sound cheery enough for you, there’s going to be a sad callback in the episode, too.Carl got his deadly bite in Season 8, Episode 6, “The King, the Widow, and Rick,” when he was killing zombies with Siddiq (Avi Nash). Siddiq’s mother apparently believed that killing zombies would free their souls, so Carl helps Siddiq kill some zombies in honor of his mother.Unfortunately, Carl’s decision to do so leads to his demise.On the surface, this seems like a really dumb way for Carl to die. After all, he’s been around since Season 1, and still has a lot of story from the comics that the show hasn’t yet touched on. If you dig just a little deeper, yes, the plot turn is still dumb (can’t fix that), but it also seems to have a connection to Carl’s mom, Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies).You see, after learning that Siddiq kills zombies because of his mother’s beliefs, Carl asked, “Doing that, doesn’t it just make things harder for you while you’re trying to survive?”Um, yeah, considering Carl’s bite, it clearly does.But the line reminded us of when Lori died, and she told Carl to “always do what’s right,” even though it’s not easy. Does killing the zombies make it harder to survive? Yes, but it’s right, so that’s why he did it. For those who don’t remember Lori’s death, you’re lucky. In Season 3, a very-pregnant Lori went into labor, and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) had to perform a cesarean section on a dirty floor without pain meds or anesthetic. Baby Judith comes out fine, but Lori doesn’t make it, and Carl has to shoot her to ensure she doesn’t come back as a zombie, as people on “The Walking Dead” are known to do.Before all that, she said goodbye to Carl, telling him he’s going to “beat this world” (a line that Carl repeats in the Season 8B trailer), adding:You gotta do what’s right, baby. You promise me, you’ll always do what’s right. It’s so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So don’t... so if it feels wrong, don’t do it, all right? If it feels easy, don’t do it. Don’t let the world spoil you. You’re so good.During an interview with “Walking Dead” chief content officer Scott Gimple last year following the midseason finale, HuffPost asked if Carl’s fateful decision to go zombie-hunting was a callback to Lori’s final words.“It was a story decision, and the only reason I can’t get into that part is I want the story to be told,” Gimple said.“It’s funny that you bring up Lori. I will say there are parallels there, and it was very much in our mind,” he added. “Things we see even in the very next episode played into exactly what you’re talking about.”What those things will look like remains to be seen; however, Riggs previously told The Hollywood Reporter that his character’s death turned him into a “humanitarian figure” meant to help Rick (Andrew Lincoln) see the good in people. Just as Lori died imploring Carl to do what’s right, it seems Carl might do the same for Rick.The upcoming episode is going to be heavy. On the bright side of things, Rick’s ugly cry after Lori’s Season 3 death eventually led to all those Sad Rick/Coral memes. Maybe the next episode’s tragedy will make for another hilarious GIF.We hope so. Yes, it’s the apocalypse, but would it kill anyone besides Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) to smile every once in a while?“The Walking Dead” Season 8 returns Feb. 25 at 9 p.m. Eastern on AMC."
65,POLITICS,Not Every Pennsylvania Democrat Benefited From Redistricting,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-democrats-gain-from-new-congressional-map_us_5a8d9fdfe4b00a30a251b3fc,Here's a rundown of the winners and losers.,2018-02-21,Democrat Christina Hartman has been running for the U.S. House in a Pennsylvania district that a new political map has made much more conservative. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8da06e1e0000fb077ac63a.jpeg?cache=83F3Hxpbmp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court prompted cheers from Democrats on Monday when it released the new boundaries it drew for the state’s 18 congressional districts.The new map, which the court created after ruling earlier this month that the previous, GOP-gerrymandered map had unconstitutionally disenfranchised voters, gives Democrats the opportunity to compete in eight districts won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, compared with six she carried under the old map.But in a central Pennsylvania district where two formidable Democratic hopefuls already have raised serious cash, the new electoral map is foreboding.Pennsylvania’s 16th Congressional District, which leaned modestly Republican, is now the deep red 11th District. While the previous district included the city of Lancaster, surrounding suburbs and the city of Reading ― which has a diverse population ― the more geographically contiguous new district excludes Reading and adds swaths of conservative, rural York County. The result is that a district President Donald Trump won by 7 percentage points is now a district he would have carried by 26 points, according to calculations by the New York Times. (Further references to Trump’s margin in the new congressional districts is attributable to the Times.)It also went from having an R+5 partisan voter index to R+14, according to the Cook Political Report, which compiles the figure to show how a district voted in the presidential election compared to the country as a whole. “It would be hard to get people to invest further in that race,” a prominent Democrat familiar with the national party’s considerations said of the newly drawn 11th District. “The natural thing for several Democrats ... is either to move or drop out.” Overall in Pennsylvania, Republicans hold 12 of the 18 U.S. House districts, with one seat that had been in GOP hands vacant. Trump carried the state by less than a percentage point. GOP leaders have indicated they will challenge the state Supreme Court’s redrawn map in federal court, but legal experts give them little chance of having it voided.That’s good news in general for Democrats as they seek to win the House majority in this year’s midterm elections. Still, in the 11th District, the new boundaries are disruptive because of the heated state of the Democratic primary where many of the national divides between the party establishment and its more populist faction have begun to play out.The two leading Democrats in the race are Christina Hartman, a former international development specialist running as a mainstream Democrat, and Jess King, a nonprofit leader who is running on a more populist, left-wing platform that includes support for “Medicare for all.” King and Hartman had both raised more than $300,000 as of the end of 2017.Upon learning of the new redistricting map, Hartman issued a brief Facebook statement praising the decision and saying she would be “studying these maps closely to determine our next moves.”Hartman made clear in an interview with HuffPost that the new district, replete with Trump supporters, would make it harder for a Democrat to win the seat. Her victory strategy hinged in part on attracting the backing of moderate Republicans disenchanted with Trump.She is seriously considering ending her bid, and said she will decide by the middle of next week. “We have to look at the best strategy moving forward and figure out what that is for my district and for myself,” she said.King sounded a more upbeat note in her response to the new map, claiming on Facebook that the tough nature of the race is “nothing new.” “Our campaign has never been about Democrats versus Republicans,” King wrote. “Our campaign is about building an America that truly works all of us, not just for the rich and powerful who rig the game in Washington.”King’s campaign communications director, Guido Girgenti, told HuffPost in an email on Wednesday afternoon that King walked into the office earlier in the day and said, “I’m all in.”Girgenti also said that a phone-banking marathon to introduce King to new Democratic and independent constituents would continue as planned this weekend, manned by volunteers in 25 homes.Meanwhile, an adjacent congressional district is suddenly within Democrats’ grasp. The former 4th Congressional District has become the 10th. With the addition of Hershey and previously excluded sections of Harrisburg, it went from a district Trump won by 21 percentage points to one he would have carried by 9 points.Democrats Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson, a former Obama administration budget official, and retired career military officer George Scott are already vying to unseat Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) in the district. In light of the new map, Democrats have also approached Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale about jumping in the race.Petitions for House candidates to be on the ballot are due in Pennsylvania by March 20 and DePasquale said on Twitter that he would make his decision before petition collection starts in earnest.The biggest swings in Democrats favor were in eastern Pennsylvania districts where party leaders already liked their chances. In Philadelphia’s suburbs, the old 7th District ― infamously gerrymandered to look like “Goofy kicking Donald Duck” ― is now the 5th District.Clinton won the old district by 2 percentage points, but would have carried the reconfigured one by a 28-point margin. And with the retirement of GOP Rep. Patrick Meehan amid sexual harassment allegations, the seat is now open. Democrat Rich Lazer, who has close ties to area labor unions, is considering a run for the seat, according to Daily Kos, which provided a rundown of other candidates as well.Republican prospects also have been hurt in suburban Philadelphia’s 6th District, which now includes the heavily Democratic city of Reading. GOP Rep. Ryan Costello already faced a well-funded challenger in Democrat Chrissy Houlahan, a career naval officer, business executive and public school teacher. He must now defeat Houlahan in a district that would have gone for Clinton by 9 percentage points, compared with the 1 point victory she had in it.In the Lehigh Valley north of Philadelphia, Democrats like their odds more in the new 7th District than they did in the old 15th. The retirement of Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, a popular moderate, had already sent Democrats scrambling to pick up the seat. With the addition of the city of Easton and Democratic-leaning towns in the Poconos region, the district went from one that Trump took by 8 percentage points to one where Clinton would have defeated him by a single point.Democrats competing for the seat span the ideological spectrum. John Morganelli, a long-serving district attorney in the area who has praised Trump, is running as a self-described moderate. Under the new map, he noted in an email to supporters, the county where he is a prosecutor is now a larger part of the district.Attorney Susan Wild and pastor Greg Edwards, a civil rights activist with the endorsement of national liberal groups, are vying for the progressive mantle. Thus far, Edwards has outraised Wild ― and his campaign believes the new district helps his chances in the primary. “General election viability, which is often an excuse to dismiss progressive candidates, is really no longer in play” now that the district leans more Democratic, said Dan Friedman, an Edwards campaign spokesman.And while the new district boundaries do not affect the March 13 special election for the vacant seat in southwest Pennsylvania’s 18th District, they could help Democrats in that area in November.The home of Democrat Conor Lamb, a former federal prosecutor running in the special election, has been redistricted into the 17th District. Even if Lamb loses next month, he will have a chance to challenge Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in the new 17th District that includes more Democratic-leaning Pittsburgh suburbs than before. Trump won Rothfus’ old district, which was then the 12th, by 21 percentage points, but would have carried the new one by just 3 points.Finally, there is at least one Pennsylvania district where Democrats’ fortunes appear to remain almost exactly the same. Trump won what was the 17th District in northeast Pennsylvania’s by 10 percentage points, and that would have been his margin in what is now the 8th District.Rep. Matt Cartwright, a liberal Democrat, was re-elected in 2016 by nearly 8 percentage points. His staff estimated that about 30,000 people in the district voted for him and Trump, Cartwright told HuffPost.Cartwright may now face a tougher Republican opponent since the geography of the new district enables to former state Revenue Secretary Dan Meuser to jump in.But Cartwright said he isn’t worried about the electoral impact of the changes.He plans to hold a March 4 town hall in Pike County to introduce himself to new constituents. And one advantage of the geographically compact new district is that Cartwright’s new constituents were already in his campaign media market, he said. “Even though they haven’t been represented by me, some of these people know me and know what I’m about,” he said.This story has been updated to reflect Democrat Jess King’s confirmation that she will stay in the race in the new 11th District.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Rothfus’ old congressional district was the 11th. It was the 12th."

He has been periodically homeless for five years and is hoping to find a job and an apartment.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d45781e000046057ac591.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s no secret the U.S. is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. Rents are spiraling out of control while incomes stagnate, with rents increasing at more than triple the rate of wages over the last 50 years. The increasingly desperate situation has led nine U.S. foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation, to announce on Tuesday that they are launching a partnership to tackle systemic problems in the housing market. The aim: to ensure that the more than 11 million families across the country that spend more than half of their paycheck on rent and those who are homeless have access to safe, affordable housing.The partnership, called Funders For Housing and Opportunity, has divided an initial $4.9 million in grant money between four nonprofits that tackle housing insecurity. This first tranche of money is aimed “mostly in the area of policy, advocacy and organizing,” said Susan Thomas, senior program officer at Melville Charitable Trust and chair of Funders for Housing and Opportunity. Center for Community Change will get $750,000 to bolster its work with low-income communities, with a focus on California and Washington state. National Housing Trust and Enterprise Community Partners will receive just over $1 million to lead a community coalition to help residents get heard on housing issues. The California-based Partnership for Children and Youth will get $400,000 for its training and advocacy work in housing developments. The largest grant, $2.7 million over three years, goes to the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), which is working to launch a multi-sector housing campaign including organizations from across the health care, civil rights, education and anti-poverty fields.“The research that’s been building shows us that when people are struggling so much just to afford their homes, they’re suffering in a multitude of ways,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the NLIHC. “They have poor health, their kids are unable to do as well in school as their peers who are affordable housed, they have lower lifetime earnings and they even have have lower life expectancy.” The NLIHC was behind stark research last year into rent affordability, which found that for those working a 40-hour week on the minimum wage, there is no state in the country where a modest two-bedroom rental home is affordable (defined as costing less than 30 percent of the renters’ income). A renter earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would need to work 117 hours a week for a two-bedroom rental home to be affordable. “I would say the affordable housing crisis has reached historic heights,” said Yentel, who pointed to research showing a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes available for the lowest income people. “Another way of looking at it is for every 100 of the lowest income people in our country, there are just 35 homes that are affordable and available to them.”At a time families are “making choices between their housing payments and buying healthy food, medicine or school supplies for their kids,” said Sue Henderson, Habitat for Humanity International’s vice president for the United States and Canada, this new partnership is to be welcomed. “We need more funders at the table and more work boots on the ground,” she added. The nearly $5 million initial purse is, of course, peanuts compared to the total resources of these foundations, which collectively manage assets of about $470 billion. But Thomas said this is just the start. More money will be available that will be focused on mobilizing and scaling grassroots projects that work “particularly in the areas at the intersections of housing and education and housing and health care. ... We really feel very strongly that this is a cross-sector issue; it’s not just a housing issue.” The announcement comes at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration has just unveiled a proposed budget that hacks away at the funding available for affordable housing. “It looks really grim,” said Mary Cunningham, vice president of the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute. “I don’t think philanthropy will be able to make up the losses that we face from the federal budget but certainly getting smarter, targeting affordable housing and helping align the fields is really important work.”She added, “We really know what the solutions are to ending the affordable housing crisis and ending homelessness and that is building more housing and we just haven’t figured out a way to pay for that.”For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8cc4d12000003800eaf766.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since a gunman killed 17 students and adults in Parkland, Florida, last Wednesday, gun violence prevention group Moms Demand Action has seen in a surge in new volunteers ― and it’s eager to mobilize them to support the new student-led movement for gun reform.Moms Demand Action, the grassroots arm of Everytown For Gun Safety, was founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The group says more than 75,000 people have reached out online or by text to volunteer in the last week.Local chapters of Moms Demand Action have also reported swelling attendance at events over the past few days, with anywhere from two to 10 times the usual number of people showing up at new member meetings, advocacy days and rallies.For instance, a meeting in Maine that usually has about 20 attendees had over 250 people turn up on Sunday, a meeting in Raleigh that usually has two dozen participants had more than 350 on Monday, and an “advocacy day” calling for action from legislators in Missouri ― which about 150 people attended last year ― had more than 300 participants this week.Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, said one of the most encouraging aspects of this influx has been how many new members are young students, mirroring the recent wave of teen activists mobilizing since the Parkland shooting. Students at Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School and beyond have been speaking to news outlets, pressuring legislators on social media and organizing national marches to call for lawmakers to take action on gun violence.To meet these new members’ needs, Moms Demand Action has just launched a new initiative: Students Demand Action.“When Sandy Hook happened, those were babies. They weren’t able to use their voices and express their outrage,” Watts told HuffPost on Tuesday. “These are kids who have come of age as the generation of lockdown drills. Our lawmakers are not standing up to the gun lobby, so our children are having to stand up to gunmen.”The Parkland shooting was the 17th shooting incident at a U.S. school in 2018 alone, and it was also a turning point for 68-year-old Ilene Evanter Van Hoozer. She attended a Moms Demand Action event in Falls Church, Virginia, for the first time on Monday, and plans to continue being active with the group.“In the wake of the tragedy of last week, there were no excuses that were good enough anymore,” Evanter told HuffPost Tuesday. “Feeling sad wasn’t enough. Feeling numb wasn’t enough. It was time to channel it.”As a clinical social worker who has worked with children for decades, Evanter was most excited to hear students speaking at the event, which was held at a local high school. She plans to attend next month’s student-led March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C.“I think we’re learning from the students in Florida ― they really are giving us energy and making us as adults look at ourselves and want to support them,” she added.Moms Demand Action is excited to support the young activists organizing now, Watts said, and has already started mobilizing its more than 4 million members to attend the March for Our Lives.Taking on gun reform in America is “a marathon, not a sprint,” Watts said, adding that local chapters in all 50 states that took years to build up have now been essential in absorbing the thousands of new people seeking to get involved in the gun reform movement.Since Sandy Hook, the group has had key legislative victories ― such as getting background check laws passed in eight states ― but Watts noted that Moms Demand Action still hasn’t been able to push Congress to close the many loopholes in the country’s background check system. That’s another reason she’s encouraged by this new surge of young activists.“I’m excited to let them lead and see where they’ll take us,” Watts said. “There is strength in numbers. We need every generation to get involved. It’s going to be up to the next generation to make sure this work gets finished. This is going to take a while ― and take every American.”"
68,POLITICS,Here's How To Stop The Next Nikolas Cruz,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-school-shooter-red-flag-law_us_5a8d9d2de4b00a30a251a979,"""Red flag"" laws empower families to take action when they spot signs of trouble.",2018-02-21,"Nikolas Cruz faces 17 charges of premeditated murder in the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Before the shooting, he exhibited dozens of warning signs, but was able to legally purchase firearms.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d9eb4210000ed06601e46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nikolas Cruz was depressed. He cut his arms and posted videos on Snapchat. He killed animals. He threatened fellow students. He hit his mother. He brought bullets to school. Someone close to him called the FBI to report his “desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” Despite this, Cruz, 19, was able to legally acquire an arsenal of firearms, including the AR-15 police say he used to slaughter 17 people last week at his former high school in Parkland, Florida.Without a criminal record or a court declaring him mentally incompetent, Cruz was free to arm himself as heavily as he could afford in his home state. This would not have been the case in the five states that allow law enforcement or family members to petition a court to temporarily remove guns from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others. The policy, alternately called a “red flag” law, “gun violence restraining order,” or “extreme risk protection order,” is getting more attention since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Federal law prohibits some individuals from buying or owning guns: those who have been convicted of a felony or a domestic violence misdemeanor, are an undocumented immigrant or fugitive from justice, were dishonorably discharged from the military, or have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Some states have gone further, passing laws to prevent individuals who are exhibiting red flags, but haven’t yet committed a crime, from possessing firearms, explained Robin Lloyd, the director of government affairs at Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization established by the former congresswoman and shooting survivor Gabrielle Giffords. California, Washington, Oregon, Indiana and Connecticut have approved measures that allow a court to temporarily strip gun rights from people who show warning signs of violence. While each state differs, here’s broadly how they work: A concerned family member or police officer asks a judge to remove guns from an individual they believe is at risk of hurting themselves or others.A temporary order, which typically lasts for a few weeks, can be issued immediately if there’s evidence it’s needed to prevent imminent danger. Individuals are given notice of a final hearing, where a judge will decide if they should be prohibited from gun possession for a longer period of time, generally a year. They may contest the evidence against them, and can appeal the decision. In Cruz’s case, “it’s entirely possible that there could have been an intervention beforehand to remove firearms” if Florida had a red flag law, said Lloyd, noting that police responded to his family home on dozens of occasions. “We know this is a life-saving measure.”California was the first state to allow family members to petition a court to remove guns from individuals who exhibit alarming warning signs. The legislation was passed in 2014, a few months after the Isla Vista rampage, in which Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured 13. A month before the massacre, his mother contacted mental health officials, saying she was worried about disturbing videos he was posting to YouTube. Law enforcement performed a welfare check, but said their hands were tied. There was nothing legally preventing him from possessing a gun.Similar legislation has been proposed in 18 other states this year. Elizabeth Avore, legal and policy director for Everytown for Gun Safety, said passing red flag laws was a top priority for her organization, even before the Florida mass shooting.“We see over and over again that these mass shooters have demonstrated warning signs prior to the act of violence,” Avore said. “After the Florida school shooting, there is renewed interest ― and bipartisan interest ― in these laws.” Florida state Rep. Lori Berman (D) introduced a red flag bill last year, and told HuffPost it received no bipartisan support at the time. Now, it seems like her bill may pick up steam. Prominent Florida Republicans, such as former presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, have come out in support of the approach. “We haven’t had a serious discussion about gun safety in the state of Florida,” Berman said, noting that she has introduced at least seven bills on gun violence prevention during her time in the legislature. None has ever even received a hearing. “It saddens me that it took this event to have this discussion,” Berman said.Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.) introduced federal legislation last year that would encourage states to adopt red flag laws with grant money. Carbajal said the approach is “sensible and reasonable,” and may have prevented Cruz from committing a mass shooting. “The Second Amendment is important, but it doesn’t mean that we have to be extreme and permissive with the sale of guns to anyone and everyone,” Carbajal said. “There are reasonable parameters that can be enacted.” "

Democrat Linda Belcher, a former public school teacher and state lawmaker, defeated Republican Rebecca Johnson, 68 percent to 32 percent.Belcher’s “lifelong commitment to bettering her community and her door-to-door campaign showcased her dedication to standing up for Kentuckians,” Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “She will work hard on behalf of working families, students, and the people of Bullitt County.”Belcher is no stranger to the 49th District, which is in Bullitt County, just south of Louisville. Belcher represented the district from 2009 to 2012 and again from 2014 to January 2017, after being defeated in the 2016 election by a narrow margin.Belcher’s victory is nonetheless symbolically important since Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton among the district’s voters, 72 percent to 23 percent.The special election was prompted by the December death of then-state Rep. Dan Johnson, a Republican. Johnson took his own life after denying allegations that he had molested a 17-year-old girl at a church where he had served as a pastor.Rebecca Johnson, the defeated Republican candidate, is Johnson’s widow.Belcher did not provide details of her policy proposals on her campaign website. But in an Election Day Facebook post, Belcher vowed that a vote for her was a vote for “keeping funding for Bullitt County schools, supporting our working families, and bringing Bullitt County’s share of road and infrastructure funds to the district.”"

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-india-speech_us_5a8c9d83e4b00a30a2505846,"The president’s eldest son is slated to speak at an event with India's prime minister, during a trip meant to sell luxury apartments.",2018-02-20,"Policemen enter the premises of a construction site of Trump Tower, a luxury apartment building, ahead of the visit of Donald Trump Jr. in Kolkata, India, Feb. 20, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c9e56210000ed06601ceb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The president’s eldest son is scheduled to appear at a business summit in New Delhi on Friday. He will speak just minutes before the prime minister of India. His remarks are titled “Reshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The New Era of Cooperation.”Will Donald Trump Jr. offer the country’s business leaders a peek into a new U.S.-India relationship in trade? Defense? Terrorism?Don’t ask the United States government. It claims not to have any idea.The State Department, usually an authority in matters concerning America’s relations with other countries, said it wasn’t involved with Trump Jr.’s trip, which appears to be primarily about marketing luxury apartments in new buildings that will be licensed to bear the Trump name.“I’m not familiar with what is going to be the contents of the speech, or how it was put together,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a briefing Tuesday. “He is there as a private citizen, and I don’t have any comment beyond that.”White House press secretary Sarah Sanders similarly said the trip is unrelated to government business. “My understanding is he is there in a personal capacity,” she said.Critics of President Donald Trump’s ongoing ownership of his various branded businesses say the speech is a perfect example of the conflicts of interest he has created and that his family is taking advantage of.“Don Jr. has continued to blur the lines between the Trump administration and the Trump Organization,” said Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group. “He is touring Indian properties and selling off the opportunity to meet with him, while also delivering a speech on foreign policy at the same summit as the prime minister of India, all while under Secret Service protection on the taxpayer dime.”Unlike previous presidents who placed their assets in a blind trust while in office to ensure that their decisions could not be affected by their personal financial interests, President Trump has refused to do so. Instead, he continues to profit from Trump properties such as the Trump International Hotel four blocks from the White House and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The hotel routinely accommodates foreign delegations visiting the city, while Mar-a-Lago doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after Trump’s election. When visiting the Florida resort, the president frequently mingles with paying guests while excluding the journalists assigned to travel with him.Donald Trump Jr. is executive vice president of the Trump Organization, the family business that operates his father’s various for-profit enterprises. An official there, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the India trip is purely on behalf of the Trump Organization.“Donald Trump Jr. is speaking to the Economic Times Global Business Summit in his capacity as a businessman. I believe there are other influential business leaders speaking such as the CEO of Uber and the founder of Netflix,” the official said. “Donald Jr. is not part of the administration.”The official did not respond to a follow-up query asking what topics Trump Jr. would be covering in his remarks, which according to the schedule posted by the sponsor are to begin at 7:35 p.m. local time and last for 15 minutes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to speak for half an hour that evening, beginning 10 minutes after Trump Jr. is finished.Trump Jr. is attending marketing sessions in various Indian cities where apartment towers are being planned with the Trump brand attached. As has been the case with most Trump family construction projects since Donald Trump ran his casinos into bankruptcy in the 1990s and 2000s, other investors are financing the construction, while the Trump family is benefiting from licensing fees it charges to put the Trump name on the buildings.Ads in Indian newspapers have been promising drinks and dinner with Trump Jr. if buyers make a down payment of 2.5 million rupees ― about $39,000 ― for an apartment. Flats in a tower being built in a New Delhi suburb are running for as much as $1.5 million.In an interview with CNBC India upon his arrival in the country this week, Trump Jr. said he was impressed at how Indians always seem happy, despite living amid so much poverty. “You can see the poorest of the poor, and there is still a smile on a face,” he said. “I know some of the most successful people in the world and some of them are the most miserable people in the world, also, right?”Libowitz said he’s not sure how and when Trump Jr.’s thoughts about “Indo-Pacific ties” became valuable enough to warrant a prestige speaking slot with India’s prime minister.“We do not know when he became a foreign policy expert, but we would bet it had something to do with being the son of the president,” Libowitz said. “The big question is who will be paying for access to the president’s son.”"

As a result, the error cost them significant points on their technical score and ended their chance of placing on the podium.Chock and Bates were one of three U.S. ice dancing teams competing for a medal on Tuesday, and they were separated by only a few points from U.S. fan-favorites Maia and Alex Shibutani following Monday’s competition. Right before Chock and Bates took the ice Monday, Chock said, her old foot injury flared up, which she said was “kind of traumatic.” Still, they skated a stellar program, which brought high expectations for Tuesday.Though it was unlikely they’d contend for gold, Chock and Bates were within reach of bronze before the fall.The duo made a quick recovery and finished their graceful program to John Lennon’s “Imagine” without error. The crowd cheered them on as they moved on from the mistake.Chock later tweeted her gratitude to fans for their support, noting they received tons of kind messages after their performance. "

For one, the drug’s purported benefits ― increased blood flow and faster recovery after a workout ― don’t seem particularly necessary for curling, a sport in which some athletes were known to take smoke breaks mid-match.Plus, Krushelnitsky, his managers and his doctors knew what the rest of the world knew going into the Winter Games: There’s a microscope on Russia because of revelations about its state-sponsored doping regime and its athletes’ taste for meldonium in particular. Tennis star Maria Sharapova admitted to taking meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, which earned her a 15-month ban, and enough members of Russia’s under-18 hockey squad tested positive for the stuff that the team was replaced en masse before the 2016 world championships.Perhaps most peculiar, though, is the fact that meldonium, a heart drug, was banned in the first place. The drug’s performance-enhancing properties have not actually been scientifically confirmed. But they never had to be, because Russian athletes were taking a lot of it, and that was enough to get the World Anti-Doping Agency’s attention.WADA took aim at meldonium, developed in 1970 in Latvia, when it noticed that a number of professional athletes in the old Eastern Bloc were using it. A study of the 2015 European Games, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found a “high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes.” It found that 13 medal winners were on meldonium at the time, and 66 of 762 athletes tested positive for it.Russians, meanwhile, were crazy for it. A study by the country’s anti-doping agency found that 17 percent of samples taken from 4,316 Russian athletes between October 2014 and February 2015 had traces of meldonium, according to the Times. When researchers looked at rugby players, that number skyrocketed to 53 percent.WADA spent only a year monitoring the drug before banning it on Jan. 1, 2016. (By comparison, it’s taken years to ban other substances ― some drugs, like caffeine, sit on the monitoring list indefinitely.) After meldonium was banned, athletes largely from Eastern European countries failed more than 170 doping tests due to the drug, including Sharapova.Dr. Olivier Rabin, WADA’s science director, noted that after the Sharapova scandal, the group banned meldonium in part because everyone was doing it.“For meldonium, it quickly came to our attention that there were clear patterns of use by entire teams, which usually suggests a drug isn’t being taken for medical purposes,” he told NPR in 2016. “How could every member of a team need the same medical treatment?”But although Rabin says there are studies suggesting the drug had a “potential performance-enhancing benefit,” there isn’t any preponderance of evidence that this is true. In fact, one study Rabin referred to actually states that “The evidence to demonstrate any performance enhancing effects of meldonium in the athlete population is limited.”Of course, this didn’t need to be about performance enhancement. Before banning a drug, WADA also looks at other criteria, including health risks and an even wider catch-all, “whether taking the drug goes against the spirit of sport,” according to Rabin. Meldonium, apparently, falls into the latter category, since Radin previously noted that “meldonium is probably not a very toxic substance.” Meldonium’s short history on the naughty list is a classic case of authorities post-hoc’ing their way through a drug war. A suspect class of people took a substance; the substance became suspect as a result.“Here’s a situation where WADA has to play constant catch-up,” says John Hoberman, an Olympic historian and professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “They had to include related substances [on the banned substances list] as well, because some underground chemist would tweak the testosterone molecule that wasn’t covered by the statute. They have to react to events.”In the case of meldonium, that meant banning a drug without conclusive evidence that it enhances athletic performance.During the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, clean Russian athletes are only permitted to compete under a neutral flag and uniform as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.” The IOC banned 11 Russian athletes for life over allegations of state-sponsored doping and what the committee called “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.Russia ranked No. 1 in doping violations in 2013-2015, according to WADA, and the country has been implicated in doping scandals across many international sports in prior years.This year, Putin admitted to “instances of doping” among his athletes, but also said, “There are many such examples around the world, but no one is making a big show of it.” (He’s not wrong in this. “Americans have a well-established doping regime, too; it’s just privatized and corporatized,” HuffPost’s Travis Waldron has written.)It’s unclear what will happen to Krushelnitsky, or whether Russia will be reinstated as an Olympic competitor after the latest scandal. The IOC had previously suggested that it could lift its suspension on Russian athletes marching under their national flag for the closing ceremony, but IOC spokesman Mark Adams told The Associated Press that a failed doping test could prevent that."

77,POLITICS,West Virginia Teachers Plan Statewide Strike,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/west-virginia-teachers-plan-statewide-strike_us_5a8c8a8ae4b00a30a2503bcc,"For the first time in nearly three decades, teachers across the state are set to walk off the job if their demands aren't met.",2018-02-20,West Virginia teachers unions say workers in every county of the state are poised to take part in the strike.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c8bd32000003800eaf734.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On weekdays, Rebecca Diamond teaches second grade at Kellogg Elementary School in Wayne County, West Virginia.On weekends, she works a register at Hardee’s.“I never dreamed 19 years ago when I started teaching that I would have to work a second job to provide for my kids,” explained the 42-year-old Diamond, who’s married to a fellow public school teacher and has two teenagers. “I knew teaching wouldn’t make [me] billions, but I thought it would be enough.”Diamond and her colleagues are so fed up with their stagnant pay and rising health care costs that they have decided to walk off the job later later this week. If the teachers and other public employees go on strike Thursday and Friday as expected, it will be the first statewide work stoppage to hit West Virginia schools in nearly 30 years.The state’s two teachers unions ― affiliates of the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association ― say workers in every county will take part in the strike, with most having voted in favor of it by overwhelming margins. They are hoping to send a strong message to the state legislature, which hasn’t funded the public employees’ health care program enough to curb rising premiums.The last across-the-board raise for teachers and other public employees came in 2014. Coupled with increasing deductions for health premiums, that means some workers have actually seen their take-home pay go down in recent years, according to Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia.“I don’t think people recognize how dire it is, and how it directly impacts students’ learning,” Campbell said. “Teacher vacancies are increasing. There are classrooms with no teacher of record. ... We’ve actually been educating teachers at our universities in West Virginia and they’re not staying here.”West Virginia ranked 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in average teacher salaries in 2016, ahead of only Mississippi, Oklahoma and South Dakota, according to data from the National Education Association. It was one of just five states where average pay dropped from the previous year, to $45,622.The state’s Republican governor, Jim Justice, proposed a 1 percent general increase in teacher pay each year for five years, a plan passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate. The Republican-controlled House of Delegates passed a plan that included a 2 percent raise followed by several 1 percent annual raises. The state’s unions have been critical of both proposals. Don Scalise, a government and history teacher at Cabell Midland High School, said rising health care costs are a bigger problem than the salaries. If the state doesn’t fill a $39 million shortfall, premiums will rise again next year for workers on the state employee health plan. Scalise said the reasonable health care costs used to help make up for the low pay.“In West Virginia, we know they weren’t known for having high salaries, but they were known for good health insurance,” he said. “That used to be something to attract people. Now that’s eroding.”Scalise’s county was one of a handful where teachers went out on a one-day walkout last week, before the statewide strike was organized. He said legislators have underestimated how willing public employees are to use work stoppages to make their demands.“We feel like we’ve been backed into a corner,” he said.West Virginia public employees don’t enjoy the same collective bargaining rights that public sector workers do elsewhere. In most states, a local teachers union will negotiate with the school district to secure a contract spelling out wages and benefits. But in West Virginia, the general pay scale is set by the state legislature, with counties left to supplement those salaries to varying degrees. Unions essentially lobby lawmakers to pass legislation improving pay and benefits, rather than bargain directly on behalf of members. While they can’t negotiate over wages, there’s precedent for West Virginia teachers to go on strike ― even though they could face court injunctions to return to work. (The state superintendent of schools has asserted that a strike would be illegal.) The last time teachers walked off the job in West Virginia was 1990, when they protested low pay. During that strike, workers in 47 of the state’s 55 counties participated.Campbell said the state will continue to lose teachers in border areas where they can easily cross state lines for better pay. Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland all have higher average wages than West Virginia. According to Campbell, a lot of teachers feel torn between needing more money and wanting to stay loyal to the state they have always lived in.“We’re not saying we want to be first in pay,” Campbell said. “It’s about actually having a living wage. We have to be able to survive. We have families. Our students are suffering because of the lack of an ability to attract and retain people.” West Virginia has been dealing with a growing teacher shortage in recent years, with 700 vacancies around the state as of last spring. The board of education has proposed watering down some teacher training requirements in order to plug the gaps, including waiving the need to pass a basic knowledge test if a candidate had a certain grade point average.Diamond said boosting pay would be one way to address the problem. With 19 years of teaching experience, she earns a salary of about $39,000. Her husband earns slightly more, thanks to having a master’s degree plus 30 credit hours. But even with two salaries, they live one paycheck to the next. She said her $8.75-per-hour shifts at Hardee’s help cover the costs of their children’s traveling sports teams. She lives so close to Ohio that she shops for her groceries there. So far, she’s resisted looking for a better-paying job teaching on the other side of the Ohio River. “I have lived in West Virginia my whole life,” she said. “I have two children who I don’t want to leave the state. I don’t want them to feel they can’t be productive. What I’m fighting for is the future of West Virginia.”This story has been updated with details on the 1990 strike."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c72d62000008806eaf70c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SÃO PAULO ― Brazilian President Michel Temer made the unprecedented decision Friday to give the country’s military all public security responsibilities in Rio de Janeiro, the beleaguered city that has been plagued by rising rates of violent crime since it hosted the Olympic Games nearly two years ago.Temer’s decision will put the military in near-total control of security in Rio through the end of the year, marking the first time a Brazilian president has mobilized the armed forces to take over a city or state’s public security efforts since the country’s military dictatorship ended in 1985.The announcement has sent shockwaves across country, where the prospect of any sort of military intervention is already an unsettling topic for many, and yet Temer argued in an official statement and again on television Friday that it was the only possible maneuver still available in a desperate time for both Rio and Brazil.After nearly a decade of declining crime rates, Rio has seen a dramatic spike in violent crimes and homicides in the past two years. In 2016, the Rio state was home to more than 5,000 homicides, including nearly 1,000 killings committed by police.Though it is far from Brazil’s most violent area, the second-largest but most prominent city in the country has become a barometer for the nation as a whole, which saw its number of homicides increase nearly 4 percent, to roughly 62,000, in 2016. (By comparison, in 2016, there were around 17,000 homicides in the United States, which has roughly 100 million more people than Brazil.)There were another 688 shootings in Rio in January, but it is no coincidence that Temer made the announcement last week, at the close of Carnival. As the annual pre-Lent festival ended, videos of tourists being beaten and robbed on Rio’s streets and beaches circulated online and on Brazilian cable news, driving home the perception that violence in the city had spiraled out of control.There is no doubt that Rio and Brazil in general are in dire need of a policy shift to address the outbreaks of violence.But there is little reason for optimism that Temer’s plan to send in the big guns of the Brazilian military will work, and the concerns around his decision are plentiful and obvious. Most notably, allowing the military to take control of Rio for up to 10 months raises pertinent questions about the health of Brazil’s democracy some three decades after the end of the country’s military dictatorship: Since his announcement, there has been open worry in Rio and across Brazil that Temer’s military intervention could be a test run for more aggressive military involvement in policing and public security in the future. And Temer’s escalation in policing is happening in a state with one of the deadliest police forces in a country with one of the world’s deadliest police forces. It’s folly, human rights groups and security experts say, to think the move will do anything but add to the bloodshed and put the lives and rights of Rio’s poorest and most vulnerable residents at even greater risk.“It is the equivalent of a public-policy ‘Hail Mary,’ and the results are far from certain,” said Dr. Robert Muggah, a co-founder of the Igarapé Institute, a Rio-based public security think tank. “There is a real danger of militarizing public security in Rio de Janeiro even further.”In 2016, Brazil law enforcement killed more than 4,200 people. Rio’s police, meanwhile, are among the deadliest even by the country’s standards. Police there killed 925 people in 2016, a 43 percent increase from the year prior, and an amount roughly equal to the number of people killed by police in the U.S. in the same year, even though the American population is nearly 20 times larger than the Rio state’s. The number of people killed by police in Rio likely topped 1,000 for 2017.The violence has taken a toll on police officers, too. In 2016, more than 400 officers died on duty across Brazil, and police deaths rose 34 percent, to 132, in Rio state. But the vast majority of the victims of violent crime and homicide in Rio and across Brazil ― both by police and otherwise ― are not Carnival-going tourists or middle-class people, but the poor and mostly black residents of favelas, the informal, impoverished neighborhoods that have suffered decades of government neglect and are often controlled by drug gangs. Black Brazilians are 23.5 percent more likely to die in homicides than members of other racial groups, and more than three-quarters of the victims of police killings in 2016 were black.Sending in a military that has little training in urban policing and virtually no time to plan for the complexities of Rio and its favela neighborhoods may only exacerbate those problems, human rights groups warn.“The decision of the federal government to intervene in the state of Rio de Janeiro´s public security ... reinforces mistakes that have already been made in the past,” Jurema Werneck, the executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, said in a statement. “Rio de Janeiro state has already experienced actions of the Army, none of which have reduced homicides and aggravated human rights violations. The possible 10 months [of] federal intervention puts at risk mainly the lives of those living in the favelas and peripheries, [especially] black youth.”The military has indeed proven unable to bring such areas under police control in previous, less-sweeping interventions.In June 2015, the Brazilian army ended a 14-month occupation of the Complexo da Maré ― a sprawling favela network that is home to an estimated 140,000 people ― having done almost nothing to root out the drug gang that controls it or to curb the violence that plagues the daily lives of its residents. And last year, the military helped Rio police lock down Rocinha ― the largest of Brazil’s favelas ― after a sustained period of shootouts between police and rival drug gangs. The army left two weeks later with Rocinha still ringing with gunfire.That has led to widespread opposition from favela residents and organizations that work within the neighborhoods. Over the weekend, they started an opposition campaign on social media that branded the intervention “a farce.”“In our history, we’ve had one soldier for every 55 inhabitants, but we never had a doctor or a teacher for every 55 inhabitants,” said Gizele Martins, a journalist and community activist in the Maré favela. “We suffer with war tanks at our doorstep. Imagine having your house being searched everyday. [We have] many cases where people get murdered.”“Now Rio is suffering again with military intervention,” Martins added. “So we that live in the favelas and the peripheries of Rio are completely opposed [to military intervention], because we suffer more than everybody.”The way to curb the violence, human rights groups and favela residents argue, is not further military intervention, but comprehensive policies that would provide resources like education, health care, infrastructure and economic opportunities that the neighborhoods have long lacked.“The public security crisis is structural,” Werneck, of Amnesty International, said. “Its not by increasing the number of weapons, militarization nor the continuation of the ‘war on drugs’ that we’ll overcome it.”Jean Wyllys, a Rio congressman from the leftist Socialism and Freedom Party, echoed that sentiment on Twitter.“The attack on public safety problems goes far beyond a police organ,” Wyllys said. “It goes through urban policies, the reaffirmation of citizenship of the most vulnerable populations, change in drug policy, improvement in public education and the end of underemployment.”Political leaders in both Rio and Brazil, though, have had little interest in such efforts. The last major initiative aimed at reducing crime in the favelas ― a program called “pacification,” originally launched in 2008 ― collapsed shortly after the Olympics thanks to budgetary shortfalls. Once intended to deliver major social programs and reforms to the favelas, the primary legacy of pacification was instead widespread police corruption, an increase in violence and homicides (including those committed by police), and the further stigmatization of favela residents as little more than poor criminals.And since he assumed office after the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff in 2016, Temer has pushed austerity policies that have cut health, education and welfare programs that once helped many of Brazil’s poorest residents escape poverty. Rio state Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezão and Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella, meanwhile, “have shown little interest or appetite in developing and implementing a serious public security agenda” amid the outbreaks in violence, Muggah said.And so Rio gets what it got on Friday, a decision based not in responsible or meaningful public policy, but in politics.Temer has spent the last year pushing an unpopular overhaul of Brazil’s public pension system, and some have speculated that he is using the military intervention as a political smokescreen to distract attention from that legislation while he plots a path forward on how to pass it.Meanwhile, polls have shown that violence and public security are among the chief concerns of voters heading into general elections later this year, when Brazilians will choose Temer’s successor. Temer won’t be a candidate for president, but with approval ratings that have languished in the single digits for more than a year, the intervention is an opportunity to show that he and the parties within his governing coalition are willing to adopt the tough-on-crime stance many Brazilians say they want.But Temer’s plan also carries substantial risk, even beyond the most immediate human rights concerns, by creating a political vacuum for those advocating for even more aggressive methods. Rio congressman Jair Bolsonaro, for instance, has emerged as a popular presidential candidate on a platform of giving Brazilian police more leeway to shoot and kill criminals. Bolsonaro, a former army parachutist who has previously praised Brazil’s military dictatorship, blasted Temer’s intervention plan, suggesting that the military likewise won’t have enough latitude to conduct the sort of all-out war he believes the country needs to wage.“Everyone says we’re at war. Rio is at war. But what kind of war can only one side fire?” Bolsonaro asked in an interview with a Brazilian web site, suggesting again that the police and military need more impunity to shoot and kill.Polling in recent years has also shown increasing support for the idea of returning to military rule — a 2015 poll showed that 47.6 percent of Brazilians saw a military intervention as justifiable under certain circumstances of major governmental corruption, and support for democracy is among the lowest in the region — and Bolsonaro’s star continues to rise in pre-election surveys, largely on the back of his public security platform. So if Temer’s plan fails to reduce the violence, as it most likely will, the continued lack of a true strategy could further exacerbate the problem and the risk to the lives and human rights of poor, black Brazilians like those that populate Rio’s most dangerous areas. “Putting the army in charge may win some votes in the short term,” Muggah said. “But the potential long-term consequences are exceedingly dangerous.”"

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) later this year after 42 years in office.Romney is expected to be a popular candidate in Utah, where he is remembered as the man behind the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he also enjoys strong support among Utah’s large Mormon population.However Romney, 70, was one of the most outspoken Republican critics of Trump during the 2016 election, and he bashed the then-candidate as a “phony” and a “fraud” after Trump failed to denounce white supremacists. Romney later said he couldn’t vote for him or his rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, saying he wished Americans “had better choices.”“I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle, and I only hope and aspire we’ll see more greatness,” he said in March 2016.Trump fired back his own barbs, saying Romney “choked like a dog” during his own bids for the presidency. Some of that tension appeared to wane after reports that Trump was considering Romney to be his secretary of state, but the president has reportedly remained wary of Romney’s allegiances and lobbied heavily for Hatch to run for re-election rather than retire. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told The New York Times on Friday he couldn’t imagine why Trump wouldn’t endorse Romney, despite the duo’s history.“We don’t want to lose the seat, and this looks like a pretty formidable candidate,” he said, noting that Romney’s prestige would allow him to “come in here with a level of national identity and respect that will make him effective from Day 1.”During his candidacy announcement on Friday, Romney delivered some pointed critiques of lawmakers in Washington, D.C., including an overt attack on Trump’s restrictive immigration plans.“Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world,” he said during his speech, noting the state “has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington.”"

Content exclusive to the streaming service will focus on hosts’ opinions and give viewers a chance to interact in some way with big network personalities. They will also be given access to “exclusive events,” but the network released few details about how the service will work. The cost of Fox Nation will be announced at a later date, the network said. Viewers will not need a cable subscription to access it. The announcement comes days after the network’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, announced quarterly profits that beat Wall Street estimates. The earnings were helped in part by increases in the fees it collects from cable and satellite distributors. Those earnings come in spite of a number of scandals that have rocked the network in the last year, including the departure of longtime host Bill O’Reilly after several of his female colleagues came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment.

85,POLITICS,House Democrats Just Had Their Best Ever January Fundraising Haul,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dccc-breaks-january-fundraising-record_us_5a8b213ae4b00bc49f47587a,The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $9.3 million.,2018-02-20,"Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, touted the group's January fundraising numbers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8b21c02000004d00eaf553.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Tuesday that it had raised $9.3 million last month, the largest ever January haul for the campaign arm of House Democrats.Of that total, the DCCC raised $3.4 million online in average donations of $18, a figure that points to enthusiasm among grassroots activists in addition to well-heeled donors.The January numbers reinforce early signs of Democratic excitement that bode well for the party’s performance in November’s midterm elections.“Our long run of record-breaking fundraising has been fueled by an energized and motivated grassroots base that is working every day to take back the House,” Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), chairman of the DCCC, said in a statement. “The huge size of the House battlefield, combined with incredible candidate recruitment and candidate fundraising, is spreading vulnerable Republicans thin and forcing them to fight for every inch.”The DCCC’s January fundraising total increases its cash on hand to $43.8 million, compared with $33.2 million it had at this time in 2016.But the party has a tough task ahead if it hopes to flip the 24 GOP-held seats needed to take back the House of Representatives.The DCCC, buoyed by voter discontent with President Donald Trump and a slew of Republican retirements, is casting a large net. The campaign arm announced earlier this month that it is investing in races in 101 GOP-held districts, including once-safe Republican areas like South Carolina’s 5th district.For its part, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to elect House Republicans, raised record money in an off year in 2017. The total gave it $43.6 million in cash on hand as of the end of December, which at the time was more than the DCCC had.But as Bloomberg reported, a sizable share of the NRCC’s donations came in the form of large checks not subject to the same contribution limits. These donations, which reach as high as $101,700 a piece, cannot be used toward federal elections. As a result, the NRCC had $20 million in cash that could not be used for electoral purposes.Republicans still enjoy the support of super PACs and other outside groups that can fill gaps left by party fundraising. These outside groups potentially have the power to fundamentally alter the dynamics of key House races. One such contest is the March 13 special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, which Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points but where Democrats are putting up a serious fight. Democrat Conor Lamb has proven a more adept fundraiser than Republican Rick Saccone, but the latter has benefitted from the largesse of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), and Ending Spending, another outside conservative group.DCCC chairman Luján acknowledged this factor in his statement celebrating the January fundraising numbers.“We’ll need every penny in the face of an unprecedented flood of outside Republican money, and there’s certainly more work to do,” Luján said."

The administration insisted that the legislation was already working by “deterring Russian defense sales,” making additional action on Trump’s part unnecessary.Critics have questioned the administration’s logic.“The State Department claims that the mere threat of sanctions will deter Russia’s aggressive behavior. How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that’s already underway? It just doesn’t make sense,” Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters in January.Reporters on Tuesday also questioned why Trump has not directly called out Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead blaming former President Barack Obama for failing to prevent Moscow from interfering in the U.S. election.Trump “has been tougher on Russia in the first year than Obama was in eight years combined,” Sanders said, adding that the president has done “a number of things ... to be tough on Russia.”"

It follows 16-year-old Rhiannon (played by Angourie Rice), whose life takes an unexpected turn when she falls in love with a mysterious soul known as A, who appears as a new person by inhabiting a different body each day.In translating the book’s central conceit for the big screen, director Michael Sucsy cast 15 different actors in the role of A, allowing the character to appear as male, female and transgender over the course of the film, which opens Friday.Paranormal circumstances aside, A and Rhiannon face the same challenges as most young, real-life couples. Both must let themselves be seen for who they are, and not be defined by what others think of them as, in order to experience true love.Levithan, whose list of works include 2003’s Boy Meets Boy and 2013’s Two Boys Kissing, spoke with HuffPost about bringing his “extremely queer” story to the big screen, and shared his current picks for the best LGBTQ-inclusive books for young readers.As an author, your creative job is done when the book gets published. What was your reaction to seeing your work on the big screen?Levithan: It’s one thing as a novelist to describe a character in all these different bodies, but it’s another to actually see all these actors bring that character to life so seamlessly. It was extraordinary to see that conceit carried through so beautifully in the film.The director, Michael Sucsy, encouraged the cast to read the entire script and not just their part. They had to understand who A was in all of the scenes in order to do their own scenes. There was a very concerted effort to make sure everybody knew each part of the character.Below: Ian Alexander, who identifies as trans, is one of 15 actors to portray A. Many of your books have dealt with LGBTQ themes. To what extent do you consider ‘Every Day’ to be a queer story?I think it’s an extremely queer story. It’s about self-definition. It’s certainly about being agender, as well as aracial ― A’s name is a nod to that, in fact. A’s sensibility is, hopefully, something that’s very relatable to queer readers ― and to queer viewers now, too.The ‘Every Day’ movie will introduce your work to a whole new audience. Who do you hope comes to see the movie?One of the most amazing things about the book’s life, so far, is because of its paranormal conceit, a lot of people who would not otherwise gravitate toward a queer story come around to it. I hope the movie has that effect, too. I’d love young queer viewers to see themselves in it the same way that young queer readers have seen themselves in my book. I hope non-queer viewers will start to question the notion of gender and how we’re defined by our bodies after seeing the movie, too.When you first wrote Boy Meets Boy in 2003, queer books for young readers were rare. Since then, a number of LGBTQ authors have emerged and written books specifically for young audiences. Which are your favorites?I love so many of them! Will Walton has a book coming out this summer that I edited called I Felt a Funeral, in My Brain, which is this incredible prose-poetry novel about grief, loss and having an alcoholic mother. It’s unlike anything I’ve read before. It has a queer sensibility, but it’s not about being queer.I think Billy Merrell’s Vanilla, which is about two boys who’ve been dating since eighth grade who get to their high school years and sex comes into the equation and throws them off, is brilliant. Probably my favorite queer book of the past couple years is Nina LaCour’s We Are Okay, which just won the [Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature]. That was astonishing ― to see a queer book get the biggest young adult literature prize.As a queer author, do you feel any responsibility to present the LGBTQ community in any specific way through your work?Only realistically. I don’t think queer authors have to write queer stories, and I certainly don’t think queer writers have to write queer stories a certain way. For me, it’s all about trying to find aspects [of queer life] that haven’t been talked about and trying to reach young queer readers while making sure readers [who don’t identify as LGBTQ] feel welcome in my stories as well.“Every Day” hits theaters Feb. 23.

Field upped the ante in her retweet by tagging Rippon, enhancing the chance that the bronze medalist would actually see the post. Though it seemed everyone on the internet saw Field’s extremely conspicuous nudge, Rippon apparently did not. When BuzzFeed on Monday informed the 28-year-old athlete of Field’s move as a wing woman, Rippon seemed completely shocked. He reportedly screamed and applauded her move as “bold.”Rippon then sent a sweet message to Greisman:“Sam, your mom — I admire her,” he said via BuzzFeed. “And I’m sure one day we’re going to meet! So thanks, Mom.”Though Greisman, 30, hasn’t responded to Rippon’s message on Twitter, his heart may be doing triple axels.Before Field blew up his spot on Twitter, Greisman, a writer and director, had professed his fondness for the “sassy, beautiful” Rippon numerous times on Twitter. In one tweet, he says he is “in love with him,” and in another, he bluntly tweeted: “marry me Adam.”Bold seems to run in the family."
