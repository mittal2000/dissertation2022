0,POLITICS,DOJ Threatens To Pull Federal Law Enforcement Funds From 'Sanctuary Cities',Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-sanctuary-cities_us_58fa4c36e4b06b9cb91697e1,"Chicago, New Orleans, Philadelphia and New York City are among the targets.",2017-04-21,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaks during a meeting with the Organized Crime Council and Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Executive Committee in Washington, D.C., on April 18.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa4d612600004500c46fdd.jpeg?cache=INW0V5jeKj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Justice Department on Friday warned nine jurisdictions that they could lose federal law enforcement grants unless they reassure the government that they’ll disclose information on the immigration status of the individuals they arrest.The letters targeted so-called “sanctuary cities” that limit their interaction with federal immigration authorities. The letters were sent to officials in California, Chicago (as well as Cook County), New Orleans, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Miami, Milwaukee and New York City. The letters were authored by Alan R. Hanson, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Justice Programs, which distributes Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant grants that support local law enforcement. They request that the jurisdictions validate that they are in compliance with a federal law stating that “a Federal, State, or local government entity of official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity of official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”Defining a “sanctuary city” is a difficult task, as The Huffington Post has previously reported. The law cited in the letters says jurisdictions cannot restrict immigration information, but doesn’t require proactive disclosure to federal authorities. Policies in some sanctuary cities relate to how the city responds to “detainer” requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with many of the cities refusing to continue to hold individuals who would otherwise be released unless ICE provides a warrant. Police share fingerprints taken at arrests with the federal government, including ICE, so nearly every jurisdiction in the country shares some type of information.The letter states that the grant agreement with the Office of Justice Programs “makes clear” that they must document their compliance no later than June 30, 2017. “Failure to comply with this condition could result in the withholding of grant funds, suspension or termination of the grant, ineligibility for future OJP grants or subgrants, or other action, as appropriate,” the letters reads.The Justice Department said in a press release that many of the jurisdictions were “crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime.” The department cited the rise in murders in Chicago and said New York City ― which has seen record low levels of crime ― “continues to see gang murder after gang murder, the predictable consequence of the city’s ‘soft on crime’ stance.”Many of the cities sent letters were named in a report from the Justice Department’s Inspector General last spring. The report listed the grants that had been received by some of the local jurisdictions that ICE said were not cooperating fully with detainer request: $132 million for California, $4.7 million for New Orleans, $60 million for New York City, $16 million for Philadelphia, $6 million for Cook County and $28 million for Chicago, $10 million for Miami and $7.5 million for Milwaukee.The IG report expressed concerns that city employees were not made “explicitly aware” that their local ordinance did not limit their legal authority to respond to ICE requests. Investigators for the DOJ’s watchdog said they believed some sanctuary city policies “may be causing local officials to believe and apply the policies in a manner that prohibits or restricts cooperation with ICE in all respects.”Pablo Alvarado, executive director of the National Day Labor Organizing Network, said the “DOJ’s attempt to scare local governments” would backfire.“It will likely embolden lawmakers to pass policies that protect public safety, as opposed to criminalize and target large portions of its community,” Alvarado said in a statement. “In California, the CA Values Act, (Deleon, SB-54) does just that. Not only does it limit cooperation between immigration and local law enforcement, but it ensures that state and local institutions do not participate in Trump’s deportation agenda.”This article has been updated with comment from Becerra and with details from the IG report.

1,POLITICS,Why House Republicans Seem Fine Risking Humiliation Again In Pursuit Of An Obamacare Repeal,Sam Stein and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-gop-obamacare_us_58f9f308e4b06b9cb915dada,They need to show they're doing something -- anything -- or else their voter base may crumble.,2017-04-21,Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) speaks about health care reform with House Republicans during a press briefing on Capitol Hill on April 6. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f9f41714000021001b585a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The House Republicans’ zombie health care overhaul bill rose from the dead once more Wednesday night, with moderates and conservatives coming to a tentative agreement on draft language. Immediately, though, it became clear that the new bill faces even tougher odds than the one that was already laid low in the House and that caused no shortage of political damage to Republicans.All of which raises a vexing question: Why are they doing this to themselves again?After all, their first effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act went up in dramatic flames in an embarrassing fashion, raising questions about Speaker Paul Ryan’s ability to manage his caucus, President Donald Trump’s ability to inspire votes, and the viability of the rest of the GOP agenda. It left the Freedom Caucus wounded and at war with the president, while moderates had to suffer an outpouring of intense opposition back home.Since then, Obamacare has only grown more popular and the pathway to its demise more narrow in the Senate. One Republican lawmaker told The Huffington Post that the chances of ultimately succeeding with repeal and replace stood at 25 percent. And that, he acknowledged, was being generous.Congressional Republicans could conceivably look at these odds and decide that it’s in their self-interest to run away ― that the risk of incurring more humiliations, of reminding voters of their political fecklessness, is simply too great. And yet, since the first attempt fell apart, they’ve repeatedly returned to the subject. “I think in their campaign and since the election, they have shown they are not risk-averse,” John Brabender, a longtime Republican operative, said of GOP lawmakers.Those involved in actually crafting a health care bill say they recognize the politics are tricky, if not potentially self-damaging. And because of that they’ve sought to tamp down expectations that something will pass. A senior GOP aide told HuffPost on Wednesday that there was no current agreement to whip votes for the latest measure, let alone any indication the party would have the necessary 216 votes. But aides also insist they have to continue to look for a path forward, in large part because the primary political concern for GOP lawmakers right now originates within their own party and not outside it. Virtually all elected Republicans in Congress pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare during their campaigns ― more or less every day since it became law. To abandon it after one attempt at passage (and a meek three-week effort at that, without even a vote) would be to risk alienating their core voters. “At that point, your base collapses,” former National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis said before March’s planned health care vote was pulled because of lack of support. “All these people out in those town meetings [protesting repeal and replace] won’t vote for Republicans anyway.”And so, the party is pursuing the repeal of Obamacare out of a desire to ― at a minimum ― show it is still in pursuit. This is true of both the White House, where Trump is reportedly obsessed with scoring legislative victories before his first 100 days in office; among outside groups, which worry that any health care failure will beget failures on other conservative priorities (mainly tax reform); and on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are feeling an acute need right now to convince voters that they remain committed to their seven-year legislative objective.The most recent attempt was launched by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, and Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), co-chair of the moderate House Tuesday Group. “They want to be viewed as constructive,” one plugged-in GOP lobbyist said of those recent talks. “The actual vote-getting part is not their problem. It’s good PR. Neither side [conservatives nor moderates] actually speak for any significant bloc of votes.”As long as the bill appears to still be alive, it gives Republicans running for re-election something to point to, the thinking goes. This has been the GOP’s electoral formula for seven years already, so perhaps it can be played on the base through the next election, too. But the politics of Obamacare are shifting in ways that make this calculus more complex. Many people who benefit from the Affordable Care Act happen to be the type of low-income voters that flocked to Trump’s candidacy. And recent polls strongly suggest that Republicans writ large are growing more favorable to the law, now that its namesake is no longer in office. A Public Policy Polling survey from Wednesday showed 27 percent of Republicans supporting it and, more remarkably, just 51 percent opposing it. House aides insist these studies don’t fully capture the political dynamics in which they’re operating. One of the reasons, they argue, that they must continue trying for repeal is precisely because the law is failing in many rural districts ― the type usually represented by Republican lawmakers. “It is not working for a lot of their people,” explained another senior GOP aide, “and they need help.” The problem, though, is that the kind of help needed in rural communities ― greater subsidies, a more generous Medicaid expansion ― are the opposite of what the GOP plan would do. And the proposals the party currently is pursuing have the public and its own members spooked. That apprehension is best reflected in the Senate, where even a conservative like Tom Cotton has pledged to protect the Medicaid expansion in his home state of Arkansas. But it’s also the underlying context of Trump’s routine insistence that he’d prefer to let Obamacare collapse on its own so that Democrats will shoulder the blame and be in a worse negotiating position. Not every Republican subscribes to this theory. In fact, many believe the “let-it-collapse” approach would backfire dramatically. “When I hear people say ‘let it fall apart and implode,’ do they really think they will have the political willpower to let that happen?” asked former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.). “Imagine the news stories. It will focus on how the callous, mean, son-of-a-bitch Republicans aren’t willing to fund whatever. And so and so will be without health care. There is no way Republicans are going to sit back and let this fall apart.” But for all his fear of the politics of inaction on health care, Kingston also recognizes the complexities of acting on it. When he was running for a Senate seat in Georgia in 2014, he was criticized within his own party for suggesting Republicans might consider keeping elements of Obamacare in place rather than taking the entire bill apart. His former colleagues have gradually moved closer to that position. But they aren’t yet ready to fully say goodbye to the concept of repeal and replace. And so, Kingston predicts, they might just do the most congressional thing possible: pass something ― anything ― and let it collapse in the Senate. “I think the way to get it out of the way is to get something to the floor and then blame it on the Senate,” he said. “They just have to.”Any piece of paper will do.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at a Democratic Party rally in Grand Prairie, Texas, on Thursday. In the evening he spoke to a larger crowd in Omaha, Nebraska.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa677714000049001b5a45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"OMAHA, Nebraska ― Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) called on an arena full of Omaha Democrats to get behind the city’s mayoral candidate Heath Mello on Thursday night, passionately appealing for unity hours after national reproductive rights advocates criticized the Democratic Party for backing an anti-choice lawmaker.“Maybe, just maybe, it’s time to change one-party rule in Nebraska. And we can start right here, by electing Heath Mello as the next mayor,” Sanders declared to loud cheers.Well before Sanders delivered his remarks, Mello had responded to the controversy by vowing that he would “never do anything to restrict access to reproductive health care” as mayor, notwithstanding his faith-rooted opposition to abortion ― and history of votes to limit abortion rights as a state lawmaker.But Sanders and Ellison’s decision to stump for Mello well before that clarification underscored a disagreement within progressive ranks about where to draw ideological boundaries, with Sanders arguing that compromising on contentious social issues is the price of building political power outside the liberal coasts.Ironically, enduring charges of progressive betrayal allowed Sanders to showcase his pragmatism and party loyalty on the fourth day of a cross-country “Come Together, Fight Back” tour with Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez in which his own differences with the Democratic establishment have occasionally crept into the spotlight.“We can all be pure. I would love it if everybody in America held my political views,” Sanders said after Thursday’s rally, in a locker room in the Baxter Arena that had been turned into a green room for the evening. “That would be great if 320 million Americans all agreed with Bernie Sanders on every issue. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.” Sanders, who himself has faced accusations of excessive purism from Democratic critics, argued that supporting figures like Mello is an essential part of reviving the Democratic Party in GOP strongholds like Nebraska where Republicans control all congressional seats, the governorship, the legislature and the mayoralty of the largest city.He likened his disagreement with Mello on abortion rights to divergences with other Democrats who supported the Iraq War, major international trade deals and financial industry deregulation.“This is a progressive guy. We disagree on an issue,” Sanders said.The Vermont senator’s team-player tone was a marked contrast with some of the scenes of intra-party dissonance that arose on earlier legs of his national tour with the DNC.A handful of Sanders supporters booed at mentions of Perez’s name at rallies earlier this week in Portland, Maine, and Miami.Then there were the divergent messages of Sanders and Perez themselves. In an MSNBC appearance with Perez on Tuesday evening, Sanders pointedly denied that he was a Democrat, telling host Chris Hayes, “I am an independent.”Asked in the same interview whether he shared Sanders’ ire for the “ruling class of this country, the billionaire class,” Perez avoided the question, pivoting instead to talking points about Democrats winning when they “put hope on the ballot.”Earlier that day, Sanders declared that Georgia Democratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff is “not a progressive,” according to a report in the Washington Post.But by Thursday night, with political writers wondering whether Democrats would ever resolve their “existential crisis,” Sanders was walking back his characterization of Ossoff.“I don’t know a whole lot about Jon. I certainly hope that he wins,” Sanders told HuffPost. “It would be an asset. It would be part of the process of reclaiming the House of Representatives for the Democrats.”Sanders also offered more details about his reasons for not formally identifying as a Democrat. For practical purposes, he has caucused with Democrats since taking office in the House in 1991, and is now a member of the leadership of the Senate Democratic Caucus, Sanders noted.What’s more, given the plurality of Americans who identify with neither of the two major parties, someone like him can help Democrats recruit independents, Sanders argued.“The Democratic Party is going to have to work very very hard to bring those independents into the party, to make the case that the Democratic Party can represent their needs. So having an active independent in the Democratic Senate leadership, I think, is very positive,” he concluded.A key to understanding the kumbaya atmosphere in Omaha is Sanders’ close relationship with Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb.Kleeb backed Sanders in the March 2016 Nebraska caucus, which Sanders won, and a few months later was elected chair of the state Democratic Party on the strength of the Sanders wave. She now sits on the board of Our Revolution, the successor organization to Sanders’ presidential campaign.But Kleeb’s considerable accomplishments as a party chair and grassroots organizer in the state were clearly what impressed Sanders most. He implied that not traveling to Omaha to speak on behalf of Mello would have been an insult to her hard work and success in a state that Donald Trump won by 25 percentage points.“She is great. She is exactly the kind of energy that we need for the Democratic Party,” Sanders said.As founder of the multistate environmental advocacy group Bold Alliance, Kleeb earned progressive accolades for forging a new coalition of traditional green activists, native American tribes, farmers and ranchers to oppose construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The various stakeholders believe the pipeline would threaten vital water sources on its way through Nebraska and neighboring rural states.The enthusiasm and diversity on display at Thursday’s three-hour rally suggests Kleeb has brought some of that creative organizing to her leadership of the state party. The boisterous crowd of 6,000 that arrived to hear Sanders and Mello was dotted with dozens of “Bernie-Mello” signs distributed by the state party. The placards featured the already famous outline of Sanders’ white hair and glasses alongside an outline of Mello’s black hair with black sunglasses. For his part, Mello, who has a sunny disposition, combined a local pitch filled with promises to improve pothole-ridden roads and pursue a “unifying aspirational vision” for the city’s development with an appeal to concerns about the policies of President Trump.“We need leadership that’s also willing to stand up against those in Washington, D.C., who want to trample on our values … values like inclusion and having a mayor who stands with immigrants, refugees” and the LGBTQ community, Mello said, prompting roars from the crowd.Although Sanders was clearly the evening’s biggest draw, many in the crowd also expressed excitement at Mello’s candidacy and the prospect of a Democratic glimmer in an otherwise deep-red state.Myra Jo Bates, 68, a retired marketing professor and volunteer for Mello’s campaign, said that while Mello’s opposition to abortion “bothers” her, “nobody’s perfect.”“I’m excited because he’s different and he’s going to be the mayor of all of Omaha, not just West Omaha, which is what we have now,” Bates said, referring to an affluent part of the city. In fact, Mello’s position on abortion did not come up at all over the course of the rally. The closest any speaker came was a remark by Kleeb implying that the existence of opposing views on abortion is simply a facet of the Nebraska Democratic Party’s diversity.“The Democratic Party is a broad party. We are pro-life; we are pro-choice,” she said, before listing other factions like labor unions and “people that work in corporate America.”At a smaller rally in Grand Prairie, Texas, just outside Dallas, where Sanders spoke earlier in the day, some of the lingering internecine battles were slightly more visible.A group of Sanders supporters briefly broke into a chant of “Berniecrats, Berniecrats” during remarks by Dallas County Democratic Party chair Carol Donovan.Later someone interrupted a speech by Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa to ask if he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the now-defunct 12-nation trade agreement negotiated by former President Barack Obama that was deeply unpopular with the party’s progressive base.“No, I didn’t. In fact, the Texas Democratic Party, at my request, passed a resolution unanimously opposing the TPP,” Hinojosa responded, drawing cheers from the crowd. “Thank you for reminding me of that.”Sanders’ presence on the stump was also reassuring to some of the disaffected Democratic activists and independents who flocked to his candidacy.One of them was Joseph Landemeyer, a bearded 52-year-old who came with his brother from Gainesville, Texas, an hour away, to see Sanders in person.Landemeyer has never identified as a Democrat, but he voted for Obama twice and Sanders in the primary. When it came time for the general election last November, however, he opted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Hillary Clinton was “not of the people,” given her speeches to big banks and her other corporate ties, Landemeyer said.Enlisting Sanders as a prominent spokesman is “a good sign for the Democratic Party. They can’t be old-school values. They have to be new school,” Landemeyer said."

4,WOMEN,Indiana University Will No Longer Accept Athletes With History Of Sexual Violence,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indiana-university-will-no-longer-accept-student-athletes-with-a-history-of-sexual-violence_us_58fa5ba6e4b06b9cb916bb5c,The university's athletic director hopes other Big Ten schools will follow suit.,2017-04-21,The Indiana University Hoosiers run onto the field for a Big Ten Conference game in November 2016. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa5c8914000021001b59fe.jpeg?cache=LpjEvdg800&ops=crop_0_189_3000_1728%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Indiana University is taking a big step toward combat sexual assault and violence against women on its campus.On Wednesday, the university released a new policy banning any prospective student who has a history of sexual assault or domestic violence from joining any of the school’s athletic programs.The policy bars the acceptance of any transfer student or incoming freshman “who has been convicted of or pled guilty or no contest to a felony involving sexual violence..., or has been found responsible for sexual violence by a formal institutional disciplinary action at any previous collegiate or secondary school.”“Sexual violence” under this provision is defined as “dating violence, domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, or sexual violence as defined by the Indiana University Policy on Sexual Misconduct.”Indiana University Athletic Director Fred Glass told IndyStar that the policy was inspired by a similar ban created by the Southeastern Conference in 2015, which includes 14 colleges. The SEC policy bans any school in the conference to accept a transfer athlete with a history of “serious misconduct” ― an umbrella term that includes domestic violence, sexual assault or “other forms of sexual violence.”“It’s something the SEC, with their transfer ban, I think raised the issue generally,” Glass told IndyStar. “We’ve been working on that since that time, in trying to put something together that makes sense for Indiana University.”Indiana University is part of the Big Ten, which includes 13 other schools such as University of Michigan, Rutgers University and Penn State University. “My hope is that [Indiana is] leading in this area, and maybe others will follow with, maybe not the exact same policy, but one that fits their particular institutions,” Glass added. Dan Schorr, the co-leader of sexual misconduct and Title IX investigations practices at Kroll, told The Huffington Post this policy is definitely a step in the right direction when it comes to keeping students safe from perpetrators. “If there’s someone who’s a known public safety threat based on a prior conviction or finding of sexual misconduct, it’s understandable why a school would not want that person to come to their school,” Schorr said. “It’s a rational response, and I think it’s likely that you’ll see other schools follow it.” The one issue Schorr was quick to point out, however, is that campus disciplinary proceedings are often led by people without expertise in handling cases of sexual misconduct, and tend to have a bias toward the university. “It’s certainly something to consider as people look at how ‘campus courts’ are developed because they’re not always conducted by professional investigators and there’s concerns about how well those procedures are carried out,” said Schorr. Indiana’s new policy states that the athletics program is required to do its “due diligence” by running a background check and an internet search on all prospective athletes. Prospective athletes will also be asked about “any previous or potential arrests, convictions, protective orders, probations, suspensions, expulsions, or other discipline involving sexual violence or any other matter.”But if the people conducting these aforementioned investigations aren’t experts in the sexual misconduct field, Schorr explained, the policy becomes less useful. “It’s important that whoever’s handling these types of cases has specialized experience in investigating sexual misconduct cases, because they are different than other types of investigations,” Schorr said. “You want someone who’s a trained investigator to really get to the bottom of a prior allegation, rather than someone who doesn’t have investigative experience just asking questions; they might not know what questions to ask.”"
5,WOMEN,Indiana University Will No Longer Accept Athletes With History Of Sexual Violence,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indiana-university-will-no-longer-accept-student-athletes-with-a-history-of-sexual-violence_us_58fa5ba6e4b06b9cb916bb5c,The university's athletic director hopes other Big Ten schools will follow suit.,2017-04-21,View of the interior of Indiana University Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa6dc114000021001b5a64.jpeg?ops=crop_0_188_5184_3101%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Indiana University is taking a big step toward combat sexual assault and violence against women on its campus.On Wednesday, the university released a new policy banning any prospective student who has a history of sexual assault or domestic violence from joining any of the school’s athletic programs.The policy bars the acceptance of any transfer student or incoming freshman “who has been convicted of or pled guilty or no contest to a felony involving sexual violence..., or has been found responsible for sexual violence by a formal institutional disciplinary action at any previous collegiate or secondary school.”“Sexual violence” under this provision is defined as “dating violence, domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, or sexual violence as defined by the Indiana University Policy on Sexual Misconduct.”Indiana University Athletic Director Fred Glass told IndyStar that the policy was inspired by a similar ban created by the Southeastern Conference in 2015, which includes 14 colleges. The SEC policy bans any school in the conference to accept a transfer athlete with a history of “serious misconduct” ― an umbrella term that includes domestic violence, sexual assault or “other forms of sexual violence.”“It’s something the SEC, with their transfer ban, I think raised the issue generally,” Glass told IndyStar. “We’ve been working on that since that time, in trying to put something together that makes sense for Indiana University.”Indiana University is part of the Big Ten, which includes 13 other schools such as University of Michigan, Rutgers University and Penn State University. “My hope is that [Indiana is] leading in this area, and maybe others will follow with, maybe not the exact same policy, but one that fits their particular institutions,” Glass added. Dan Schorr, the co-leader of sexual misconduct and Title IX investigations practices at Kroll, told The Huffington Post this policy is definitely a step in the right direction when it comes to keeping students safe from perpetrators. “If there’s someone who’s a known public safety threat based on a prior conviction or finding of sexual misconduct, it’s understandable why a school would not want that person to come to their school,” Schorr said. “It’s a rational response, and I think it’s likely that you’ll see other schools follow it.” The one issue Schorr was quick to point out, however, is that campus disciplinary proceedings are often led by people without expertise in handling cases of sexual misconduct, and tend to have a bias toward the university. “It’s certainly something to consider as people look at how ‘campus courts’ are developed because they’re not always conducted by professional investigators and there’s concerns about how well those procedures are carried out,” said Schorr. Indiana’s new policy states that the athletics program is required to do its “due diligence” by running a background check and an internet search on all prospective athletes. Prospective athletes will also be asked about “any previous or potential arrests, convictions, protective orders, probations, suspensions, expulsions, or other discipline involving sexual violence or any other matter.”But if the people conducting these aforementioned investigations aren’t experts in the sexual misconduct field, Schorr explained, the policy becomes less useful. “It’s important that whoever’s handling these types of cases has specialized experience in investigating sexual misconduct cases, because they are different than other types of investigations,” Schorr said. “You want someone who’s a trained investigator to really get to the bottom of a prior allegation, rather than someone who doesn’t have investigative experience just asking questions; they might not know what questions to ask.”"

On the day of the ceremony, Brissett posted a photo on Instagram to thank Obama ― whom he affectionately addressed as “Big O” in the caption ― for the inspiration he’s provided to the NFL player and countless other people of color who’ve ever doubted their ability to succeed. “When you were elected President for the first time I was 16 and I watched you make the never-imaginable, attainable and I heard your cry to inspire hope,” Brissett wrote in the post. “I used those words as motivation and saw your achievement as an opportunity and permission to work [to] make my dreams come true too.”“You broke a barrier and a stereotype proving not every minority has to use a ball to make a way,” he continued. “You’ve inspired a lifetime of dreamers young and old. Now, kids from my community – and my future children – will know that there is no dream too big – even they could be the President of the United States.”Brissett also included a brotherly jab at Obama’s basketball skills. “P.S Holla at me to help you with your broke jump shot,” he wrote. We get it, Brissett. We miss him too. "

The 24-year-old suspect then allegedly poured gasoline on a man sitting in a booth near him, then lit matches that he threw at the victim, according to KGW.Officials said unreleased surveillance video shows Swanger running out of the restaurant after a large flash near the victim, who was later identified as 69-year-old Scott Ranstrom. Authorities say Swanger and Ranstrom did not know each other.The victim was taken to a nearby hospital where he is being treated for critical injuries, according to his sister, Leslie Kurtz.“I went to see him and I thought, ‘It wouldn’t be that bad, could it?’ No, it’s worse,” she told KOIN TV. “He’s in critical condition… it’s horrible. Whoever did this is horrible.”A GoFundMe account has been set up to help pay for Ranstrom’s medical bills.Denny’s released this statement about the incident:“We are deeply disturbed by the senseless, random act of violence that took place at our franchised-owned Happy Valley restaurant, and our thoughts and prayers are with our guest that was seriously injured.”Sheriff’s Office spokesman Brian Jensen told The Oregonian that the attack appears to have been random and not a hate crime.However, detectives are investigating whether there is a connection between the Denny’s attack and a similar one that happened Sunday night at a local movie theater during a showing of “The Fate of the Furious.” Swanger was arrested Thursday night at a transitional home a few blocks away from the restaurant, according to KGW.A neighbor who used to live at the home with Swanger saw surveillance video of the suspect in the Denny’s parking lot and believed it was his former roommate. He then called in a tip to the sheriff’s office.The neighbor also told KGW he was surprised by the allegations.“He was really quiet...he stayed to himself,” he said.Swanger is currently in the Clackamas County Jail without bail. His previous criminal history includes charges of robbery, burglary and assault."

Todd Weiler (R), chair of the state’s Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee, said he doesn’t believe the state legislature would find Low’s actions egregious enough to seek his impeachment.“I’m not as outraged as I think some people are, but I am concerned what kind of message that might have sent to the victims because I would never want them to feel discounted in any way,” Weiler said.Low came under intense scrutiny last Wednesday after offering a glowing character assessment of former Mormon bishop Keith Vallejo moments before sentencing him to five years to life in prison for sexually assaulting two women a few years ago.“The court had no doubt that Mr. Vallejo is an extraordinarily good man,” Low told the courtroom as he held back tears, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. “But great men, sometimes do bad things.”Julia Kirby was 19 years old when Vallejo, her brother-in-law, sexually abused her in his house. She said it was “incredibly traumatic” to hear Low praise her attacker. “It’s not only been difficult to try and seek justice, but added on top of that, to have it kind of thrown back in my face and be told that the person who abused me is an ‘extraordinarily great person’ ... did cause a lot of emotional damage,” Kirby said. “It sends a message to victims that even in the justice system, where people are supposed to be the most unbiased, judges will take sides.”Kirby said she plans to file a formal complaint against Low to the state’s Judicial Conduct Commission this week.Low did not return The Huffington Post’s multiple requests for comment.The judge continued to hear cases this week as complaints to the state’s judicial oversight committee continued to trickle in.Weiler, however, said he felt justice had been appropriately served and that the sentence itself was more important than the way Low delivered it.He said he understands why Low’s remarks upset some people, but he believes they might simply be unaware of the “context” of the comments.“[Low] received about 50 letters in support of that defendant,” Weiler said. “Many of the people who wrote those letters were in the courtroom, and I think the judge wanted to acknowledge the fact that he had read those letters and weighed those comments into consideration.”Vallejo’s trial took place in Provo, Utah ― the heart of Mormon country, where at least 90 percent of the population are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Mark Lawrence, the co-director of sexual abuse victims advocacy group Restore Our Humanity, said he “strongly” believes Low empathized with the former LDS bishop.“What we saw this judge do is try to turn the perpetrator into the victim, and it’s not at all uncommon,” Lawrence said. “We just see these same patterns over and over, especially within the LDS Church. And it’s really disturbing.”Kirby left the LDS church years ago, after discovering Vallejo had sexually abused another victim. She said the church’s legal representatives initially discouraged her from reporting her abuse, only offering her public support after one of her family members decided to report the assault to police.The JCC could recommend the state’s Supreme Court issue sanctions against Low, but the proceedings are confidential and wouldn’t be made public until months from now if and when the commission decides to pursue formal action.Restore Our Humanity filed a formal complaint to the JCC on Tuesday, but Lawrence said he isn’t expecting Low to be disbarred. He said he hoped the state’s Supreme Court would sanction him and that he would be encouraged to seek sensitivity training.“[Utah judges] don’t know how to deal with survivors of sexual abuse,” Lawrence said. “Utah has some of the highest rates of sexual abuse in the nation.

A spokesman for the administrative office of the courts said Utah judges are expected to complete at least 30 hours of continuing legal education annually, but he wasn’t able to immediately determine if the required curriculum includes sexual violence trainings.Voters may eventually decide Low’s fate on the bench, though he doesn’t face another retention election until 2020. Until then, Bitton hopes mounting public outcry will pressure Low and other judges to be more mindful of the potentially devastating impact their words and actions can have on victims of sexual assault.“In sexual violence, there is a person whose bodily autonomy, whose sense of self, was taken away,” Bitton said. “Every time someone in a position of authority says something like this, it really perpetuates the rape culture that we have that makes victims responsible for the actions of their perpetrator. ...

Some 600,000 boys and girls have already been forced to flee their homes in the impoverished area of central Congo, where tensions have erupted between government forces and tribal militias.The conflict in Kasaï-Central and Kasaï-Oriental provinces has been escalating since the start of the Kamwina Nsapu uprising last summer. Jean Pierre Mpandi, also known as Kamwina Nsapu, launched a violent rebellion in June to challenge the government of President Joseph Kabila, who refused to step down at the end of his term.Nsapu was killed while leading an attack against state security forces in Kasaï-Central province in August. His militia group, which reportedly includes several fighters under the age of 13, has since intensified its deadly campaign. There have also been reported clashes between other native and non-native groups, fueling ongoing mass displacement.In the past week alone, violence and intercommunity chaos have internally displaced some 62,000 people in the Kasaï provinces, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to 1.09 million, according to the U.N.’s latest situation report for the region.During a recent visit to the city of Kananga in the Kasaï region, Tajudeen Oyewale of UNICEF had the opportunity to speak with former militia members aged 14 to 17.“What was most striking for me was my exchange with the children who have been exposed [to violence],” Oyewale later told The Huffington Post. “They described the fear and the struggle they’re going through to reintegrate back into society now, and the concern of acceptance after leaving the militia.”“I could see in them the aspiration of wanting to be somebody different in life now,” he went on, noting that because of the violent conflict in the region, the teens he spoke to could end up grappling with mental health issues long after the crisis itself has ended. “Having been through what they’ve been through, moving forward remains a challenge.”UNICEF reports that it has secured the release of 384 children who were detained or enrolled in militias in the Kasaïs, but it says some 2,000 are still being used as fighters.The international rights group also estimates that hundreds of children in the region have been seriously injured by violence, thousands have been separated from their families, and more than 350 schools have been destroyed.Some parents in the Kasaïs have responded by pulling their children out of school, sacrificing formal education for safety, according to local media reports.Just weeks ago, the remains of two U.N. researchers, Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan, and their Congolese interpreter, Betu Tshintela, were found in Kasaï-Central province. They had been investigating widespread allegations of human rights abuses by the Congolese army and local militia groups. The government of Congo blamed their deaths on the Kamwina Nsapu militia. On Wednesday, the U.N. confirmed the discovery of 17 new mass grave sites in Kasaï, bringing the regional total to 40. U.N. investigators have accused the Congolese military of digging some of the graves after killing more than 100 people while fighting the Kamwina Nsapu militia last month. Dozens of children were among the dead.Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the U.N.’s high commissioner for human rights, called on the government of Congo to conduct an independent, transparent investigation.“The discovery of yet more mass graves and the reports of continued violations and abuses highlight the horror that has been unfolding in the Kasaïs over the last nine months,” Al Hussein said. “Should there be no effective national investigation, I will not hesitate to urge the international community to support an investigation by an international mechanism.”UNICEF is calling for $20.6 million to address the crisis. Oyewale said immediate aid is essential to prevent further deterioration in the Kasaïs.“We’ve been able to mobilize some initial funding, but we’re working to upscale [our efforts] quickly,” he said. “Children cannot wait.”"

It’s not exactly clear why Sanders is there ― as he said in an MSNBC interview, he’s not a Democrat ― but presumably because Elizabeth Warren is on her own book tour and nobody knows who Chuck Schumer is, Bernie’s out on the road.In a piece published by NPR, Sanders is reported to have defended his decision to support pro-life Omaha mayoral candidate Heath Mello. That decision earned him a harsh rebuke from NARAL, a pro-choice organization, and distancing from Perez and the DNC as a whole. When asked to explain his decision, Sanders said:“The truth is that in some conservative states there will be candidates that are popular candidates who may not agree with me on every issue. I understand it. That’s what politics is about. ... If we are going to protect a woman’s right to choose, at the end of the day we’re going to need Democratic control over the House and the Senate, and state governments all over this nation. And we have got to appreciate where people come from, and do our best to fight for the pro-choice agenda. But I think you just can’t exclude people who disagree with us on one issue.”Coming from a man who once called himself “an honorary woman,” this statement is incredibly tone-deaf to the real and pressing needs women face regarding reproductive choice. It’s not exactly clear what Sanders’ criteria for good political positions are, given that he openly doubted the progressive credentials of Georgia House candidate Jon Ossoff, a man endorsed by Planned Parenthood.The issue of reproductive choice is not the same as a different perspective on an earmark or funding agricultural subsidies. This is literally a matter of life and death, no matter what side of the political spectrum you’re on (pro-choice people focus on the woman, pro-life people on the fetus). There is no casual disagreement about the issue of abortion.Moreover, in a political climate where women’s reproductive resources are often first on the chopping block when it comes to federal and state funding, it’s clear that the Trump Administration has about as much stake in women’s health as their chief executive has in Sexual Assault Awareness Month: zero. Without careful strategizing and conscientious efforts on the part of Democrats, access to mammograms, vaccines, birth control, and health screenings will disappear entirely. The result will be a movement of women underground, to obtain services that endanger their health, performed by amateurs with no health or safety training that could end up doing permanent damage to their patients. Just because we stop providing these services does not mean people will stop needing them, and the most desperate of people will go to any lengths, even at great personal risk.As unclear as it is what Sanders is actually trying to accomplish or why he’s going about it the way he is, it is obvious that the Democratic Party is being led to a very dangerous place by someone who’s not even a member: a platform that prioritizes the economic insecurity of rural, white men over all others. That’s not to say their needs aren’t important or that the Democratic Party can’t address them better. But in a climate that is so openly hostile towards everyone who doesn’t look like our president, we cannot afford to abandon inclusion for colorblindness.This is not a retroactive reading on the merits of Hillary Clinton, despite what some would have you believe. This is not an unwarranted, unreasonably harsh critique of Sanders either. If he wants to lead the Democratic Party into the future, he needs to get his act together. He’s making zero attempt to even appear remotely tolerant of Tom Perez, or any other Democratic leaders. He’s not even trying to achieve compromise, unless it comes to issues like this when compromise excuses incongruent ideology.I really want to like Bernie Sanders.

These hefty projects invite companies and other groups with something at stake to frantically lobby the government, hoping the legislation can turn in their favor.Eight high-rollers stayed in the top 10 spenders list from last year, with some jostling among the ranks. In addition, AT&T and Novartis joined the top spenders, after being No. 11 and 22, respectively. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Realtors predictably stayed at Nos. 1 and 2, with the business federation spending $24.8 million, almost $2 million more than in the same quarter of 2016, and NAR at $10.2 million, about $2 million less than the first quarter in 2016. (NAR uses a filing method that includes its local and state lobbying, which is part of why it always ranks so high.)The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug companies’ trade group, showed the highest leap in spending by far, jumping 34.9 percent to $8.1 million from just under $6 million in the first three months of 2016. That catapulted the trade group from No. 5 a year ago to No. 3 now — and it was the biggest-spending quarter for the organization since the start of quarterly reporting in 2008.A PhRMA spokesperson declined to discuss the surge in the group’s efforts. But after drugmakers came under harsh criticism from GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump (who said they were “getting away with murder“) as well as many in Congress in 2016 for its pricing policies, the trade group in January began spending tens of milliions of dollars in a “Go Boldly” television ad campaign touting industry breakthroughs in science and indicated it would mount an extensive lobbying campaign. Its new lobbying report indicates it weighed in on a wide range of issues, including provisions dealing with intellectual property, reimportation, the drug approval process, nominations to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration, opioid abuse and more. It also showed that PhRMA had hired six new lobbyists, though several others are gone.Once in office, Trump met with CEOs of major drug firms, as well as the CEO and six board members of PhRMA. In a statement after the meeting, CEO Stephen Ubl wrote “We need to reform existing laws and regulations that are currently preventing private companies from negotiating better deals and paying for medicines based on the value they provide to patients and our health care system.”PhRMA, the American Medical Association and Blue Cross/Blue Shield seem to historically compete for spots three through five, and this quarter was no different, with all three focusing resources on the Obamacare overhaul, among other topics.The American Medical Association rejected Congress’s attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act, stating the changes to Medicaid would threaten coverage and make it difficult for states to act nimbly. “And critically, we urge you to do all that is possible to ensure that those who are currently covered do not become uninsured,” wrote James Madara, the CEO of the trade group, to Congress.Health insurance group Blue Cross also wrote to lawmakers in March that the proposed repeal-and-replace Obamacare bill could lead to huge losses in coverage by reworking Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement program, and asked to drop the “premium surcharge” for those who let their insurance lapse.Dow Chemical increased its first quarter spending by 9.3 percent, investing $450,000 more in the first three months of 2017 than the previous year. Some of that may due to trade association dues related to lobbying, which must be reported. But Dow has made itself heard on policy issues in recent weeks: The chemical company sent letters to three federal agencies asking the Trump administration to ignore government studies that found a family of pesticides made by Dow are harmful to critically threatened species, saying the studies are flawed. That appeal came after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt rejected a petition asking the agency to ban all uses of Dow’s chlorpyrifos pesticide, one of those critiqued in the studies. Dow also listed lobbying on its proposed $130 billion merger with DuPont, one of the world’s largest chemical companies, which faces regulatory hurdles. The possible union, announced at the end of 2015, is due to encounter close scrutiny, and a little lobbying on mergers never hurts.And Dow is working hard on being cozy with the new administration: The company gave $1 million to help fund Trump’s inauguration, and its CEO Andrew Liveris leads a manufacturing working group in the White House. (Liveris also got the pen Trump used to sign an executive order that looked to cut back government regs.)Surprisingly, some of the biggest stakeholders in a controversial congressional resolution that Trump signed didn’t expend more this quarter than the equivalent period last year. SJR 34 blocked a Federal Communications Commission rule that intended to ban Internet service providers from selling consumer data (like your browsing history and even sensitive info) to others. Trump overturned the rule, which had not yet taken effect, using the Congressional Review Act, which also blocks other rules on internet privacy from being issued. (Here’s more detail on how this came to be and where industry money went to those who voted for the resolution.)ISPs such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon clearly had skin in the game, but that wasn’t evident from the spending shown in their lobbying reports. AT&T (always a top lobbying spender and No. 8 in the first quarter) only spent $100,000 more in 2017’s first three months compared to the same timeframe in 2016. (Though AT&T ranked No. 11 last year this quarter, so the company did increase among the ranks.) Comcast saw no change, and Verizon actually decreased its spending, from $3.6 million to $2.9 million. All three of the companies in various ways listed internet privacy as a topic of concern.For more on how these persuasive powerhouses have shifted their spending over the years, check out our chart below: Senior researcher Dan Auble contributed to this report.

He consistently earned $4,000 (USD) annually growing grapes known locally as “the bride’s finger” for their elongated, plump sweetness.“It’s what my father and grandfather did, and I learned from them,” Hafizullah said while sitting in his garden surrounded by desperate-looking plants, the dry earth cracking beneath him. He also learned an important proverb from his elders: “Let Kabul be without gold, but never without snow.” The water to irrigate his fields comes from melting snow. In 2015 and 2016, there wasn’t a single flake, and for the past two years, drought has devastated his crops. The lack of water – and the fungal disease it caused – has suffocated the grapes and covered the leaves in mold. In 2016, he earned just $600 (USD), a ruinous 85 percent drop in income. Enter Hafizullah’s two daughters. Maryam, 23, and Goldasta, 24, are the only girls in their family to have ever gone to school, and they are the first in their family – male or female – to graduate from high school. That education led to opportunity when a girls’ school opened in their village. Today, they are both teachers at the Zabuli Education Center, and their salaries are helping their parents and five siblings survive.“[What if] my daughters didn’t work? I can’t imagine it,” Hafizuallah said.This perspective, experts say, is key to understanding one of the newest and biggest ideas in global development: Girls’ education may be a magic bullet when it comes to solving issues related to climate change. “The conversation is dominated right now by climate scientists, oil and gas – the usual suspects,” says Christina Kwauk, a girls’ education postdoctoral fellow at The Brookings Institution’s Center for Universal Education. “For actors who aren’t thinking about education, it’s hard for them to see the connection to climate. But it’s there.”According to the United Nations Environment Program, climate change is a real and present danger in Afghanistan, and “the poorest people, particularly subsistence farmers and pastoralists … are those who suffer most.” Experts say today’s drought is climate-induced and that there’s every indication that the future will be worse. Temperatures in the country are expected to increase more than the global average, with projections as high as 4 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050 and 11 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.Without serious adaptation and disaster risk reduction, climate change will send the country’s already-fragile economy and security spiraling, UNEP says.“When we’re talking about climate adaptation or mitigation,” Kwauk says, “girls’ education has to be part of the conversation.” It’s critical, she says, for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which was unanimously adopted by the 193 U.N. member states in 2015. In it, there are 17 goals to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change.“We’re looking at girls’ education as the way to achieve multiple sustainable development goals,” says Kwauk. “It is innovative. Who would have thought that you could tackle very different seemingly unrelated goals through girls’ education?”It’s a question that Hafizullah and his family have already answered.

I never heard him speak ill of anyone. He was also a Jewish man and I always just assumed that he had witnessed enough anti-semitism, racism and gender inequality in his time to see the silliness in it all.... peoples need for otherness. A need that says I may not be great but I’m better than him, her or them.... the other. Usually, the weaker folks feel about themselves the greater the need for the other. Unless you were the other. In those cases you were hip to it all, had faced the stiff jawed icey look of false superiority, fought it, bore it or silently withdrew in a peaceful warrior mode that saved itself for another time. My dad was a good guy, quiet and thoughtful. He knew better. I always just assumed that he came down on the side of judging a man or woman by the color of their character, not their skin. I always just assumed....One day driving through town, dad spotted a black man and white woman walking down the street together, obviously and by their body language a couple. Dad saw me see him see them. He glanced over and said Black and White Cookie* and that was the end of it. But in that one moment, that one glance and those four words I knew that my assumptions about him were wrong. There was a mocking disapproval in dad’s look and voice that let me know he too needed the concept of the other to make him feel bigger, better and more powerful.Before I was Dr. Robert I was an up and coming musician and recording artist in L.A....I was a contender. One of the great acts I was in was called The Balding Brothers, a seasoned bare bones 4 piece that could rock the house. We all had BBros names. There was Tank Barstow on bass, Larry Jones guitar singa superba, Tommy D beating the drum and me Butch Balding or Butchie B. And while we loved writing a good love song we also recognized the artist’s job of mirroring the world; musical food for thought with a melody and a beat. A tune we felt particularly strong about was one called Living in the Darkness, a same as it ever was tale of the other. This was several years before Rodney King and the L.A. riots but we were street enough guys to know, to understand the unspoken codes of separation and where the lines of otherness were drawn. So when years later, a video beating surfaced highlighting otherness and then a trial consummating the deal concluded with a firestorm to mark the occasion, we were not surprised.Much has been written and re-written about those times so that there is no need for further comment here. However, it does seem natural and right to present that tune here for your listening pleasure. Tank, forever holding down the bottom, was kind enough to go into the public domain and find some footage to accompany the audio. So, and without further ado:Living in the Darkness (c)1982 The Balding BrothersThere’s a part of the city where the white man never goes Down in the projects it’s the land of the negro Gangs rule there with their own unwritten law Police speed through you know they know the scoreTired of the justice they got in the white folks’ land Where your color and your pocketbook’s the measure of a man They gave up and formed their own state and being whites’ illegal in that place Living in the darkness waiting for a change wondering if the sun will ever shine againOh no its a cryin’ shame   Oh no in the USAthe words for which we stand don’t stand for every man When you take a lion and put him in a cage remember in that cage he’s still a king so if you forage in there you might feel his rage especially if its you that put him inBlack and White Cookie*: an oversized cake like cookie covered half and half with vanilla and chocolate icing, usually found in your favorite Deli.Dr. Robert Lusson is a licensed clinical psychologist currently living and working in Los Angeles, Ca.

Jeffreys continues making socially conscious rock ’n’ roll, as heard in this exclusive/premiere, his cover of The Velvet Underground’s ""Waiting For The Man.""A Conversation with Garland JeffreysMike Ragogna: Garland, your new album 14 Steps To Harlem features your cover of The Velvet Underground’s “Waiting For The Man,” premiering today. You were friends with Lou Reed going back to your days together at Syracuse University, so I’m assuming you recorded it as a tribute to him. But why did you record that song in particular and were you ever concerned that you might get grief from comparison with the original version?Garland Jeffreys: I didn’t even think about getting grief until you said it! I’ve done covers over the course of my career—“96 Tears” and “What Does It Take” for example—and I always try to be as respectful as I can of the artist who did the original. The recording of “Waiting For The Man” evolved out of doing the song live. The band and I have really enjoyed playing it over the last couple of years and it just felt natural to record it. Overall, I think I’ve given the song my feel, my vocal sensibility and swing, and I have a feeling Lou would have dug it. It feels like a “tribute” somewhat after the fact rather than having been a focused intention in the recording.MR: Did you discover anything about the song itself when you recorded it, maybe yet another interpretation or deeper meaning that wasn’t as obvious in its original framing? Through the production, what were you trying to achieve?GJ: More than a deeper meaning, I discovered the narrative of it, how it so richly describes the journey to get to the end goal! Also an appreciation of the visual detail in the song, especially in the lines “Here he comes, all dressed in black / PR shoes and a big straw hat”—very concise and direct but vaguely menacing. We did it in one take, much the way we do it live, and used a kind of honky-tonk piano sound [Charly Roth] and the down and dirty Stratocaster [Mark Bosch] to give it the funk.MR: What other boundary pushing did you attempt on 14 Steps To Harlem? What were the sessions like and do you feel the project affected your creativity going forward?GJ: The sessions were a bit unusual for me. Some takes just flew along with ease and other times there was a lot of tinkering and even some frustration. Co-producer James Maddock encouraged me to do more of the “talking” and improvising in the vocal booth, especially on “14 Steps To Harlem” and “I’m A Dreamer.” It was something of a boundary breaker to record “Time Goes Away” with my daughter Savannah since we’d never really given it much weight over the years but we knew the day would come. She’s a fantastic singer songwriter herself. The song was somewhat fragmentary beforehand but I love the vibe of it, the sadness and the almost nursery rhyme simplicity. Going forward, I think I’ve learned that I can go in with a song that’s not entirely realized and come up with something not quite what I envisioned, but maybe even better. I learned more deeply that some songs are already complete even though imperfect and yet somehow, therefore, more true.MR: Your albums tend to have a theme or unifying element. What is this album’s mission?GJ: The themes of some records only come forth when they’re complete. This one has most of my usual preoccupations: the outrage over racial discrimination on “Colored Boy Said;” the love for my hometown and its incredible variety on “14 Steps To Harlem,” “Reggae On Broadway” and “Waiting For the Man” are all New York City songs; the influence of family and the love for my wife on “Spanish Heart” and “Luna Park Love Theme”—also New York! So if there is a mission, it’s just that I’m continuing to write and sing about the things that matter to me and hopefully to some other people too. Perseverance is the be all and end all.MR: Beautiful. Back in February, you released a video for the album's title track. Having had as full a musical career as you’ve had, how do you approach creating and recording music these days versus when you started out?GJ: Well, of course, it’s different because Luna Park Records is my own label. I’ve been with nearly every major label over the last 45 years, and it’s been great to control the process myself over the last three records. That said I still approach creating and recording the exact same way. I write on the acoustic guitar and record demos and ideas on cassettes and snippets of paper. Then it’s time to cull through everything and separate the wheat from the chaff. Very laborious and my wife and manager Claire is a huge help with that process. A couple of these songs were laid down on cassette just once and we had to really honor that iteration and try to coax more from it. Others had many variations and were more complete and we had to find the best feel to suit the song.MR: You as the artist, what do you feel are some of your best accomplishments on 14 Steps To Harlem? And was this a more personal step forward considering some of the songs’ topics?GJ: I am proud of the record overall and consider it one of my best and very true to me at this point. I’m channeling my great love for Van Morrison in the phrasing of “Venus” and didn’t even notice it until later. I also love the production on “When You Call My Name.” James Maddock had a lot to do with that, making it very Brit synth. And of course I love the duet with Savannah and the generosity and sweetness of Laurie Anderson to play such soulful violin on the closing song.MR: I hope you don’t mind my asking but what was your reaction to Lou’s passing and does it still affect you?GJ: Naturally, I was deeply affected by it. When you’ve known someone that long it’s hard to fathom the world without them in it. I had seen him not that long before he passed and he seemed especially grateful and hopeful and even on the rebound. I miss him. Laurie has kept his spirit and his legacy alive in countless ways, both public and private, and that’s a lovely thing. All his friends miss him terribly. He was a force. I was especially happy that his archives went to Lincoln Center, here in his hometown.MR: How are you enjoying New York these days and how do you think it’s doing?GJ: I will always love New York despite the way it seems to be losing itself at times to the world of money. It will always be the greatest city in the world for me. I can’t ever criticize it with any real conviction! We were just on a tour in Europe and after a week I couldn’t wait to get home and walk around the streets, chatting up the older ladies outside my building in Stuyvesant Town, getting a bagel, the newspaper from the corner store—these are the things I’ve been doing all my life and they never get old.MR: Garland, your albums Ghost Writer, which earned you a Best New Artist nod from Rolling Stone, plus the Lou Reed/Rumour/E Street Band populated Escape Artist, and your socially-conscious Don’t Call Me Buckwheat and other projects helped make you a critic’s favorite. As the artist behind those projects, did that kind of reception affect how you approached projects, like adding extra pressure for even higher integrity or creative achievement on each project?GJ: Interesting question. Before going into the studio, there is always doubt. But I’m not thinking about my reputation or how critics might or might not respond. I’m asking myself: is it good enough? Are the songs up to my standards? Do I still have what it takes? But despite those questions you just go in there and do it, and hope for the best. The only real pressure these days is time. As I say in the song “Time Goes Away,” “...time goes away, till you don’t have many, till you don’t have any.”MR: What are your thoughts about some of your older projects? Do you have any personal favorites? And which recordings are you most proud of?GJ: I am most connected to Ghost Writer, Escape Artist and Don’t Call Me Buckwheat. I think they hold up amazingly well. I’m proud of all my work but I think these three are very strong.MR: Are you ever tempted to revisit your Grinder’s Switch approach to music?GJ: If by that you mean a more acoustic, folky song, the answer is yes. Some people listen to that and my first album and have really liked the sound and see a side of me that didn’t continue as I moved on. Food for thought.MR: You wrote a poem for your friend John Cale’s Vintage Violence album that also included your song “Fairweather Friend.” Is there a story behind how he reacted to the poem when he first read it? And what was your reaction to his cover of your original composition?GJ: I can’t remember his reaction. As a matter of fact, I want to connect with him again, so John, if you’re out there—get in touch with me! I loved his cover of the song.MR: What’s your opinion about music coming from newer artists in 2017?GJ: Mixed. Some is fantastic, some is pretentious, some has real heart and some has faux heart, a kind of forced folksiness that I don’t like at all. I have been listening non-stop to Van Morrison’s Keep Me Singing from 2016, so maybe that says it all. His singing on that record is just remarkable.MR: Garland, what advice for you have for new artists?GJ: Perform as much as possible, even when you think the gigs are crap or beneath you. Just go out and play all the time so you get better. You also never know who will be in the audience. Study performers you like and learn from them. What are they doing on stage? Is there something you can incorporate? Be nice to everyone, be humble, and appreciate your fans without being over the top. And lastly, no matter what some manager or label guy tells you, don’t sell your publishing!MR: What advice would you have given yourself when you were starting out?GJ: Find a good, trustworthy manager who gets your music and hold on to them for dear life.MR: What other creative ventures are you currently involved or hope to get to?GJ: We are using PledgeMusic to raise money to make a feature documentary about me. Claire is directing it and we’ve got a fantastic executive producer coming on board. We’ve already done interviews with Harvey Keitel, Graham Parker, Laurie Anderson and the great writer David Hajdu and we’re really excited to get focused on it now that the album is about to release.MR: Are you comfortable with still being considered one of the great singer-songwriters and song interpreters of our time?GJ: May I quote you on that?A Conversation with Virgil Films’ Joe AmodeiMike Ragogna: Joe, you’re currently trying to raise funds on Idiegogo for a documentary about Bruce Springsteen’s Big Man, Clarence Clemons. What inspired you to move ahead on such a project? Joe Amodei: I have been a lover and follower of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band for most of my adult life. The music has been a constant companion through the good and the bad that life throws at you. To be able to work with any of these guys would be an honor so when I read about this film I contacted Nick Mead and the journey began.MR: Did you ever meet him? JA: Yes, in Asbury Park at the Garden State Film Festival where a shorter version of the film premiered to a standing ovation. Director Nick Mead introduced me and it was there that we decided to work together and add more footage and turn it into a feature length film.MR: How did Clarence’s playing affect you? What was it about his creativity or how it fit in with the Bruce Springsteen paradigm? JA: Clarence’s sax had a power to it that I have never felt before or since. It had an incredible emotional tug to it and it matched perfectly with whatever Bruce was singing about. MR: Is there an unknown story or two about Clarence that you discovered during your research that you can share? JA: I did not know him long enough to tell any stories but the one thing that comes up in all of the interviews is his spirituality more than anything. That even overrode rock ’n’ roll. People loved this guy.MR: What are some of your favorite Clarence Clemons performances? Did you like his duet with Jackson Browne, “You’re A Friend Of Mine”? JA: Well, it always begins with “Jungleland” and then you go from there. I’m not sure if it was Clarence’s favorite song but it was the one that fans identified him with. But his solos on lesser known songs like “Heart of Stone” and “Prove It All Night” blow me away even though I’ve heard them a million times. And let’s not forget “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town.” The Jackson Browne song is great too! MR: In the world of pop or jazz sax players, where do you think he fit in? JA: I think he could blow the horn as good as anyone. MR: Have you gotten the thumbs up from the Bruce camp? Will he contribute either on camera anecdotes or some funding? JA: We have been in contact with management as we would love to get Bruce to talk about Clarence but have not heard back yet.MR: What’s the history of Virgil Films and what are some of your other popular releases? JA: This is my first producing gig along with Nick Mead who is also directing. My company Virgil Films has released a lot of great docs over the years including the Academy Award nominated Restrepo and SuperSize Me along with I Am Chris Farley, Glen Campbell I’ll Be Me, Bridegroom and the ever popular Forks Over Knives.MR: What’s your own entertainment history? JA: I started in the VHS days. Have always loved film and have worked for folks like Ted Turner, Scott Greenstein and Barry Diller before going my own way.MR: Instead of going the investor route, you decided to try and fund the doc through Indiegogo. What is it about that crowd funding site that you like best and what’s the plan on how funding will work? JA: The folks at Indiegogo have been great. It’s my first venture into doing this so ask me this question a month from now. But I like the flexibility of Indiegogo.MR: What advice do you have for new or up and coming artists? JA: Just to realize that nothing is easy and in fact is very hard to get made. Do not attempt if you do not have thick skin. MR: What advice do you have for future filmmakers? JA: Follow your dream and never give up buy learn the “business” of filmmaking and not just the creative part. How to get your film seen is just as important as actually making it. MR: What important advice was given to you that either mattered or you passed on? JA: Don’t ever forget your friends and family. Life in this business can get crazy and take you away from them. But they are the only real things that exist. And always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.MR: What will some future Virgil Films projects be? JA: I Am Heath Ledger premiering at this week’s Tribeca Film Festival is keeping us busy these days."

Police say the men planned a ""violent attack"" before the eleciton.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f7e94014000021001b5325.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARIS ― Five days before the first round of the French presidential election, the threat of terrorism has returned to center stage in the campaign for the Elysee.There has been no lack of news on the topic in Europe. Between the November 2015 attack in Paris and the July 2016 attack in Nice, as well as the recent events in London and Stockholm, terrorism has been a core issue. Yet, despite its prominence in the media and public debate, the subject had been virtually absent during the campaign so far.Presidential candidate Francois Fillon said Tuesday at a campaign event in Lille, “There is a topic that has been left out during this campaign, even though it is dramatically making itself known: It is terrorism.” The silence ended dramatically Tuesday when authorities announced the arrest of two young men in the port city of Marseille. Police found guns and bomb materials after arresting the men and said the duo had planned a violent attack ahead of Sunday’s vote. Terrorism was pushed to the background of the campaign amid the various scandals surrounding two of the presidential candidates, conservative Fillon and far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Both candidates share muscular national security views, but their legal challenges shifted much of the debate to the morality of politicians and how the legal cases would affect the candidates.In fact, the candidates hadn’t appeared particularly worried about security at their own campaign events. Earlier this month, a protester managed to pelt Fillon with flour in Strasbourg, while centrist front-runner Emmanuel Macron was egged during his visit to the Salon of Agriculture.

Between the November 2015 attack in Paris and the July 2016 attack in Nice, as well as the recent events in London and Stockholm, terrorism has been a core issue. Yet, despite its prominence in the media and public debate, the subject had been virtually absent during the campaign so far.Presidential candidate Francois Fillon said Tuesday at a campaign event in Lille, “There is a topic that has been left out during this campaign, even though it is dramatically making itself known: It is terrorism.” The silence ended dramatically Tuesday when authorities announced the arrest of two young men in the port city of Marseille. Police found guns and bomb materials after arresting the men and said the duo had planned a violent attack ahead of Sunday’s vote. Terrorism was pushed to the background of the campaign amid the various scandals surrounding two of the presidential candidates, conservative Fillon and far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Both candidates share muscular national security views, but their legal challenges shifted much of the debate to the morality of politicians and how the legal cases would affect the candidates.In fact, the candidates hadn’t appeared particularly worried about security at their own campaign events. Earlier this month, a protester managed to pelt Fillon with flour in Strasbourg, while centrist front-runner Emmanuel Macron was egged during his visit to the Salon of Agriculture. On Sunday, a member of the feminist protest group Femen rushed the stage as Le Pen spoke, even though her security service had been warned of the risk. Far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon has been holding large open-air rallies, even though it’s difficult to ensure security at those events.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making an initial six-figure investment into the Montana state party to back Quist’s campaign, DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly told The Huffington Post. It will be left to the state party and the campaign to decide how best to use the funds, whether on mail, television or door-knocking operations. The spending is in the low six figures, but is unlikely to be the last cash infusion from the national party as attention increasingly turns to the state’s race.Closer-than-expected finishes by Democrats in Kansas and Georgia have left progressive grassroots activists feeling more emboldened than ever, demanding that the national party compete in areas that once seemed impossible. Liberal blogging website Daily Kos and its contributors, for example, have stepped up where reluctant Democrats have not ― sending more than $1 million to help flip an ultraconservative district in Georgia held consistently by the GOP since the late 1970s.Unlike the election in Kansas, where Democrats didn’t jump into the race until the eve of the election for fear of their involvement being used against candidate James Thompson, Quist’s campaign is getting some help more than a month from Election Day.The support doesn’t stop at that. Actress Alyssa Milano will join Quist on the trail next week, she told HuffPost. Milano, who is filming in Atlanta, was active on behalf of Jon Ossoff there. The DCCC is not yet running ads in Montana, but the difference in strategy reflects how much attention the race has already received, and thus less need for worry about support from national Democrats hurting Quist’s campaign. (Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for example, is set to campaign for Quist next month.)The move may also signal Democrats’ eagerness for a win after having fallen short in two consecutive elections, first in Kansas and then in Georgia.The special election to fill the seat vacated by newly appointed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is scheduled to take place May 25.Clarification: Language has been amended to more accurately describe the results of the vote in the recent special election in Georgia.This article has been updated with comment from Milano."
21,POLITICS,Trump Bound For Europe Soon But Still Doesn’t Understand How It Works,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-europe-wrong_us_58f92bcde4b06b9cb91531eb,The president again displays a fundamental misunderstanding of trade and NATO in news conference with Italian prime minister,2017-04-20,"President Donald Trump and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni stand together following a joint news conference at the White House on April 20, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f92cb91b0000330016cad1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Another European leader to the White House, another news conference, and another display by President Donald Trump of at best a hazy understanding of how Europe works.Standing just feet from Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni at a joint White House news conference, Trump complained about unfair trade relationships and other NATO members failing to “pay their full and fair share for the cost of defense.”“We both seek a trading relationship that is balanced, reciprocal ― I love the word ‘reciprocal’ ― because we don’t have too many reciprocal trading partnerships, I will tell you that, but we will very soon,” Trump said.The grievances were common fare during his presidential campaign, and he has been repeating them to varying degrees during previous discussions and news conferences with United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May, Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.And as they were the earlier times he raised them, they are factually incorrect. Italy, like Germany, uses the Euro currency and is a member of the European Community – which works as a trading bloc. It has no specific trade deal with the United States, although one has been under negotiation for years. Britain, while it has its own currency, is also a European Union member, although it is starting to negotiate its departure following the “Brexit” referendum of last summer.All three are members of NATO, which has never collected dues to pay for a common military. Rather, each country pays for its own military and participates in common defense of the entire group. NATO as a group agreed in 2014 – two years before Trump’s election – that each nation would increase its defense spending to at least 2 percent of the value of its economy by the year 2024.Stoltenberg during his recent White House visit explained this in detail, and Trump appeared to accept it. He went on to take credit for the spending policy, and declared that NATO was no longer obsolete and that he would support it.On the issue of trade, Merkel during her White House visit last month pointed out that Germany had no bilateral trade agreement with the United States. On Thursday, Gentiloni didn’t even bother countering Trump’s trade assertions, but did say that Italy would honor its NATO commitments.“We have also spoken about common commitment to NATO and the goals that were identified in 2014, and the commitments on military expenses, and the contribution that each country must make towards collective security,” Gentiloni said. “We are proud of our contribution.”Italy is to be Trump’s second foreign visit as president, as it hosts this year’s G-7 Summit of the world’s largest democratic industrialized nations. Trump is to start his first foreign trip in Brussels at the annual meeting of the NATO alliance on May 25, and then travel to Taormina in Sicily the next day.Trump as a candidate railed against NATO, accusing the other member nations of cheating the United States by not paying their fair share of the costs. He also claimed other nations, including G-7 members Germany and Japan, were taking advantage of the U.S. through unfair trade agreements.Those stances made European and Asian allies wary of Trump, making his remarks and actions during his coming trip of particular interest to political and military leaders in those regions."

Put another way, there are eight female CEOs and 92 male CEOs in the Fortune 100. The average age is 59; they are overwhelmingly white. Somehow, it’s even worse in Europe. Women lead 6 percent of the top 100 companies in the U.K., 2 percent of the top 30 in France, and 1 percent of the top 50 in Germany.The sad state of affairs at the top is a stark sign that gender equality is still more dream than norm. That’s despite all the talk of women resisting, or holding conferences about women, or being promised equal pay (what a privilege!), or just straight-up trying to “lean in.”Sure, Fox News finally got rid of a guy who’d been repeatedly accused of sexual harassment. But it took the men running the company 15 years to get around to it. More women in power typically equals fewer sexual harassers hanging around the espresso machine.Here’s another bizarre indicator of just how little opportunity there is for women at the top: From 2014 to 2016, six women were hired as chief executives at S&P 250 companies, out of 81 appointments, according to a new report from Feigen Advisors. During that same period, eight people who were alumni of PepsiCo. were appointed CEO of S&P companies. So, it’s easier to hire a CEO from a single soda company than it is to find women from literally anywhere to run a top-250 company.OK, so it’s 2017. Women work, and they have been for a while. Women make up more than half of all college graduates, the majority of law students, and 40 percent of managers overall. Why has there been such glacial progress at the highest level?“That’s probably the question of the century,” Bonnie Gwin, a vice chairman at Heidrick & Struggles who recruits CEOs, told The Huffington Post. The answer boils down to discrimination and bias, though Gwin didn’t label it that way. She talked about how companies need to intentionally develop a good pipeline of talented women who would be qualified for the CEO role.  Most of the U.S. companies the Heidrick analysis looked at promote CEOs from within, and they tend to appoint leaders with strong backgrounds in finance and other roles that have profit and loss responsibility. Women still tend not to be in those roles (essentially because of bias ― like how we teach boys they’re better at math).Gender bias and discrimination ripples through the workplace in a variety of ways, starting with very basic things. Picture a CEO in your head and you see a man. Google it. That’s a bias for everyone, including people doing the hiring. Men have been running corporations since the dawn of corporations.There are a lot more dimensions to the bias: Women are judged more harshly in performance reviews, for example. Women are more likely to be interrupted in meetings; more likely to wind up doing menial or invisible tasks for which there’s little reward. Gwin said women tend to leave the workforce at earlier stages in their careers. Often times, women leave to have kids ― either because maternity leave is not a thing, or because they’re penalized for taking it. Or, they leave because of bias at work. That’s especially true in the tech industry, studies have shown.And there’s plenty more data out there about how women are less likely to be mentored for leadership positions by male superiors, some of whom might have Mike Pence-style rules about socializing with women outside the office.Gwin said companies truly do want to do better. “Some companies are taking it more seriously,” she said.That seems true when judged by the number of women’s conferences, reports on gender, and experts from corporate America who pitch themselves as experts on women in leadership. But it’s obviously silly when you look up at the chart.There’s been some chatter recently that all the handwringing over such a privileged sector is trivial, especially now with a White House that seems bent on restricting women’s rights.“The dire threat that women face is not the possibility that women won’t make it into the C-suite,” Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, told Bloomberg recently. “It’s the possibility that we will die from an unsafe abortion.”But these aren’t separate issues. When women leaders are in power, all women tend to have more power. Donald Trump’s White House clearly listens to business leaders ― as have previous administrations. Shouldn’t more of those leaders be women? "

The researchers found that instances of sexual violence and harassment were so pervasive that 1 in 6 of the teen girls surveyed said they had been harassed since Election Day. The report, titled “Let Her Learn: Stopping School Pushout,” was conducted in partnership with Lake Research Partners to pinpoint the reasons why girls drop out of school. Researchers surveyed 1,003 teen girls between the ages of 14 to 18 from across the United States this past January. According to the report, 1 in 5 girls between 14 and 18 years old (21 percent) reported being sexually assaulted ― defined by NWLC as “they had been kissed or touched without their consent.”Girls of color and LGBTQ girls experience sexual assault and harassment at higher than average rates. Twenty-four percent of Latina girls reported experiencing unwanted kissing or touching. Twenty-three percent of Native American girls, and 22 percent of black girls reported experiencing sexual assault. LGBTQ girls experienced the highest incidences of sexual assault, with 38 percent reporting they had been kissed or touched without their consent. The researchers found that 6 percent of all girls surveyed said they had been raped. But, again, those numbers were higher for LGBTQ girls and girls of color: 15 percent of LGBTQ girls, 11 percent of Native American girls, 9 percent of black girls, and 7 percent of Latina girls reported being forced to have sex when they did not want to. These statistics take on new weight given that the president of the United States is an accused sexual predator. According to the survey, more than 1 in 6 teenage girls (or 17 percent) reported that they had experienced harassment since the 2016 presidential election.Many advocates worried that there would be an uptick in violence against women when President Donald Trump took office. Directly after the election, many incidences of sexism and harassment happened, along with an increase in hate crimes. President Trump has been accused of sexually assaulting more than a dozen women, and has publicly defended other men who have been accused of sexual harassment and assault, like Roger Ailes and the recently-ousted Bill O’Reilly. “My concern is based on not just what [President Trump’s] behavior has been, because he is an individual, but what he can do to influence other men’s behaviors and other women’s perceptions of their value,” Rita Smith, the former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, told The Huffington Post in November. “Even just the election itself had an impact on how men treated and talked about women.” “The trauma that girls experience affects not only their mental and physical health but also their ability to concentrate, feel safe, and stay and do well in school,” Chaudhry wrote. “We need targeted policies to help these groups of girls stay and thrive in school, and we owe them no less.” Head over to the National Women’s Law Center to read the full report, which also explores other obstacles young girls face including homelessness, unplanned pregnancy and racism.

In the essay, Biden discussed his organization It’s On Us and how it’s working to prevent sexual assault. “We’re still working on that ― together,” he continues. “And I need your help.”Biden reflected on what it was like to pass the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 and how the law has helped to reduce violence against women. But when he became vice president in 2008, he reviewed the current sexual assault statistics in the U.S. and he was “heartbroken” by what he found.The rate of violence against women was as high as when Biden drafted VAWA. One in 5 women will be sexually assaulted at some point in her college career and 1 in 3 women will be victims of intimate partner violence at some point in her lifetime. So Biden created the It’s On Us organization alongside former President Barack Obama in 2014. Their main goal? Get men involved. “We called on men to step in, at a bar, at a party, in a dorm room, or anywhere they might see a woman being targeted for sexual assault, especially if she is incapacitated by drugs or alcohol or for any other reason is not able to consent,” Biden wrote in Cosmo. “In my view, men’s silence when they see this happening is complicity. We also know that sexual violence happens in LGBTQ communities too. It’s on Us is about changing the culture for everyone.”Students are leading the way in the fight against sexual assault, Biden wrote.“In huge part because of [students],” he concluded, “we are so much closer to a world where no woman will ever blame herself for being sexually assaulted and no man will make excuses for this unconscionable behavior.”Head over to Cosmo to read Biden’s full essay.

About 87 percent of Republicans approve of his performance, several points above the average for previous presidents and similar to the numbers Obama and Bush saw at this point in their presidencies.Rather, Trump’s ratings reflect the near-complete absence of support from Democrats, just 9 percent of whom approve of his performance so far.Americans’ willingness to support a president across the aisle has shrunk dramatically in recent years. This early in their terms, Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter all saw majority support from their opposing party, a feat that seems almost unimaginable in the modern political environment. Even Obama still managed to garner the approval of about 30 percent of Republicans during the first quarter of 2009, while George W. Bush saw a 32 percent rating among Democrats in the first quarter of 2001.Trump’s numbers are also notably weak among independents. Just 37 percent approve of his performance, according to Gallup, compared with 51 percent or more for every other president elected to his first term since Eisenhower.Trump’s “unconventional style suggested his presidency would be like nothing seen before,” Gallup’s Jeffrey M. Jones wrote. “And that has been true, but likely not in the way he or his supporters hoped ― with no honeymoon period to speak of and approval ratings far worse than any president has received this early in his tenure. On his best day, less than half of Americans, 46%, have approved of the job Trump is doing.”Gallup is just one of the pollsters tracking Trump’s approval rating, and its numbers so far have looked slightly less positive than average. But they’re not far off. As of Thursday morning, HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate, which combines publicly available polling, gives Trump about a 43 percent approval rating, with just under 51 percent disapproving. By contrast, in April 2009, Obama’s average rating, though quickly declining from his post-inauguration honeymoon numbers, still stood at just under 60 percent.Gallup surveyed 45,111 adults between Jan. 20 and April 19, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cellphones.Language has been added to clarify that Gallup was looking only at presidents since World War II who were elected to their first terms. Therefore, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford were omitted from the analysis."

Both leaders praised the district, although DeVos did not back down from the idea that expanded school choice options could benefit the area.“I acknowledge and have acknowledged for many months, rural areas face unique challenges and unique opportunities,” DeVos said Thursday, in response to a question about whether school choice would work in an area like rural Ohio. “I think the fear of a negative impact on a school that is meeting the needs of its students is very low, actually.”DeVos said it was evident there was a vibrant learning environment in Van Wert classrooms, but she argued that parents in the area might still appreciate the benefits of school choice. “[In Van Wert], it might be a handful of students who might elect to do something different if they had that opportunity. Perhaps that would be the case. But that would be a choice made by parents,” DeVos said, noting that 20 percent of students in the area already choose to go to schools that are not part of the Van Wert district.Weingarten invited DeVos to visit a public school with her several months ago, shortly after DeVos’ contentious confirmation process. Van Wert is located in a rural area where most students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and where most residents voted for President Donald Trump.Weingarten and DeVos have been deeply critical of one another in the past, but they expressed a mutual appreciation during the Van Wert visit. Weingarten, president of the nation’s second largest teachers union, cited the visit as evidence of DeVos’ willingness to “walk the walk.”“I don’t think we even gave her a duty-free lunch,” Weingarten joked during the press conference. DeVos faced a particularly harsh confirmation process, where a 50-50 vote forced Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie. During this time, Weingarten and her union, the American Federation of Teachers, portrayed DeVos as an interloper bent on destroying traditional public education in order to create a more capitalistic, free-market structure.DeVos maintains that she supports traditional public schools, but also believes parents should be given a menu of options for where they can send their students. At the same time, the proposed U.S. Department of Education budget would make steep cuts to public school programs, while setting aside money for charter schools and a still-nebulous private school choice program.Part of her goal, DeVos said during the press conference, is to diminish federal and top-down intervention in education to give teachers and schools increased autonomy. “We overcomplicate things in many cases and for no specific end necessarily,” she said. DeVos has not had as much communication with the nation’s other major teachers union, the National Education Association. DeVos reportedly called the president of the NEA, Lily Eskelsen García, who sent DeVos a letter in response. The letter demanded clarity from DeVos on issues like special education and LGBTQ students.“Students, parents and educators still want answers for a wealth of concerns based on Secretary DeVos’s destructive record and refusal to commit to ensuring every child in every community has the opportunity provided by a great education at a neighborhood public school,” García said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “NEA raised a number of these issues in my February 14 letter to the secretary and we have not received a response.”"

Local marijuana advocacy organization DCMJ was marking the unofficial cannabis holiday on April 20 ― better known as 4/20 ― by handing out free joints to members of Congress and their staffs. The event was being billed as a ― wait for it ― “Joint Session For Congress.”The scene was a bizarre confluence of buttoned-up Washington politicos and cannabis enthusiasts. Sheepish bureaucrats in pressed khakis presented their official IDs to volunteers as DCMJ officials barked the play-by-play over a megaphone.

Curious Republican staffers kept their distance (”Y’all here to watch the weed thing?”) as volunteers in T-shirts stamped with slogans such as “DOPE NATION” and “Make America Kind Again” handled crowd control.

One activist from Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes cannabis legalization, handed out bags of Cheetos with anti-marijuana talking points stapled to them.Put another way, what transpired Thursday was arguably the year’s foremost gathering of Washington navel-gazers and people who literally gaze at their navels because they’re stoned out of their minds.The event was ostensibly being held to raise awareness of legislation in Congress that would allow the District of Columbia to regulate the sale of marijuana ― voters in 2014 passed a referendum allowing for the possession and consumption of small amounts of marijuana but did not specify how to regulate its sale. Attempts by the D.C. Council to regulate the sale of marijuana in the District have hit a roadblock in Congress, which has veto authority over the council. “It’s the same hypocrisy that governs everything else around here,” said a staffer for the House’s chief administrative officer, who asked that his name not be published. He said he had begun smoking marijuana regularly six months ago to manage chronic pain. “Look around, you can talk to other people and find out how common [marijuana use] is,” said Tyler, a District resident and volunteer who asked that his last name not be published. “I’m not the only one ― it’s not just white guys with long hair that smoke weed, man.” But for all the hazy revelry on display, the event underscored a very serious matter ― one that organizers certainly wanted attendees and journalists to ponder ― can you legally hand out pot one block from the U.S. Capitol? The answer is complicated. While federal law still prohibits marijuana consumption, a 2013 memo issued by the Obama administration effectively left enforcement and regulation up to the states, and the Trump administration has yet to reverse it. A number of local events in which cannabis seeds were handed out for free have gone off without interference from the authorities, and several delivery services have sprung up in which customers purchase a product ― such as a box of cookies or bottle of juice ― and receive a small amount of marijuana as a “gift.” However, the District of Columbia is entwined with the federal government in ways the 26 states that have passed laws loosening marijuana regulation ― or outright legalizing consumption ― are not. While someone may be inclined to take advantage of Washington’s consumption laws in one of its beautiful parks, many of the District’s outdoor spaces are actually managed by the Interior Department. That jurisdictional tension was on full display Thursday, as U.S. Capitol Police arrested a number of organizers, including DCMJ’s director, Adam Eidinger. While officials allowed the event to proceed, the Capitol Police later attributed the arrests to the organizers’ intention to distribute marijuana. “At approximately 12:18 p.m. today, United States Capitol Police (USCP) officers began arresting several individuals after witnessing them distributing marijuana in public view to passersby at First and Constitution Avenue, NE,” said the statement from USCP spokeswoman Eva Malecki. “Under federal law, it is unlawful to possess marijuana.” In an interview with The Huffington Post, DCMJ Communications Director Nikolas R. Schiller said the location of the giveaway was chosen not just to raise awareness of their legislative agenda, but to highlight the apparent contradiction between what types of substances congressional staffers can and can’t consume.“There’s a lot of trade organizations that have events with free alcohol,” Schiller said, “and staffers can go and have their free alcohol. It’s not a big deal.” Schiller added that the giveaway’s location ― on the corner of First Street Northeast and Constitution Avenue ― was the closest the group could get to the Senate without leaving D.C. territory (most federal offices in Washington sit on federal land out of the jurisdiction of the D.C. government and police). While organizers said upward of 30 congressional staffers had come forward to claim their free weed in the first hour alone, the actual number was significantly less, owing in no small part to the numerous television cameras trained on the table organizers had set up to distribute the joints. With Congress on recess, there were no lawmakers around to take advantage of the giveaway ― though few legislators likely would have shown up even if they were in town. That said, members of Congress and their staffs aren’t under terribly close scrutiny when it comes to drug use. As Schiller noted, members of Congress and their staffs are not subject to the drug testing statutes that keep other federal employees, including contractors who work in Congress, from consuming marijuana. “Hill staffers that work for members of Congress are not required to submit urine tests, while the contractors like janitors are required to,” Schiller said. “After cleaning so many toilet bowls at work, someone might want their own bowl, yet they could lose their job.” Politics hurt too much?

The arrest was first reported by The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.Powers, who is running for a seat on Arlington City Council, sent “harassing, obscene, threatening” Twitter messages to Bethany Tinderholt on Valentine’s Day 2016, according to the arrest affidavit. Tinderholt is married to state Rep. Tony Tinderholt (R).The messages, sent via the Twitter screenname @CzarofSwag, propositioned Bethany Tinderholt for sex acts and offered her $1 and $5. Other messages included:“Also I hope one of your kids gets raped by a pedophile or killed by someone texting. You can thank your husband for that.”Bethany Tinderholt reported the messages to police the day after they were sent. Tinderholt, who was pregnant at the time, told investigators she found the rape reference “extremely alarming and offensive.”Tinderholt and her husband contacted police again days later to report receiving a disturbing handwritten letter in the mail. The letter read, in part:“I do love watching you Beth. I would hate to see something happen to you. See you again soon.”Police said the letter included “various numbers and symbols,” which had no meaning to the Tinderholts.A neighbor’s surveillance video showed a man on a black motorcycle depositing the letter in a mailbox, but the quality was too poor for police to see the license number. Authorities said an internet search of the @CzarofSwag user name yielded a social media profile linking Powers to the Twitter handle.Powers denied creating the account when investigators questioned him. Pressed further, Powers “requested an attorney, advising he no longer wished to speak,” the arrest affidavit says.A black Honda motorcycle was parked in Powers’ driveway when police interviewed him, and it belonged to Powers, police said.Investigators said it took them until January to link Powers to the @CzarofSwag Twitter account. The account has since been removed from Twitter.Authorities have not speculated on a motive. Powers was unavailable for comment. A Facebook page devoted to his political campaign was no longer available Thursday. If convicted, Powers faces up to 180 days in jail.David Lohr covers crime and missing persons. Tips? Feedback?

Mark Green (R) to be his Army secretary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e2752a16000021004d86d2.jpeg?cache=IkkOGLVXEK&ops=crop_13_197_627_424%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Tennessee state Sen. Mark Green (R), President Donald Trump’s choice to be the next Army secretary, believes that part of his mission as a public official is to “crush evil” ― and that opposing transgender equality policies is key to that effort.As head of the Army, Green would oversee a force that’s fully integrated, since the Pentagon ended its ban on transgender people serving openly in June. If confirmed, he would set a significantly different tone than the previous Army secretary, Eric Fanning, who was the first openly gay person to serve in the position.In June, Green said he opposed allowing people to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity, rather than the sex assigned at birth. He told an online radio show he believed the matter should be left up to the states rather than the federal government, and then cited the safety of women as a key reason he personally opposes transgender equality in public accommodations. “There are 300,000 rapes in the United States every year,” Green said. “Three hundred thousand women who are sexually assaulted by predators. We know this. It’s documented. It’s factual. To think that some young guy isn’t going to take advantage of the system where we’re going to allow guys to go into the bathroom ― the women’s bathroom ― to think that it’s not going to happen is just ridiculous.”The need to protect women from sexual predators is a common conservative argument against inclusive bathroom policies. But it’s also a red herring. It’s already illegal for men to sexually assault women, whether it takes place in a bathroom or some other place. Nothing would change in that regard. And leading organizations dedicated to fighting sexual assault say they support transgender equal access.States and localities that have implemented transgender-inclusive restroom policies have also said they have not seen an increase in rape and assault because of these laws.But for Green, there’s also a biblical reason to oppose these policies: He needs to “crush evil”:And as far as the religious argument goes, and this applies to the issue of Syrian refugees as well. There’s a big fuss about whether or not that we should sue the federal government over having to take refugees from Syria into the State of Tennessee, I believe we should sue the federal government in that case because Romans 13 is pretty doggone clear, this is the passage where it tells people to submit to the authorities – meaning, basically if you’re in the government, you should do what the government tells you to do. You know, don’t speed, all that kind of stuff. Obey the laws is basically what the passage says. But what it goes on to say is that because the government exists for two purposes. “The Trump Administration must have been desperate to fill this post because Mark Green’s anti-LGBTQ remarks should disqualify anyone seeking to be in charge of the United States Army, which includes many out and proud soldiers,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy group. “Our nation is strongest when we are together ― and calling transgender people ‘evil’ does just the opposite.” Green did not return a request for additional comment on his remarks and views on transgender people.In September, Green told a tea party gathering that he believes being transgender is a disease. (The medical community disagrees.)Green is also the sponsor of SB 127, a bill that would bar government entities from taking “discriminatory action against a business entity on the basis of the internal policies of the business entity” in Tennessee. The state’s nondiscrimination protections do not currently cover discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, although some municipalities do have stronger rules protecting LGBTQ government employees.The bill passed the Tennessee state Senate, but this week, the House deferred the measure until next year. Green is a West Point graduate and physician. He was an Army medic for the special operations team that captured Saddam Hussein in 2003. He later wrote a book about his experience interviewing the former Iraqi dictator. Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."
36,ARTS & CULTURE,Bill O’Reilly's Book Publisher Says It Will Continue To Support Him,Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-book-publisher_us_58f8c9a8e4b091e58f391f1c,The former Fox News host still has a platform.,2017-04-20,"Bill O'Reilly promoting one of his many books, ""Killing Reagan,"" during an interview with Jimmy Fallon in 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f8cc001b0000330016c8e2.jpeg?cache=O031Rijqec&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Although an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment has led to Bill O’Reilly’s dismissal from Fox News, the right-wing media personality will still have a platform, courtesy of his book publisher.Publisher’s Weekly reported Wednesday that Henry Holt ― an imprint of Macmillan ― “has no intention of altering its support of the bestselling author.” Just last month, O’Reilly released a commercial successfully book through Henry Holt called Old School: Life in the Sane Lane. The book ― a sendup of progressive values, from trigger warnings to safe spaces ― begins with a quiz, wherein readers can determine whether they’re “Old School,” or a “Snowflake.” Questions range from the politically divisive (“If someone wishes you ‘Merry Christmas’ what’s your immediate response?”) to the smug (“If you happen upon a raging warehouse fire late at night, do you: a) Hope the firefighters are safe and express concern for the people who work there during the day. b) Get out of your car and take a selfie with the fire in the background?”) Henry Holt has an unnamed September release co-authored by O’Reilly; so far, the publisher says “plans have not changed” for the title.The imprint’s other recent releases include Elizabeth Warren’s This Fight is Our Fight and Coretta Scott King’s My Life, My Love, My Legacy. It’s unclear whether the publisher’s decision to keep O’Reilly on its list is inspired by commercial or ethical aims. Publisher’s Weekly points out that O’Reilly was the bestselling adult nonfiction author of 2016; his book Killing the Rising Sun sold over 1 million copies in print. With the ability to tout his titles on his show, he had the sort of built-in fan base that a debut author might not. But, a book market expert predicts that his sales will decline, especially from casual fans and women readers. On the other hand, free speech organizations such as the National Coalition Against Censorship ― which stood by Milo Yiannopoulos’ book before the title was pulled ― would likely argue that cutting ties with O’Reilly would be a violation of his rights.Yiannopoulos’ book was cancelled after the “alt-right” personality made a comment condoning pedophilia. Either the statement was finally an ethical breach the publisher was unwilling to accept, or it turned Yiannopoulos into a long-term financial liability. Most likely, it was some combination of the two. Regardless, O’Reilly’s charges seem not to have warranted such action just yet. "
37,POLITICS,Georgia Is Trying To Block Newly Registered Voters From Taking Part In Fierce Runoff Election,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-voter-registration-runoff-ossoff_us_58f90c7ce4b06b9cb91505f8,"This is just typical, said the Georgia NAACP chief, who is suing the state.",2017-04-20,Democrat Jon Ossoff will face off against Republican Karen Handel in a June 20 special election in Georgia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f910031b0000320016ca61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Five civil rights and civic engagement groups have filed suit against Georgia and its secretary of state for attempting to block registered voters from participating in a closely watched runoff election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District.On Thursday, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a complaint in the federal district court in Atlanta, arguing that the state is violating the National Voter Registration Act. That law sets 30 days before a federal election as the earliest permissible deadline for voter registration.Georgia complied with the provision for the special congressional election held this past Tuesday. But because no candidate won 50 percent of the vote, there will be a second election on June 20 ― a runoff between the top two finishers, Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.Georgia election officials contend that the June runoff is simply a continuation of the special election this week, so they don’t have to allow newly registered voters to participate. The registration deadline for Tuesday’s election was March 20, and officials say anybody who registers after that day is not eligible to vote in the June runoff.Ezra Rosenberg, co-director of the voting rights project at the Lawyers’ Committee, argues that under the federal law, Georgia can’t set the registration deadline for the June 20 runoff any earlier than 30 days before that election ― that is, May 22.“The case is actually a very, very simple case,” Rosenberg told reporters on a conference call Thursday. “Federal law specifically defines elections as including runoff elections.”The National Voter Registration Act, passed in 1993, defines the word “election” based on the Federal Election Campaign Act. That 1971 statute defines an election as “a general, special, primary, or runoff election.”The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Georgia NAACP, Georgia Coalition for the Peoples’ Agenda, ProGeorgia State Table, Third Sector Development and Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta. The groups are asking the federal court to order the state to let people vote on June 20 if they’re registered by May 22 ― and to publicize that extension of the deadline.Speaking on the press call, Francys Johnson, president of the Georgia NAACP, called the decision to block people from voting “par for the course” for Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R). “The tactics that the secretary of state and the state of Georgia are employing are anything but special. They are typical,” Johnson said.Their goal, Johnson argued, “is to make voting difficult, to make voting something that all Georgians cannot participate in. Any time there is a need to interpret federal law, [Kemp] always interprets federal law to close opportunities for Georgians to be able to exercise the right to vote.”Stephanie Cho, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, added that Georgia’s decision was already causing considerable confusion. She noted that people who had moved to the 6th District or turned 18 since March 20 would not be able to vote in the upcoming runoff.The Lawyers’ Committee already knows of more than 100 voters affected by the state’s excessively early deadline, according to spokesman Derrick Robinson.But Georgia law requires that individuals who vote in a runoff election must be registered to vote in the initial election, Kemp spokeswoman Candice Broce said in an email. She also noted that the U.S. Constitution allows states to set additional qualifications for voters in federal elections that don’t exceed the qualifications for state elections.Ira Feinberg, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, essentially responded to that argument on the conference call when he said that the National Voter Registration Act “clearly pre-empts state law.” Hogan Lovells is assisting on the case.Broce claimed that allowing new voters to register would undermine the integrity of the runoff.“The election system, which includes the voter registration database and electronic poll books, was set up in such a way that it necessarily depends on the runoff being connected to the underlying election,” she said. “Attempting to make a change to the election system this late in the process could result in serious complications to normal election operations.”Ossoff performed far stronger than expected in Tuesday’s election for the congressional seat recently vacated by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. It’s a seat long held by Republicans. The race has drawn national attention because some see it as an early indicator that dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump could turn into political gains for Democrats."

Of course there are the stresses of dealing with Ben’s behaviors on a daily basis, such as: his meltdowns, sleepless nights, his OCD, his lack of danger awareness, and his difficulty communicating. However, what stresses me the most is not Ben’s behavior, but society’s reaction to it. It stresses me when people give me “that look” when Ben is having a meltdown in public or when he is stimming (such as hand flapping or spinning) at a restaurant or other public place. I dream of a world where people are not only aware of autism, but also accepting of it. I dream of an autism-friendly world, which would look something like this…Autism-Friendly Hotels: I was once told by hotel management that if we didn’t keep the noise down, we would be asked to leave the hotel. The noise he was referring to was Ben’s stimming: loud vocalizations and jumping. These behaviors, although disruptive, are necessary for his sensory integration. The picture above was taken at Canada’s first autism friendly hotel, located in Port Aux Basques, NL. It provides a space for children on the spectrum to meet their sensory needs. It also has a specific room for individuals with ASD and their families. Nothing in the suite is movable or can be thrown should a guest become distressed. In an autism friendly world, all hotels would have such a room, and would be more tolerant of autistic behaviors such as stimming.Autism-Friendly Movie Theatres:  A friend of mine was once asked to leave a movie theatre because her son’s vocal stimming was disturbing to the other movie goers. Some movie theaters offer mommy and baby matinees where crying is okay. I would urge all movie theaters to offer this service and to extend it to children with autism and other special needs so that not only noise, but movement is also acceptable.Autism-Friendly Airports: It can be difficult traveling alone when you have a child with autism, as Ben’s dad once learned when he disappeared at Heathrow Airport! Wouldn’t it be great if airport personnel provided assistance to families who are traveling with a person with ASD, in the same way that they support people with physical disabilities. This would include escorts from gate to gate and access to the special lines which reduce wait times.Autism-Friendly Stores:  When Ben was younger, it was very difficult for him to wait in line, especially at grocery stores while he was anticipating his treat! When I took my kids to Disney World, we got a special pass which allowed not only Ben, but his whole entourage (mom and siblings) to go to the front of the line for all rides and attractions. How nice would it be if kids with autism got a special pass to go to the front of the line at shopping centers. Hey, if Disney can do it, then why not Walmart?Autism-Friendly Restaurants: Imagine a world in which restaurants designated a table, away from the main traffic area, with a sign that says “Autism Friendly Table.” Then if the child was having a meltdown because for example, his chicken nuggets were touching his fries, people would know at a glance that the child has autism, and is not just “being a brat” as is too often assumed.Autism-Friendly Hair Salons: Many children with autism resist getting their hair cut, which can cause quite a scene at hair salons. Wouldn’t it be great if hair salons offered a private room, with dim lights and soft music to help soothe the senses of people with ASD, while preserving their dignity?Autism-Friendly Parades: I am happy to say, that in my home town of Burin, Newfoundland, last year’s Christmas parade was autism-friendly! There was a stretch of the parade which was quiet, no sirens or loud music, for people on the spectrum who are sensitive to loud noises. In an autism-friendly world, all towns and cities would adopt this practice.Autism-Friendly People: In an ideal world, not only would businesses be more accommodating to people with autism, but so too would people. However, that can only happen if we raise understanding and acceptance of the disorder. The time for awareness has passed. People are aware that autism exists, yet many still react in a very negative way to autistic behaviors such as stimming and meltdowns. Tolerance. Understanding. Empathy. That is what an autism friendly world would look like!"
42,POLITICS,Trump's War On Federal Science Will Stifle Innovation And Hurt The Economy,"Elliott Negin, ContributorSenior Writer, Union of Concerned Scientists",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-war-on-federal-science-will-stifle-innovation_us_58f828aae4b01d4eb1e1695c,Proposed cuts would hamstring research at federal agencies that have a long history of doing the heavy lifting.,2017-04-20,<p>Research funded by the National Science Foundation led to the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f832be2600001400c469ed.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just after President Trump was elected last November, thousands of American scientists did something unprecedented. Startled by the incoming president’s blatant disregard for the facts, they sent an open letter calling on the new administration and Congress to respect “scientific integrity and independence.” Signed by more than 5,500 scientists, the letter ends with a warning: “We will continue to champion efforts that strengthen the role of science in policymaking, and stand ready to hold accountable any who might seek to undermine it.”If Trump’s scientifically indefensible statements on the campaign trail weren’t disturbing enough, his cabinet appointees, his executive actions rescinding environmental safeguards, and his preliminary “skinny” budget proposing to gut federal science programs have all set off alarm bells. In response, the scientific community is preparing for another unprecedented action. On Saturday, April 22 — Earth Day — scientists and their supporters will gather in Washington, D.C., and more than 400 cities around the world for the first-ever March for Science, kicking off a week of activism capped off by the People’s Climate March on April 29. Never before have scientists seemed this motivated and engaged, and with good reason. Trump’s actions and his proposed budget would not only threaten public health and the environment, they also would stifle American innovation and slow economic growth.That’s right. Most Americans — including the businessman in the White House, apparently — do not fully appreciate how much our economy relies on federal science. The truth is, U.S. corporations, their employees, and the public at large are all heavily indebted to taxpayer-funded research for a wide array of consumer products, pharmaceuticals and technologies. Regardless, Trump’s proposed cuts would hamstring research at federal agencies that have a long history of doing the heavy lifting. Nipping the Nifty 50Let’s start with the fact that you’re reading this on a computer or another electronic device. In 1973, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched a research program called the Internetting project, which developed procedures that allowed computers to communicate across multiple, linked networks. In the mid-1980s, the National Science Foundation underwrote the development of DARPA’s system to provide the backbone of what we now call the Internet. The National Science Foundation’s website includes the Internet in its “Nifty 50” government-funded inventions, innovations and discoveries that we all now take for granted. The list, which includes everything from barcodes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to speech recognition and web browsers, amounts to just a small sampling of products and technologies government funding helped spawn. Although Trump’s proposed budget does not specifically mention the National Science Foundation, which currently provides more than $7 billion annually in research grants, it likely will be included in the category of “other agencies” that Trump wants to cut by nearly 10 percent.Defunding Life-Saving Drug ResearchTrump’s proposal does explicitly call for slashing the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) annual budget by 18 percent, from its current $31.7 billion to $25.9 billion, which would bring its funding to the lowest level in at least 15 years (in constant dollars). According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, such a drastic cut “would irreparably harm the ability of the nation’s scientists to develop cures and treatments” and would “have a devastating effect on America’s health security.” An analysis published earlier this month in the journal Science found that more than 30 percent of NIH-funded biomedical studies between 1980 and 2007 were later cited in a patent for a drug, device or medical technology. Nearly a tenth of all NIH grants over the same time period, meanwhile, led directly to a patent. NIH’s commercialization track record has had a significant economic impact. According to a 2013 report by United for Medical Research — a coalition of leading research institutions, patient and health advocates, and private industry — NIH-funded research added $69 billion to U.S. gross domestic product in 2011 alone. If anything, “we’re underinvesting” in biomedical research, says economist Pierre Azoulay, co-author of the recent Science study. “The idea that we’re going to get to a better place by cutting [the NIH budget] is ridiculous.” Running Out of EnergyThe Trump blueprint proposes to cut the Department of Energy (DOE) budget by less than 6 percent, to $28 billion, but would spend more on the DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration — which runs the nuclear weapons complex — and chop energy-related programs by nearly 18 percent. The Office of Science, which supports research at more than 300 universities and oversees 10 national laboratories, would suffer a 16 percent cut. Many of those labs, including Lawrence Berkeley and Pacific Northwest, conduct studies on bioenergy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency, hydropower and solar energy. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, both which invest in cutting-edge energy technologies private investors won’t fund, would be eliminated altogether, as would the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program, which provides loans to automakers to produce a new generation of fuel-efficient vehicles. Federal Science Trumps Corporate R&DThe Trump administration’s rationale for eliminating these DOE research programs? According to the president’s budget report, the “private sector is better positioned to finance disruptive energy research and development and to commercialize innovative technologies.”In fact, government-funded R&D — not the private sector — is responsible for much of the innovation that drives economic growth. As economist Mariana Mazzucato, author of The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths, explained in a September 2013 article, “businesses are typically timid — waiting to invest until they can clearly see new technological and market opportunities. And evidence shows that such opportunities come when large sums of public money are spent directly on high risk (and high cost)” research. The private sector’s “fear explains why we have seen venture capital entering, in industry after industry, only decades after the initial high risk has been absorbed by the government.” Rush Holt, CEO at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, agrees that “corporate research, as beneficial as it may be, is no substitute for federal investment in research.” “We need both,” he wrote in a September 2016 column. “But we should recognize that the private sector, with its natural focus on commercial results and return on investment, will not do much of the fundamental research that is necessary for the long-term progress of society.” Holt, who served in Congress from 1999 to 2015 and holds a doctorate in physics, called on the federal government to “fund more vital research for public health, safety, security, economics and quality of life.” The Trump administration’s preliminary budget blueprint, however, indicates that it plans to do the exact opposite, one of the many reasons scientists will be marching this weekend. Some experts point out that gutting federal scientific research would have dire international consequences as well.“If they were enacted, these cuts signal the end of the American century as a global innovation leader,” Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, recently told the Los Angeles Times. “America’s lead in science and technology was built on the fact that in the 1960s, the U.S. government alone invested more in R&D than the rest of the world combined, business and government. The Trump budget throws this great legacy away.”Elliott Negin is a senior writer at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Ashanti Washington provided research for this article."
43,POLITICS,The Supreme Ugliness Of The Deportation Regime,"Llewellyn King, ContributorJournalist, broadcaster, public speaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-supreme-ugliness-of-the-deportation-regime_us_58f8c813e4b01d4eb1e169e5,Things are going to go from ugly to hideous when the federal government brings its might against sanctuary cities.,2017-04-20,<p>NEW YORK CITY - FEBRUARY 11 2017: Several hundred protesters gathered in Washington Square Park to voice support for immigrants & Muslims in light of Trump's travel ban.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f8c9e42600004700c46b84.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is ugly today, it will be uglier tomorrow and months from now, it will be even uglier. The relentless rounding up of undocumented people living in the United States is the horror that can be ended, if there was a will to end it – and if it were not a source of political feedstock for unyielding positions so close to the Trump presidency.Mind you, it was not all that pretty under the Obama administration. He signaled his heart was in the right place while the deportations continued. What Obama did was to protect, by executive order, the undocumented who were brought in by their parents while underage. Now there is a report of the first of these dreamers, Juan Manuel Montes, being arrested.We get little snippets of how ugly the deportations are from time to time in the media: a child bawling her eyes out because ICE policemen have seized her mother. That poor woman is on her way to a country she left because there was little there for her when she committed the crime of settling without papers in the United States; when she availed herself of the opportunity which nearly all American settlers once did: to live and work in freedom and peace.In writing about the inhumanity of deporting the undocumented, I know what I have opened myself up to a flood of abusive mail, denouncing me as a crypto-communist and much worse. Always the same theme and often the same words inform these communications: “What is it that they don’t understand about illegal?” That is crime enough for those who want mass deportations.At present the threshold, we are told, is that the deportee should have at some time committed a felony. Under federal law, illegal residence here is not a felony but a misdemeanor. One such crime in some states is driving under the influence. A felony? Yup. By the way, it is a crime for which former President George W. Bush was convicted in 1976.Things are going to go from ugly to hideous when the federal government brings its might against sanctuary cities. There is the raw combustible material of civil strife here ― ugliness in the streets which has not been seen since 1968.When neither of two options is acceptable, it is time to seek a third way: a compromise.I have been advocating a compromise which was developed by a quiet, former IRS tax inspector and California university system auditor who lives in Malibu, Calif. He is Mark Jason and his idea is simple: cool things down and get some benefit for local authorities in areas where the undocumented are concentrated.Jason and his Immigrant Tax Inquiry Group, wholly funded by himself, would recognize the presence of the undocumented and give them a way to remain and live productive lives. His proposal is a 10-year work permit dependent on a tax of 5 percent to be paid by both the worker and the employer. Jason calculates a revenue bounty of $176 billion over 10 years. There would be no citizenship for the worker. This money, Jason says, ought to go to the localities where the undocumented live and to defray the costs of education, healthcare, policing and other essential services.This third way, this 5-percent solution, would not satisfy the immigrant advocates who want a “path to citizenship” or those who want to throw the baggage out; the dreaded knock on the door, families shattered, dreams turned into nightmares.I still think we must control immigration, prevent it at points of entry, not when a life has been established and families are at risk.There is a horror greater than the illegality of an otherwise productive citizen. It is the supreme ugliness of the state sending its agents against the individual, whether it is the state seeking to bivouac troops in private homes, as the English did to the American colonists, or the agents of the state coming into a home to rip it asunder.That is an ultimate ugliness, unspeakable, unbecoming and, dare I say, un-American."

Women and men in Washington, D.C., throughout the U.S., and around the world will take to the streets to “March for Science,” in recognition of climate science and the critical importance of governments upholding commitments to global environmental protection efforts and climate change accords. It’s an important moment to rally as leaders’ denial of climate change and science in the U.S. carries devastating implications for all of us.For women around the world, every day is Earth Day. They are fearlessly working to defend their lands. They are climate justice warriors, on the frontlines fighting for clean water, equal land rights for women, and protecting indigenous lands.In my years working with women and girls and learning from their experiences in their own communities, I know that for many women, land is intensely personal. Land is full of possibility, and it holds years of rich history.Land rights are a very personal thing: they’re often passed down by generations, most often from fathers to their sons. At Global Fund for Women, we know that land rights are also inextricably tied to other issues, like economic empowerment and independence. With ownership over a piece of land, new economic opportunities open for individuals and for families.For women in Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, land rights and access to sustainable agriculture trainings meant the difference between one, or sometimes zero, meals per day for their families and three healthy meals per day.For women in Latin America, in places like Guatemala and Honduras, land is the only thing that their communities have. It holds ancestral knowledge and deep culture. It also holds rich resources, making it ripe for land grabs and dangerous environmental plots that could ruin the land.Land rights and women’s rights go hand in hand, and for many women, land means a real livelihood.Around the world, individual women and women’s groups are taking the lead in extraordinary efforts that are transforming societies. They’re leading and shaping powerful grassroots movements for land, climate change, and women’s rights.Women like Bai Bibyaon in the Philippines, a leader known for organizing communities to resist destruction and occupation of their ancestral land. The government forced Bai’s people off their lands in favor of mining companies, but Bai led the resistance to protect the forest. Where the companies see profit, the Manobo people see the loss of the mountains that are their age-old source of food and livelihood. They see their very survival threatened. Bai—the only woman chieftain of the Manobo tribe—continues to lead her people in protests to protect their land. She says about her work: “…this is not only my struggle, but the struggle for my people and our struggle is in defense of humanity.”Women are leading the struggle in Guatemala as well. Ana Sandoval was still in high school when she began asking the questions that led her to co-found the organization “La Puya”, a women-led movement that uses non-violent direct actions to defend land against environmental destruction.Ana began to investigate the mining projects around La Choleña, her hometown in Guatemala. Fearing the environmental disaster and economic plunder they had seen in neighboring mining communities, the women decided to organize and demand that the mining megaproject leave their community.For four years, women, men, and children have organized protests around the clock to prevent gold mining operations on their lands. Crowds of local activists like Ana put their lives on the line by lying down in the road to block the entry of mining machinery.In Zimbabwe, the story is similar. Melania Chiponda remembers a time when people came to her village Marange to buy cattle or to pick fruit from the majestic baobab trees. Today, the mines have displaced the people and destroyed the trees. Families have been forcibly relocated by the government and were cut off from the land that sustained their lives and livelihoods. Women and children have been left homeless.Melania sums up her work in these words: “Sometimes I think it’s dignity that I’m fighting for. Women are supposed to be treated with dignity, with respect. For the women I interact with, land is their dignity.”For me, too, land is very personal.Twenty years ago, my father-in-law, who was then 80 years old, divided his land to his children and he included a piece of land to his daughter and to me. This was neither culturally nor legally permitted in Kenya but ‘Pa’, as I called him, had come to believe that it was an injustice not to affirm the role women play in families and caregiving. Pa’s action had many implications in our village but the bottom line is that, it changed the whole of our extended family norms about land inheritance. Today, the laws about inheritance in Kenya include women. Our family was way ahead of the law and the times, and that is a good thing.For too many women around the world, this is still not the case. I’m so inspired by the incredible women and men around the world who boldly defend their right to land, work to advance women’s access to land rights in their communities and change deep cultural norms, and advocate for changes in laws and policies that dictate how land rights are devised and passed down, and to whom.We need to work together to continue to fight for women’s rights to land, water, and livelihoods. We need to amplify the incredible work of women like Bai, Melania, and Ana who are relentless stewards of environmental protection.Melania’s words ring so very true—for women around the world, “land is their dignity”.Not just on Earth Day, but every day, let’s commit to using our voices and resources to help advance the critical work of women defenders of our earth and, together, build a better world for everyone—no exceptions."

Famine is the evil partner of war. Marshall said he ""wished to help out in this matter"" knowing that innocent and starving civilians were trapped by the two armies of China's war. He called it a ""highly explosive"" situation. Marshall wrote to President Harry Truman about the ""urgent necessity to move UNRRA food up the Yangtze River"" to reach China's famine zones. The U.S. Navy came to the rescue and was able to get some life-saving supplies moving. That humanitarian effort demonstrates America's spirit of fighting hunger, wherever it may be.

At a WFP-UNICEF press conference Guarnieri said Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia are in the midst of a severe drought causing livestock deaths and high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition.WFP and UNICEF need funds to feed millions of hungry people and prevent deadly malnutrition with foods like the enriched peanut paste Plumpy’nut.In South Sudan, meanwhile, famine has struck two counties and is threatening even more.WFP does not have enough funding to help these nations. The UN food agency has been forced to scale back programs like school feeding that fight hunger and keep children in class.The crisis extends well beyond East Africa. Yemen, which has its own civil war, is also on the verge of famine. So too is Nigeria, which has been victimized by Boko Haram violence. Many other nations are in danger as well.The U.S. Famine Warning System said in January that “70 million people, across 45 countries, will require emergency food assistance this year. “ We clearly need a massive scale up of American food aid to help fight the worst hunger crisis since the World War II era.Catholic Relief Services (CRS) is asking the U.S. government to increase funding for the Food for Peace and McGovern-Dole school lunch program.

Sean Callahan, the CRS president, says, “It is through these types of humanitarian and development programs that other countries view Americans. They highlight our values and leave lasting impressions on those we reach, building a partnership of trust in many fragile countries around the world.” Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are uniting to support increasing food aid too. Republican Lynn Jenkins of Kansas and Democrat Jim McGovern of Massachusetts organized a letter, signed by 57 representatives, urging increased funds for the McGovern-Dole school lunch program.The letter states “for just a few cents a day, McGovern-Dole has made a difference in the lives of children and communities, promoted American values in the most positive terms, and helped achieve U.S. foreign policy and national security goals.”The Syrian civil war by itself is a massive hunger emergency. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) is trying to feed over 4 million Syrians inside the war-torn nation. They are also feeding millions of Syrian refugees who have fled to neighboring countries. But WFP and other relief agencies depend on their largest donor, the United States. American food aid must be increased to help with war relief. We must also ensure humanitarian access in war zones like Syria. The United States and Russia must use their influence in Syria’s civil war to end humanitarian blockades. That is a crucial step that can be taken now to save lives and bolster any chance for peace. Food is the foundation of peace and progress in our world. We can't abandon countries with food shortages, especially with such vast need. During this time of famine, hunger relief funding should increase.

Most Corps are non-profits, and the majority of the more than 130 organizations that are part of The Corps Network – the national association of service and conservation Corps – receive AmeriCorps funding. This funding enables Corps to enroll participants and leverage additional funding to complete projects on public lands.Where exactly does the AmeriCorps funding go? In exchange for their service on public lands, AmeriCorps members receive a modest living allowance and, upon completing their service, a scholarship that can be used to pursue further education or help repay student loans. The scholarship can be worth up to about $5,800 for a full year of service. The living allowance, which varies based on region, is, for many AmeriCorps members, less than $500 every other week.The AmeriCorps living allowance and scholarship are not handouts: Corps participants work for them and our public lands directly benefit.

By engaging Corps in public lands maintenance, our resource management agencies chip away at the maintenance backlog in an economical fashion and prepare a new generation of skilled job candidates. Over 35 percent of the Department of the Interior’s workforce is eligible for retirement. The same is true at the state and local level. Through their service, AmeriCorps members in Corps gain experience and hard skills needed to succeed in resource management jobs in both the public and private sectors. Training a new generation of lands managers and keeping our public lands in top condition is good business. In 2015, visitors spent $16.9 billion in communities surrounding national parks. This generated $32 billion in economic impact and supported nearly 300,000 jobs. Every year, America’s outdoor recreation industry as a whole generates an estimated $646 billion and 6.1 million direct jobs. Allowing parks to deteriorate also erodes local economies. In addition to proposing the elimination of AmeriCorps, President Trump proposed a 21 percent cut to the Forest Service budget, and a 12 percent cut to the Department of the Interior’s budget. Decreased budgets mean our federal agencies will need to stretch project funding further, making public-private partnerships with Corps even more important. However, if AmeriCorps is also cut, even more projects will need to be deferred.

Since the 1960s, his pagan performances have incorporated the carcasses, blood and entrails of slaughtered animals into elaborate aesthetic rituals resembling botched orgies or alien religious ceremonies. The Austrian artist, who has been arrested three times for his work, is no stranger to controversy.Nitsch’s newest performance, part of his ongoing “Orgy Mystery Theater” series, just might be his most gag-reflex-triggering yet. The three-hour piece, titled “150.Action,” will feature 500 liters of bull blood as well as an actual slaughtered bull. “Action” participants, who Nitsch calls “disciples,” are invited to dress in white and engage with the bloody mess by bathing in blood, butchering dead animals, whatever floats your boat. The performance will involve a bizarre buffet of blood, semen and guts, a visceral event at once pleasurable, horrifying, pornographic, spiritual and grotesque. Nitsch’s work is slated to run in June as part of the Museum of Old and New Art’s Dark Mofo festival in Tasmania, but a petition by Animal Liberation Tasmania is calling on the Hobart city council to ban the literal blood bath. The appeal reads: “We are opposed to this event, which trivializes the slaughter of animals for human usage, and condemns a sentient being to death in the pursuit of artistic endeavors.” It had received over 9,000 signatures at the time of this article’s publication. Though an actual bull will need to be killed for this debauched sensory overload, Dark Mofo creative director Leigh Carmichael told ABC Radio Hobart that reports of a “live slaughter” are incorrect. Instead, the animal will be “slaughtered humanely” at a local butchery before the performance, he explained, adding that the blood used in the performance would also be locally sourced. Despite this clarification, Peter West, the general manager of animal welfare group RSPCA Tasmania, is still concerned with what will happen to the carcass after it’s slaughtered.“I think the difficulty we have is the respect shown to the animal with this action, that’s the challenge that we have with this particular artwork,” West told Guardian Australia. “It’s clearly not respectful to the beast and even though it has been humanely and respectfully dispatched, what happens after that is anything but respectful.”Surely no bull wants its life to end with a crowd of young art enthusiasts bathing in its blood, but for Nitsch, such an action evokes intensified sensations that are often muted in everyday life, feelings that get to the core of what it means to be a human being.“I want my work stir up the audience, the participants of my performances,” the artist told Hyperallergic in 2014. “I want to arouse them by the means of sensual intensity and to bring them an understanding of their existence. Intensity is an awakening into being.”As of now, Dark Mofo remains unsurprised by the controversy Nitsch’s performance has provoked and has no plans to cancel the performance. As Carmichael explained, the festival will “not shy away from presenting work that challenges us to consider the ethical implications of our actions both today, and in the past... Some artists use paint, he uses blood and meat.”Barring cancelation, Nitsch’s “150.Action” will run in Hobart as part of Dark Mofo from June 8 to June 21. “Action” attendees ― all of whom must be 18 years or older ― may even be able to feast on the freshly butchered meat itself, if the museum can sort out the details with Australian health and safety regulations."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f7a8e714000049001b523f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARIS ― There’s a storm brewing over Marine Le Pen’s presidential campaign. For the past two years, the head of the France’s far-right National Front party has been widely expected to finish second in this weekend’s first round of the French presidential election. That would keep her candidacy alive, but it would make her the underdog in the runoff election on May 7.This dual role as both a favorite and a loser has greatly informed Le Pen’s tactics. With her eyes on winning a majority of votes in the runoff, Le Pen has worked hard to appease voters who might be ill at ease with her far-right party’s extreme history and positions. The problem is, nothing has gone as planned.Le Pen had always hoped for a rematch against former French presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande. But both were eliminated early in the campaign ― Hollande opted not to run for re-election, Sarkozy didn’t make it through the primaries. Instead of a face-off with an establishment candidate, Le Pen now finds herself in a pool of four. This group includes Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a self-proclaimed populist who likens himself to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); François Fillon, the conservative candidate whose campaign has been crippled by an embezzlement scandal; and Emmanuel Macron, a banker and former Socialist party member who served as economy minister for two years under Hollande. The race has shifted dramatically. While it once looked like Le Pen would take as much as one-third of the vote, she now finds herself in second place, just 3 points ahead of the bottom two contenders, according to a HuffPost France poll count.“While she may set a new record for an NF candidate’s votes in a presidential election, and even a historic record for the NF in any election, there has been an erosion of her support in the polls,” Yves-Marie Cann, director of political studies at Elabe, told HuffPost France. “In February, she was at 28 percent, and now she’s at 22 to 23 percent, according to polls, which shows she hasn’t been able to create a dynamic around her campaign.”Will Marine Le Pen 2017 be like the Lionel Jospin of 2002, who was eliminated in the general election after neglecting his campaign in the first round? Even if the scenario isn’t the most probable for Le Pen, it’s now possible.To prevent even bigger losses in the final stretch, Le Pen appears to have shifted tactics in the past 10 days. In order to consolidate her base, she’s made a sharp right turn and is doubling down on some of the core tenets of the National Front platform: French identity and the fight against immigration. At a large rally in the city of Marseille on Wednesday evening, Le Pen is expected to reinforce that message. The rally is also expected to mark the first time Le Pen will be flanked by her niece, Marion Maréchal Le Pen, who had previously been marginalized in the campaign and is a poster child for the party’s identity before Le Pen softened some of the edges. Le Pen has also recently proposed an immediate moratorium on legal immigration, and the recall of military reservists to enforce France’s borders.At her rallies, too, Le Pen has dropped her cloak of “appeasement” and plunged back into discouraging, provocative speeches likely to remobilize her electoral target. After sparking a major controversy by denying the role of the French state in the Vel d’Hiv roundup earlier this month, the candidate has resumed her winning 2012 formula, linking immigration and terrorism. “With me, there would not have been a Mohammed Merah,” Le Pen said during a recent meeting, referring to the gunman who shot seven people in Toulouse in 2012. “There would not have been any migrant terrorists at the Bataclan or the Stade de France,” she added, referring to the November 2015 attack in Paris. She even mentioned France’s colonization of Algeria, again hoping to play on national identity. “Colonization has brought a lot, notably, since we are talking about Algeria ― in Algeria, hospitals, roads, schools ... Even Algerians who are in good faith admit it,” Le Pen told BFMTV earlier this month. . “Her base is very solid and has not decreased, but she hasn’t attracted many new voters,” pollster Yves-Marie Cann warned. “The voters who picked Nicolas Sarkozy in 2012 for a long time did not express their intentions, but they’re starting to do so in favor of not François Fillon. Marine Le Pen isn’t getting many of them.” That’s a strong warning, given that nearly one-fourth of the French electorate still hasn’t decided who to vote for on Sunday. "

55,ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Gives Historical Women Of Color The Glorious Crowns They Deserve,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivette-cabrera_us_58f668b0e4b029063d34a0b1,"""Women are both warriors and creators, fighters and powerful yet fragile enough to care for human life.""",2017-04-19,A photograph of a Sandista woman Cabrera found during her research. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f7829f1b0000320016c579.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In Nicaraguan artist Ivette Cabrera’s delicate drawings, women real and imagined don elaborate headdresses. The black, white and red crowns transcend fashion trends and sovereign traditions, resembling weightless, geometric diagrams ― part botanical, part architectural ― that allude to the endless, blossoming potential of its wearers. They are material and immaterial, regal and boundless. Cabrera first began contemplating the series while researching the Sandinista National Liberation Front, the democratic socialist party in Nicaragua that overthrew the country’s president in 1979, establishing a revolutionary government in its place. Women played a vital role in the revolution, serving in government, enacting social programs and joining the ranks of the local guerrilla groups. While delving into the Nicaraguan history that propelled her mother to migrate to the United States, Cabrera discovered a photograph that grabbed her attention. The photo depicted a Sandinista woman wearing a rifle slung around her shoulder while breastfeeding a child. “The image made me realize,” Cabrera explained to The Huffington Post, “that women are both warriors and creators, fighters and powerful yet fragile enough to care for human life.”This image and the paradoxical ideas of womanhood it embodied compelled Cabrera to think about the societal standards women have been held to regardless of time, place or tradition. “We are much more capable than the roles society places on us,” she said, “but it takes an awareness of our own personal identity within that societal structure to really grow as a human so we can create a more balanced future for ourselves. Our history of oppression has had cataclysmic effects that has molded the identity of women today, especially to women of color.”Cabrera’s background is in architecture; she worked in renovations and residential building design for most of her life. She is more inspired by architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Zaha Hadid and Rennie Mackintosh than fine artists, by movements like Brutalism and Constructivism than those found in art history books. “Some of my work is inspired by artists of the Post-Graffiti and Futurism movements along with some older artists from Art Nouveau such as Victor Horta, Erte, Alphonse Mucha and Gaudi,” Cabrera added. In 2013 she taught herself how to draw portraits, incorporating elements of her architectural design concepts for buildings into visionary headdresses fit for a warrior and a queen. Before beginning a work, Cabrera scours thrift stores, hunting for old architecture books. She flips through them, looking for certain details she can incorporate into her unorthodox headpieces ― whether a certain use of negative space, line or composition. She works on toned paper with archival ink, marker, graphite and charcoal, sometimes using a magnifying glass to perfect the smaller details. Each drawing takes weeks or even months to complete, and Cabrera will start a piece over if the portraits don’t sufficiently capture the essences of their subjects. Currently, Cabrera is working on a series titled “Monarch,” focusing on historical icons like Hadid, the iconic Iraqi-born British architect, and Wu Zetian, a 7th-century empress and the only woman to rule China. These sovereign inspirations are crowned with airy and expansive coronets that combine the airiness of butterfly wings with the expansive power of a yawning cathedral. Through the drawings, Cabrera hopes to highlight the discrepancy between the roles women are often expected to fulfill and the true potential they possess. As the artist explained: “The biggest message that I hope to communicate to my viewers is to honor their inner strength and individuality, not to conform to the societal rules, and to see yourself as powerful and beautiful. Don’t buy into the system that tells you how you should be, act or what you should look like.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f789572600004500c467f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Miami-Dade County is celebrating “Moonlight” and the impact of its creators with the renaming of a street in their hometown. Commissioners announced Tuesday that they would rename a stretch of NW 22nd Avenue in Miami’s Liberty City neighborhood “Moonlight Way,” according to the Miami New Times. The Academy Award-winning film, which is set in Liberty City, was co-written and directed by Barry Jenkins and executive produced by playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney ― both of whom are natives of the South Florida community. Miami-Dade Commissioner Audrey Edmonson told the New Times that she hopes renaming the street will remind children in underprivileged neighborhoods that despite their surroundings, they can go on to achieve their dreams.“This movie — at least what I got from it — really depicts the life of how a lot of us were raised and what we had to go through and endure as children in the inner city,” she said. “This goes out to children still living here in the inner city that are told they’ll never amount to anything. It shows that it doesn’t matter how you were raised or where you grew up; you can still turn out to be someone.”Edmonson added that the film’s depiction of a young boy’s struggles growing up in the poverty-stricken neighborhood mirrors actual events that take place in Liberty City. “To everyone, I’d say it’s still not too late to watch it. It will bring awareness to those not brought up that way,” she said. “It definitely shows what goes on in the city.”The announcement of Moonlight Way comes ahead of Jenkins and McCraney’s celebratory return to their hometown. This weekend, the pair will attend a ceremony honoring “Moonlight” during an event held at Miami’s African Heritage Cultural Arts Center."

Just a few months prior, Daleiden had been crashing on the couch of Kohl Peifer's Orange County apartment while editing videos around the clock, Peifer says.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f75fba2600003596c46705.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In July 2015, 28-year-old Kohl Peifer logged onto CNN.com and noticed a breaking story: “Man behind Planned Parenthood videos speaks out.” The interview featured David Daleiden, the anti-abortion activist whose organization, the Center for Medical Progress, had recently released undercover videos targeting the women’s health care provider. To Peifer, a Los Angeles native working as a design director for a marketing firm, Daleiden was familiar for another reason: The then-26-year-old had been crashing on Peifer’s couch. Daleiden and his colleague, Sandra Merritt, now face 15 felony counts in California connected to their work on the sting videos, which purported to show Planned Parenthood employees illegally planning to profit from fetal tissue. Merritt allegedly helped with the recordings. The charges specifically relate to recording confidential communications without consent, not to any editing. Daleiden — whose legal team declined to comment for this story — has claimed the charges are “fake news,” and noted that other charges in Texas were dropped. At least some of the released footage was misleadingly edited, and a dozen state investigations into Planned Parenthood did not find that the organization was profiting off fetal tissue, which its patients may choose to donate for research. (Planned Parenthood stopped recovering reimbursements for expenses related to its donation program after the videos came out.) But Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress, the 501(c)3 nonprofit he started in 2013, captured national attention anyway. Even as California’s investigation unfolded, Republican lawmakers cited the discredited videos to attack Planned Parenthood and suggest it should be defunded ― one as recently as February this year. Daleiden ran the conservative cable circuit. And at some point between 2015 and 2016, CMP hired Kellyanne Conway — who is currently White House counselor — for “consulting services.” Conway received more than $5,000 from CMP, according to recent financial disclosures released by the Office of Government Ethics.Yet search warrant documents from the California Justice Department obtained by The Huffington Post — and interviews with Peifer, who assisted investigators — suggest that CMP’s operation was less legitimate than the group’s national profile made it appear. And they raise questions as to why big-name GOPers were so quick to jump on board.In July 2014, Peifer moved into the Orange County condo that Daleiden would soon frequent. Peifer’s new roommate, Ryan Gonzalez, was a video editor. Soon after Peifer moved in, Gonzalez started working with Daleiden, according to Peifer and Gonzalez’s Facebook posts from 2015.Starting that August, Gonzalez and Daleiden edited videos, including in the condo’s living room, where they used the central TV as a computer monitor, Peifer said. By summer 2015, just before the release of the first video, Daleiden was working in the condo around the clock, Peifer later told California DOJ investigators.Peifer didn’t find Daleiden particularly friendly. Over the course of the year, Peifer said, he said “hello” only a couple of times, and usually wouldn’t look up from his computer. Peifer also noted that Daleiden never apologized or acknowledged working out of their place.The first video broke nationally on July 14, 2015. Daleiden, who identifies as a citizen journalist, told CNN later that month that his team “follows all applicable laws in the course of our investigative journalism work” and also called the project a “two-and-a-half-year long investigative journalism study.” Peifer —who is pro-choice, but doesn’t consider himself particularly political —was upset. He didn’t like that Daleiden was claiming the videos were unbiased journalism, when to him, it looked like the footage had undergone intensive editing in his living room for months. And he didn’t like that the videos were being edited under his roof without his knowledge. Peifer decided to talk to Gonzalez. “When I confronted Ryan, he smirked and said that yes, this was what they had been doing,” Peifer told HuffPost. “It was sort of a ‘gotcha’ moment ... He was cold and callous and didn’t really care what I felt about the situation. I think they honestly thought they could do this indefinitely, under the radar, and not have anyone catch on or raise issue. But I raised issue with it — and he continued to do it.” (Gonzalez did not respond to requests for comment.) Peifer contacted a college friend who worked at Planned Parenthood to explain the situation. Planned Parenthood later provided Peifer’s contact information to the California Justice Department, according to search warrant documents. Months went by, and Peifer watched the consequences of the videos unfold. In September, Republicans threatened to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood funding. Then, in November, a shooter — who later said he was upset in part because he believed Planned Parenthood was selling “baby parts” — stormed a clinic in Colorado Springs, leaving three people dead.Immediately following the release of the “highly edited tapes,” said Ana Sandoval, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, “our health centers saw a nine-fold increase in threats of violence.” Peifer, who saw that shooting on the news, messaged his friend that he had “terrible anxiety” about the situation. “Someone just fucking died,” he added. (Daleiden publicly condemned the shooting.) In its complaint against Daleiden, the California DOJ says it got a request on Dec. 2, 2015 to investigate whether Daleiden or CMP had broken California law. That document does not state who made the request. A day later, investigators met with Peifer, according to search warrant documents. They asked him, among other things, about computer equipment in the apartment.Peifer told investigators that although he had “no personal interest” in the matter, “something getting national attention and happening in his living room was ‘not good,’” according to the documents.In April 2016, a court granted authorities a search warrant for Daleiden’s apartment. (Not Peifer’s condo.) Those documents detail the extent to which the feds allege Daleiden engaged in criminal deception. They also feature interviews with Planned Parenthood officials who said they believed the conversations they were having with Daleiden — who allegedly called himself “Robert Sarkis”— were confidential. Daleiden has claimed they weren’t.A California Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on an ongoing investigation. Sandoval, from Planned Parenthood, said the organization “was both the focus and victim of Daleiden’s criminal activity.” An attorney who is part of Daleiden’s legal team, Tom Brejcha, said last month that Daleiden and Merritt will “assert robust defenses to these charges.”  That Daleiden was allegedly editing his videos out of a stranger’s living room in California might surprise conservatives who watched him chat with Bill O’Reilly. But it was never a mystery to his temporary housemate. “You have this meek guy eating cheeseburgers in someone else’s house all day producing this content to put up on YouTube, and people are buying it as ‘investigative journalism’ from the ‘Center for Medical Progress,’” Peifer said. He added, “Did you think the people you were living with ... weren’t going to say something?”Matt Ferner contributed reporting. "

To Peifer, a Los Angeles native working as a design director for a marketing firm, Daleiden was familiar for another reason: The then-26-year-old had been crashing on Peifer’s couch. Daleiden and his colleague, Sandra Merritt, now face 15 felony counts in California connected to their work on the sting videos, which purported to show Planned Parenthood employees illegally planning to profit from fetal tissue. Merritt allegedly helped with the recordings. The charges specifically relate to recording confidential communications without consent, not to any editing. Daleiden — whose legal team declined to comment for this story — has claimed the charges are “fake news,” and noted that other charges in Texas were dropped. At least some of the released footage was misleadingly edited, and a dozen state investigations into Planned Parenthood did not find that the organization was profiting off fetal tissue, which its patients may choose to donate for research. (Planned Parenthood stopped recovering reimbursements for expenses related to its donation program after the videos came out.) But Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress, the 501(c)3 nonprofit he started in 2013, captured national attention anyway. Even as California’s investigation unfolded, Republican lawmakers cited the discredited videos to attack Planned Parenthood and suggest it should be defunded ― one as recently as February this year. Daleiden ran the conservative cable circuit.

Talk of a 20-month extension instead of a permanent fix is floating around the chamber, according to multiple sources.

Smith said.Advocates argue that a permanent solution would make the federal government good on a 70-year-old promise to protect United Mine Workers’ health benefits.If Republican House leaders try to push through a government funding bill with only a 20-month extension, battle lines will be drawn by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in the upper chamber. Manchin threatened to shut down the government if help for miners wasn’t included in a continuing resolution last year, but conceded after McConnell and the president assured him a permanent solution would get a vote and have their support. On Monday, Manchin and Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, also of West Virginia, wrote to party leaders in both chambers, urging them to settle for nothing less than a complete fix for the more than 22,000 miners who stand to lose their health care on April 28. “As Congress considers a continuing resolution to keep the government running, we fully expect that such a vehicle will include the permanent health care fix for our nation’s retired miners as promised at the end of 2016,” the bipartisan duo wrote to McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “Anything less is an unacceptable and tragic failure of this body to keep its word to the men and women who powered our nation to prosperity at the risk of their own health and lives.”Capito has not said outright whether she would vote against a government funding bill if it doesn’t include a permanent solution for the miners. But she and other coal-state Republicans, including Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), have hinted they’d back Manchin.Before leaving for the Easter break, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has long supported a permanent fix for the miners’ health care, warned during a speech on the Senate floor that another extension would be unacceptable. “The clock is ticking down to ... when the temporary miners’ health care fix we passed in December, along with funding for the entire federal government, runs out,” Brown said. “We must pass a solution, or face a government shutdown.”Brown met with retired miners this month, and said it was the first time he’s ever received a standing ovation for advocating legislation fixing health coverage and the pension fund for miners, which is set to go insolvent this year. The issue of retired miners’ pensions, however, is a battle that Republican leaders have made clear they want to avoid in the current government-funding negotiations. On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Schumer didn’t mention health benefits for miners, but said talks with Republicans over the impending government funding deadline were going well. “What I’ve said, and I think there’s quiet agreement in the four corners, is that if the president doesn’t interfere and insist on poison-pill amendments being shoved down the throat of Congress, we can come up with an agreement,” Schumer said. “Our Republican colleagues know that since they control the House, and the Senate and the White House, a shutdown would fall on their shoulders, and they don’t want it.”It should be an easy lift for Republicans with a president in the White House that campaigned heavily to help save miners livelihoods, but there could be political calculations in play. If a 20-month extension is all that is passed, benefits will expire as voters head to the polls in November 2018 ― when Manchin, Brown, and other coal-state Democrats are up for re-election. The provision on the miners’ health coverage would cost $1.9 billion, but the Congressional Budget Office found that a bill authored by Manchin and backed by Capito, Brown and others ― dubbed the Miners Protection Act ― would save the government $74 million over the 10-year life of the legislation. That bill also provides a fix for the pension benefits and would be paid for by increasing customs fees on imported goods.Matt Fuller contributed reporting."

Proposes Bill With Hope That More Sexual Assault Survivors Will Get Justice,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dc-proposes-bill-with-hope-that-more-sexual-assault-survivors-will-get-justice_us_58f10dabe4b0b9e9848ba2b0,"“We know that when victims and survivors feel supported they are more likely to engage with the criminal justice system.""",2017-04-19,"Mayor Muriel Bowser delivers her inaugural speech on January 2, 2015. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f10e432600003600c45bf6.jpeg?cache=Qt9zHaOlAq&ops=crop_0_347_5193_2902%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On April 13, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed legislation that would expand the rights of survivors of sexual violence. The Washington Post reported that the Sexual Assault Victims’ Rights Amendment Act of 2017 was crafted after a year-long deliberation of an independent task force, made up of multidisciplinary professionals. The goal of the task force was to reflect on national best practices for sexual assault cases and to make recommendations about how the District of Columbia could improve its response to sexual violence. The legislation builds on the Sexual Assault Victims’ Rights Act of 2014, adding multiple provisions that help survivors preserve rape kits, require prosecutors to provide a reason to the victim about their decision not to prosecute a case, and expand the right of a victim to have an advocate present during interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement. The bill also clarifies a victim’s right to compensation under existing insurance policies and it expands the definition of what constitutes a sexual assault crime by including the removal of a person’s clothing without their consent. Currently in D.C., a sexual assault survivor is defined as anyone who is 18 years or older who’s experienced sexual violence. With Mayor Bowser’s new legislation, people as young as 12 years old who experience sexual assault would be considered victims by law. Children under the age of 12 are still considered sexual assault victims, but they do not have the same legal right to an advocate that victims 12 and older have. They could still access support through victim services networks, but law enforcement and courthouses are not legally bound to offer children under 12 a sexual assault advocate. The director of D.C.’s Office of Victim Services, Michelle Garcia, explained to The Huffington Post why this provision is so significant.“It would afford teenagers the same rights that adults have in the aftermath of a sexual assault, and that includes the right to have an advocate,” Garcia said. “Someone who could provide support, information and help the victims and their families navigate the criminal justice system. Every right an adult would have, a teenager would have as well.” This expanded definition is relatively common among states, Garcia said. D.C. is simply catching up. Kristen Houser, the chief public affairs officer for the National Sexual Violence Research Center, spoke with The Huffington Post about the importance of having a third-party advocate whose main role in the process is to support the survivor ― something that victims under 18 weren’t previously offered after an assault. “There’s no guaranteed outcome in the criminal justice system ― if there’s a plea, if someone doesn’t show up, if there’s an acquittal, if it keeps getting stalled and rescheduled,” Houser said. “Somebody who’s working with the court system is working with the court’s schedule, and that advocacy is dependent upon a victim being involved in a court case. In reality, a victim and their family may need support greater than what the court system can provide while they’re in it. And that can extend long beyond the resolution of the case, no matter which way it goes.”The goal of the bill, Garcia said, is to give more support to survivors, making it less painful for them to navigate the court system and therefore easier to hold perpetrators accountable.First and foremost, the bill is about affording survivors’ rights to ensure that systems are “treating victims and survivors with fairness, dignity and respect,” Garcia explained. “We know that when victims and survivors feel supported,” Garcia said, “they are more likely to engage with and stay engaged with the criminal justice system which leads to increased offender accountability.” Houser pointed to the “ripple effect” of trauma that families often experience when a teenager is sexually assaulted. “When you have juveniles who have been victimized, it has a massive ripple effect through the family,” she said. “So having some guarantee of rights to access services from organizations that may be better equipped to meet the family’s needs can really benefit. It benefits not just the victim and their family, but when you have somebody who’s better supported and understands the next step in the process, it can absolutely help them do well in terms of the role of testifying in a criminal case.” "

In February, shortly after DeVos was confirmed, the pair decided they would travel to a school of the other’s choice.The goal, according to the American Federation of Teachers, is to show DeVos the possibilities of great public schools, as opposed to charter schools and private schools. DeVos also invited Weingarten to visit a school with her ― such as a charter school ― although such a visit has not yet been announced. The pair will be touring Van Wert City Schools, a public school district in Ohio. While the school district has a mixed academic record, it has deeply invested in strategies that engage community members and serve the social and emotional needs of children. It is an example of a school district that would be hurt by the passage of Trump’s proposed education budget, which slashes federal funding for education by $9 billion, according to an op-ed Weingarten wrote in a local Ohio outlet, the Times Bulletin Media. “When the federal budget gets cut and the state can’t make up the difference, the burden lands on the local district. But here in Van Wert, teachers and school officials have already stretched the budget as far as possible. Anything cut now would destroy the programs and strategies that make Van Wert’s schools great,” wrote Weingarten. Van Wert City Schools have high graduation rates and received stellar marks for students’ academic growth on a report card issued by the state. However, on that same report card, the school system received poor grades for elementary school literacy rates and standardized test scores. But the school district, in which most high school students qualify for free or reduced price lunch, has implemented a number of effective strategies, like pre-kindergarten and project-based learning, according to Weingarten’s op-ed. Located in rural Ohio ― in a county that voted heavily for Trump ― it also represents the type of district that might not benefit from the increased school choice programs DeVos favors. DeVos is a major proponent of charter schools and private school choice programs. However, rural districts like Van Wert lack the infrastructure to easily implement such programs. Notably, DeVos received opposition from two Republican senators during her confirmation process because of the issues school choice programs pose in rural districts.Jeff Hood, the president of the local Van Wert Federation of Teachers, suggested to Weingarten in February that DeVos come visit the district, according to the Toledo Blade. He said he hopes the visit is about education, as opposed to politics, but suggested DeVos’ agenda might not be in line with Van Wert residents’ priorities. “The people who put Donald Trump in office live in Van Wert County, and they live in all the other ‘Van Werts,’” Hood told the outlet. “Charter schools and private schools and vouchers are not going to mean much to people in Van Wert.”"

The clerk seat became available following the February death of incumbent Republican Michèle McQuigg.Miller outspent Smith 6 to 1, according to the Prince William Times.The Democratic Party of Virginia touted Smith’s victory as a sign of the momentum it has ahead of November elections for governor and seats in the House of Delegates.“Tonight’s victory is further testament to the rising tide of the resistance,” state party Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a statement. “Jackie Smith’s victory is a referendum on Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Richmond. Virginia Democrats are energized and organized, and tonight we outperformed a state legislator with more than four times as much money as our nominee. This is the beginning of the end: the age of Trump didn’t even last 100 days.”Backlash to President Donald Trump in the state has already enabled Democrats to field challengers in an unusually high number of Republican-held legislative seats, including 17 GOP-controlled districts that Hillary Clinton won. In Alabama, Democrats maintained their control over state House District 67. Democrat Prince Chestnut, an attorney, defeated independent Toby Gordon.Chestnut will fill a seat vacated by Democrat Darrio Melton after Melton was elected mayor of Selma in November.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that Jackson Miller was not running for re-election to his House seat this year. He filed to run in that primary as well. A previous headline also stated incorrectly that the Republican candidate was “unseated.” Neither candidate was an incumbent."
64,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Rise Laid The Groundwork For Bill O'Reilly's Fall,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-trump-sexual-harassment_us_58f789c8e4b029063d360141,The election of a man with a history of sexual misconduct unleashed a massive backlash. O'Reilly is feeling it.,2017-04-19,Donald Trump and Bill O'Reilly drink milkshakes at a New York Yankees game in 2010.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f78a9b1b0000320016c5a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bill O’Reilly weathered sexual harassment charges for more than a decade, but not this time: Fox News has fired the controversial host.The media company was under extreme pressure from advertisers, protesters and its own employees ― all fed up with a company culture that enabled O’Reilly’s misbehavior for too long.But behind all that was the growing power of women, more emboldened than ever before, to protest sexual harassment and assault. For this, at least in part, we can thank President Donald Trump. Trump’s surprise victory in November sparked a massive wave of energy among progressives, activists and especially women, outraged that the reality TV star had won office despite more than a dozen sexual assault accusations, a record of strikingly misogynistic comments and insults, and a damning video in which he boasted of grabbing women by their genitals and kissing them without consent.You’d think that Trump’s election would have sent the message that speaking up doesn’t matter. Instead, it galvanized an already growing movement.“I never thought a man who openly bragged about committing sexual assault could get elected,” said Karin Roland, chief campaigns officer for UltraViolet, a women’s group that helped organize several anti-O’Reilly petitions and protests at Fox News headquarters in New York on Tuesday.“Women are now trying to figure out how to make [sexual misconduct] something that would doom a future presidential candidate or aspiring athlete or a Fox News host,” Roland said.Pussy-gate was supposed to doom Trump. Last summer, after the tape of his bragging about grabbing women by the genitals was made public, thousands of women shared their own stories of sexual assault on Twitter and other social media. It was a natural next step. For at least the past couple of years, more and more women have been coming forward to tell their own stories of sexual assault and harassment. Long-silenced women told horrifying stories about Bill Cosby in 2015, for example. Roland also pointed to the furor over Stanford student Brock Turner, who served just three months of a lenient six-month sentence for sexual assault last year. His victim bravely spoke up.Trump’s election only added fuel to the fire.“Sometimes you have to take a step back to take two steps forward,” said Amy Siskind, president of The New Agenda, a nonprofit women’s group. She’s been working on women’s issues for close to a decade, after leaving a career on Wall Street. “There is a level of engagement and awakening now,” she said. “I’ve never seen anything like it before.” The pressure on Fox News to dump O’Reilly began in earnest soon after a bombshell New York Times report on April 1 revealed that the network and the news host had together paid out $13 million to five different women who accused him of inappropriate behavior over a decade and a half. The women alleged that O’Reilly had targeted them with verbal abuse and lewd comments ― even phone calls in which he could apparently be heard masturbating.Two of the O’Reilly settlements happened after Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes was ousted from the company. Female employees had accused Ailes of sexual misdeeds, including firing host Gretchen Carlson after she declined his sexual advances. At the time, Fox said it would no longer tolerate this kind of misconduct.The New York Times story was a tipping point for advertisers, said Rashad Robinson, executive director of the racial justice nonprofit Color of Change. His group had been pressing companies to stop running ads on “The O’Reilly Factor” for two years, after reports emerged that the news host had lied about being attacked by protesters during riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s. Another group that got on Fox’s case, Sleeping Giants, is actually a loosely organized group of volunteers who came together after Trump’s win to push advertisers to abandon Breitbart News.The Times story was hard for advertisers to ignore, Robinson said. As more of them pulled their spots from O’Reilly’s show ― over 80 have dropped out ― the media ramped up its coverage, Robinson said.Recently, Color of Change created a call line for Fox News employees to report harassment and placed ads online that geo-targeted social media users at Fox headquarters. Robinson hoped the ads were hard for Fox’s human relations department to ignore. “We wanted to encourage employees to speak out,” he said.The ads look like this:On Tuesday night, O’Reilly dismissed the idea that Americans were angry at him for good reason. In a statement, his lawyer said they had “uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying O’Reilly for political and financial reasons.” Yet to come: the promised “irrefutable evidence” of that.But more Fox News employees and contributors have been talking, activists say. Earlier on Tuesday, a black woman who’d once worked at the network said O’Reilly had called her “hot chocolate” and made repeated comments about her appearance.Adding to the pressure on Fox was Megyn Kelly’s example: The rising star left the company in January in part because of O’Reilly’s behavior. “Women are fired up,” Roland said.Get more news and opinion on gender and economics from Emily Peck in her newsletter.

The sellers were Jesuits, part of the Catholic religious order that helped establish Georgetown University.The enslaved people were men, women, and children whose families would soon be ripped apart so that the college could pay off its debts.Just 178 years later, the current leader of that religious order stood in front of more than 100 descendants of those slaves and repented for his predecessors’ sins. “We have greatly sinned, in our thoughts and in our words, in what we have done, and what we have failed to do,“ Rev. Timothy Kesicki, president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States said on Tuesday.“We are profoundly sorry — it is our very enslavement of another, our very ownership of another, culminating in the tragic sale of 272 women, men, and children that remains with us to this day, trapping us in a historic truth, for which we implore mercy and justice, hope and healing.”The formal apology was part of a service of “Remembrance, Contrition and Hope” held on Tuesday at Georgetown University. The service was hosted by the university, the Jesuit order, formally known as the Society of Jesus, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. Onita Estes-Hicks, whose great-grandparents were part of the 272 individuals sold by Georgetown University, had often wondered why her family was Catholic. Some relatives had been named Nace, after Ignatius of Loyola, who founded the Jesuit order.“We’re tied to [the Jesuits] by name, by rosaries and by religion,” Estes-Hicks told CNN.Maryland’s Jesuit priests required slaves to attend Mass, taught them to pray the rosary, and allowed them to participate in the sacraments, such as Eucharist and marriage. But the priests’ apparent concern for enslaved people’s spiritual welfare didn’t extend to concern for their physical bodies and liberation.Estes-Hicks said she had been shocked to find out that Catholic priests had sold her ancestors. For her, the formal apology was just a beginning. “I could see a lot of the descendants were in tears,” she told CNN. “This is all new territory. It’s moving something around in American history, in family history and in ourselves.”During the service on Tuesday, another descendant of the 272 enslaved people, Sandra Green Thomas, said that the apology was a positive step, but just the beginning ― since the pain of her ancestors is still present.“Their pain is unparalleled, their pain is still here, it burns in the soul of every person of African descent in the United States, it lives in people, some of whom have no knowledge of its origins, but who cope with the ever-present longing and lack it causes,” said Thomas.“And so, I return. No, we the descendants return to the home place, to our ancestor’s home place acknowledging contrition, offering forgiveness, hoping for penance, and more importantly seeking justice for them and ourselves.”Georgetown President John J. DeGioia called slavery the “original evil of our Republic ― an evil that our university was complicit in.”“[It was] a sin that tore apart families,” DeGioia said during the service, “that through great violence, denied and rejected the dignity and humanity of our fellow sisters and brothers. We lay this truth bare – in sorrowful apology and communal reckoning.”When Jesuit priests arrived in Maryland in the 1600s, they used profits from plantations to help fund their ministries. These plantations were first manned by indentured servants. But as that labor supply ran dry, the Jesuits turned to slaves, who were often donated by parishioners. In its early days, Georgetown University depended on the labor of these enslaved men and women to support the college. Over the past year, the university has been confronting its historic role in the the slave trade and seeking ways to move towards reconciliation. Acknowledging demands from its students, the university has also renamed two buildings that formally bore the names of Georgetown presidents Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry, who were involved in the sale. One building was dedicated on Tuesday to Isaac Hawkins, the first of the 272 people who appear on a list of individuals for sale drafted by Mulledy. The second was renamed in honor of Anne Marie Becraft, a 19th-century free woman of color who founded one of Georgetown’s first schools for black girls and later became one of the United States’ first black nuns. Along with the public demonstration of repentance, the college also held private dialogue and vigils with descendants. During a tree ceremony and libation ritual, participants spread soil from West Oak Plantation in Louisiana, where descendants of Isaac Hawkins were forced to work, over the roots of a white oak tree.Many of the American Ivy League schools have ties to the slave trade. But historians say the 1838 sale organized by Jesuits at Georgetown University stands out for the large number of people exchanged for money. A group of Georgetown professors and students have worked together over the past year to trace the living descendants of the men and women who were sold to keep the school running. The group has helped establish a new department of African American studies, and pushed for greater diversity on campus. Georgetown has previously announced that it would give descendants preferential treatment in its admissions process. Delores Williams Johnson, a descendant of Isaac Hawkins who lives in Illinois, told Religion News Service that she wasn’t ready to forgive. “I think in one sense it has taken a lot of effort on the descendants’ parts to push Georgetown and the Jesuits to acknowledge us and not dictate to us,” said Williams Johnson. “There has to be ongoing meaningful conversation.” "

But new freestyle rap-based game Vers, developed by 21-year-old Northeastern University entrepreneurship student Jerry Spatch, is offering people a chance to experiment with the rap form. Spatch, who is originally from Southern California, said the idea for the game was sparked from freestyling at college parties. “Afterwards people would come up to me and say things like, ‘That’s amazing, how does your mind work so fast?’” Spatch told The Huffington Post. “And I started to think, ‘If I can do this, why can’t they?’ Freestyling is a mental exercise, it’s not like a piano or guitar where you have to strategically train your fingers.”Outside of his realization that people were fascinated by freestyles, Vers is also a product of Spatch’s entrepreneurial mindset. “The resolution was that if I could give people what a freestyle rapper does in their head and then make it as fun and accessible as possible, it could be a pretty great game,” he said. The Kickstarter for Spatch’s game launched on Wednesday, but the game is available to download and print on the website. He hopes to raise $10,000 for the game’s production. “What I like about freestyling is that it’s a primarily idea-based form of expression,” he said. “You’re really just connecting the concepts in your head and putting those into rhymes.”In the game, players are given a category card and a base card that will inspire the freestyle. The base card lists the words to be used in the rap whereas the category card determines what the freestyle is about. If players think someone’s bars are weak, the freestyler has to try again until they drop something semi-impressive. “Anybody can rap with this game as long as you can read the words on the card and you can think,” Spatch said in a video descriptor for the game. “The process is like giving people a crayon and a piece of paper and then letting them do what they want with it. One person might draw a cow, another might draw a horse, and the last might melt the crayon and use the paper as a stem to make a candle,” Spatch said. “Freestyling is like that except the crayon and paper are all the thoughts, feelings and ideas you have.”Not only is Spatch allowing others to try their hand at what’s otherwise a mysterious art form, he’s bringing some very necessary diversity to the gaming industry. “When you look at the tabletop segment, it’s extremely, extremely non-diverse and it has a very noticeable impact on the games produced,” Spatch said. (Tabletop games are a reference to card, board and dice games, among others, that can be played on a flat surface and are distinguishable from video games). Spatch said when browsing Kickstarter, he mostly sees fundraising campaigns for games involving dragons, space, cowboys, dungeons or medieval times.“It’s very likely the majority of the development team [for these games], and possibly the whole, is not representative of the culture,” he said. “More diverse people in games would likely mean more diverse and relevant games; as opposed to the current state of the industry, where it’s saturated with a lot of the same.”Lack of diversity isn’t limited to tabletop games. According to a Newsweek article published last year, which cites the International Game Developers Association, only 3 percent of developers in the video gaming industry are black. “No one really talks about this because it’s games, but we really do not have a diverse influx,” Spatch said.

69,POLITICS,Supreme Court Shows Soft Spot For Church Denied Public Funding For Playground,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-missouri-religious-school_us_58f781efe4b0de5bac42ca01,Even some of the more liberal justices signaled the state of Missouri may have gone too far against a religious school.,2017-04-19,The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard a case about a religious preschool that was rejected from a state program that provides reimbursement grants for purchases of rubberized surface material for children's playgrounds.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f7823c2600003596c467cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court doesn’t always see eye to eye when messy issues of church and state collide. But what if it’s schoolchildren who lose out if the court gets it wrong? A majority of the justices on Wednesday seemed to recognize that the state of Missouri may have discriminated against a church that was shut out of a competitive funding program open to schools wishing to resurface their playgrounds with tire scraps. Under the state’s constitution, no public funding may go to “any church, sect or denomination of religion.”The case, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, calls into question the state’s application of that provision, which the church claims violates the federal Constitution. The Supreme Court has upheld similar funding prohibitions in the past, but here the church insists that its school was denied funding solely on account of its religious status — and that the funds it sought for tire scraps should’ve been granted because they wouldn’t be used for religious instruction.Given the stakes of the case, one of the biggest church-state disputes the Supreme Court has heard in the past decade, all eyes were on Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court’s newest member and someone whose record suggests a sympathy for religious rights.But it turned out the rookie justice only played a minor role in the hearing, intervening toward the end of an hourlong session in which even some of the more liberal justices appeared ready to recognize that there are constitutional limits to denying funding to religious schools for something that isn’t exactly sectarian: the type of surface upon which children play.When Justice Elena Kagan told the lawyer representing Missouri that the state’s treatment of the church school appears to be “a clear burden of a constitutional right,” it became apparent that maybe the dispute isn’t as close as some observers anticipated.“As long as you’re using the money for playground services, you’re not disentitled from that program because you’re a religious institution doing religious things,” Kagan said. “And I would have thought that that’s a pretty strong principle in our constitutional law. And how is that the State says that that’s not violated here?”Justice Stephen Breyer wondered if a Constitution that protects the free exercise of religion would tolerate a state to give everyone law enforcement, public health or fire department protections except churches.“If it does not permit a law that pays money out of the treasury for the health of the children in the church, school, or even going to church, how does it permit Missouri to deny money to the same place for helping children not fall in the playground, cut their knees, get tetanus, break a leg, et cetera?” Breyer asked. “What’s the difference?”The Supreme Court itself sent signals that the case could be a divisive one. The justices agreed to hear it before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year, and it wasn’t until President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch to replace him that the court decided it to schedule it for oral arguments — an indication that maybe the powers that be at the court wanted a fully staffed bench before the justices entertained the challenge.The case was complicated further by a changing of the guard in Missouri’s governor’s mansion. In an eleventh-hour move last week, Gov. Eric Greitens (R) announced that the state would begin accepting grant applications like the kind Trinity Lutheran was denied. The high court asked both sides in the case if that switch in positions rendered the case moot, but everyone agreed that the justices should go ahead and decide it anyway.David Cortman, the lawyer representing the church, told the justices that Greitens’ shift was akin to “policy by Facebook or press release.” He suggested that the Supreme Court should resolve the dispute because constitutional rights shouldn’t be subject to changes in “political winds.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who emerged as the strongest defender of Missouri’s position, pointed out that 39 states have constitutional amendments in their books that erect stronger church-state barriers for public funding than the federal Constitution.“One would think that if there’s play in the joints” of the Constitution’s religion clauses, Sotomayor said, quoting language from a 2004 case, “that that would include the concept that states are free to say we don’t want to spend money from the public fisc on houses of worship.”“This church is not going to close its religious practices or its doors because its playground doesn’t have these tires,” Sotomayor added. “No one is asking the church to change its beliefs. In fact, no one is asking the church as a condition ... ‘Don’t use what we give you for religious purposes’ — they’re not even doing that. They’re just saying we don’t want to be involved with the church.”James Layton, who served as Missouri’s solicitor general until January but was retained by state officials to defend the funding program, said the state takes a hard stance with churches because it doesn’t want to be perceived as playing favorites — a kind of religious endorsement that by itself may be unconstitutional.“We don’t want to be in a position ... where we are selecting among churches,” he said. “We don’t want to be in a position where we are making a visible, physical improvement on church property.”But based on how several justices responded to Missouri’s line-drawing in the case — singling out Trinity Lutheran for no other reason than it was a church running a school — the Supreme Court may very well conclude that states should be more careful when drawing “status-based” lines in the first place.“So long as the money is granted based on neutral criteria that are faithfully applied, I don’t know how you can draw a distinction between a program that’s open to everybody and a selective program,” Justice Samuel Alito said.The Supreme Court is expected to decide Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer by the end of June."

And where Gorsuch could, conceivably, cast the tie-breaking vote.The case’s timing underscores Gorsuch’s importance in the matter: Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, as this Missouri case is known, has been lying dormant on the court’s docket since before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. In January 2016, less than a month before Scalia’s passing, the Supreme Court agreed to consider the dispute — a constitutional challenge to Missouri’s decision to deny funding to a church that had applied for a state grant to resurface its school’s playground with tire scraps. In response, Trinity Lutheran sued the state in federal court, claiming that its Department of Natural Resources discriminated against and violated the church’s right to freely exercise its religion under the U.S. Constitution.“Excluding Trinity Lutheran from the Scrap Tire Program here exhibits an undeniable hostility to religion that offends the Constitution’s essential mandate of religious neutrality,” lawyers for the church charged in a brief filed last April.That was a year ago. But once President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch in January, the court scheduled the dispute for oral arguments in April — perhaps anticipating that the Senate would get around to confirming the new associate justice by then and the Supreme Court would have a full bench.Barry Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a group that advocates for a strong wall between religious freedom and government intrusion, said Gorsuch’s record as an appeals judge suggests where his loyalties might lie in a case of this magnitude.Gorsuch has displayed an “apparent disinterest in preserving what we consider legitimate religious freedom rights and substituting a view that has developed in the last decade or so,” said Lynn, whose group joined with other religious and civil liberties organizations and filed a legal brief supporting Missouri.“We were not happy about Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation,” Lynn added.The Trinity Lutheran case has all the elements of a blockbuster: a sympathetic religious school, claims that Missouri discriminated against it, and a tug-of-war between the federal Constitution and the state’s own charter, which prohibits that public funds be given to “any church, sect or denomination of religion.”Dozens of organizations have also filed briefs in the dispute, and so far Trinity Lutheran appears to have more friends supporting it — the coalition includes major denominations, Christian colleges, members of Congress and conservative-leaning states.Alliance Defending Freedom, the legal advocacy group defending the church before the Supreme Court, wasn’t shy about its endorsement of Gorsuch. In a news release praising his confirmation, the group called him “a natural successor to Justice Scalia.”In an interview, Erik Stanley, a senior attorney with Alliance, pointed to Gorsuch’s record as a judge as a harbinger of how he might approach Wednesday’s hearing.“We do know that Justice Gorsuch has been a friend to religious liberty in the cases that have appeared before him,” Stanley told The Huffington Post. “He’s had the opportunity to rule on religious liberty issues a few times. He’s always been positive to religious liberty. We hope that that continues in this case.”But Stanley added that he hopes “all nine justices” on the Supreme Court see Missouri’s treatment of Trinity Lutheran as “blatant religious status discrimination” — since the program under which its school applied for funds was supposed to be applied neutrally to all schools, no matter their affiliation or lack of one.Gorsuch’s strongest endorsement of religious freedom to date came in none other than the controversial Hobby Lobby case, a religious challenge to the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that employers provide free contraceptive coverage to all employees. Before that case headed to the Supreme Court, the judge wrote a pointed concurrence supporting the Green family, the Hobby Lobby owners who claimed that complying with federal law would be a “substantial” burden on their Christian faith.“As the Greens describe it, it is their personal involvement in facilitating access to devices and drugs that can have the effect of destroying a fertilized human egg that their religious faith holds impermissible,” wrote Gorsuch in 2013. “And as we have seen, it is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious complaint of a faithful adherent, or to decide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes too much moral disapproval on those only indirectly assisting wrongful conduct.”During his confirmation hearings in March, Gorsuch defended his court’s decision in that case, which was later upheld by an ideologically split Supreme Court. The high court ruled that religiously owned corporations were covered by a federal law that limits how the government may burden a person’s exercise of religion.Gorsuch told members of Congress they could always go back to the drawing board and rewrite the law.“It has all of those options available, Senator,” Gorsuch said during an exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) during his hearings. “And if we got it wrong, I’m sorry. But we did our level best, and we were affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. And it’s a dialog — like any statutory dialog between Congress and the courts.”In the Trinity Lutheran case, the stakes are even higher because a majority of the Supreme Court could be convinced to read the First Amendment of the Constitution as providing a ceiling for how states may restrict funding to churches and religiously affiliated entities.The state of Missouri, at least until a new governor took office in January, maintained that its constitution treats all churches equally — and that its funding prohibition shouldn’t be seen as proof of religious bigotry.“Trinity Lutheran remains free, without any public subsidy, to worship, teach, pray, and practice any other aspect of its faith however it wishes,” read the brief signed by lawyers from its prior administration. “The State merely declines to offer financial support.”In 2004, the Supreme Court upheld a similar Washington State constitutional provision that denied funding to college students pursuing “devotional” theological studies. But the court that decided that case looked a lot different than the present court — which has since decided Hobby Lobby and has been more amenable to religious claims.Gregory Lipper, a former church-state litigator with Americans United who is now in private practice, said things could continue down that path now that Gorsuch is on the court.“He may well cast the decisive vote holding that Missouri taxpayers are required to fund the church’s renovations,” he said."
71,POLITICS,Aaron Hernandez's Death Highlights A Serious Problem,Dana Liebelson and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aaron-hernandez-suicide-prison_us_58f7b124e4b029063d3661bf,The latest available federal data showed that prison suicides were on the rise in 2014.,2017-04-19,Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez sits at the defense table during his double murder trial in Boston on March 2.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f7b28f1b0000320016c657.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It’s a familiar story: An inmate takes his or her life inside a prison or jail, and family and loved ones are left wondering how the incident possibly could have happened. This time, the public interest is even higher ― one of the most famous prisoners in America, former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, was found dead in his cell on Wednesday morning, according to the Massachusetts Department of Correction.Hernandez, 27, was serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee. That sentence was handed down in 2015, but last Friday, he was found not guilty of a separate 2012 double murder. (Note: This article discusses some of the details of the means by which Hernandez killed himself.)It’s a misconception that there is nothing prisons and jails can do about suicides in custody. Although “not all inmate suicides are preventable, many of them are,” said Lindsay Hayes, a national expert on this issue who previously consulted with the Massachusetts Department of Correction. Hayes also noted that he was “confident” that the agency and its health care provider will conduct comprehensive investigations into Hernandez’s death, and that “should include a transparent determination as to whether or not his death was preventable.”As the circumstances unfold, there are a number of factors that may help answer that question: Were there any warning signs, and if so, should Hernandez have been put on suicide watch? Did he receive appropriate mental health screening and treatment, if warranted? How often was he supposed to be checked on, and when was his last contact with a correctional officer? Was his prison cell designed with suicide prevention in mind, or retrofitted to reduce ligature points an inmate could use to hang himself? In the wake of Hernandez’s death, his family is seeking a probe. His former agent said he didn’t believe that Hernandez would kill himself. (It’s not uncommon for friends and family members to be skeptical that a loved one would ever take his or her own life.) There were 47 suicides in Massachusetts prisons between 2001 and 2014, according to federal data. From 2001-2014, the suicide mortality rate in Massachusetts state prisons was 32 per 100,000 inmates, double the national average of 16 per 100,000 over that timeframe. There were six suicides in 2014, but just one suicide in 2015 and two in 2016, according to Massachusetts Department of Correction data.The suicide rate in jails is much higher than it is in prison. In state prisons throughout the country, that rate was 20 deaths per 100,000 inmates in 2014, compared to 50 deaths per 100,000 inmates in local jails, according to Bureau of Justice statistics. Still, prison suicides appear to be on the rise in recent years. The percentage of suicides in state prisons in 2014 was the highest recorded since 2001, and represented a 30 percent jump from 2013 to 2014 ― from 192 deaths in 2013 to 249 deaths in 2014. The suicide death rate in 2014 ― 20 suicides per 100,000 inmates ― was the highest rate recorded since 2001.Part of the discrepancy between prisons and jails is due to the nature of the confinement. Unlike prisons, jails hold inmates for only short periods of time, and they are dealing with people who may not be used to the shock of confinement, could be withdrawing from drugs or alcohol, and have unknown mental health histories. (A Huffington Post investigation found that nearly a third of jail deaths over a year-long period occurred in the first 72 hours after booking.) Hernandez wasn’t new to confinement: He was already serving a sentence of life without parole. But his apparent suicide occurred less than a week after he was acquitted on separate charges stemming from the murder of two other people. During the trial, he had contact with his family — including his 4-year-old daughter — in a different capacity than he would have once back in prison. That kind of event is a trigger “that could increase his risk of harming himself,” says Eric Balaban, a senior staff counsel with the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. That raises the question of whether Hernandez’s mental health status was evaluated during or after the trial. A prison spokesman told the Boston Globe that Hernandez had not been on a suicide watch and did not suggest that he planned to harm himself, although it’s not clear on what evaluation that was based. (A Massachusetts Department of Correction spokesperson did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s list of questions about Hernandez’s death.) The Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, where Hernandez was held, is a 500,000 square foot maximum-security facility that opened in 1998 at a cost of more than $100 million. It has more than 1,000 cells and 366 cameras. Earlier this year, it was the site of a prison riot where inmates were “getting ready for war,” in the words of one official.Leslie Walker, the executive director of Prisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts, told the New York Times on Wednesday that she considered the prison “troubled” and noted they were “very concerned” about it. The group sued the state on behalf of inmates in December for allegedly unlawfully segregating mentally ill inmates in solitary confinement, which can exacerbate mental health issues and make inmates more likely to commit new crimes when they’re released. The suit alleged that Department of Correction officials were downgrading the diagnoses of mentally ill inmates, making them eligible to place in segregation. The physical plan of a prison, as well as whether inmates have direct supervision from staff, can also be key factors in preventing suicides. We do not yet know how often Hernandez was supposed to be checked on by staff, or when he actually was.Hernandez was found hanging by a bedsheet tied to the cell window, and it’s unclear whether the window had been designed to prevent suicide. For the cell window to be suicide-resistant, any security bars should have been flush with the window or covered, or the gap between the bars and the window should have been eliminated, according to a guide issued by Hayes on suicide-resistant cells. Hernandez was also in a single cell in a general population unit at the time of his death, according to prison officials, which can also be a risk factor.As the investigation into Hernandez’s death is ongoing, authorities and Hernandez’s family are still searching for answers. “There were no conversations or correspondence from Aaron to his family or legal team that would have indicated anything like this was possible,” said Jose Baez, a lawyer for Hernandez.UPDATE: April 20 ― Hernandez’s death was ruled a suicide, officials in Massacusetts announced Thursday. A statement from the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office said cardboard had been jammed in the door tracks of Hernandez’s cell and there were no signs of a struggle. Three handwritten notes were found next to a Bible in his cell, where Hernandez had been from 8 p.m. until he was found dead at 3:03 a.m., according to the statement.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

As there is no existing reliable diagnostic test for the disease, a feather is run over the skin to detect areas of numbness, which is indicative of the nerve damage caused by leprosy.Commonly thought to be a disease of the ancient past, leprosy continues to affect thousands of people each year. Between 200,000 and 250,000 new patients are diagnosed annually.Thanks to medical advances, leprosy can be treated with multi-drug therapy (MDT) once diagnosed. Not only is MDT effective at curing leprosy, it helps reduce transmission and prevent permanent disability. Since this therapy became freely available worldwide, there has been a dramatic decrease in annual diagnoses of leprosy. Yet it can only be administered once a diagnosis has been made, and as it can take up to 20 years before patients become symptomatic, during this time leprosy can be unknowingly transmitted.In the absence of a better diagnostic tool, the most effective way to interrupt transmission and eliminate leprosy is contact tracing.Contact tracing identifies and diagnoses people who may have come into contact with an infected person, which helps toward earlier diagnosis. This is one of the approaches the Novartis Foundation is taking to help work toward final elimination of the disease.In 2014, the Novartis Foundation and its partners launched the leprosy post-exposure prophylaxis (LPEP) program. This program focuses on interrupting the transmission of leprosy by ensuring all those who may have been exposed are examined and offered a post-exposure prophylaxis, which can reduce the risk of developing leprosy by 50-60%.Since its launch, LPEP has been expanded to Indonesia, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Tanzania and Sri Lanka, while Brazil and Cambodia have introduced similar approaches.

The Defense of Marriage Act still stood, and most states barred same-sex marriage. Transgender Americans remained all but invisible, our elders too often isolated, and our youth too often ostracized and endangered. LGBTQ nonprofit organizations were just starting to recover from the Great Recession.That time of acute need gave birth to that first Give OUT Day. Simply put, LGBTQ nonprofits lacked the funds they required to advocate for our rights and meet our community’s needs. Meanwhile, many LGBT people of good heart didn’t know how easy – and rewarding – it can be to support their work.Give OUT Day brought our community’s nonprofits and people of good heart together – all across the country, on a single day dedicated to giving to the LGBTQ community. It’s not, of course, that giving is alien to our community. Give OUT Day builds on a rich, decades-long tradition of individual donors funding every step in this struggle, from bar fundraisers and penny jars to gala fundraisers and major gifts. But research from Horizons Foundation and the Movement Advancement Project suggests that less than 5% of LGBTQ people are giving to our community’s nonprofits.But Give OUT Day brings all of us, coast to coast, together for one common purpose – and that is very new. What’s more, it’s been a great success. Since 2013, more than 23,000 donors in all 50 states and Puerto Rico have contributed more than $3 million to over 500 organizations, ranging from youth organizations to elder support, from arts groups to social services agencies, from advocacy groups to community centersThe result? Tens of thousands of LGBTQ people – young, old, and all of us in between – have benefited from services, advocacy, and increased visibility that Give OUT Day funds have made possible..We have all read about the spikes in hate crimes, attacks on our LGBT Centers and of course the continued dismantling of the progress we have worked so hard for, from Title IX guidance for trans students to the scores of anti-LGBT bills now being introduced in an emboldened anti-LGBT climate.As the fifth Give OUT Day takes place on April 20, we should note that our movement has made immense progress on many fronts. But not only have the needs so apparent in 2013 – save marriage rights – not diminished significantly, but our community faces grave new challenges as well.An administration actively hostile to LGBTQ Americans now occupies the White House, the Congress, and the great majority of statehouses. Pro-equality executive orders of the Obama Administration are being torn up. America’s proud international voice on LGBTQ rights is being silenced. Across the country, state legislatures are furiously working to limit our rights, especially those of transgender people. Community centers have been vandalized. Hate crimes are up.Many of our organizations are already overwhelmed. And that’s before what are universally expected to be draconian budget cuts start hobbling countless vital social and health programs – cuts that will leave hundreds of thousands of LGBTQ people alone more vulnerable than ever before.We know that we cannot afford to stand, silently, on the sidelines. Many of us have already been out in the streets, showing up to resist, volunteering our time. Many of us have opened our checkbooks, too.Give OUT Day is the perfect opportunity for every LGBTQ person – and every one of our allies – to make sure that our nonprofits have what they require to litigate, educate, and fight for our rights. Give OUT Day is the perfect chance for all of us – together – to ensure that nonprofits have what it takes to help our community, whatever our people’s needs for service, help, and support may be.The reality is that there are many, many compelling calls on people for charitable gifts these days. Many have become even more critical since the elections. It’s been encouraging that a few nationally prominent and crucial organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood have received outpourings of gifts – they’re going to need every penny.Very few, if any, LGBTQ organizations have comparable visibility, or the resources to undertake massive fundraising campaigns. And it’s here that Give OUT Day comes in. Give OUT Day provides LGBTQ nonprofits with a national technology platform – at no cost to them – to reach donors and prospective donors on a single, highly visible day of giving for our community.From shelters for LGBTQ homeless youth, to support hotlines, to lobbying city councils and state legislatures, to providing HIV testing and medication, to community health care for low-income people, there is no part of the country where LGBTQ lives have not been changed for the better by the incredible work that nonprofits are doing each day. Give OUT Day is a chance for all of us to support their work – and to make our community’s voice heard and its power felt.For many of us, monetary donations are the most direct way to support their work. And that means gifts at any level - $25 as much as $2,500. It takes all of us – LGBTQ people and our allies – to fuel the organizations that advocate for and help hundreds of thousands of our brother and sisters, every single day.Our community – our movement – is only as strong as the number of us who step forward to be part of it. Give OUT Day is exactly the same: it is together that we can change laws, heal lives, and ensure that future generations live in equality, dignity, and justice.Please join us.

While teaching a class is nothing out of the ordinary — after all, this is a college — what is unusual is that my participation has been via a prison telephone.Dr. Ade Offuniyin teaches Juvenile Justice: Initiatives to Dismantle the School to Prison Pipeline, in which 20 students are challenged to consider the experiences of young people in the criminal justice system. The class also examines the public policies that lead to the incarceration of youth, while searching for solutions to the problem.Dr. Ofunniyin takes an anthropological approach to understanding the school to prison pipeline. Textbooks include Jean Trounstine’s Boy With a Knife, Dr. Ofunniyin’s Die Not Another, and my own Federal Prison Handbook. Instead of approaching this topic from the perspective of the police state, Dr. Ofunniyin looks closely at the experiences of those who have gone through the process of being incarcerated at a young age. It’s through this angle that I became involved with this class.Virtually all of the readings have concerned those who have served time and struggled to succeed in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The class readings primarily focus on the ugly truth of American criminal justice, while illuminating the occasional success. I am not a student in this class, but having read all of these books (and knowing both of the other authors), it isn’t hard to see how they inspire both a frustration with the system as it exists today and a desire to seek change in it.My participation has largely revolved around the in-class use of my Federal Prison Handbook (Middle Street Publishing, 2017) and my phone calls from the prison into the classroom. These calls are placed through a recorded and monitored inmate telephone system, and are limited to 15 minutes each. It’s quite a sight — one witnessed firsthand by Sandi Tecklenburg, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg’s wife, who is a staunch advocate of area criminal justice reforms. The calls are short, but student engagement is high, with students crowding around the cellphone to ask me questions.The students have asked diverse questions, ranging from my history as a high school student being charged with a crime — for which I take full and complete responsibility — to the use of school resource officers (police stationed in public schools) to race and violence in prison. The students are sometimes surprised by my answers. For example, one student asked about race in prison and was shocked to hear that inmates largely segregate themselves by race. Another was surprised to hear that some prisoners offer legal services behind bars and even have complete law practices in federal prison.While this was just one class at a single school, the fact that I was able to participate really meant something to me. For the most part, I receive nothing but negative feedback as a federal prisoner. The media and prison guards alike tell me that as a former lawbreaker, my life is worth nothing. I am to be despised, distrusted and punished. Yet here, at a college in the bastion of the south, a professor has extended an olive branch. Dr. Ofunniyin made me feel as though I am valuable, and all that was necessary was offering me an opportunity. I have seized this opportunity with gusto. Dr. Ofunniyin’s students aren’t just reading about the problem, they are seeing it and examining it firsthand. This type of innovative approach is to be applauded.Now that my interaction with the class is over, I hope that the students have gained and grown as I have through my participation. A dialogue has been started that has the potential to impact not only their thoughts on the issues surrounding the school-to-prison pipeline, but also their actions now and in the future. Consideration of diverse perspectives is what college should be all about. It’s curious and heartening that such an interaction would occur in the “law-and-order state” of South Carolina. May other college professors be as bold as Dr. Ade Ofunniyin, and as accepting of the voices of diversity as the College of Charleston.Christopher Zoukis is the author of Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Surviving the Federal Bureau of Prisons, College for Convicts: The Case for Higher Education in American Prisons (McFarland & Co., 2014) and Prison Education Guide (Prison Legal News Publishing, 2016).

I was in my late 20s, working as a middle manager in a secondary school, a mortgage, nice car, serious boyfriend - all of the things that you fantasise about when you are younger that should make for a happy adult life. I often day dreamed about going to see more of the world. People like me, with responsibilities and financial commitments, don’t up and leave their life to embark on a journey of travel though - so it remained a dormant day dream for a number of years.I began to feel like I was already living a life of regret by not experiencing more of the world. The discontent grew as I realised that there was more to life than what I was seeing and experiencing, day in and day out and I felt trapped in the life I had created. In 2010, I decided it was now or never and took a leap of faith and booked a round the world ticket. Don’t get me wrong, some tough decision’s had to be made - my relationship ended as a result of my decision , I quit a good job, I sold my car and handed over my house to my then partner. I asked numerous people to come with me on the trip but nothing ever solidly materialised. So, in September 2011, I got on a plane to New Delhi, India, alone. That was 7 years ago and in the last 7 years I have visited parts of the world I used to daydream about but genuinely never thought I would make it. The majority of the time I have taken these journeys alone.Embarking on a solo travel adventure, whether short term or long term can be a fearful thought and this fear can often discourage people from doing what they dream of doing. Here is a collection of my thoughts and experiences designed to help anyone who is unsure about taking the plunge and going travelling for a week, for two weeks, for a month or for a year and beyond, alone.1. Let go of the fear.I found the biggest barrier was fear. I had many fears; of going it alone in a big and scary world, of being kidnapped like in the film Taken, only my Dad wasn’t international bad ass Liam Neeson, ready to track me down and save me (although I am sure he would have tried!) It was fear that dominated me and it was fear that was preventing me from taking that next step. I then started to think about regret and how much I would regret not seeing the Taj Mahal or the Great Wall of China - the fear of going soon turned into fear of living life with that regret. I accepted that my life, as I knew it, with a few tweaks here and there would be ready and waiting for me and at anytime I could return. I was only a flight or two away from my comfort zone. The job could be replaced, the house, replaced, the car, replaced.2. Don’t wait on anyone else ― book the trip. If I had waited on other people to join me on my travels I would not have seen and experienced half of the places I have, in fact I would probably still be waiting now. All it comes down to is myself and whether or not I want to go. The more time I have to think, the more I will talk myself out of it - in the end, booking that ticket solidifies things and makes the decision real. By just booking it, the decision is made.3. Stay in hostels and guesthouses.I had been abroad before, mainly package holidays with friends and family, never alone, never branching out into the unknown like I did boarding that plane on September 1st 2011 to Delhi, India and I was absolutely f*****g terrified. However, as soon I got out of the airport, I had a hostel booked and I made my way there and the truth is; you are never really alone when you travel solo and I learnt this immediately. As soon as I got to my hostel I met and made friends with another solo traveller and that was the exact story for every place I have ever traveled to. Meeting others - completing their own travelling dream, some alone, some with companions but the glue that seems to hold all of that together is hostels and guesthouses. Love them or hate them, you are guaranteed to make friends and have guaranteed help and assistance from the staff. They make the initial experience far less daunting and scary.4. Plan ahead but don’t over plan.When I decided to go it alone I thought at first I had to have everything planned out, a precise itinerary I would follow day to day. Where I would stay, where I would go, what I would be doing. The reality is you do need to plan ahead - flights, accommodations at times, big trips you want to take but actually the beauty of solo travel is liberating because you are free to pick and choose where you go. I learnt very quickly that listening to the locals and other travellers meant I often change my plans and end up visiting places I had never even heard of. It is better to have that kind of freedom rather than a restricted, rigid schedule and itinerary.4. Make friends from all around the world.I have met so many wonderful people from all walks of life, different cultures, different countries that I am now proud to call friends. It has been one of the biggest perks of traveling ― making friends and sharing invaluable life experiences. I have learnt so much from these people about their own cultures and understandings of life. Friendships made while traveling are a blessing.5. Learn and grow from cultural differences.This seems very straight forward but experiencing cultural differences opened my mind. I had grown up in a small town in the middle of England with a very strong sense of what I perceived to be right and wrong and good and bad. There were times when I was seeing things that I was in absolute awe of and other times left me deeply disturbed but learning about different cultures through experiences made me more knowledgeable of the world as a result.6. Become truly independent and self reliant.When I travel alone I have to learn to rely on myself. I have no choice. I learn so many new skills and life tools I never knew I had. I feel independent and I learn so much about myself as a result. Who knew I was able to navigate myself around the world, from border to border with only one bag and passport. It is a liberating and exhilarating experience. When you go it alone you only have yourself to answer to and that is the beauty of it all.Solo travel is a beautiful thing, every time I go somewhere new I get so much from the experience that benefits me as a human being - however being safe, careful and not reckless is imperative for successful solo travel.Seven years ago I dreamed of the Far East, Machu Pichhu, seeing Mount Everest and the Taj Mahal - now those dreams have become a reality that I made true for myself. I am so grateful I made that decision in 2010 that although scary at the time, changed my life, how I am, how I see things and how I view the world as a result. My life feels more enriched as a result of my solo expeditions around the world - experiences I would never have obtained if I had listened to my initial fears and stayed in my comfort zone."

Stay in hostels and guesthouses.I had been abroad before, mainly package holidays with friends and family, never alone, never branching out into the unknown like I did boarding that plane on September 1st 2011 to Delhi, India and I was absolutely f*****g terrified. However, as soon I got out of the airport, I had a hostel booked and I made my way there and the truth is; you are never really alone when you travel solo and I learnt this immediately. As soon as I got to my hostel I met and made friends with another solo traveller and that was the exact story for every place I have ever traveled to. Meeting others - completing their own travelling dream, some alone, some with companions but the glue that seems to hold all of that together is hostels and guesthouses. Love them or hate them, you are guaranteed to make friends and have guaranteed help and assistance from the staff. They make the initial experience far less daunting and scary.4. Plan ahead but don’t over plan.When I decided to go it alone I thought at first I had to have everything planned out, a precise itinerary I would follow day to day. Where I would stay, where I would go, what I would be doing. The reality is you do need to plan ahead - flights, accommodations at times, big trips you want to take but actually the beauty of solo travel is liberating because you are free to pick and choose where you go. I learnt very quickly that listening to the locals and other travellers meant I often change my plans and end up visiting places I had never even heard of. It is better to have that kind of freedom rather than a restricted, rigid schedule and itinerary.4. Make friends from all around the world.I have met so many wonderful people from all walks of life, different cultures, different countries that I am now proud to call friends. It has been one of the biggest perks of traveling ― making friends and sharing invaluable life experiences. I have learnt so much from these people about their own cultures and understandings of life. Friendships made while traveling are a blessing.5. Learn and grow from cultural differences.This seems very straight forward but experiencing cultural differences opened my mind. I had grown up in a small town in the middle of England with a very strong sense of what I perceived to be right and wrong and good and bad. There were times when I was seeing things that I was in absolute awe of and other times left me deeply disturbed but learning about different cultures through experiences made me more knowledgeable of the world as a result.6. Become truly independent and self reliant.When I travel alone I have to learn to rely on myself. I have no choice. I learn so many new skills and life tools I never knew I had. I feel independent and I learn so much about myself as a result. Who knew I was able to navigate myself around the world, from border to border with only one bag and passport. It is a liberating and exhilarating experience. When you go it alone you only have yourself to answer to and that is the beauty of it all.Solo travel is a beautiful thing, every time I go somewhere new I get so much from the experience that benefits me as a human being - however being safe, careful and not reckless is imperative for successful solo travel.Seven years ago I dreamed of the Far East, Machu Pichhu, seeing Mount Everest and the Taj Mahal - now those dreams have become a reality that I made true for myself. I am so grateful I made that decision in 2010 that although scary at the time, changed my life, how I am, how I see things and how I view the world as a result. My life feels more enriched as a result of my solo expeditions around the world - experiences I would never have obtained if I had listened to my initial fears and stayed in my comfort zone."

This was the famous “Bathroom Bill,” which was a thinly-veiled attack on the rights of the LGBTQ community, specifically transgender people.The repeal happened after estimates showed the state was going to lose up to $3.7 billion in revenue due to boycotts. It’s sad that it takes greed to make people/legislators do the right thing, but whatever gets the job done, I guess.After HB2 became law in 2016, Target was the focus of protests by hate groups like Faith2Action and the American Family Association. Why? Because Target announced that in their stores, transgender people could use whichever bathroom they identified with. Naturally, closed-minded and hate-driven people everywhere were upset. Target was to be boycotted, driven out of business, shamed, and so on and so forth. Target was targeted, pardon the pun, because they stood up for human rights.What no one seems to have talked about or noticed, is at the same time Target was coming under fire, Starbucks quietly and deftly handled the problem.I travel for work.A lot.I stop at a plethora of different Starbucks locations across the Midwest, and a few months after HB2 went into effect and Target came under fire, I noticed something: all the “Men’s Restroom” doors I had once walked through now said, “Restroom.”Instead of one bathroom per gender, Starbucks simply made each bathroom unisex. Each room had a toilet, sink, and a lock. No stalls, no urinals. Which wasn’t a change; the men’s restroom had always been a sink and a toilet. All Starbucks changed was the placard outside the door. Easy. Peasy.A Google search found a few hate posts regarding the change—someone always notices and raises a fuss—but the anger was nowhere near what Target faced.(Or, to be fair, what Starbucks itself faces every December when their holiday cups come out and raises the ire of the “War on Christmas” knuckleheads.)I’ve never understood why more corporations don’t go about their business more delicately than they do. Sure, you can make a proclamation, but that’s going to get you in trouble somehow, somewhere.Take a stand for human rights? Awful people will pout and stomp their fists, creating a lot of noise and public relations headaches for you. Make a quiet change that in many ways no one will notice, but makes a world of difference to, say, a transgender person?That’s win-win.More nonsense at www.nathantimmel.com"
