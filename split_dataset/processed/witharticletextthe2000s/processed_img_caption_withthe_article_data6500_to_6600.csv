He reportedly said he had thrown rocks at the squirrel to scare it away from his home. “Then the squirrel gave me a look and I took it personal,” Mangia said, according to the complaint.Mangia also allegedly told police that after being shot, the squirrel was able to flee and remove the arrow from its own body, according to the New York Daily News.It’s unclear whether that’s true, but an environmental conservation officer spotted the animal dead, covered in blood, and also noticed blood near the window of Mangia’s property, Staten Island Live reports.The New York Police Department’s 122nd Precinct tweeted about the arrest, referring to it as “illegal hunting” and stating “save archery for the range.”Officers charged Mangia with torturing and injuring animals, reckless endangerment and violating a state Environmental Conservation Law. He is due to appear in court next on June 27.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the man used a crossbow."

Wright suggests that ancient aliens may have lived on nearby planets hundreds of millions of years ago, before vanishing without a trace.In a new scientific paper, “Prior Indigenous Technological Species,” published in Cornell University’s research archive, ArXiv, on April 24, Wright speculates:One of the primary open questions of astrobiology is whether there is extant or extinct life elsewhere in the solar system. Implicit in much of this work is that we are looking for microbial or, at best, unintelligent life, even though technological artifacts might be much easier to find.HuffPost asked Wright how far back in time he thinks aliens might have lived in our solar system and if some of them may still be lingering out there.“It seems pretty clear there aren’t any now. That’s become more clear as we’ve explored the solar system robotically. In terms of large, intelligent, technological civilizations, that seems pretty case closed,” he said in an interview Friday.While Wright pays tribute to the imaginations that created tales of Martians and moon dwellers in his paper, he remained cautiously open-minded about what’s possible in time and space. “While the applications of this idea in science fiction are usually fanciful, it is unclear to what degree the existence of such species in reality is allowed or disallowed by evidence,” he wrote.In the interview, he said he thinks it’s interesting to wonder if there could have been a previous species on Earth that used technology like we do and if there’s any room in the geological or fossil record for that, or have we completely foreclosed it?“My guess is that we can rule out big swaths of the Earth’s history. The farther back you go, the harder it is to rule something like that out. If they’re very old, there may not be any traces. Things don’t last long. If you put something in orbit around the sun, it’ll be subject to collisions with asteroids and meteors.“So, anything, including planetary surfaces in the solar system, just gets constantly hit with these things. When you’re on the surfaces of objects, like asteroids or moons or planets, those surfaces can also completely turn over, given enough time.”NASA defines astrobiology as “the study of the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe. This multidisciplinary field encompasses the search for habitable environments in our solar system and habitable planets outside our solar system.”Wright told HuffPost of two important ingredients in looking for signs of life somewhere in space.“In the field of astrobiology, we talk about what are called biosignatures. If you look at a planet or a moon that has life on it, how would you know? What is the signature ― the signal ― that says this is life and not a completely sterile object? So, that’s a biosignature. “A technosignature is the same idea but not for any life ― it’s for the technology that’s been engineered and constructed and designed by life. For instance, a radio transmitter would be one of our most obvious technosignatures. And we build large structures. The Empire State Building is a technosignature.”According to Wright, it’s important to keep searching. "
2,POLITICS,"Education Was A Huge Factor In How People Voted In 2016, But Most State Polls Missed That",Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/education-2016-election-poll_us_590cbaffe4b0104c734eb412,A new report examines where polling went wrong in the presidential election.,2017-05-05,Voters' education levels were a stronger predictor of their vote in 2016 than in recent presidential elections.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590cbbe61700001f005a5074.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Voters’ level of education closely tracked with the candidate they backed in key states in the 2016 election, but state-level polling failed to place enough emphasis on education to accurately reflect that, according to a new report.While voters with a college degree were more likely to support Hillary Clinton, those who didn’t attend college tended to back Donald Trump. National-level polls predicted Clinton would win the popular vote by 3 percentage points, when she actually won it by 2 ― so those were fairly accurate. But polls were way off the mark in key states such as Michigan (6 points off), Wisconsin (7 points) and Pennsylvania (5 points) ― and Trump’s victories there helped him gain the Electoral College votes necessary to become president. State-level polling didn’t survey enough voters without a college education ― which may be a big reason they overestimated Clinton’s support, a topic discussed in the report issued Thursday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research on what went wrong in 2016. The report found many state-level pollsters weren’t accounting for the fact that those with college degrees are significantly more likely to take surveys. While pollsters weight their survey responses to reflect a representative balance of people based on demographics such as age, gender, race and political party, not all weight them based on education. “National polls are twice as likely to weight for education as state polls,” noted Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center and one of the polling experts on the committee that wrote the report. In the past, education has not been as strong a predictor of the presidential vote. In 2012, 50 percent of college graduates and 51 percent of non-college graduates supported Barack Obama, according to exit polls. Obama in 2008 and George W. Bush in 2004 also each won while garnering similar levels of support from both college graduates and non-college graduates. However, in 2016, Trump won 51 percent of non-college graduates, but just 42 percent of those with college degrees.As Nate Silver pointed out in November, Clinton won by a larger margin than Obama did in 48 of the 50 most-educated counties in the United States. So while Clinton won the educated vote, many lower-education voters flipped from Obama to Trump. Education levels of poll respondents is complicated to measure because there are almost as many ways of weighting the data as there are pollsters. The report states that after the election, committee members attempted to weight their surveys based on education levels and found a “very small change in the pre-election vote estimates with no systematic improvement.”The report concludes with the sentiment that election polling is a unique beast — Americans shouldn’t distrust all polls because of this example — and pollsters are working to adjust their methodology for more accurate political polls in the future.For now, committee member Mark Blumenthal, now at SurveyMonkey and previously at HuffPost, advises pollsters to be open and honest about their data and methodology and to work collaboratively with committees like AAPOR to ensure everyone is held to the same standards.

Since their immigration status",2017-05-05,"The cover illustration of “Telling Our Stories: Immigrant Women’s Resilience,” a graphic novel written by immigrant women living in Canada.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590ce2731600001f00c59b95.png?cache=u7cvAgWFuB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Canada, dozens of immigrant women have coauthored a graphic novel about sexual violence. Since their immigration status is often linked to their relationship status, immigrant women are particularly vulnerable to domestic violence.TORONTO – It wasn’t an easy decision, but when Mariah Nalubuulwa fled Uganda in 2015 after years of domestic abuse, she knew it was a matter of life and death.“It’s the worst experience any mother [could] go through. Oh my God,” Nalubuulwa said of leaving behind two young children, a boy and a girl, who are now aged three and five.“But what was much more important was me being alive … If I stayed with them, I don’t think I’d even be alive today,” she said.The 32-year-old had been a victim of domestic violence – sexual violence in particular – at the hands of her partner since 2008. She said she was taught that “relationship matters, like bedroom matters, should not go out there to the public.”Finally, however, she fled and sought refuge in Toronto, Canada’s most populous city. But life as a new immigrant, alone in a place so far from home, was a shock.Nalubuulwa said most things in Canada were different from what she was used to. She didn’t know where to find a job or social services. Even after two years, “you’re still a newcomer,” she said.Yet it was those very experiences, and her resilience in the face of past abuse, that pushed her to join a new project that aims to make the transition easier for other immigrant women in Canada.“If it’s going to help a woman out there, then I should be part of it,” Nalubuulwa said about joining dozens of other immigrant women across the province of Ontario to write a graphic novel about sexual violence.One in three women in Canada, regardless of immigration status, will experience violence in her lifetime.But immigrant women can be particularly vulnerable, especially if their residency status is tied to their spouse or partner, or if they fear deportation. Many also don’t know where to seek help or services, or what local laws dictate when it comes to violence.“Telling Our Stories: Immigrant Women’s Resilience” is written for, and by, immigrant women. Some of the authors are survivors of sexual violence themselves.Four groups of immigrant women attended creative writing workshops in Toronto, Windsor and Ottawa to learn how to build a graphic novel from scratch.She said many of the women, including herself, hesitated to share their experiences during the workshop. But once the first woman opened up, everyone followed suit, and they gained strength from each other. “Everyone was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m not alone. I’m not alone.’ Everyone has gone through this,” she said.Each workshop group was tasked with covering a specific topic related to sexual violence. The women then exchanged ideas and questions, and shared their own experiences. These exchanges were then used to inform what the characters in the novel say, how they react to violent situations and how they eventually find help.Comprising four fictionalized stories illustrated by a professional artist, the graphic novel covers sexual consent, rape, intimate partner violence, victim-blaming and workplace sexual harassment, and gives advice on how to support survivors.The book was funded by the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration. The Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants (OCASI) and Mouvement Ontarien des Femmes Immigrantes Francophones (Ontario Movement of Francophone Immigrant Women) organized the workshops, and released the book last month as part of a province-wide awareness campaign.The book is free, and will soon be available in 11 languages – English, French, Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Dari, Punjabi, Somali, Spanish, Tamil and Urdu – at local organizations and venues across Ontario that work with new immigrants.“[They] loved that [the book] was for immigrant women, by immigrant women,” Fayza Abdallaoui, the president of MOFIF, said of the participants. “They also talked a lot about the vulnerability of immigrant women. That was also very powerful because they recognized the fact that coming into a new country [puts] them in a vulnerable position.”“Immigration, refugee and sponsorship processes often put one partner in a position of power over the other,” the Canadian Council for Refugees says on its website. “The reinforcement of power imbalances works in favor of an abusive partner or spouse.”Canada’s federal government has announced plans to change an existing law that requires couples to cohabit for at least two years following their arrival in the country in order for the sponsored spouse or partner to maintain permanent resident status.Abdallaoui said the graphic novel sends a symbolic message that the lives of immigrant women are valued.“Violence against women is everywhere,” she said. “I’m pretty sure that anybody that will read these stories … [they] will resonate,” she said.Nalubuulwa, meanwhile, said she hoped immigrant women would feel less alone when they read the book, and learn that it’s possible to get out of abusive and violent relationships.On a personal level, she longs to one day be reunited with her children – and to continue to work to help other survivors of abuse.“I want to see every woman finding the hope they’re looking for.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

6,POLITICS,ISIS To Recruits: Buying Guns In The U.S. Is 'Very Simple',Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isis-terror-recruits-american-gun-laws_us_590c8249e4b0e7021e97065a,The extremist group encourages militants to take advantage of unregulated gun sales.,2017-05-05,"The four guns used by the ISIS-inspired shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California on Dec. 4, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590c84001700001f005a4f43.jpeg?cache=Hl9T8HSkVo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Islamic State militant group is encouraging recruits in the United States to take advantage of permissive American gun laws, according to a Washington Post report.The latest edition of the ISIS propaganda magazine Rumiyah includes an article describing the ease with which guns can be purchased without background checks through private dealers.“The acquisition of firearms can be very simple depending on one’s geographical location,” the article read. “In most U.S. states, anything from a single-shot shotgun all the way up to a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle can be purchased at showrooms or through online sales — by way of private dealers — with no background checks, and without requiring either an ID or a gun license.”The Rumiyah article specifically touted gun shows where these unregulated sales are often easiest.“With approximately 5,000 gun shows taking place annually within the United States, the acquisition of firearms becomes a very easy matter,” the article added.Over 1 in 5 gun acquisitions in the United States in the past two years occurred without a background check, according to a Harvard-Northeastern University national survey released in January. Those unregulated transfers ― either through off-the-books sales, gifts or other means ― typically take place online or at gun shows.Previous estimates suggested that some 40 percent of gun acquisitions took place without background checks, suggesting there has been a modest improvement in gun safety norms.But as the Post noted, the Rumiyah piece is not the first evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of the United States’ lax gun safety laws.An ISIS recruit imprisoned in Germany, who has since defected from the organization, told the New York Times in August 2016 that ISIS tells its members that “the Americans are dumb, they have open gun laws.”Then-President Barack Obama subsequently cited the Times story to make the case that tougher gun laws are essential for national security.ISIS-inspired assailants have also taken advantage of loose standards around the sale of the high-powered, military-style long guns often known as “assault weapons.” The two assault-style rifles used in the San Bernardino mass shooting in December 2015 were legally purchased in California thanks to a loophole in the state’s assault weapons ban. The attackers, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, nonetheless bought them through a straw buyer.Omar Matteen, the shooter in the Orlando gay nightclub attack in June 2016, who claimed allegiance to ISIS in a call with police, also used a legally purchased assault-style rifle in his deadly spree, despite being questioned by the FBI twice in the preceding years. Matteen murdered 49 people in the massacre."

The group receives U.S. government assistance, and it’s been featured in an Oscar-winning Netflix documentary. Its chief, Raed Saleh, has received scores of awards, most recently a spot on the Time 100 list.But their latest trip brought something new: meetings with American power players who have never engaged with the volunteer rescue group before, including individuals highly skeptical of U.S. involvement in the Middle East.Last Tuesday, two representatives of the group, officially known as Syria Civil Defense, met with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Through the course of the trip, White Helmets members had their first encounters with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a progressive favorite, and a raft of other lawmakers who have not previously engaged with them, like moderate GOP Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana.“As we try to come up with a plan to end the devastating war in Syria, it’s very important to hear from those who are experiencing it firsthand,” Sanders told HuffPost. “The death and destruction taking place in Syria, and the brutality of the Assad regime is almost beyond belief. I was honored to meet with these incredibly brave volunteers, ordinary men and women, who risk their lives to help their fellow citizens.”Khanna praised the group of first responders, too, noting that it serves civilians targeted by both sides of the six-year conflict.But Khanna’s interactions with the group also highlighted the way conspiracy theories, misrepresentations and general wariness of the war have made serious talk about it in the U.S. increasingly difficult. The congressman faced a social media backlash after tweeting and posting on Facebook about his meeting, with commenters accusing him of cheering American intervention and of supporting a group that Syrian President Bashar Assad, Russia and others falsely portray as a terrorist front.Khanna deleted the tweet and changed his language on Facebook. After HuffPost reported on the kerfuffle, he said he regretted that decision and slammed conspiracy theory talk about the White Helmets. Volunteers ― people who were previously accountants, firefighters and bakers ― founded the group in 2012 as civilian casualties began to increase in Syria. As the first responders began attracting international attention and support, from the U.S. and allied governments like the Netherlands and Japan, they told the world about the brutality of the war, particularly by Assad’s forces. The regime’s supporters soon launched an ongoing propaganda campaign to discredit them, highlighting their appeals for Western help.The more leftist Sanders wing of the Democratic Party, which increasingly appears to be ascendant, is closely associated with activists who oppose Western involvement abroad. The senator spent much of his time on the campaign trail arguing for a reconsideration of U.S. foreign policy, following years of international instability, and attacking his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, as too hawkish. These arguments are not in themselves problematic. But some elements in this galaxy have courted controversy by adopting the kind of rhetoric Assad and his backers use, particularly in spreading misinformation about the White Helmets and others the U.S. supports in Syria. Former Ohio Gov. Dennis Kucinich has loudly echoed the Assad government’s narrative of the conflict, as has former Sanders adviser Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Columbia University. This year, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a favorite of the Sanders movement, has both traveled to Damascus to meet with Assad and suggested that the dictator may be correct in saying he was not responsible for a chemical weapon attack in April that the international community has held him responsible for.With the rise of President Donald Trump, a critic of traditional U.S. foreign policy, some on the right have boosted these views, too. Assad is beloved by figures like white nationalist Richard Spencer and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.Meeting with the White Helmets and acknowledging their description of what the regime has done to civilians is important for progressives who claim to be non-interventionist, Khanna argued.It matters for the humanitarian workers too.“It was important for us to meet Sen. Sanders and other American politicians so we could explain what is happening to civilians who are under attack from all sides inside Syria,” Mounir Mustafa, the group’s deputy head, told HuffPost. “Twenty-four hospitals have been bombed in the last month alone, and many areas are subject to daily airstrikes. In the last week, 12 White Helmets have been targeted and killed while rescuing others. We hope that Sen. Sanders stands with us in our humanitarian mission to save lives and uses his voice to call for an end to all attacks on civilians.”Watchers of the war say constant claims that the group’s members are regime-change agents rather than rescue workers only adds to Syrian suffering. And that view might be becoming more widespread. Last week, Gabbard’s office confirmed to HuffPost that the congresswoman would be willing to meet with the group, too. "

When questioned by police, the boy said the sex had been consensual. When the girl heard this, she fainted, Abdinoor says.In Somalia, the prosecution needs to prove that penetration occurred in order to secure a conviction. Getting a medical certificate that attests to this can prove difficult. Until recently, there was only one doctor, at one hospital in the capital, who was legally empowered to give out such certificates. (Human Right Watch researcher Laetitia Bader, who spoke to the country’s attorney general, says courts now accept records from other hospitals.) This doctor issued the girls with a signed certificate that said intercourse had taken place, allowing the girls to take their accused rapists to court. But there would be no conviction.During the trial, Abdinoor says the girls were questioned in separate rooms (in Somalia, details of sexual assault can’t be discussed in public courtrooms). By the end of the session, both had recanted their original statements, and the boys were let go. Abdinoor says it’s conceivable the 14-year-old had consensual sex with the boy whom she knew. But the 12-year-old had also been penetrated – what happened to her over those two days in November?When applied in the state court, Somali law on sexual violence is based on an Italian colonial-era penal code, written in the 1930s. Conviction is dependent on the provision of medical and police certificates, and survivor testimony is not prioritized. Moreover, Human Rights Watch says there is no agreement over the legal age of consent in Somalia.Statistics about rape in Somalia vary wildly, and the lack of infrastructure, combined with the rarity of reporting, means there is no way to get a firm grasp on its scope. The Somalia Protection Cluster, a consortium of NGOs working in the country, recorded 1,599 cases of gender-based violence between September 2016 and February 2017. In 2015, the attorney general’s office recorded 69 rape cases, 55 of which resulted in a conviction, according to Legal Action Worldwide (LAW), a firm specializing in human rights. Back in 2013, the U.N. recorded 800 cases of gender-based violence in the first six months of the year – in Mogadishu alone.In a country where survivors themselves believe that “rape is normal,” women’s rights advocates say these statistics represent a fraction of the sexual assaults that actually occur in Somalia.“I think so few cases go to court, in part, because of poverty,” said Deqo Olad, a project coordinator at the Somali Women Development Center, the Mogadishu-based human rights advocacy group where Abdinoor works. “People don’t have time to deal with the case.”A bill to address sexual assault more comprehensively is currently wending its way to parliament. The proposed legislation will place more weight on survivor testimony and less emphasis on the doctor’s certificate. In anticipation of the potential new law, and to teach Somali lawyers how to gather evidence that could be used in domestic and international courts,Legal Action Worldwide, which is providing technical support for the bill, is running a series of training sessions inside Mogadishu International Airport. The fortified airport is the most secure building in Somalia.It’s at these sessions that Abdinoor is learning what she might do differently next time. The attendees, most of them men, are being trained in gathering testimony from survivors and witnesses, using video to collect evidence and how to build a story to tell in court.In such a conservative culture, lawyers – both men and women – aren’t comfortable naming explicit body parts. At one point in the training, attendees practiced saying “penis,” “vagina,” “anal” and “penetration,” out loud in both English and Somali. While this detail might seem small, closing such gaps fortifies survivors’ individual narratives, as well as the national legal system.LAW wants to train the lawyers to collect more evidence than is necessary under the national penal code. Not only will that build stronger cases, such testimony can also be archived so there’s enough information for the country’s lawyers to adjust to the evolving Somali legal system.“Evidence collected today may be vital for access to justice for victims and building a transparent and accountable justice system in Somalia in the future,” Antonia Mulvey, LAW’s executive director, says.It’s a positive step forward, but Olad says she has toned down her expectations of rapid progress on sexual assault in Somalia.“Men think they can turn a girl’s life upside down on a whim,” she says. “Training someone can change the interview process, but it’s not going to change the culture.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

The company’s development a sizing system that accommodates over 248 body types, but at the moment they’ve got their eyes on just one human: White House advisor and clothing purveyor Ivanka Tump.  The Society’s new clothing drive, aptly titled “Make America Rational Again,” calls on consumers to send “gently used and emphatically discarded” Ivanka Trump merchandise that will be rewoven into new, made-in-the-U.S.A. special edition jumpsuits.Unlike the Society’s typical suits, the Ivanka versions will be “millennial pink” with gold accents, the video above notes. Citing the hypocrisy of Donald Trump’s “buy American, hire American” rhetoric ― both the president and his daughter source their products largely from China, where Ivanka Trump’s clothing manufacturer uses a factory that violated labor standards ― the Society’s founders Abigail Glaum-Lathbury and Maura Brewer have a clear message they wish to convey to the president’s daughter.“You offer a path to women’s liberation and empowerment achieved through inspirational hashtags and pink polyester blouses,” they told HuffPost, addressing Ivanka Trump. “But your promises are empty. We reject the siren call of marketplace feminism in which freedom is measured by buying power. This so-called feminism is achieved on the backs of low-paid garment workers and working-class people everywhere.” Glaum-Lathbury and Brewer also said the demands of the Rational Dress Society for Trump are simple: “Shutter your businesses, renounce your political ambitions and move to a commune in western Montana.” (Ethics experts would certainly be pleased.)Make America Rational Again, or M.A.R.A., just launched Thursday. But Brewer and Glaum-Lathbury cheekily said the response “has been tremendous! Huge!” They’ve already received four garments to be recycled: “A sweater, a dress, a purse and an ‘awful and ugly Trump tie I got for Christmas many years ago,’ to quote the donor.”The M.A.R.A. website offers a mailing address for submitting Ivanka Trump clothes, lists locations of drop-off centers in multiple states and provides information on how to otherwise participate in the drive. The clothing will be collected during the months of May, June and July, then sorted and spun into yarn to make the jumpsuits. The recycled Ivanka Trump versions will be auctioned off some time in the fall, with proceeds donated to organizations focused on ensuring fair labor in the United States.

Few Americans have faith in the government. And trust in scientists’ accuracy is deeply polarized. This is HuffPollster for Friday, May 5, 2017. WHAT HAPPENED WITH 2016 ELECTION POLLING? - An American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) report, released Thursday, digs into the performance of last year’s surveys. HuffPollster: “National polls, which largely predicted a modest win for Hillary Clinton in the popular vote, weren’t too far off. But state polling missed the mark significantly, and often uniformly, leaving much of the public feeling utterly blindsided by Donald Trump’s victory...A late shift in key swing states and a failure to correct for the underrepresentation of less-educated voters played out against the backdrop of a close race that saw different winners in the Electoral College and the popular vote. The resulting errors were fundamentally worsened by pollsters, forecasters, and aggregators who were either overconfident in their results, or unable to convey a proper level of uncertainty to the public.” [HuffPost, full report, additional coverage from WashPost, Politico, AP]What went wrong, according to the report: More from HuffPollster: “In Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, between 11 percent and 15 percent of voters said they made up their minds in the final week of the campaign. Late deciders in those states, several of which saw a last-minute surge in attention from the campaigns, broke heavily for Trump….[B]etter-educated voters were likely to support Clinton. That presented a problem for some pollsters, because highly educated voters are also more likely to answer polls….While many pollsters weight their surveys to correctly reflect Americans’ educational backgrounds, some, especially at the state level, did not.”What we still don’t know: “The impact of other potential factors is less clear, according to the report. The report sheds no light, for example, on the effect of FBI Director James Comey’s letter to Congress….Similarly, while likely voter models ― pollsters’ efforts to determine which of the people they talk to will actually show up on Election Day ― presumably played a role, much of the data that would help measure the exact effect isn’t yet available.”What didn’t go wrong: “The study found no evidence of a consistent bias toward one party in recent polling. While Trump was underestimated last year, Democrats Barack Obama and Al Gore also saw their standing underestimated in election polling. ‘The trend lines for both national polls and state-level polls show that ― for any given election ― whether the polls tend to miss in the Republican direction or the Democratic direction is tantamount to a coin flip,’ the report’s authors write.”What to know for next time: “Pollsters who didn’t already account for educational levels can take more care to do so. But there’s no reason why future elections won’t also see last-minute shifts in swing states, or an Electoral College result that doesn’t reflect that popular vote…. panelists on Thursday suggested that pollsters, aggregators and journalists should spend more time emphasizing that surveys represent only a snapshot of public opinion at the time that they’re taken, and that the uncertainty surrounding polling goes far beyond the stated margin of error.” HOUSEHOLDS WITH LANDLINES ARE NOW THE MINORITY - Pollsters who only call landline phones have an ever-shrinking universe to work with. Stephen J. Blumberg and Julian V. Luke: “The second 6 months of 2016 was the first time that a majority of American homes had only wireless telephones. Preliminary results from the July– December 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) indicate that 50.8% of American homes did not have a landline telephone but did have at least one wireless telephone (also known as cellular telephones, cell phones, or mobile phones) —an increase of 2.5 percentage points since the second 6 months of 2015... Despite operational challenges, most major survey research organizations include wireless telephone numbers when conducting RDD surveys. If they did not, the exclusion of households with only wireless telephones (along with the small proportion of households that have no telephone service) could bias results. This bias—known as coverage bias—could exist if there are differences between persons with and without landline telephones for the substantive variables of interest.” [CDC]TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT IS AT A NEAR-HISTORIC LOW - Pew Research: “The changes in the dynamics of power in Washington have registered with members of both political parties. Somewhat more Republicans express trust in government today than did so prior to the election, while views among Democrats have moved in the opposite direction. For the first time since George W. Bush’s presidency, Republicans (28%) are more likely than Democrats (15%) to say they can trust the government in Washington to do the right thing just about always or most of the time. The share of Democrats expressing trust in government is among the lowest levels for members of the party dating back nearly six decades. The national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted April 5-11 among 1,501 adults, finds that the overall level of trust in government remains near historic lows; just 20% say they trust the government to do what’s right always or most of the time. Far more say they trust the government only some of the time (68%); 11% volunteer that they never trust the government to do what’s right.” [Pew]TRUMP’S APPROVAL RATING DIPPED SLIGHTLY BUT RECOVERED THIS SPRING - Mark Blumenthal, on SurveyMonkey’s data: “After a brief dip in March, President Donald Trump’s job approval rating rebounded slightly in April….That slight dip in March represented the lowest ebb so far in Trump’s presidency. Prior to that, our tracking of Trump’s ratings varied between 44 and 48 percent – essentially where they are now….[W]hile it is difficult to attribute recent changes to any one issue, it is likely that the shift in news coverage from a high-profile defeat of an unpopular proposal to military action and other news helps explain the glacial regression to the mean in Trump’s ratings. Independents who lean Republican have also been more variable in their assessment of Trump (partly because that subgroup is smaller, typically about 10 percent of all adults), but do show a slightly different pattern: Well over 80 percent approve of Trump, and while the numbers dipped slightly in late March, hitting a low of 84 percent in the week ending on April 3, they only rebounded in the past week (to 89 percent).” [HuffPost]TRUST IN SCIENTISTS SPLITS ALONG PARTISAN LINES - HuffPollster: “Americans’ trust in scientists is deeply split along partisan lines, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. 54 percent majority of Democrats, compared with just 13 percent of Republicans, say they have ‘a lot’ of trust that what scientists say is accurate and reliable…. In a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken four years ago, Democrats were 28 percentage points likelier than Republicans to express a lot of trust in scientists’ findings; in 2015, the gap was a relatively similar 25 points. But by last spring, that divide was 31 points, and the most recent poll finds it widened to 41 points, due both to increasing levels of trust among Democrats and a corresponding decline among Republicans.”  [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this update every Tuesday and Friday morning via email!

In it, you can see that Lorre’s other mega-hit “Two and a Half Men” topped Trump’s “The Apprentice” in both the key adults 18-49 demographic and total viewers at the time.Below the graphic read the caption: “Defeat terrorism and crazy dictators? He couldn’t even defeat ‘Two and a Half Men.’”Lorre’s jab is meant to hit Trump — who seems to be obsessed with TV ratings — where it hurts by proving “The Apprentice” wasn’t the massive hit he claimed it was.This is not Lorre’s first vanity card that took aim at Trump.Just days before the election in November, Lorre wrote a vanity card that was critical of the then-Republican candidate. It included the lines:You won’t let us join your club? %#&@ you, we’ll start our own club. You won’t let us go to your school? %#&@ you, we’ll start our own school.

It’s the latest lawsuit in a string of legal actions aimed at the news giant.In the suit, Jessica Golloher, a radio journalist based in Jerusalem, said she endured several years of discrimination during her time as a freelancer and later as a full-time employee at Fox News Radio. Golloher claims she tried to report the treatment last month following a series of harassment reports related to former anchor Bill O’Reilly, but within 24 hours of emailing an attorney about those complaints, she was informed by a supervisor that her contract would not be renewed and her position would be eliminated.Her lawyers filed suit in New York State Supreme Court against the network, parent company 21st Century Fox and two of her managers, Hank Weinbloom and Mitch Davis.“Within 24 hours of sending this email, knowing that Ms. Golloher had previously made internal complaints about gender discrimination, Ms. Golloher was, without any prior warning, fired,” the suit reads. “The decision to terminate Ms. Golloher can only be described as a blatant act of retaliation.”A person familiar with the case refuted that account, saying that Golloher’s managers were unaware of the email and that the decision to cut her position was made independent of the complaints.A Fox News spokesperson also denied the allegations, saying the network would “vigorously defend the matter.”“Jessica Golloher’s claims are without merit,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Her allegations of discrimination and retaliation are baseless.”Golloher, who began working with Fox News as a freelancer in 2008, cited several incidents of marginalization, including during coverage of 2014’s Winter Olympics in Sochi, where she says she was “degraded and humiliated” after being forced to work as an “assistant” to a male reporter. In another example, the suit says, Golloher was told by her manager to “find better pictures of herself” and that she was “much better looking in person.”She alleges complaints about the treatment were brushed off by supervisors. The suit notes she did not complain to human resources because she had heard that “HR was not to be trusted as it had repeatedly failed to assist employees with valid concerns.”Thursday’s lawsuit follows several filed in recent months by current and former employees of Fox News. In late April, a group of 11 people filed a class-action suit over allegations of years of “abhorrent, intolerable” racial discrimination. Earlier that month, an on-air contributor filed a separate suit, claiming former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes made repeated sexual advances toward her.The legal action came amid a network-wide purge that has seen the departure of Fox standard-bearers Roger Ailes, Bill Shine and O’Reilly, all implicated in a sexual harassment scandal that has thrust the company into chaos.At the end of April, 21st Century Fox Co-chairman Rupert Murdoch addressed the upheaval in a memo sent to staff:“I know the last few weeks have been tough for everyone here, but our passion for news and commitment to our viewers continue to lead us through. Congratulations and thank you for all your hard work.”"

Her daughter, Ellie, teetered on the edge of survival and weighed less than a pound. She spent the first four months of her life hooked up to tubes in the NICU.At the time, Megan—who asked that only her first name be used—had health insurance though Obamacare. Ellie also qualified for secondary Medicaid coverage. The couple still relies on that combination to cover her ongoing health complications: Chronic lung disease, which requires her to be on oxygen; intestinal complications that require a special feeding tube; chronic kidney disease; epilepsy; growth hormone deficiency and low muscle tone. Between January and March 2017 alone, the family’s insurance plan paid more than $100,000 for some 1,200 claims.So a day after the Republican-led House narrowly passed a bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, Megan is trying not to panic. Trumpcare would roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions and slash federal funding for Medicaid—both changes that put her daughter at risk. “It seems like these kids are going to fall through the cracks, and it’s just really unfair,” Megan told HuffPost, pausing to collect herself. “She didn’t do anything wrong to deserve any of this. I had a healthy pregnancy. I’m a healthy person. We didn’t ask for this. And it just feels like we’re being forgotten.”Megan’s husband already puts in 60- to 70-hour weeks managing a car sales department, and she has quit her job to manage Ellie’s care full-time and watch their 7-year-old son. They simply cannot afford for their health care costs to soar. Other families are particularly concerned about potential cuts to programs and services supported by Medicaid. Erin Raffety, a 35-year-old professor from New Jersey, told HuffPost she feels “betrayed” by Thursday’s vote. Her 3-year-old daughter, Lucia, has a progressive genetic disease of the brain and has been in early intervention programs in New Jersey for much of her young life. Lucia is bussed to a local school that is equipped to handle her speech, physical and occupational therapy in-house.Raffety said that since President Donald Trump’s election, she has learned to cope with the feeling that her daughter’s life hangs in the balance, but after yesterday’s House vote she is even more anxious.“She’s been on Medicaid since she was probably a year old,” Raffety said. “We try and be really outspoken about the amazing benefits the state of New Jersey, and also the federal government, provides families like ours. There’s no way anyone could afford the level of care Lucia needs, and not just the medical services, but the services she needs for her life to be full.”The possibility that the new health care bill could bring back annual and lifetime caps on coverage—even for individuals with employer plans—is also worrisome for mothers and fathers managing sick children with serious, life-time needs. When a child needs millions of dollars in care, these limits can be life-destroying.“I’m feeling a combination of angry, scared and really sad. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Lisa, 30, who lives in California and who also asked that only her first name be used. She has a 4-year-old with cerebral palsy and a nearly 2-year-old with chronic lung disease.“My pregnancy with my daughter alone was really complicated, and cost something like $500,000. If they bring back the maximums, that’s really close, you know?” she said. But while Trump boasted on Thursday that the American Health Care Act is “a great plan,” doctors who treat children have widely condemned the bill. The American Academy of Pediatrics said in a press release on Thursday that it is “bad policy for children and dangerous policy for our country.” Parents like Megan—including those who took to social media this week to express their outrage using hashtags like #IAmAPreexistingCondition—say they simply want some reassurance that legislators are doing what they can to protect their kids. “Ellie’s great,” Megan said. “She thinks she’s a typical 4-year-old and handles everything so well. She’s a complete joy.”“I don’t think these legislators could look at us face-to-face and tell us, ‘Your kids aren’t important enough for us to make sure they stay safe,’” she said. “I don’t think they could look at my daughter and tell her she’s not worth it.”"

These people are colloquially known as “sick” people. In medical jargon, they’re called people with “pre-existing conditions.” Obamacare tried to help these people cope with their costs by spreading them out among as many people as possible. Obamacare forced everyone to buy health insurance and banned insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. This meant higher premiums for some healthy people, and new access to insurance for millions of others.The GOP replacement takes the opposite approach to dealing with this problem. It allows states to move people with pre-existing conditions out of the private insurance system and into high-risk pools, which gives insurance companies room to reduce premiums.“Freed from the current system’s coercive mandates, insurers would finally be able to bring down costs for all patients, including those with pre-existing conditions,” health secretary Tom Price maintained in a Wednesday CNBC column. The problem, of course, is that high-risk pools are very expensive ― they’re full of sick people with high health care costs. The only way for the GOP bill to bring down costs for all patients is to funnel tons of taxpayer cash into the high-risk pools. Otherwise, it’s just a gambit to sack sick people with massive bills ― exactly the sort of thing insurance is supposed to prevent. And the GOP bill appears to have extremely scarce funding for high-risk pools.Listen to HuffPost’s analysis of the House Obamacare replacement in the latest episode of the politics podcast “So That Happened”:At the beginning of the week, the GOP bill provided up to $130 billion that states could theoretically use to set up high-risk pools. The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, calculated that would still be $200 billion short. To placate moderate Republicans, party leaders added another $8 billion that could only be used for the pools. So maybe the Senate will fix the bill and pour hundreds of billions of dollars into high-risk pools, enough to make up for the $673 billion in premium subsidies that the bill cuts. What’s far more likely to happen is what has happened with high-risk pools in the past ― a big underfunded mess. Before Obamacare, 35 states ran high-risk pools for people who couldn’t get private insurance. These programs covered about 200,000 people, though they weren’t backed by billions in federal funding. Instead, states levied assessments on insurance companies and hospitals, according to the Congressional Research Service. The state pools tended to have high premiums, high deductibles and typically excluded coverage for health problems related to a potential enrollee’s pre-existing condition for six months. Insurance companies lose money by participating in the pools, with losses totaling $1.2 billion in 2011, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. During the 14-month debate over the Affordable Care Act, Republicans pitched expanded pools as an alternative. Democrats incorporated the idea in their legislation, setting up a $5 billion high-risk pool that opened almost immediately after the bill became law. They billed the provision as a stopgap for people with pre-existing conditions who couldn’t get health insurance until Obamacare’s ban on discrimination against the sick took effect in 2014.Administration officials expected the Obamacare pool, known as the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, to cover up to 375,000 people out of as many as 25 million Americans who were uninsured due to pre-existing conditions. It only reached 100,000 enrollees, and their medical claims were so extensive that the Obama administration closed enrollment early in 2013. The program’s medical losses totaled $2 billion in its final year.  “So That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney and produced by Zach Young.

16,POLITICS,Congressman Asks Reporter To Explain The Health Care Bill He Just Voted For,Alana Horowitz Satlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-collins-ahca-health-care_us_590c7073e4b0d5d9049b9d58,He admitted he didn't actually read the bill.,2017-05-05,Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) admitted he wasn't aware of some of the cuts in the GOP health care bill he voted for Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590c7c551600002000c599ca.jpeg?cache=NXzdFZrUja&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A congressman who voted for the Republican health care bill despite not having read it needed a reporter to explain it to him.Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) on Thursday told CNN he hadn’t read the American Health Care Act, but that his staff had briefed him on its contents. But pressed later by The Buffalo News, Collins seemed to not be aware of how it actually affects his constituents.“Explain that to me,” Collins said after the reporter pointed out that New York stands to lose billions in federal funding for its Essential Plan, an Obamacare provision meant for low-income people who don’t qualify for Medicaid. The plan serves thousands of people in his own district, according to The Buffalo News.He then admitted that he wasn’t aware of the cut in the first place. In March, Collins enraged critics of the legislation, which is Republicans’ most serious attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, by saying Congress needed to pass the bill before lawmakers could tell their constituents what’s in it. Anyone who actually read the bill before the vote (like HuffPost’s Jeffrey Young!) would have seen that it stands to kick millions of people off insurance and slash key protections for those with pre-existing conditions.

17,IMPACT,The Choice Bus Uses Prisoner Perspectives To Discourage Students From Dropping Out,"Christopher Zoukis, ContributorAuthor and Prisoners' Rights Advocate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-choice-bus-uses-prisoner-perspectives-to-discourage_us_590ca8c2e4b046ea176aea93,"“He who opens a school door, closes a prison.”",2017-05-05,<p>The Choice Bus initiative gives students hard facts and different perspectives on the effects that staying in school vs. dropping out can have on their lives. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590ca93e17000024005a5020.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an effort to stem the school-to-prison pipeline and to keep kids in school, the Choice Bus was rolled out, using the stark contrasts between stories from prisoners who dropped out and statistics on those who completed school to help students understand their options in life, and how their decisions can affect their futures.The Choice Bus is an initiative of the Mattie C. Stewart Foundation, a national nonprofit created in 2007 to help educators, community leaders and other interested groups reduce the dropout rate and increase the graduation rate. Dr. Shelley Stewart named the foundation in honor of his mother, whose murder he witnessed at the hands of his father at the age of five. The tragic incident put him at risk of poverty, homelessness and dropping out of school. Had it not been for his passionate first-grade teacher, Mamie Foster, Stewart’s life may have gone in a different direction. But no matter what was going on in his life — running away, bouncing from one relative’s home to another, changing schools — Stewart remembered Mrs. Foster’s stringent message that you could be anything you wanted if you had an education. And for Stewart, education made all the difference.The Choice Bus is a fleet of three busses that travel around the U.S.. They have been decked out to appear as half school bus and half prison bus, showing children what their choices in regards to education can really mean. More than 2 million children have visited the Choice Bus, an experience-based learning tool that features a four-minute minute video quiz about the differences between dropouts and college grads, and testimonials from prisoners. After the film, a curtain is opened to reveal a prison cell, including beds and toilet, demonstrating the reality of where negative choices can lead. After spending some time in the cell, students are given pledge cards to make positive choices. Presenters help students see the value of staying in school, and of pursuing further opportunities — whether college, trade school or other constructive paths. The goal is show that a choice that may seem small and insignificant at a time when you are young can actually have far-reaching consequences, potentially for the rest of your life. The Choice Bus is not a scared-straight style program, but provides real information to students who will be faced with real decisions.The Choice Bus goes hand in hand with the foundation’s Inside Out documentary, which also emphasizes the importance of education through interviews with inmates who talk about how their lives would have been different if they had made other decisions and stayed in school.Education is imperative to stemming the school-to-prison pipeline. Seventy-five percent of inmates are high school dropouts, and 80 percent are functionally illiterate. About 7,000 students drop out of school every day — to the tune of more than 1.2 million each year.Post-secondary education also pays off financially. On average, college graduates will make more than $1 million more in their lifetimes than peers that do not pursue further education or training. Any initiative that helps reduce mass incarceration and improve lives for youth is a move in the right direction.The Mattie C. Stewart Foundation hopes to empower youth by making them understand and embrace the importance of education. A quote from Victor Hugo lines the walls of each Choice Bus: “He who opens a school door, closes a prison.” That’s certainly the hope.Christopher Zoukis is the author of Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Surviving the Federal Bureau of Prisons, College for Convicts: The Case for Higher Education in American Prisons (McFarland & Co., 2014) and Prison Education Guide (Prison Legal News Publishing, 2016).

While custom dresses and designer duds are out of reach for most budgets, the 35-year-old singer recently wore something surprisingly affordable. On Thursday, Bey posted a few pictures of herself in a “Preggers” T-shirt from ASOS Maternity that retails for only $23. The shirt, of course, is already out of stock. She rounded out her look with a denim jacket, ripped jeans, Chuck Taylors and sunglasses. Considering Beyoncé wore a $5,450 Gucci jacket with a $1,790 Gucci backpack to a basketball game just a few nights ago, this ASOS look is a straight-up bargain. See you at ASOS, Bey!

But while analysts and journalists alike rushed to speculate about the extent to which the relationship had been improved, very little attention was being paid to something else developing between the two nations in recent months: the irony in their channelling of one another’s immigration values. Has the relationship been salvaged? It seems so, even though Trump thanked Rupert Murdoch and talked about pro golfer Greg Norman before even thanking the Australian leader for his speech. It was an “all-smiles” dinner, after all.While it is unclear where this relationship stands, regardless of the pleasantries exchanged Thursday, the immigration channelling is noteworthy, particularly because it comes at a time when both countries have expressed a desire for fine-tuning their respective immigration policies.Although the two have clashed on refugees and immigration protests threatened to spoil the American president’s homecoming, what has flown under the radar about Turnbull and Trump ― and is likely going to be sidelined as more analysis of the meeting surfaces ― is how they have curiously and contradictorily crossed paths on distinct components of immigration policy ― merit and nationalism.One of the hallmarks of Trump’s presidency so far has been his proposed changes to America’s immigration policy. And in his effort to overhaul the system, the president has looked to other nations for inspiration, including Australia. But while Trump sings Australia’s praises for its merit-based immigration system, Australia’s Turnbull is also being accused of emulating Trump by scrapping a central pillar of that policy and planning to institute an “Australian values” section of the Australian citizenship test.Domestic pressures have forced Turnbull to appease the right-wing members of his own party with half-hearted gestures once seen as out of character for this more centrist conservative leader. Whether the two manage to cooperate is one thing, but given Trump’s praise for Australia’s style of immigration management ― and now its universal health care system hours after celebrating a vote to scrap the U.S. Affordable Care Act ― the future may be intriguing. But the interesting question at present is: can Australia and the U.S. borrow more from one another on immigration, as English-speaking democracies and allies that already share so much?The answer is complicated. The two nations differ vastly in population and economy, making wholesale borrowing hard. But how do merit-based systems fare in that process, and is there much that America can take from Australia’s policy? Trump in particular has zeroed in on merit-based immigration as a possible solution to what he considers a flawed system in the U.S., saying that such a measure would provide “many benefits” for U.S. citizens economically. “Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others,” the president said in a speech to a joint session of Congress soon after taking office, “have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.”And in theory that sounds great. In Australia, there is a particular push for those coming in to be able to, at least in part, be self-sufficient, something arguably lacking in America’s own policy. One of the ways this manifests itself is in the recently scrapped 457 visa, as well as a points system.Were the 457s a success, and would they work in the U.S.? The measure was introduced by Prime Minister John Howard in 1996 to promote skilled migration by providing workers for jobs that could not be filled locally. The visas had a period of four years and those on them could apply for permanent residency.Murray Thornhill, director of HHG Legal Group, a law firm that focuses on immigration in Western Australia, said that 457s, “[have] been very effective as a tool for managing skill shortages and giving employers and businesses in key industries like tourism, health and agriculture the ability to fill shortages quickly.”In an ideal world, this principle would also apply to the U.S. and make the law a plausible fix for America’s skill deficit. But countries cannot simply copy and paste policy and expect it to work ― and even if they could, the measure wasn’t entirely a home run for Australia either.Azadeh Dastyari, a law lecturer at Melbourne’s Monash University, doesn’t see the skilled migration system in Australia as a complete success.“On the one hand it has attracted more educated and wealthy migrants. However, there has been no guarantee that high-skilled migrants will in fact be able to move into high-skilled jobs,” she said. “As a result, there is the situation of high-skilled migrants competing for unskilled labor.”The visa, though ironically lauded by “America First” Trump, was a point of contention in the country prior to its elimination, with both sides of the Australian political sphere taking aim at it over varying concerns, ranging from potential overflow of immigration or cheaper labor options undercutting locals, to possible abuse of immigrant workers. The concern included union protests that occurred across the country in opposition to the employment of 457 workers.In his immigration reform sweep, Turnbull has also announced that his country would institute a values test, a tactic that was similarly floated by Trump back in August of last year. For some Australians, this represents a clear shift by the prime minister to placate the Trump-like fans of his own party or ride the wave of populism that has seen success elsewhere, including the U.S. Indeed, the removal of the visa has been loosely compared to the reassessment of H-1B visas for temporary skilled migration in America or even Brexit motivations ― part of a larger global trend aimed at curtailing the flow of migrants in certain countries.America’s immigration system is more family-oriented. According to the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit news agency focusing on inequality in education, “Seven out of 10 immigrants to Australia are accepted based on having skills the government and employers say are needed. In the United States the proportion of immigrants admitted for their skills is less than two in 10.” In addition to the skills deficit this leaves, in America it is the lower-skilled immigrants who often end up doing low-paid jobs locals wouldn’t want to do. And fair wages are even a problem for those who are native-born citizens.That’s where Dan Engles, a Perth-based migration agent who runs Visa Solutions Australia, a company that assists immigrants through the legal aspects of the country’s visa application process, is skeptical about an Australian immigration system realistically transferring over to America.“A key issue for the U.S. [in implementing a merit-based measure like Australia] would be the requirements to pay a minimum level of income, [because] Australia requires that workers coming here are not subject to exploitation through low wage earnings, which can lead to poverty traps for migrants,” he said.Where America’s government has lagged on immigrant working conditions, Australia’s government has been blunt. Canberra has made clear that the issues of immigration and working standards are of high importance, while the current American administration has instead started to implement policies that may negatively impact immigrant working conditions.In fact, Labor, the current Australian opposition, suggested it would not pass the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, or ChAFTA, an agreement that eliminated a large majority of trade tariffs between the two countries and granted 5,000 visas to Chinese nationals for work and holiday purposes in 2015. The backlash surrounding ChAFTA was due to the fear that it could have potentially allowed for more lax labor standards ― and an influx of Chinese workers. The idea was that not only could the workers allowed in under the ChAFTA have taken jobs that could have otherwise been filled by Australians, but that the working standards may have even been lower as well. This differs from the U.S. where often less care is taken to ensure migrants do not work for lower wages, with regular cases of exploitation of guest workers and other immigrant labor occurring across the country.And while the move towards focusing on the local Australian workforce is in line with much of Trump’s own vision for the U.S. ― think “America First” ― it may seemingly feel at odds with the merit-based system Australia prides itself on and that Trump not so long ago championed.Globalist Turnbull would baulk at his policies being called Trump-like, but his goals appear to be getting closer to Trump’s with recent actions, despite their initial frosty personal relationship. The prime minister is at pains to appease the right wing of his party and voters who are swinging towards Pauline Hanson’s populist right-wing One Nation, which is protectionist and against Muslim immigration. As a result, he’s making some sort of anti-immigration noises and has changed policy without spelling out what he plans to replace it with. He’s also said that Australia is one of the most successful multicultural nations in the world and that “Australian values” include democracy, respect for the rule of law and equality between the sexes. Exactly what is he trying to fix with these changes? Unclear, save that things could be “even better.” After “getting along great” in New York, it will be interesting to see how the relationship between Trump and Turnbull progresses from here. After all, as Trump put it in a speech following their meeting, “[Australia and the U.S.] were born as the rebellious children of the same parent.”Even if the nations aren’t identical, there are certainly things the two have in common. One of those things is not immigration policy so much as the lack of a coherent one."

23,THE WORLDPOST,Australia Is Scrapping A Key Component Of The Merit-Based Immigration System Trump Wanted To Borrow From,"Helen Clark, ContributorVietnam and Southeast Asia Analyst and Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-trump-merit-based-immigration_us_590a84c7e4b05c39768621ca,And it may be indirectly taking a page from Trump’s playbook in the process.,2017-05-05,"Globalist Turnbull would baulk at his policies being called Trump-like, but his immigration plan doesn't seem quite coherent either.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590b2e251700001f00dd685a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"PERTH, Australia — After a “testy” phone call on refugee resettlement got these two world leaders off to a rocky start four months ago, all eyes were on the face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull Thursday. But while analysts and journalists alike rushed to speculate about the extent to which the relationship had been improved, very little attention was being paid to something else developing between the two nations in recent months: the irony in their channelling of one another’s immigration values. Has the relationship been salvaged? It seems so, even though Trump thanked Rupert Murdoch and talked about pro golfer Greg Norman before even thanking the Australian leader for his speech. It was an “all-smiles” dinner, after all.While it is unclear where this relationship stands, regardless of the pleasantries exchanged Thursday, the immigration channelling is noteworthy, particularly because it comes at a time when both countries have expressed a desire for fine-tuning their respective immigration policies.Although the two have clashed on refugees and immigration protests threatened to spoil the American president’s homecoming, what has flown under the radar about Turnbull and Trump ― and is likely going to be sidelined as more analysis of the meeting surfaces ― is how they have curiously and contradictorily crossed paths on distinct components of immigration policy ― merit and nationalism.One of the hallmarks of Trump’s presidency so far has been his proposed changes to America’s immigration policy. And in his effort to overhaul the system, the president has looked to other nations for inspiration, including Australia. But while Trump sings Australia’s praises for its merit-based immigration system, Australia’s Turnbull is also being accused of emulating Trump by scrapping a central pillar of that policy and planning to institute an “Australian values” section of the Australian citizenship test.Domestic pressures have forced Turnbull to appease the right-wing members of his own party with half-hearted gestures once seen as out of character for this more centrist conservative leader. Whether the two manage to cooperate is one thing, but given Trump’s praise for Australia’s style of immigration management ― and now its universal health care system hours after celebrating a vote to scrap the U.S. Affordable Care Act ― the future may be intriguing. But the interesting question at present is: can Australia and the U.S. borrow more from one another on immigration, as English-speaking democracies and allies that already share so much?The answer is complicated. The two nations differ vastly in population and economy, making wholesale borrowing hard. But how do merit-based systems fare in that process, and is there much that America can take from Australia’s policy? Trump in particular has zeroed in on merit-based immigration as a possible solution to what he considers a flawed system in the U.S., saying that such a measure would provide “many benefits” for U.S. citizens economically. “Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others,” the president said in a speech to a joint session of Congress soon after taking office, “have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.”And in theory that sounds great. In Australia, there is a particular push for those coming in to be able to, at least in part, be self-sufficient, something arguably lacking in America’s own policy. One of the ways this manifests itself is in the recently scrapped 457 visa, as well as a points system.Were the 457s a success, and would they work in the U.S.? The measure was introduced by Prime Minister John Howard in 1996 to promote skilled migration by providing workers for jobs that could not be filled locally. The visas had a period of four years and those on them could apply for permanent residency.Murray Thornhill, director of HHG Legal Group, a law firm that focuses on immigration in Western Australia, said that 457s, “[have] been very effective as a tool for managing skill shortages and giving employers and businesses in key industries like tourism, health and agriculture the ability to fill shortages quickly.”In an ideal world, this principle would also apply to the U.S. and make the law a plausible fix for America’s skill deficit. But countries cannot simply copy and paste policy and expect it to work ― and even if they could, the measure wasn’t entirely a home run for Australia either.Azadeh Dastyari, a law lecturer at Melbourne’s Monash University, doesn’t see the skilled migration system in Australia as a complete success.“On the one hand it has attracted more educated and wealthy migrants. However, there has been no guarantee that high-skilled migrants will in fact be able to move into high-skilled jobs,” she said. “As a result, there is the situation of high-skilled migrants competing for unskilled labor.”The visa, though ironically lauded by “America First” Trump, was a point of contention in the country prior to its elimination, with both sides of the Australian political sphere taking aim at it over varying concerns, ranging from potential overflow of immigration or cheaper labor options undercutting locals, to possible abuse of immigrant workers. The concern included union protests that occurred across the country in opposition to the employment of 457 workers.In his immigration reform sweep, Turnbull has also announced that his country would institute a values test, a tactic that was similarly floated by Trump back in August of last year. For some Australians, this represents a clear shift by the prime minister to placate the Trump-like fans of his own party or ride the wave of populism that has seen success elsewhere, including the U.S. Indeed, the removal of the visa has been loosely compared to the reassessment of H-1B visas for temporary skilled migration in America or even Brexit motivations ― part of a larger global trend aimed at curtailing the flow of migrants in certain countries.America’s immigration system is more family-oriented. According to the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit news agency focusing on inequality in education, “Seven out of 10 immigrants to Australia are accepted based on having skills the government and employers say are needed. In the United States the proportion of immigrants admitted for their skills is less than two in 10.” In addition to the skills deficit this leaves, in America it is the lower-skilled immigrants who often end up doing low-paid jobs locals wouldn’t want to do. And fair wages are even a problem for those who are native-born citizens.That’s where Dan Engles, a Perth-based migration agent who runs Visa Solutions Australia, a company that assists immigrants through the legal aspects of the country’s visa application process, is skeptical about an Australian immigration system realistically transferring over to America.“A key issue for the U.S. [in implementing a merit-based measure like Australia] would be the requirements to pay a minimum level of income, [because] Australia requires that workers coming here are not subject to exploitation through low wage earnings, which can lead to poverty traps for migrants,” he said.Where America’s government has lagged on immigrant working conditions, Australia’s government has been blunt. Canberra has made clear that the issues of immigration and working standards are of high importance, while the current American administration has instead started to implement policies that may negatively impact immigrant working conditions.In fact, Labor, the current Australian opposition, suggested it would not pass the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, or ChAFTA, an agreement that eliminated a large majority of trade tariffs between the two countries and granted 5,000 visas to Chinese nationals for work and holiday purposes in 2015. The backlash surrounding ChAFTA was due to the fear that it could have potentially allowed for more lax labor standards ― and an influx of Chinese workers. The idea was that not only could the workers allowed in under the ChAFTA have taken jobs that could have otherwise been filled by Australians, but that the working standards may have even been lower as well. This differs from the U.S. where often less care is taken to ensure migrants do not work for lower wages, with regular cases of exploitation of guest workers and other immigrant labor occurring across the country.And while the move towards focusing on the local Australian workforce is in line with much of Trump’s own vision for the U.S. ― think “America First” ― it may seemingly feel at odds with the merit-based system Australia prides itself on and that Trump not so long ago championed.Globalist Turnbull would baulk at his policies being called Trump-like, but his goals appear to be getting closer to Trump’s with recent actions, despite their initial frosty personal relationship. The prime minister is at pains to appease the right wing of his party and voters who are swinging towards Pauline Hanson’s populist right-wing One Nation, which is protectionist and against Muslim immigration. As a result, he’s making some sort of anti-immigration noises and has changed policy without spelling out what he plans to replace it with. He’s also said that Australia is one of the most successful multicultural nations in the world and that “Australian values” include democracy, respect for the rule of law and equality between the sexes. Exactly what is he trying to fix with these changes? Unclear, save that things could be “even better.” After “getting along great” in New York, it will be interesting to see how the relationship between Trump and Turnbull progresses from here. After all, as Trump put it in a speech following their meeting, “[Australia and the U.S.] were born as the rebellious children of the same parent.”Even if the nations aren’t identical, there are certainly things the two have in common. One of those things is not immigration policy so much as the lack of a coherent one."

Continuing in the tradition she started in 2014 as a part of her Reach Higher initiative for the first time after leaving the White House, Obama addressed about 300 high school students, mostly first-generation, in the audience. Donning a gray Princeton Tigers shirt to represent her alma mater, Obama told the audience that though she may not be first lady anymore, her priority lies with education. “This event has grown from just a few dozen events in a handful of cities where we first started to this nationwide celebration we’re having in just four years,” Obama said. “So one of the reasons that we’re doing this, my presence here today is no accident because I might not live in the White House anymore, but Barack and I are going to keep on celebrating you all and supporting you and lifting you up no matter what house we live in.” Obama discussed the transformative power education had on her life as she went from a “working class kid” from the south side of Chicago to a Princeton graduate with the tools to impact the world at her fingertips. She told the students that she wants them to realize the importance of their accomplishment and celebrate their college acceptance. “We gotta celebrate students going to college bigger than we celebrate the Final Four or the Super Bowl,” she said. “This is important. The number of acceptance letters you get should be more important than the number of followers you have on social media.”She also told students to not be discouraged when they encounter struggle in their pursuit to education. The former first lady encouraged them to find a support base early, whether it be in the academic center, a club or a study group. She said that will be a major key to the future college students finding success.“Once you find that community, and you have to find your community in college and it may take some time, you’re gonna get this thing. You are gonna soar and you’re gonna continue to make us proud because we need you prepared to be the next generation of leaders,” she said. And the auditorium was full of future leaders indeed. Teens who were scholars, activists, entrepreneurs, artists and more graced the stage and filled the audience. And in true Obama fashion, this College Signing Day was full of magical melanin. BLSYW step team, the black, all-girls squad from Baltimore featured in the forthcoming documentary “Step,” opened up the event, incorporating one of Obama’s most celebrated sound bytes in their performance: “When they go low, we go high, raise our standards to the sky.”Other performaners included a young lady who performed a poem as prolific writer and former slave Phillis Wheatley and a young duo who sang their an original composition on the ills of slavery to the tune of Rihanna’s “Consideration.”Dozens of celebrities, athletes and influencers, including Questlove, Michael B. Jordan, Tamron Hall, Sherri Shepard, Black Thought, Luuvie Ajaayi, Swin Cash, Ashley Graham, Jidenna, Andra Day, Robin Roberts, Soledad O’Brien, among others celebrated the students’ accomplishments and imparted wisdom on the college-bound students. Obama wrapped up her comments by urging the high school students to remember the advice they were given and the spirit they felt throughout the event.“There’s stuff going on out there and thankfully we have you to take up that challenge. Right? You’re gonna be the next leaders of tomorrow. So don’t ever get discouraged. Remember this day... We need you, alright? And I couldn’t be more proud of you.”Watch footage from the full event in the video below. "

Anthony List. “President Trump has been keeping his promises to stand for life. He’s literally filled this White House and agencies with pro-life leaders.” Pence, who led the fight against reproductive rights as a congressman and governor of Indiana, went on to list the members of what he called the anti-abortion “A-team”― Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Housing Secretary Ben Carson, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Trump’s counselor Kellyanne Conway, who spoke at the gala before Pence.Also listed on his “A-team” was Charmaine Yoest, the former CEO of Americans United for Life, who is assistant secretary of health and human services, and Teresa Manning, a former lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee who is expected to be appointed to oversee the nation’s family planning program at HHS.“For the first time in a long time, America has an administration that’s filled top to bottom with people who stand without apology for life,” Pence said.Addressing a crowd at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C., Pence celebrated the various ways Trump has chipped away at abortion rights during his first hundred days in office. “At President Trump’s direction,” Pence said, he cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate to give states the power to withhold public funding to Planned Parenthood and other health providers that offer abortion. Trump reinstated the Global Gag Rule, blocking money to international health and family planning organizations that even mention abortion. And on Thursday, the House will vote on health care legislation that would withhold Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood and prohibit tax credits from being used to buy insurance plans that cover abortion. “I like to say, in this administration, we’re in the promise-keeping business,” Pence said. Pence also listed the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a victory for the anti-abortion movement. The conservative judge has ruled against Planned Parenthood and birth control access, and he would presumably rule against abortion rights on the high court. Pence said that “hope is finally shining through” for Americans who believe abortion should be illegal. “I truly believe we’ve come to a pivotal moment in the life of this movement,” he said.As Trump and Pence endeavor to roll back reproductive rights, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered a counterexample of how governments might treat women. Addressing Planned Parenthood at its annual gala Tuesday night, Clinton said the “only right approach” to leadership is “to defend the ability of every woman to make these deeply personal decisions for herself.”She added that anti-abortion politicians should stop attacking groups like Planned Parenthood that help women avoid unwanted pregnancies. “I believe that anyone who is opposed to abortion should be in favor of preventing unintended pregnancy, expanding economic opportunity and fighting for policies that actually support parenthood,” Clinton said.

Though the mom would’ve been well within her rights to nurse openly in the store, she opted to go to the bathroom for a bit more privacy. “She was crying. She was ready to have her meal, so I went to the restroom and found an open chair,” Davis told KSL. She said a few minutes later, a Nordstrom employee approached them and said a customer had complained about her breastfeeding in the bathroom.The employee then asked Davis to relocate to a fitting room.Davis said she was embarrassed at first and felt she hadn’t done anything wrong. After she later told her husband, Joel, about the incident, he reached out to the store. “It provokes the question, why did it make sense to ask a nursing mother to leave the privacy of a bathroom?” Joel told KSL. He later added, “I’m floored. It’s baffling.”Nordstrom did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, but a spokesperson issued a statement to KSL. “We want every customer to feel comfortable while they’re shopping with us, particularly nursing mothers,” the statement read in part. “Though we’re always happy to offer a fitting room if a mom is looking for additional privacy, our employees should never ask a nursing mom to move.”The dad said he also received an apology from the store manager, who promised to better inform employees of mothers’ right to nurse wherever they feel comfortable.Davis is just one of countless women who have been shamed or asked to leave a public space for breastfeeding. Moms have opened up about negative nursing experiences in gyms, on airplanes, at restaurants, and in stores ― from Nordstrom to Dillard’s to Victoria’s Secret.Ultimately, the Davises wanted to share their story to spread awareness around breastfeeding mothers’ rights.Said the mom: “We as a society are OK with, you know, low-cut shirts or advertisements of underwear models. But a nursing mother, to a lot of people, is just very offensive.”"
28,ARTS & CULTURE,The Gallery Trying To Get Women Artists Paid,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-artists-auction-prices_us_58f92365e4b06b9cb91527a5,An exhibition features two iconic feminist artists whose work is still critically undervalued.,2017-05-04,"Renate Bertlmann, ""Schnuller-Maske (Pacifier-Mask),"" 1976 ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5903b1751400001f00a9c811.jpeg?ops=crop_27_384_859_658%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"“Women artists have always been sidelined,” Bianca Chu, deputy director at Sotheby’s S|2 Gallery, told HuffPost. Her opinion is hardly unfounded. Over the years, there have been widespread efforts by feminist activists to address the ongoing gender imbalance in the museum and gallery worlds, imploring individuals and institutions to learn more women artists’ names, put more women’s work in galleries and museums, and document more women’s contributions to art on Wikipedia and in history books. Chu and the team at London’s S|2 Gallery are working to address one imbalance in particular: market value. The gallery, a space adjacent to Sotheby’s auction house in London, is launching a series of exhibitions featuring the work of female artists who are historically influential, yet remain undervalued for a variety of reasons. For the first show in this vein, S|2 is showing the work of Renate Bertlmann and Maria Lassnig, two postwar artists from Austria whose reputations and market costs don’t add up.Bertlmann, born in Vienna in 1943, is an avant-garde feminist artist whose work incorporated dildos, pacifiers and condoms to defuse what she referred to as the “phallocracy.” In one series, Bertlmann paints phalluses as pastel-colored cartoons donning corsets and garter belts. Throughout her career, Bertlmann depicted penises in many forms over and over again, each time chipping away at the unspoken patriarchal power possessed within them. “Pornographic jokes have always been a male domain, made at the exclusive expense of women,” Bertlmann said in an interview with the Tate museum in London. “I consider my series of objects an accomplished example of an obscene female joke. This joke has hit home; it targets the deadly serious, male sexual arrogance.”When Bertlmann began exhibiting her work in the 1970s, she was criticized by other feminist artists for her obsession with phallic imagery. “People thought that because she was using phalluses in such a direct way she was empowering them,” Chu said. “But really, by using them so bluntly, she was trying to overcome them.”In another iconic work, Bertlmann covers a mask with the tips of baby pacifiers, which bear resemblance to nipples and condoms, both of which were, again, frequent materials in her work. In a series of staged photos, Bertlmann wears the mask atop her face, covering her fingers with condoms. The monstrous image visualizes woman as baby-making machine, her physical features buried beneath the responsibilities of sexually accommodation and reproduction. The other artist on view is Maria Lassnig, who was born in 1919 in Kappel am Krappfeld, a small town in southern Austria. For 70 years, Lassnig painted only herself, assuming a variety of disguises including a baby, a cheese grater, a monster and a dumpling. The artist described her gripping self-portraits as “body-awareness paintings” ― in that they reflected as much as possible how she was feeling at the moment of their creation. She never painted from photographs, always from life. “I need the real body, real air,” she is quoted as saying in The Guardian. “When I paint I want everything to be as direct as possible.”Lassnig’s depictions range from figurative to abstract, naturalistic to teetering on the edge of reality, her flesh shifting from salmon pink to electric green ― all dependent on the artist’s inner state at the time of the images’ creation. In her most well-known work, 2005’s “You or Me,” Lassnig paints her unclothed, 85-year-old body, the flesh yellowy and loose. Her face appears vacant yet alarmed. With one hand, Lassnig holds a gun to her head; she points another gun at the viewer with the other. The portrait is painful to look at yet impossible to look away from, as if warning the viewer that if she breaks eye contact Lassnig will shoot. “She has been active since the 1950s,” Chu explained, “but it’s only in the last decade or so that she’s had major museum retrospectives outside of her own country.” Lassnig was awarded the Golden Lion lifetime achievement award at the Venice Biennale in 2013 and died the next year, at 94 years old. Despite the critical recognition she’s received, her work is still priced in an entirely different bracket than, say, Francis Bacon’s, with whom she exhibited (and held her own) in 2016. While Bacon’s work has sold for up to $142 million, Lassnig’s record, according to Chu, hovers around $600,000. The first round of S|2 Gallery’s programming focuses on women artists, but future shows will explore work that is undervalued for a variety of reasons. Chu stressed that the exhibitions will place more emphasis on the artist’s work as opposed to the explanations behind their exclusion.“Certain artists have been marginalized because of gender or race, but we are more interested in their rediscovery,” Chu said. “There are always a variety of factors, but we’re focusing on the art they are making.” The time is ripe for serious attention to be paid to artists as groundbreaking as Bertlmann and Lassnig. And if those auction prices go up as a result, all the better. Renate Bertlmann’s work is on view now in S|2 Gallery’s lower gallery, and Maria Lassnig’s in the upper gallery. The London show is on view until June 1. "
29,POLITICS,The One Way Donald Trump Could Be A Big Help To Muslim Families,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-muslim-schools_us_590b4ebde4b0104c734c80fa,The president's education plans may be a boon for private Islamic schools.,2017-05-04,"Children don't have to worry about anti-Muslim bullying at the American Youth Academy in Tampa, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5909dc141400008b031a64b5.jpeg?cache=TmziZaEKqC&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When school principal Farhat Siddiqui asks parents why they want their children to attend a private Islamic school, she often hears horror stories about kids facing anti-Muslim bullying. She listens to scared parents who fear for their children’s safety within a society that pushes Islamophobia and misinformation. She talks to parents who say they just want their kids to attend a school where they are protected and their values are understood.There’s a growing demand for private Islamic schools among Muslims in her community and across the country, Siddiqui said. But when she thinks about who could expand real access to such schools, she thinks of the same man who has helped make families feel so scared: President Donald Trump.The number of Islamic schools across the United States is small ― there are approximately 300 ― but growing. Like many other private schools, they can come with a steep price tag. In his preliminary 2018 budget, Trump has proposed a program to expand school choice. Although the details are unclear, such an initiative could make it easier for lower-income families to afford private schools, Islamic and otherwise.There is irony in the idea that the same man who has repeatedly trafficked in anti-Islamic rhetoric may make it easier for children to receive an education steeped in Islamic values. For Siddiqui, it is just one of life’s tradeoffs.“I feel that every political candidate that’s out there is going to make decisions that will help some aspects of your life and may not be of benefit to some aspects of your life,” said Siddiqui, who is the principal at the American Youth Academy in Tampa, Florida. “As far as the private school choice and all of that, that’s definitely beneficial for us as a community. I think it’s helpful for our schools.”Siddiqui’s school already benefits from a state-level effort called the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program. Started in 2001 under then-Gov. Jeb Bush (R), the program gives tax breaks to individuals and corporations that donate money to an organization that then grants private school scholarships to lower-income students. About 40 percent of the kids at Siddiqui’s school receive those scholarships.Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, has long championed Florida’s program, and a federal school choice effort might work along the same lines. Groups like the Council for Islamic Schools in North America, which advocates for and helps accredit private Islamic institutions, think that on this issue, DeVos will be an ally.Leaders from the Council for Islamic Schools and other groups, including those that represent Jewish and Catholic schools, met with DeVos in March. Sufia Azmat, executive director of the council, spoke to the secretary one-on-one and invited her to come visit an Islamic school. DeVos seemed open to the idea, said Azmat, although nothing has been scheduled.In the past, the mere involvement of Islamic schools in statewide voucher programs ― which use public dollars to pay for students’ enrollment in private schools ― has been seen as problematic by some lawmakers. In 2012, a Louisiana legislator retracted support for a voucher program after realizing it could benefit Muslim schools. When debating a voucher program in Tennessee in 2013, lawmakers expressed similar concerns.The solution, according to Azmat, is for Muslim schools to be more transparent about how they operate and the benefits they provide. Azmat ― who said the Trump administration has driven her to become bolder in her advocacy of Muslim schools ― is already thinking of ways her organization could respond if a future school choice program discriminated against Islamic schools. Such discrimination would be unconstitutional, she said. “We don’t want to hurt the school choice movement. ... That would be sad if we had to take a backseat because school choice would be hurt if Islamic schools are involved,” Azmat said. “I think it’s been an opportunity for us as Muslims and Islamic schools to realize we have to do more community outreach.”But for parents like Khaled Alhamzawi, who has two children attending Siddiqui’s school, and for Siddiqui herself, supporting school choice programs is not automatic.

30,POLITICS,The One Way Donald Trump Could Be A Big Help To Muslim Families,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-muslim-schools_us_590b4ebde4b0104c734c80fa,The president's education plans may be a boon for private Islamic schools.,2017-05-04,About 40 percent of the students at the American Youth Academy benefit from state scholarship aid.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5909dbfa1400001f001a64b4.jpeg?cache=pGtbCsDVCr&ops=crop_0_213_3500_1988%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When school principal Farhat Siddiqui asks parents why they want their children to attend a private Islamic school, she often hears horror stories about kids facing anti-Muslim bullying. She listens to scared parents who fear for their children’s safety within a society that pushes Islamophobia and misinformation. She talks to parents who say they just want their kids to attend a school where they are protected and their values are understood.There’s a growing demand for private Islamic schools among Muslims in her community and across the country, Siddiqui said. But when she thinks about who could expand real access to such schools, she thinks of the same man who has helped make families feel so scared: President Donald Trump.The number of Islamic schools across the United States is small ― there are approximately 300 ― but growing. Like many other private schools, they can come with a steep price tag. In his preliminary 2018 budget, Trump has proposed a program to expand school choice. Although the details are unclear, such an initiative could make it easier for lower-income families to afford private schools, Islamic and otherwise.There is irony in the idea that the same man who has repeatedly trafficked in anti-Islamic rhetoric may make it easier for children to receive an education steeped in Islamic values. For Siddiqui, it is just one of life’s tradeoffs.“I feel that every political candidate that’s out there is going to make decisions that will help some aspects of your life and may not be of benefit to some aspects of your life,” said Siddiqui, who is the principal at the American Youth Academy in Tampa, Florida. “As far as the private school choice and all of that, that’s definitely beneficial for us as a community. I think it’s helpful for our schools.”Siddiqui’s school already benefits from a state-level effort called the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program. Started in 2001 under then-Gov. Jeb Bush (R), the program gives tax breaks to individuals and corporations that donate money to an organization that then grants private school scholarships to lower-income students. About 40 percent of the kids at Siddiqui’s school receive those scholarships.Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, has long championed Florida’s program, and a federal school choice effort might work along the same lines. Groups like the Council for Islamic Schools in North America, which advocates for and helps accredit private Islamic institutions, think that on this issue, DeVos will be an ally.Leaders from the Council for Islamic Schools and other groups, including those that represent Jewish and Catholic schools, met with DeVos in March. Sufia Azmat, executive director of the council, spoke to the secretary one-on-one and invited her to come visit an Islamic school. DeVos seemed open to the idea, said Azmat, although nothing has been scheduled.In the past, the mere involvement of Islamic schools in statewide voucher programs ― which use public dollars to pay for students’ enrollment in private schools ― has been seen as problematic by some lawmakers. In 2012, a Louisiana legislator retracted support for a voucher program after realizing it could benefit Muslim schools. When debating a voucher program in Tennessee in 2013, lawmakers expressed similar concerns.The solution, according to Azmat, is for Muslim schools to be more transparent about how they operate and the benefits they provide. Azmat ― who said the Trump administration has driven her to become bolder in her advocacy of Muslim schools ― is already thinking of ways her organization could respond if a future school choice program discriminated against Islamic schools. Such discrimination would be unconstitutional, she said. “We don’t want to hurt the school choice movement. ... That would be sad if we had to take a backseat because school choice would be hurt if Islamic schools are involved,” Azmat said. “I think it’s been an opportunity for us as Muslims and Islamic schools to realize we have to do more community outreach.”But for parents like Khaled Alhamzawi, who has two children attending Siddiqui’s school, and for Siddiqui herself, supporting school choice programs is not automatic. Any federal initiative should come with strict accountability over the schools covered, Siddiqui said. She also urged the education secretary to take pains to support all educational institutions, not just private ones. Alhamzawi, a pharmacist who grew up in Syria, is fortunate enough not to need financial aid to pay for private school, although he knows other families who benefit from Florida’s support of scholarships.

There is one quality, though, she hopes her 2-year-old avoids in the future. In an interview with news.com.au, the actress said she wants Silas to inherit Timberlake’s “charm and his sense of humor.” However, when it comes to his career, she doesn’t want him to take after dad.“I really don’t want him to be a musician,” she said.Biel clarified that she meant it “sort of as a joke” and “of course” Silas can be whatever he desires. She simply doesn’t want her son to become discouraged or feel rejected in the tough music industry.“I already have this image of him as a struggling musician and that’s like, ‘Oh, my God!’” she told news.com.au. “As a mom, you think 30 years into the future and you’re like, ‘How do I fix this for him?’ I just want him to be like an engineer or a doctor, something like that.”The star of “The Sinner” told news.com.au that she’s seen what Timberlake has gone through and how he’s worked years and years to be able to work with any producer he wants and have his songs on the radio. She also noted how much she loves seeing Timberlake play with their son. “I am in awe of him and how he interacts with that little dude,” she said.Since Silas’ arrival in 2015, Biel has given fans a glimpse at her life as a mother. In September, she posted a photo on Instagram of a fork and empty plate in the shower with her, and explained to Jimmy Fallon later that making time to eat by bringing food in the shower sums up “mom life.”“I don’t know if anybody else does this,” she said. “I do not have time for anything. I’m feeding [Silas] in the morning, trying to get ready and I realize I haven’t eaten. I just take it into the shower.”She also told news.com.au that being a mother has taught her how to be more patient and compassionate. “Being a mother has changed everything,” she said."

No one knows that more than ‘70s prizefighter Chuck Wepner, whose career is long rumored to be the inspiration behind Sylvester Stallone’s “Rocky.”Wepner’s personal story is now featured in Philippe Falardeau’s new biopic “Chuck,” starring Liev Schreiber as “The Bayonne Bleeder,” who went almost 15 rounds with world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in 1975. The movie follows Wepner through his ups ― his success after the Ali fight ― and downs ― getting thrown in jail for drug possession ― while telling the tale of his doomed marriage to first wife, Phyllis (played by Elisabeth Moss), and eventual romance with his current wife, Linda (Naomi Watts). The film, which hits theaters Friday, does a fine job entertaining the audience while presenting Wepner’s various tribulations, but it’s Schreiber who stands out amid the madness. The actor is pretty darn convincing as the New Jersey-bred boxer, even impressing the source himself. “We turned down four scripts and four different actors before [we landed on this version,] and when they told me that Liev Schreiber was going to play the part, I was thrilled,” Wepner told HuffPost in a sit-down interview. “I mean, this guy is a legitimate superstar. I love him in the part for a nomination because he played it great, and Elisabeth [Moss], too. She was drop-dead great as my other wife.”“That’s a really nice thing to say. There are a lot worse things he could’ve said!” Schreiber joked of Wepner’s comment to HuffPost, adding of award murmurs, “I get excited, but self-consciously excited. But then, I do everything pretty self-consciously.” For Schreiber, the goal is never really to win awards, although it’s always nice to be considered among his esteemed colleagues. He credits his co-stars with helping him reach a level of success with this project, specifically calling his on-screen partners Moss and Watts “extraordinary.” “Both of them were so good in this movie. That was huge [working with them],” he said of his female co-stars, one of whom is his real-life ex. “Also, Michael Rapaport does a really gorgeous performance as Chuck’s brother. Jim Gaffigan, as well. All the actors in this. It’s something too about independent films. When you’re pressed for time and money, there’s a certain kind of resourcefulness that tends to pop up, and we had that going on this film.”With “Chuck,” the 49-year-old actor really wants viewers to walk away feeling more aware about the effects of fame rather than boxing history in general.“I never really thought of this as a sports movie. The best I could describe it is sort of a cautionary tale about fame and celebrity that is surprisingly enjoyable, which fame and celebrity often is,” Schreiber told us. The actor himself has dealt with the Hollywood spotlight, being in a high-profile relationship with Watts, with whom he separated in September 2016 after 11 years together. They have two sons, Sasha, 9, and Samuel, 8. “My kids don’t have any context for being swarmed in the streets and photographed, and people wanting to stop us and take pictures all the time. And it made me a little concerned about their expectations about fame and celebrity,” Schreiber said. “As I hear young people today talking about their aspirations to ‘blow up’ or become famous, it just felt important to me to add a counterpoint to that argument, which is to say, ‘It’s not everything you think it is.’ In fact, it’s a lot more precarious and dangerous existence than I think most people are aware of.” That’s not to say Schreiber doesn’t enjoy positive reviews or people coming up to tell him they love “X-Men” or “Ray Donovan.” “That feels terrific,” he admitted. “The problem, and I think ‘Chuck’ does a really good job articulating this, is that that feels so good that you could actually start to live your life for it. I think it’s important to have people close to you who know you and have always known you and will always know you so that you remember who you were before that film happened.”He continued, “There are very few jobs that are deeply connected to personality and character ― I guess prizefighter is one of them, too. There’s some projection of the audience’s own aspirational stuff that is such a huge responsibility ― for professional athletes, musicians and actors, especially ― that you have to be careful to keep yourself separate from it, to some extent.”“Fame can corrupt you and knock you down,” Wepner, who was arrested in 1985 on a drug charge, added. “There I was, on the top of the world, everything going good, and I got into [the wrong stuff]. I was a party animal and I was stupid and I got myself involved in something I shouldn’t have been in. But I fought my way out and I got Linda — she didn’t drink or do anything like that ― and I felt she was the right girl for me. She’s so terrific, I’m lucky and I’m here now.”In order to make the film, producers had to reach out to another man who knows a thing or two about being famous: Sylvester Stallone. In “Chuck,” the filmmaker and actor is portrayed by Morgan Spector, in scenes where Stallone and Wepner meet to discuss the success of “Rocky” and creation of “Rocky II.” “We did very well by him in the movie,” Wepner told HuffPost. “I thought we were very good to him, and deservedly so. He took us to Bulgaria to his studios and let us use his boxing ring for the filming of the Ali fight, because they wanted a great deal of money to shoot the fight in America — you had to pay the foundation a lot of money. Stallone took us over there — we did it for $350,000 instead of $2 million, five days, in and out ― and we got all the shots done. He was great to us.”Wepner did sue Stallone in 2003 for frequently referencing him as the living counterpart of the fictional Rocky Balboa, saying Stallone usurped his “right of publicity.” But they settled the suit for undisclosed terms in 2006. “I’ve been a fan of Sylvester Stallone for years,” Wepner continued. “Even though we went to court and I sued him, that was just business. And big deal — he’s got insurance companies and everything else. I think he’s still got a few bucks!” “If you’re Chuck, it’s hard to not see ‘Rocky 2’ [and think it’s about you],” Schreiber said. “Rocky’s sparring partner is ‘Ching Weber’ and his name is Chuck Wepner. And then Rocky fights a professional wrestler, Hulk Hogan, and Chuck fought Andre the Giant. If you’re Chuck, it’s hard to not go, ‘Wait a minute?’” If you’re interested to know more about Wepner’s side of the story, “Chuck” hits theaters in limited release Friday. "

They are central to human rights to economies to our national security, and don’t let anybody tell you otherwise. There is nothing elitist about fighting for women’s rights, equality and opportunity.” Clinton was particularly critical of the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and roll back funding for women’s health care both domestically and internationally. (The House is set to vote on a revised version of the American Health Care Act on Thursday.) “Over the last 100 days, this Congress and administration have been working really hard to turn back health care ― to turn back health care for 24 million people, but it would affect 180 million people,” she said. “Even today, they’re trying to force through that health care plan.” In a lighter moment, Clinton addressed her Twitter trolls (and Twitter trolls writ large), encouraging the women in the audience to persevere, even when confronted with depressing news and cruelty online.“There are moments when just reading the news or scrolling through Twitter can be so depressing,” she said. “But I just want all those Twitter trolls out there to know that maybe if you had left us alone, we might have gone out longer in the woods for our walks. But every time you hit those 140 characters, demeaning and denying women’s voices and rights, we’re coming back at you.” This speech came just a day after Clinton declared herself to be a member of the resistance, and later paraphrased the famous “don’t let the bastards grind you down” line from Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale.“I’m back to being an active citizen and part of the resistance,” she told CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour.

Up until May 4, 2017, it would have been a theoretical question for which political scientists lacked the data to answer. But come 2018, we’ll find out. Democrats feel like they already know the answer. For a party that just watched its signature legislative achievement get repealed in a tight vote on the House floor, Democrats had quite the spring in their step, even breaking into song as the vote was gaveled. “Nah, nah, nah, nah/Nah, nah, nah, nah/Hey, hey, hey, goodbye,” Democrats bellowed in unison to their Republican colleagues in the chamber. The song appalled Rep. Tom MacArthur, a Republican from New Jersey who brokered a deal with the Freedom Caucus that got the party to this point. “I simply don’t look at this through a political lens, and frankly I thought that was beneath the dignity of the House to be singing a song with a political message. This isn’t about politics. This is about the American people having health care and making sure that prices come down,” he said. The dignity of the House of Representatives aside, MacArthur, elected in 2014, was unaware that his own party had serenaded Democrats with the same song as they passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The taunt was accurate then: Democrats were swept out of office, and voting against Obamacare wasn’t enough to save many of them. Of the 32 Democrats who voted against the Affordable Care Act out of political concern, 21 lost or retired in the next cycle. The problem is not only the individual vote, it is also the collective action taken by the party ― and voters are fond of doling out collective punishment. If the effect is anything like what happened in 2010, any Republican who won his or her seat by 20 points or less is now vulnerable.The bill passed by the Republican House gives states the option of ignoring Affordable Care Act requirements that people with pre-existing conditions have affordable access to health care. In its place, the state must create a “high-risk pool” ― traditionally, an underfunded program that comes nowhere close to providing the kind of coverage needed.Political punishment, in the form of massive amounts of cash flowing to House Republican opponents, is already being doled out. Rep. Darrell Issa, a vulnerable Republican from California, told reporters “none of your business” when asked Wednesday how he’d vote. By Thursday, he seemed no more willing to share his position with the public, even as the clock on the vote ticked down to zero. Often, members of Congress who want to avoid a tough vote wait until the very end in hopes that theirs won’t be needed. With the tally at 215 yes votes, one short of the total, Issa finally cast his vote, putting it over the top and bringing a loud cheer from the Republican side. (It finished with 217, as there is a political maxim that a one-vote win should be avoided at all costs, because it lets the opponent say that every single vote was “the deciding vote.”) Democratic activists responded by raising at least $100,000 in a single day dedicated to whomever becomes Issa’s opponent, according to Michelle Finocchi of the group Swing Left, which launched after the election with the aim of funneling Democratic energy from blue districts into areas where it could make a difference. Another $300,000 was raised by a Swing Left page that split the money evenly among 35 swing districts where a Republican voted yes. “We informally collaborated on this with Jon Favreau and Crooked Media,” said Finocchi. “It’s the result of playing around, brainstorming, trying things out and seeing what worked. The genesis of the ideas was how to turn lemons into lemonade in this awful moment.” She said $150,000 of that came in right around the time of the vote.And another page set up on ActBlue was on its way to an additional $300,000 raised by the time this story was published and has probably climbed much higher since.The progressive website Daily Kos put out its own call for donors to help defeat the 24 most vulnerable Republicans who voted for the bill. In less than four hours, the site collected nearly $200,000 from more than 4,000 donors. That was even before Daily Kos emailed the fundraising appeal to its 3.5 million members. As of Friday morning, donations to the site had climbed to a record $650,000.That, at least, will be counterbalanced by one critical but overlooked element of the repeal bill. The politics of the vote are bad for Republicans on every level save one: Wealthy backers of Republican politicians have expected a major tax cut to come from control of both Congress and the White House. Delivering on that promise will pay off in campaign contributions and other benefits, as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act amounts to an extraordinarily large tax cut directed at the wealthiest people in the country.“Obviously the president really wanted a win here,” said Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine). “The Republicans themselves needed to dispose of this so they could extract the tax dollars. I mean, they’re getting something like $800-900 billion in returned taxes. So they want to use that money for their tax cut plan. And I don’t think they care that they’re taking it away from people who needed it.”Leah Greenberg, chief strategy officer for the progressive movement Indivisible, a federated group of hundreds of local chapters, said that the vote was sparking an upsurge in activity, with at least 21 protests against individual members of Congress already planned and more likely coming. In February, she said, 250 events were scheduled during the congressional recess. That surged to 450 during the most recent recess. The one coming up is likely to see even more. “My Republican colleagues are going to be really, really sorry that they rushed this bill to the floor before they got an amended CBO score,” Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said, because once that Congressional Budget Office projection becomes available, Americans “are going to be shocked to wake up to find out, if this Trumpcare bill passes, many millions more will lose their coverage.”On a process level, it would be hard for it to have been worse. After years of complaining that Obamacare was rushed or that nobody had read the bill, the GOP bill was rammed to a floor vote so fast the CBO hadn’t had a chance to analyze its impact. But otherwise the bill is a loser for Republicans. On a broad level, never before in American history has a political party run on the fact that they took something away from constituents (except, I suppose, the Republican Party of Lincoln, which took slavery away from Southern slave owners). And Democratic operatives on both the House and Senate side say they plan to make the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare the central plank of their campaigns in 2018.“This is a scar they will carry,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said before the vote. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, made a case you’ll hear over and over again: Republicans now own the health care system. When Democrats wrote the Affordable Care Act, they did something incomprehensibly stupid that will now rebound to their benefit: They made the window for enrollment October, meaning that premium increases were always announced just days before the election. In both 2014 and 2016, ugly percentage spikes undoubtedly drove voters into the arms of Republicans. This time, voters will have a different party to blame in October 2018, when premium increases are announced.Democrats were caught by surprise after the passage of health care reform that all of a sudden they owned every problem with the system. Premiums had been rising steadily, networks had been narrowing, deductibles had been increasing long before Obamacare was passed, but once it became law, every negative interaction with the system took on a political dimension. Now Republicans own the system, whether they pass reform into law or not.There are also regional problems for Republicans. The party is trying to hold on to much-needed seats in New York and California; remarkably, the bill Republicans just voted for would make subsidies in those states unusable for insurance, because the bill bans such money from going to plans that cover abortion, and California and New York require all plans to cover abortion services. The bill also targets Planned Parenthood for destruction, which will further galvanize women and men who support the organization to turn out and vote. In Appalachian states, the opioid epidemic has become one of the most important political issues on the table, if not the most important. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) ran his entire 2016 campaign around the issue and cruised to victory. He is now opposed to the House bill. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat up for re-election in 2018 in Ohio, will be able to hang this vote around whomever his opponent is, because it puts at risk the various policy levers and funding mechanisms that have gone toward combating the epidemic. The same dynamic will hold in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, and will resonate in Minnesota and Wisconsin, too, all states with Senate elections.How easy is it to hammer them? It takes the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee just six seconds to do it.Beyond an ability to collectively blame all Republicans for the vote, Democrats will also be able to pin it on specific Republicans who run for the Senate in 2018. The recruiting process is only in its nascent stages, but many of the top prospects Republicans hope to lure to run against red state Democrats are currently members of the House ― and most just voted to gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions or were part of a body that did so.Take Indiana, where two top GOP prospects to take on Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly are Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita. The DSCC is already up with video of them praising the health care bill. Immediately after the vote, Tom Perriello, a former congressman whose vote for Obamacare helped cost him his Virginia seat, put out an ad smashing an ambulance, a metaphor for the Republican vote. (Perriello, running for governor of Virginia, said that it was a defunct ambulance without an engine.) The policy implications of Thursday’s vote could be profound. Senate Republicans are already discarding the House bill, saying they plan to write one of their own. If they do, it would reshape the health care system. If they don’t, and Democrats take back power in 2020, the base will want everything. Democratic activists considered Obamacare a compromise on top of a compromise, as it wasn’t Medicare for All, and it didn’t even include a public health insurance option. Now that Republicans have set a precedent for rewriting a fifth of the economy in a matter of days without waiting for a CBO analysis, the Democratic base will be demanding the same, but this time for something much grander than the Affordable Care Act. But first, the effort at repeal is still alive, and Pingree said she worried Democrats were getting too eager. “Some of my colleagues were singing on the floor ‘Goodbye.’ I’m a little worried that we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves, and frankly we shouldn’t be cheering this either, if we’re just giddy about thinking they’re losing. This is a solemn occasion. They have just undercut health care for virtually everybody in this country who could be affected by this.”The politics are, indeed, bad for Republicans, she added. “It’s hard for me to believe it won’t impact the next cycle of elections because the American people are smart, and they’re going to figure this isn’t going to work for them,” she said. “I was here in 2008. I watched a lot of my colleagues lose their election in 2010. It’s because the American people, they won’t let you get away with something. And they’re 10 times more alert about what’s going on today.”Why, then, did Republicans do what they did? Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) put it succinctly, as he often does. Cole said he wasn’t worried about energizing the Democratic base but that when Republicans gave up earlier on repeal without even taking a vote, their base felt betrayed and lied to. So they had to do something, even if it couldn’t pass the Senate, or risk their base staying home on Election Day. “I think the Democratic base is already whipped up, and that’s fair enough. But if we had failed to do this, I think it would actually depress our turnout,” he said.This article has been updated with the latest donation figures to Daily Kos."

He is running in a special election to replace Tom Price, who is now the secretary of health and human services, in Georgia's 6th Congressional District.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590b7a2e1400001f001a6960.jpeg?cache=psTbp6Xx99&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal judge on Thursday ordered the state of Georgia to extend until May 21 the deadline to register to vote in a closely watched special congressional election taking place next month.The decision will affect the race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. Ossoff has seen an unexpected amount of support in the district long controlled by Republicans, and many are looking to the race as a bellwether of anti-Donald Trump political energy in the early months his presidency. Five civil rights and civic engagement groups sued the state last month, claiming that it was violating the National Voter Registration Act. The law says that a state may set a cut off for an election no sooner than 30 days before it occurs.Georgia met that requirement for an April 18 election to fill the House seat vacated by Tom Price, Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary. But because no candidate in the race received 50 percent of the vote, Ossoff and Handel advanced to a runoff.The state argued that the runoff was a continuation of the April election. Because of that, the state said, anyone who had not registered by March 20 could not vote in June. The plaintiffs argued that violated the NVRA, which clearly says the 30-day rule applies to runoff elections as well. U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten, who former President George W. Bush nominated to the federal bench, entered a preliminary injunction forcing the state to extend its voter registration deadline because “numerous voters” would suffer “substantial and irreparable harm” if they were not allowed to vote. A preliminary injunction served the public interest because the ruling would allow as many qualified voters to cast ballots as possible, Batten said. Georgia has argued that extending the deadline would interrupt the election process and force the state to hire temporary workers to process a backlog of voter registration applications. Those burdens, Batten said, “though not insignificant, do not outweigh the all-but-certain harm Plaintiffs will suffer absent an injunction.”“Would-be voters in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District were denied a full and fair opportunity to register and vote under the prior law,” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee, one of the groups that brought the suit, said in a statement.“Today’s decision extending the voter registration deadline helps ensure that eligible voters will be able to participate in the upcoming runoff election, and in all future runoff elections for federal office,” she said. “States like Georgia must stop taking action to suppress the rights of voters.”Ossoff also praised the decision.“Voting rights are constitutional rights,” he said in a statement. “I encourage all eligible voters to ensure that they are registered and make their voices heard on June 20th and in all elections, regardless of their party or political persuasion.”Read the whole order here:This article has been updated with comment from Ossoff. CORRECTION: This article previously misstated the date the congressional election took place in April and the initial voter registration deadline. "

On one hand, Democrats desperately wanted to protect President Barack Obama’s signature law. On the other hand, Democrats believe ― perhaps correctly ― that this extremely conservative bill can’t pass the Senate, and that House Republicans may have just hung a profoundly unpopular legislation around the necks of some of their most vulnerable members.As Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told Republicans during her floor speech before the vote, Democrats plan to tattoo every provision of this bill to the foreheads of Republicans. “You will glow in the dark,” Pelosi said.While Republicans were cheering as they passed the voting threshold requirements, Democrats began singing to their counterparts the popular anthem of “Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey! Goodbye!”A number of vulnerable Republicans also held off on voting for the bill until it was clear leadership needed their vote. Of particular note, Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), and Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) all waited to see if their votes would be needed before they supported the bill. Ultimately, leadership needed all of them.When Democrats passed the health care law in 2010, many members knew it was coming at the expense of their seats. They did it, however, because it was policy they deeply believed in, protecting millions of sick and poor Americans while growing the number of insured in the country to record highs. Republicans marched off this potential political cliff knowing their bill would uninsure millions, undermine protections for the sick and poor, and probably face little chance of becoming law ― and they did it without a revised score from the Congressional Budget Office.But at least it’s off their plate.That was the thinking among many members who just wanted to advance the process to the Senate and fulfill a promise that every Republican ran on: to repeal and replace Obamacare.A number of the last remaining holdouts on the GOP health care legislation said in the closing days that they just wanted to move on. One vulnerable Republican, Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, told members in a closed door meeting on Thursday that they just had to “get this fucking thing done,” according to members and aides present.Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), one of the last Republicans to flip from no to yes, changed his position after he got assurances from President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that they would address Webster’s concern about Florida having to pick up a clawback in federal funding for seniors in nursing homes, even though that fix isn’t in the legislation and leaders haven’t agreed on what they’ll do.“We got several on line,” Webster said Thursday. “We’re working on those, we’re going to get some scores and so forth before we actually commit, and I’m willing to do that.”Pressed that he was, in essence, voting to pass the legislation before he knows what will ultimately be in it, Webster said he was just advancing the process.“There’s plenty of votes between now and the end. This is for this vote,” he said.“As long as we get to a process,” Webster added. “As long as we have a conference, as long as the Senate has to vote, as long as we get another vote on the conference report, which we will, then there’s all kinds of ways to block [it] in the future if it doesn’t work out.”Republicans are also voting on this latest legislation without a CBO score, a fact Republicans either shrugged off or denied, claiming that an earlier score was sufficient.“We already had the Congressional Budget score when we did the main bill,” Rep. David McKinley (R-W.V.) told reporters Thursday morning. “These are amendments that only perfected, [and] do not add costs.”McKinley added that the CBO score could “only get better” with the latest amendments, but when pressed how he knew that, McKinley ignored the question.The amendments that McKinley believes will improve the legislation were critical to getting the bill over the finish line. The first amendment, which brought roughly 20 Freedom Caucus members who were voting no to yes, would allow states to opt out of the Obamacare provisions ensuring that people with pre-existing conditions are charged the same amount as healthy people, as well as the provisions mandating that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits ― things like lab services, maternity care and emergency room visits.That amendment, worked out between moderate leader Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) and Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), was key to reviving health care talks, after the first version of the bill was pulled from the floor at the end of March. MacArthur and Meadows’ amendment will be difficult for the CBO to score, as they’ll have to predict whether states opt out of those Affordable Care Act provisions and set up a high-risk pool for sick people. (One of the conditions of a state waiving those regulations is that it establishes a high-risk pool.)Republicans argue the high-risk pools are a sufficient protection for those people with pre-existing conditions, though, historically, those pools have been underfunded and people in them have paid much higher premiums and deductibles. The Center for American Progress estimated earlier this week that the Republican health care bill underfunds the high-risk pools by $200 billion over 10 years. In a small bow to moderates, GOP leaders agreed to accept an amendment that would add $8 billion over five years for states that waive those Obamacare regulations to help people facing higher premiums. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who was a “no” vote on the bill earlier in the week, said leadership told him $5 billion would cover the costs of those higher premiums and he got $8 billion, though Upton doesn’t know where those figures came from and the Center for American Progress estimates it would only cover the costs of about 80,000 people ― a tiny portion of the people who could be affected by the change. Either way, that amendment brought Upton and fellow Energy and Commerce member Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) back to a “yes” vote, and it was later treated as a key reasoning for Reps. David Young (R-Iowa,) Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), and David Valadao (R-Calif.) ― three potentially vulnerable Republicans who had been holding out ― to flip to a “yes” vote.Those three members were key to leadership moving ahead, but there were dozens more Republicans who said they were undecided about the legislation that leadership had to win over.While this bill’s passage will be treated as a victory for Paul Ryan and Donald Trump ― and, at least in the short-term, it is ― Republicans have chief deputy whip Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) to thank for shoring up support among many doubtful members. McHenry worked the floor frantically in the week leading up to the vote, convincing fence-sitting Republicans to help leadership out by voting “yes.”Of course, Meadows and MacArthur were also instrumental in reviving the bill, and Trump’s force of character may have helped persuade some members not to cross him. But on the president’s first real legislative battle, he showed that he can lose and he can “win” ― if you believe Republicans passing any bill at any cost constitutes a win ― as long as he mostly stays out of the specific negotiations."

This law, which passed a City Council vote with flying colors last month, was written to support women and people of color. A summary of the new law, which was introduced by public advocate Letitia James in August of last year, reads as such: This bill would prohibit employers from inquiring about a prospective employee’s salary history during all stages of the employment process. In the event that an employer is already aware of a prospective employee’s salary history, this bill would prohibit reliance on that information in the determination of salary. “Being underpaid once should not condemn one to a lifetime of inequity,” James said in a statement when the bill passed in April. “We will never close the wage gap unless we continue to enact proactive policies that promote economic justice and equity.” The new law comes six months after de Blasio signed a similar one in November 2016, which limited the ban on asking about a potential employee’s previous salary to government employers; this new law will apply city-wide to public and private institutions.

Just bros being bros.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590aa2511700002400dd6735.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Today, as every year on May 4, Star Wars fans will take over social media celebrating the iconic franchise. This year, the holiday has a special focus: Gay The Fourth, a celebration of LGBTQ fans and the need for queer representation in the series. And make no mistake, that need is great.The Star Wars universe has not featured a single LGBTQ character in a film or television show. Ever. Evidently the stories take place in a universe populated by aliens and Force-wielding Jedi, but only heterosexual and cisgender people. This is an utter failure of imagination at best, complete creative cowardice at worst.And, frankly, it’s time to do better.Stories matter. Fiction helps define our landscape of possibilities and helps determine whose experiences we can identify with. For many people, storylines in movies and TV are the most powerful way they come to see and understand people who are not like them. Seeing the experiences of people unlike ourselves is humanizing and normalizing. Once you watch someone struggle and love and hurt and celebrate, it becomes a lot harder to dismiss them as disgusting, or the enemy.Even more importantly, LGBTQ audiences desperately need to see ourselves reflected in our most popular and accessible stories. You can’t be what you can’t see. Children need to grow up seeing characters like themselves, knowing they matter and are worthy of having stories told about them. That they are worthy of being heroes. Adults need it just as much.What happens when we can’t find ourselves in our most important stories? What happens when we can’t see ourselves as heroes? When no one can? What makes any story powerful are the small moments reminding us that we are not alone in our experiences. LGBTQ audiences deserve that too.Given the current cultural climate, it’s all the more important. The current administration is bloated with anti-LGBTQ voices and has already rolled back key protections. President Trump is likely to sign a “license to discriminate” executive order soon. Hate crimes are on the rise, and not even a year after the Pulse nightclub shooting, we are no safer.Hollywood, unfortunately, is not doing its part to fight back. Only 17.5% of films released by major studies in 2015 included characters who were explicitly LGBTQ, according to GLAAD’s Studio Responsibility Index report. That’s no better than the year before. And the numbers are even worse among genre films (action, sci-fi, fantasy, and horror), of which only 6.4% were inclusive. Much of this representation is only as a punchline.Stunningly, two studios contributed precisely zero inclusive films in 2015: Paramount and Disney. Disney, in charge of both the Star Wars franchise and the Marvel cinematic universe, has perhaps the best chance of any major studio to include LGBTQ characters in a meaningful and powerful way. Yet both of those incredibly popular universes feature zero queer characters on the big screen.This is not “social justice warrior” pandering. Erasing the existence of LGBTQ people actively keeps old prejudices alive and fosters a more dangerous climate, not only in the U.S., but around the world where audiences soak up these stories as eagerly as we do. Creators have a responsibility to consider the messages they are sending to the world and to use the power and influence that comes with a franchise like this to do some good — to faithfully represent the world not only as it is, but as it should be in terms of the stories of those who have been erased and demonized. In short, gay Star Wars characters could save lives in this galaxy.Star Wars is insanely popular and almost universally recognizable. It has a huge audience and a huge impact. Creators have already realized the positive effect they can make by placing non-white and women heroes central to the newest films. It’s past time they extend the same thought to their LGBTQ fans.Star Wars is about defeating coded space Nazis, overcoming the forces of fear with hope, and resisting authoritarian power used to control and harm. So it’s not like the inclusion of LGBTQ characters would be wildly off-theme. And you can’t argue that gay characters are any less realistic than Force magic, with all that levitating and long-distancing strangling.Nor would such inclusion come as a huge shock to the audience. Rumors have swirled around other characters before, but with the arrival of Finn and Poe, almost no one would even be surprised. The actors have teased it. The director has teased it. The President of Lucasfilm has teased it. Devoted fans and media outlets and casual watchers have all noticed the possibility. Not to mention the many, many fans breathlessly, painfully rooting for it.That’s assuming, of course, you don’t count Baze and Chirrut from Rogue One as the universe’s first gay couple. Many people, myself included, left the theater not realizing they hadn’t actually been a confirmed couple. The chemistry and possibility was so obvious we took it for granted. Now, we’re ready for more than subtext.We know the Powers That Be have considered it. The question has been asked and answered several times. Some involved in Star Wars — from directors to actors — have spoken positively about the potential for future LGBTQ characters, but fans don’t have time to wait around while they tease the possibilities. (J.J. Abrams said “of course” there are gays in space. We have to ask: Where?)After all, these are space nazis we’re talking about — a terrifyingly relevant concept always, but especially now. All we want is permission to join the fight and swing some lightsabers alongside our heterosexual brethren, because these queer hands aren’t new to the struggle against the dark side.

Turns out, there’s a lot of bacteria on that piece of gym equipment you’re using. Fit Rated, a website that reviews fitness products, commissioned indoor air quality laboratory EmLab P&K to perform lab testing on three different gyms and 27 different pieces of equipment, which included treadmills, bikes and free weights, to examine gym cleanliness.Let’s just the say the findings are more nauseating than an intense cardio session.The study revealed that there is 39 times more bacteria on an exercise bike than on a reusable plastic lunch tray. There’s 74 times more bacteria on a treadmill than on a water faucet and ― here’s the kicker ― 362 times more bacteria on free weights than on a toilet seat. A toilet seat! According to the findings, 52 percent of the bacteria found on treadmills are the “most common cause of skin infections and a frequent cause of pneumonia and septicemia,” while 70 percent of the overall bacteria found “are potentially harmful to humans.”It’s important to note that this wasn’t a wide-ranging study. A sample size of three gyms is relatively small. However, it still provides insight into the cleanliness of the equipment you’re using during your sweat session. But before you swear off working out forever, try taking a big yoga inhale and out. It’s not all bad news, according to Kelly Reynolds, microbiologist and associate professor at the Zuckerman College of Public Health in Arizona.Reynolds, who was not involved with the study, shared a silver lining with HuffPost about the nature of the bacteria found on your favorite gym machines. “Not all the bacteria targeted here are the disease-causing type,” she said. “But the large numbers do indicate a high level of contamination potentials and a low level of routine cleaning and disinfecting.”So, what is a fitness devotee with a strong desire to stay healthy to do? Reynolds said that using the disinfecting wipes offered in gyms before and after use helps, but what matters most is what you do once you leave.“Your best defense is to be aware of washing your hands post workout and before eating or touching your face,” she said. “Rinsing off any exposed skin that may have come into contact with contaminated surfaces is also recommended.”Done and done.

According to the outlet, this is the first time backlash against Trump has affected an American brands’ sales in Mexico.“The numbers reflect the anti-Trump sentiment clearly,” Valentin Mendoza, an analyst at Banorte-IXE, said in a conversation Bloomberg. In the first quarter, he estimated that there was “a 9 percent fall in the sales productivity at Starbucks stores.” Starbucks’ 600 stores in Mexico are operated by the restaurant company Alsea SAB. The brand, along with McDonald’s, Walmart and Coca-Cola, became the subject of intense anti-Trump backlash and boycotts at the beginning of the year when Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, spoke out about Trump’s proposed border wall in early January.Backlash against Starbucks in Mexico again gained traction at the end of January, when Trump signed an executive order to begin construction on the border wall and Peña Nieto then canceled a meeting with Trump. Two powerful social media campaigns, called #AdiosStarbucks and #AdiosProductosGringos, ensued, sweeping social media and encouraging people to boycott the coffee chain. Starbucks quickly issued a statement in response to the protests, reinforcing its commitment to Mexico. "
44,POLITICS,Some Flint Residents Could Face Foreclosure Over Unpaid Water Bills,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-residents-unpaid-water-bills-foreclosure_us_5909e494e4b05c397684e4ec,People are still drinking bottled water over fears of lead contamination.,2017-05-03,"The interior of the Flint water plant is seen on Sept. 14, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5909ef441700002000dd64ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thousands of people in Flint, Michigan, could face foreclosure because of unpaid water bills, despite the fact that many residents won’t even touch the water. The city warned 8,000 Flint homeowners that they could get slapped with tax liens if they’re more than six months behind on their water accounts. Failure to pay a tax lien could eventually result in foreclosure. “I understand it’s the law, but I don’t like it because of the circumstances,” Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in an emailed statement. “We are working to see if any changes or something can be done to help the residents affected by this.”Flint became a symbol of water infrastructure woes in the U.S. after mismanagement by the city and state contaminated the water with lead, a deadly neurotoxin. The federal government declared an emergency in January 2016, but the city’s water has only recently begun to meet federal standards. And the fiscal pressures that pushed Flint to look for a cheaper water source in 2014, which led to the contamination, haven’t gone away. The city is desperate for revenue, and the tax lien warnings come after the city started sending water cutoff notices in March. “We have to have revenue coming in, so we can’t ... give people water at the tap and not get revenue coming in to pay those bills,” a spokesman for the city’s Treasury Department told the local Fox affiliate, which first reported the lien warnings.Foreclosures due to unpaid utility bills do happen. Laws in all 50 states allow local governments to sell properties through the tax lien foreclosure process, according to the National Consumer Law Center. A spokeswoman for Weaver said delinquent Flint water customers have until May 19 to avoid the threatened tax liens and until February 2018 to pay the outstanding charges before their accounts would be flagged for collection. Although it’s not unheard of for a municipality to foreclose on a homeowner over unpaid taxes or utility bills, it’s somewhat shocking to think it could happen in a city that’s had famously toxic water since 2014. The notices also mark a shift in state policy toward beleaguered Flint residents. Thanks to a measure passed by the Michigan legislature, Flint residents last year got discounts on their water bills, which are among the very highest in the nation. The discount ended this year.“Flint families should not have to pay for water that they still cannot drink, and they certainly should not lose their homes over this ongoing water crisis that was caused by the callous decisions of state government,” Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said in an emailed statement, adding that he opposed the state’s decision to suspend the water credits. The U.S. Congress passed legislation giving Flint nearly $100 million to replace its lead pipes, a process the city estimates could take until 2020. Although the city is synonymous with lead-tainted water, it is now one of the only municipalities making an effort to get the lead out.Millions of pipes made from the deadly neurotoxin, which can cause miscarriages and infant brain damage, remain in use in cities across the country after they were installed decades ago. Federal regulations allow utilities to deliver lead-contaminated water to household taps, which is basically why the Flint water crisis happened. Samples from residents’ homes show lead levels in Flint meet federal standards, but officials have yet to tell people it’s safe to drink the water. UPDATE ― May 18: The Flint City Council voted this week to place a one-year moratorium on tax liens from water bills. The measure still requires approval from a state advisory board. The American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund had asked the city to impose the moratorium, which it said the mayor’s office had the authority to do without legislation. "

In addition to Trump, the suit names Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as defendants.“What Trump’s executive order tries to do is upset this protection ― take it away,” said Erik Grafe, an attorney in Earthjustice’s Alaska office. “So we’re suing to restore the protection before oil companies come rushing back into the Arctic.”Environmental advocates have been resisting the expansion of offshore drilling for years, citing major risks to marine life, coastal communities and the climate.In November, then-President Barack Obama’s Interior Department imposed a temporary ban on drilling in the Arctic’s Beaufort and Chukchi seas until 2022. The action limited offshore drilling to the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet. One month later, Obama used his executive authority to extend permanent protections for large swaths of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, relying on a provision of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The lawsuit says Trump exceeded his constitutional authority by illegally attempting to reopen areas to drilling that are now withdrawn under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.“This administration seems to pander to fossil fuel companies at the expense of Alaska’s indigenous people, our future, our traditions,” said Faith Gemmill, executive director of Resisting Environmental Destruction on Indigenous Lands, an Alaska Natives advocacy group that is one of 10 plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “We’re hoping the courts right this wrong.”Gemmill said offshore drilling could endanger bowhead whales, walrus and seals, which are dietary staples for Alaska’s Native coastal communities.“They are dependent on healthy ocean for their food security, their culture and their spirituality,” Gemmill said. “They call [the ocean] their garden. It provides everything they need to survive in this harsh, cold environment.”Rising sea levels created by climate change have already forced some indigenous coastal communities in Alaska to relocate. Climate scientists say further investment in fossil fuels will exacerbate the problem.“The Arctic Ocean is not a rational place to drill for oil,” Grafe said. “It’s far too risky and it locks in fossil fuel energy when we need to invest in clean energy to leave the planet for our kids.”A majority of Americans believe the U.S. should focus on developing renewable energy.

48,POLITICS,Why Trump Can't Ruin Retirement For The Nation's Top Drug Policy Reformer,Nick Wing and Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ethan-nadelmann-trump-drug-policy-alliance_us_5909efeae4b02655f842f58f,Ethan Nadelmann is moving on after decades of helping change U.S. drug laws. He's confident the Trump administration can't destroy his legacy.,2017-05-03,"Ethan Nadelmann, seen here in 2013, retired from the Drug Policy Alliance in April.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5909f0301400008b031a64fd.jpeg?cache=hFFrDyMSws&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the course of his career, Ethan Nadelmann has gotten used to winning. The 60-year-old has been actively shaping U.S. drug policy since 1996, when he helped organize a ballot initiative to make California the first state to legalize medical marijuana. More than two decades later, 29 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, recreational marijuana is legal in eight of those states and in the nation’s capital, and support for legalization stands at an all-time high.For the past 17 years, Nadelmann has overseen this progress as the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for the reform of drug laws. His tenure at the organization has been marked not only by numerous victories against marijuana prohibition, but by much broader efforts to tackle the consequences of a trillion-dollar global drug war that has failed by all observable metrics. Nadelmann has helped open people’s eyes to the problems of mass incarceration, and the damage caused by the stigmatization and criminalization of drug use. At the same time, he’s successfully championed a more humane approach to policy that confronts decades of racial and economic injustice in drug enforcement.Last November, as Nadelmann quietly prepared to announce his retirement from DPA, he attended an election-night party hoping to celebrate one final triumph with the group. Nadelmann recalls watching the returns with billionaire political donor George Soros, one of DPA’s biggest funders, and being struck by a sense of dread as it became clear Hillary Clinton was going to lose.“It was this weird night where I was devastated by the broader national political news ― and meanwhile, with all these marijuana victories coming through, not only am I not able to express any joy, I’m not even able to feel any joy,” Nadelmann later told HuffPost.By the end of the night, eight states had legalized marijuana for either recreational or medical use. Donald Trump had also become president-elect, leaving Nadelmann to choose between going ahead with retirement or remaining at DPA and fighting to preserve the drug policy gains he’d helped secure.Nadelmann chose the former, and in January he announced that he’d be stepping down from DPA in April. Two weeks later, the U.S. Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions ― a staunch opponent of marijuana whom Nadelmann has called a “drug war dinosaur” ― as Trump’s attorney general. The Trump administration has given drug policy reformers little to celebrate in its first 100 days. But for all the concern over Sessions, who’s raised the possibility of a federal crackdown on state-legal marijuana, Nadelmann remains confident that progress on drug policy will be safe, even as he takes a more diminished role in the movement.“Most of this will not be reversed in the foreseeable future,” Nadelmann said. “Drug law reform is going to continue to advance.”Nadelmann acknowledges that DPA will have plenty of work to do in his absence, but he believes the organization has already made substantial strides in swaying the American public toward a progressive vision of drug policy reform.This involves more than convincing people that the drug war has failed ― a view that most Americans support anyway, according to polling in recent years.To understand DPA’s ethos, it’s necessary to view drug policy on a spectrum, says Nadelmann, with “punitive, draconian policies” on one end, and completely “free-market libertarian policies” on the other. Progressive drug policies are grounded in principles of decriminalization, legal regulation, human rights, public health and harm reduction, with the organizing belief that people should have sovereignty over their own minds and bodies. The goal is to find policies that don’t themselves create major risks of increased drug abuse or criminality.“The optimal drug policy seeks to reduce the negative consequences of drugs, and to reduce the negative consequences of prohibitionist policies,” Nadelmann said. “Everything that we advance is driven by solid scientific evidence, or by empirical evidence or by economic analysis, followed by the ethical or ideological element that’s grounded in human rights.”This pitch has gotten more appealing in recent years, but in the past, the drug policy reform movement suffered from public misperceptions about its mission, Nadelmann said. Many mistakenly believed the only options in the debate were continuing to wage a ruthless drug war or legalizing all illegal substances. On one side were drug warriors ― law enforcement officials and tough-on-crime politicians. On the other were drug war critics ― either “cold-hearted libertarians,” as Nadelmann put it, or reformers often accused of being interested in change only because they themselves used drugs. That was a false dichotomy, said Nadelmann.“We’re social justice libertarians,” he said. “We typically care a lot more about issues of fairness and economic redistribution than libertarians do, but we care a lot more about issues of personal liberty than most liberals do.”As the drug policy reform movement has grown, it’s illustrated the wide array of options available for dealing with matters of drug use and abuse. President Barack Obama’s administration was mildly receptive toward certain progressive initiatives, but the vast majority of drug policy successes have happened outside the purview of the federal government. Municipalities have been slowly advancing on decriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs, for example. States have also dramatically improved access to drug treatment programs and to naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug that has saved countless lives. And there’s been growing bipartisan support for needle exchange programs ― now operating in at least 35 states ― to stop the spread of bloodborne disease. More humane drug laws are only one part of DPA’s mission. The group has also pushed statewide efforts to reform controversial drug enforcement tactics that allow police to seize cash and property from people suspected of drug crimes, often without evidence. In California, DPA campaigned for legislation that reduced some low-level nonviolent felonies, including drug possession, to misdemeanors. In New Jersey, the group supported a bill that has eliminated the use of cash bail for minor drug offenses and other low-level crimes ― which means poorer defendants don’t have to sit in jail simply because they can’t afford to pay for their freedom before trial.DPA’s advocacy work also offers an alternative to the “tough on crime” rhetoric once frequently heard in Congress. Lawmakers are now discussing ways to reduce the prison population, step back from mandatory minimum sentences, and support efforts to rehabilitate offenders rather than punishing them with increasingly harsh penalties. Those sorts of measures, far outside the political mainstream just two decades ago, made it into both Republican and Democratic Party platforms in 2016 and currently enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress. These achievements suggest to Nadelmann that he and his colleagues are winning hearts and minds in their effort to end the drug war.“In America, we’ve been so culturally, historically and ideologically tied to this belief in abstinence-only approaches to dealing with drug use and addiction ― the notion that sobriety from mind-altering substances is not just a legal but a moral mandate,” he said. “It’s a quasi-religious view that my body is essentially God’s sacred vessel, and it is my obligation to my Lord and my maker not to pollute this vessel of his with these psychoactive plants and chemicals.”It’s that ideology, Nadelmann says, that led the United States to outlaw alcohol in 1920, and to adopt a similarly clumsy approach to other drugs over the past several decades. That attitude has also made some Americans resistant to the idea that drug policy can demonstrate compassion for users.With that skepticism finally starting to fade, though, Nadelmann sees an exciting future for drug policy, which will likely have to grapple with new challenges and difficult questions.Chief among them could be the nation’s approach to legalizing drugs other than marijuana. Nadlemann believes it’s necessary to address this thorny issue on a substance-by-substance basis. If the nation is ever going to see the marijuana legalization model as one that could be applied to other drugs, Nadelmann says, the government must first demonstrate that it can adequately exercise its regulatory responsibilities toward pot.Nadelmann has higher hopes for a national policy that would take its cues from Portugal, which decriminalized the use and possession of small amounts of drugs in 2001. Portugal soon saw lower levels of drug use, a decrease in new HIV infections, and far fewer overdose deaths than in neighboring countries, and its policy move has been widely regarded as a success.As for the opioid epidemic claiming tens of thousands of lives each year in the U.S., Nadelmann says there’s an urgent need for more innovative solutions. He points to a Swiss model that involves prescribing heroin to people battling addiction and providing them with safe-injection sites where they can be monitored or get access to treatment. A number of U.S. cities are looking into creating these facilities, though the idea has met some resistance.“Drug policy reform is a matter of incremental reform toward an ultimate vision,” Nadelmann said. “It’s not as if there’s any Berlin Wall of drug prohibition that’s gonna come crashing down.”While Nadelmann downplays the possibility of a full-scale federal assault on legal marijuana, he says there are still a number of “insidious” ways Sessions could undermine the momentum of a fledgling weed industry.Trump has yet to appoint his U.S. attorneys, who could prove to be hostile to marijuana reform. At Sessions’ direction, they could partner with local sheriffs and prosecutors who oppose legalization, and target bigger players in the industry to sow fear and intimidate other state-legal businesses, Nadelmann said. And while Sessions has shown no immediate signs of reversing Obama-era guidance de-emphasizing marijuana enforcement, he hasn’t committed to keeping that guidance in place, either. Even if he did, Nadelmann says, the attorney general could interpret the guidance in a stricter manner, allowing him to ratchet up enforcement.Whatever route Sessions decides to take will ultimately depend on how much “chaos” he wants to inflict on state marijuana operations, Nadelmann said.It’s a reminder that drug policy reformers should be ready to defend their gains from potential attacks in the coming years. But after spending decades building a strong foundation for change, it seems like the movement is prepared to continue on its successful trajectory.“Trump and Sessions are giving us some blowback, but essentially I and DPA have become ever more influential and ever more part of the national dialogue ― not by changing what we believe or what we advocate, but by simply persisting with what it is we say and do,” Nadelmann said. “What’s changed, really, is the way the government and the public look at these issues.”"

Same-sex marriage, those business owners claimed, simply went against their religious beliefs. In March 2015, Vice President Mike Pence ― who was then governor of Indiana ― signed a statewide Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. At the time, Pence argued that the law did not allow discrimination against anyone. LGBTQ rights advocates felt differently, and Apple, Marriott and other corporations condemned the law. (Pence signed a revised version explicitly barring Indiana businesses from denying services to someone on the basis of categories that include sexual orientation and gender identity days later.) In February, a document that was said to be a draft of Trump’s original religious freedom executive order was leaked to HuffPost, The Nation and other media outlets. That version, titled “Establishing a Government-Wide Initiative to Respect Religious Freedom,” vowed to protect the tax-exempt status of any religious organization or privately held company that “believes, speaks, or acts (or declines to act) in accordance with the belief that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman” and “sexual relations are properly reserved for such a marriage, male and female.”The White House quickly distanced itself from the leaked document, while the order itself was reportedly abandoned at the suggestion of Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Still, there were reports that Pence and a small team of conservative allies began revising the order shortly thereafter. The aim of the revised draft, one official told Politico, hasn’t changed much since the version leaked in February. “The language is very, very strong,” the source said.Whether or not the executive order reaches Trump’s desk on Thursday remains to be seen. But a number of high-profile queer advocacy groups, including GLAAD, GLSEN and the National LGBTQ Task Force, are already condemning the move. “If this possible executive order is similar to February’s draft, it would do nothing except give a national license to discriminate, and endanger LGBTQ people and their families,” GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. “President Trump is trying to create an America where my children could be turned away if a pediatrician doesn’t accept my wife and I. Nothing could be more un-American.”ThinkProgress’s Zack Ford felt similarly, and tweeted Wednesday: See how other LGBTQ groups reacted to the reports below. "

In March 2015, Vice President Mike Pence ― who was then governor of Indiana ― signed a statewide Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law. At the time, Pence argued that the law did not allow discrimination against anyone. LGBTQ rights advocates felt differently, and Apple, Marriott and other corporations condemned the law. (Pence signed a revised version explicitly barring Indiana businesses from denying services to someone on the basis of categories that include sexual orientation and gender identity days later.) In February, a document that was said to be a draft of Trump’s original religious freedom executive order was leaked to HuffPost, The Nation and other media outlets. That version, titled “Establishing a Government-Wide Initiative to Respect Religious Freedom,” vowed to protect the tax-exempt status of any religious organization or privately held company that “believes, speaks, or acts (or declines to act) in accordance with the belief that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman” and “sexual relations are properly reserved for such a marriage, male and female.”The White House quickly distanced itself from the leaked document, while the order itself was reportedly abandoned at the suggestion of Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Still, there were reports that Pence and a small team of conservative allies began revising the order shortly thereafter. The aim of the revised draft, one official told Politico, hasn’t changed much since the version leaked in February. “The language is very, very strong,” the source said.Whether or not the executive order reaches Trump’s desk on Thursday remains to be seen. But a number of high-profile queer advocacy groups, including GLAAD, GLSEN and the National LGBTQ Task Force, are already condemning the move. “If this possible executive order is similar to February’s draft, it would do nothing except give a national license to discriminate, and endanger LGBTQ people and their families,” GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. “President Trump is trying to create an America where my children could be turned away if a pediatrician doesn’t accept my wife and I. Nothing could be more un-American.”ThinkProgress’s Zack Ford felt similarly, and tweeted Wednesday: See how other LGBTQ groups reacted to the reports below. "

In one case documented by Human Rights First, a nonprofit advocacy group, a Customs and Border Protection agent allegedly told an asylum-seeker that things were different under President Donald Trump.  “Trump says we don’t have to let you in,” the officer said, according to an attorney cited in the report. In another example, a Mexican woman said CBP told her the U.S. is granting asylum only to people who are killed for being Christians in other countries, “not people like you.” CBP has been accused for years of failing to live up to its obligations toward asylum-seekers, who have the right under law to ask for relief in the U.S. if they fear returning home. But immigrant advocates and attorneys fear things have gotten worse since Trump’s election. Immigrant advocates say that as the Trump administration boasts of lower apprehension numbers, a contributing factor could be the vulnerable individuals and families who have legitimate asylum claims but are being turned away before they get the chance to express them. Human Rights First’s Shaw Drake, the primary author of the report, said he has seen more cases of border agents and security guards turning away asylum-seekers without any type of processing. Some aren’t even able to get inside the building where they should get to explain their situation, he found, based on interviews with asylum-seekers, attorneys and advocates. The report is based on 125 cases, but Drake said he suspects it’s the “tip of the iceberg,” since they likely didn’t find all of the people in a similar situation. CBP, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security and includes the Border Patrol, is not supposed to have an extensive role in determining asylum claims; agents are supposed to admit people if they express fear of returning to their native country, and then an asylum officer from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is supposed to assess their claim in what’s called a credible fear interview before they continue the process. CBP has not changed any of its policies regarding asylum procedures, which are based on international law with the goal of “protecting vulnerable and persecuted persons,” agency spokesman Carlos Díaz said in a statement. “CBP officers do not determine or evaluate the validity of the fear expressed,” he said. “As an agency, CBP adheres to law and policy on processing asylum claims and does not tolerate abuse of these policies.”Attorneys and advocates said that in practice, however, agents and officers don’t always transfer people who express fear to asylum officers for evaluation. In April, Mexico-based attorney Nicole Ramos said she went with a Honduran client to the U.S. border and the officer wouldn’t even let them past the first gate.The woman fled Honduras a few years ago and had refugee status in Mexico, but then wanted to seek asylum in the U.S. after she was raped in Mexico by a man who then stalked her around the country, Ramos said. CBP directed her to Grupos Beta, a branch of the Mexican government that sets appointments with CBP for certain asylum-seekers ― but one that has refused to set appointments for people with legal status in Mexico, such as Ramos’ client. Ramos said she told the CBP officer and a supervisor that that wasn’t what the law said and read it to them, but they were dismissive and didn’t let the woman proceed to additional screening. “He literally said to me, ‘I don’t care what that says,’” Ramos said of the supervisor.Human Rights First’s report documents some of the problems with the Grupos Beta process, which was initially created to deal with an influx in Haitians coming through Mexico to seek asylum in the United States. CBP often refers non-Haitians there, even though the Mexican government says that’s not what it’s designed for.Advocates in Mexico said Grupos Beta officials have told them, “stop lying to people, CBP told us they are not giving asylum in the United States anymore,” according to the Human Rights First report. The organization calls in its report for the U.S. to immediately end the appointment system with Grupos Beta and give training and clear instructions to the field about how to handle asylum-seekers, including the fact that they are not required to have an appointment. Human Rights First also calls for the DHS inspector general and Congress to look into the matter. Shaw said the anecdotes he and other researchers collected for the report were disturbing and must be addressed, even if not reflective of every CBP agent and officer. “The U.S. has always in my mind stood as a leader globally on human rights,” Drake told HuffPost. “To have U.S. agents directly violating U.S. law and international treaty obligations in turning people away is both shocking and disturbing to me as an American.” "

However, news announcing that both of the officers had been acquitted began to rapidly spread after multiple media outlets ― including The Washington Post, The Associated Press and The New York Times ― were told the outcome from independent sources. The official decision is expected to be announced at a press conference on Wednesday. Baton Rouge residents, many of whom had swarmed the streets for days last summer in protest of Sterling’s death, had been bracing for the DOJ’s decision for months, hoping the officers would be held accountable for their actions. However, their expectations were measured considering the little, if any, faith many have in the ability of President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to see why an indictment would be warranted in this case. “When Trump appointed Sessions as the Justice Department head, we knew with his history that nothing was going to change and I think it’s a shame,” NAACP Baton Rouge Vice President Byron Sharper told HuffPost on Tuesday. “This country is at a point where we’re either going to make it or break it. Not just Baton Rouge, but the entire country. And we got a president ― wild and crazy ass Trump – who is not a good fit for anybody. I think a lot of people that voted for him are going to reap what they have sown.”A vigil was held on Tuesday outside the Triple S store where Sterling was shot. Dozens of people gathered for a peaceful demonstration to grieve as well as express their anger over what they say is another gross act of injustice against black lives. Sterling’s aunt Veda Washington spoke before the crowd, in disbelief of how she found out about the news.“Now we haven’t heard anything. The district attorney has not called us and told us anything. The lawyer called and said they have not made a decision. Ain’t that something?” she said. “But The Washington Post calls up here. Where’s my mayor, because she promised me she would let us know? Where’s the governor, because they promised my family that they would let us know?” In fact, it was Arthur Reed, a well-admired local activist known as “Silky Slim,” who shared the news with Sterling’s aunt. She immediately “broke down crying,” he told HuffPost. “It was rough on her.”Reed is also the founder of the group Stop the Killing, a community anti-violence nonprofit organization. As a former gang leader, Reed transformed his life and became a motivational speaker who has worked to fight back against violence, especially police killings of black people, and demands that Sessions “wake up” to the reality of racism within policing. “I don’t think people are going to continue to allow themselves to continue to be victims of these individuals who have infiltrated law enforcement and are killing African Americans,” he told HuffPost. “You have individuals who grew up in the Ku Klux Klan, whose parents were in the Ku Klux Klan and now they’re Ku Klux Klan and if they infiltrate law enforcement, they become Ku Klux Klan with a license to kill.” “So we have to be very real about what’s going on and look at these individuals who have infiltrated law enforcement and are carrying out these assassinations right before our eyes,” he continued. “This is a problem. Jeff Sessions has to wake up.” Despite not receiving official word from the DOJ and having only reports from national outlets, Baton Rouge residents expressed familiar feelings of pain and anguish.“Our officials should be ashamed of themselves.

Instead, the DOJ focuses on the leaker, not the outlet that publishes the information.The comments might have been reassuring to the news media in light of Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeatedly leaving the door open to prosecuting journalists for publishing classified information ― or in other words, doing their jobs. But Comey drew a sharp distinction between what he considers “legitimate” news reporting and the activities of WikiLeaks, an organization that identifies itself as a publisher even if its methods differ from traditional news outlets.“All of us care deeply about the First Amendment and the ability of a free press to get information about our work and publish it,” Comey said. “To my mind, it crosses a line when it moves from being about trying to educate a public and instead just becomes about intelligence porn, frankly.”Comey said during the hearing that he believed “a huge portion of WikiLeaks’ activities has nothing to do with legitimate newsgathering, informing the public, commenting on important public controversies, but is simply about releasing classified information to damage the United States of America.”American journalists “almost always call us before they publish classified information” to check if disclosures could put lives at risk, he said. WikiLeaks, in contrast, has “no such considerations whatsoever.”It’s “intelligence porn,” Comey added. “Just push it out in order to damage.”President Donald Trump expressed his “love” for WikiLeaks during his 2016 campaign as the organization published a steady stream of unflattering Democratic emails believed to have been obtained by Russian hackers. And yet Trump’s administration now appears to be targeting WikiLeaks. Comey’s dismissal of WikiLeaks as an illegitimate outlet comes as the Justice Department is reportedly considering prosecuting the organization and its founder, Julian Assange, over 2010 disclosures of military and diplomatic documents and a recent release of CIA documents. The Obama administration, which aggressively targeted leakers, prosecuted former Army Private Chelsea Manning for providing the 2010 documents to WikiLeaks, but decided against charging the organization, too. Doing so, the previous administration reasoned, could set a precedent for similarly prosecuting news outlets that publish classified information. Though mainstream journalists may view their newsgathering methods as different from WikiLeaks, many acknowledge that charging a publisher of classified information ― even an unorthodox one ― could create a slippery slope that infringes on the media’s ability to hold government accountable. On Wednesday, Arizona State journalism professor Dan Gillmor and Freedom of the Press Foundation Executive Director Trevor Timm each expressed alarm over Comey’s suggestion that the government would decide if a publisher is “legitimate” or not. During the hearing, Comey agreed with a recent intelligence assessment characterizing WikiLeaks as a “known outlet of foreign propaganda” and said he believed the organization’s work has endangered American lives.When asked why Assange ― who is currently living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London ― hasn’t been charged with a crime, Comey said he didn’t want to comment so as not to “confirm whether there are charges pending.”However, the FBI director made clear that “WikiLeaks is an important focus of our attention.”"

And given Wiley’s acting experience, she would know. In season four of “OINTB,” the death of Wiley’s character ― the result of a prison guard kneeling on her as a form of restraint ― was reminiscent of the killing of Eric Garner and spurred further discussion around police brutality. “I feel like it’s a real outlet for people to be able to speak their minds without having to actually use their literal voice to talk about that,” she continued. Where King’s legacy is concerned, Wiley said that as a gay black woman, she’s incredibly thankful for the social advancements he paved the way for. “I would not have [certain civil rights] without the struggle of him and people like him and people who were around when he was fighting for these things,” she said. She said applying MLK’s teachings today is a “no-brainer.”“We need to always look at our past so we don’t repeat it, which it seems like we’re doing now,” she said. "

At the same time, President Donald Trump is threatening to cut funding for critical services that help sustain this demographic.One in 11 seniors in America faces hunger, and that figure is expected to double over the next decade, according to Feeding America, a national food bank network. Advocacy groups are stressing this stat to create a sense of urgency at the start of Older Americans Month, which takes place during May.Their warnings come in the wake of Trump’s preliminary budget outline, released in March, which proposed cutting federal funding for several anti-poverty programs. That included eliminating a Department of Health and Human Services program that doles out grants to a number of initiatives, including some of the network groups within Meals on Wheels, a national initiative that represents 5,000 home-meal delivery organizations.And while the precise details of how Trump’s budget would directly impact Meals on Wheels are still murky, the organization is worried.“Our ability to provide services as basic as nutrition is completely dependent on our ability to raise federal funding,” Ellie Hollander, president and CEO, told HuffPost this week. “The concern remains because there’s a lot at stake.”About 35 percent of Meals on Wheels’ funding comes from the federal government. While Hollander is empathetic to the fact that government cuts have to happen somewhere, targeting programs like Meals on Wheels doesn’t make much budgeting sense, she said. That’s mostly because this program actually saves the government money by helping to keep seniors at home living independently, which is cheaper than what it would cost to send them to an emergency room or long-term facility.Meals on Wheels is able to feed a senior for an entire year for the equivalent cost of one day in a hospital or 10 days in a nursing home, Hollander said.Yet, the Trump administration doesn’t appear to appreciate the value of Meals on Wheels to seniors’ health and its ability to save taxpayers money. Budget director Mick Mulvaney said in March: “We can’t spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great. ... We cannot defend that anymore. We’re $20 trillion in debt.” But even before having to grapple with the proposed cuts, Meals on Wheels wasn’t able to keep pace with the growing demand among seniors in need.There are 10.2 million seniors who struggle with hunger in America, Hollander noted, but the organization serves only 2.4 million. Waiting lists for Meals on Wheels’ services continue to grow throughout the U.S., as does the number of seniors who are living longer.Every day, 12,000 seniors are turning 60, according to Meals on Wheels. That also means that more people are living longer with chronic illnesses, and need more resources in order to remain at home.Linda Preast, 56, who voted for Trump, has relied on Meals on Wheels since suffering a stroke two years ago.“I was under the influence that he was going to help us,” the Georgia resident told CBS News in March of her hopes for Trump. Many seniors never anticipated seeking assistance at this stage in life, as they expected to retire comfortably the way generations before them did.Donna, 76, who resides in Steuben, Maine, has a subsistence farm. She grows her own vegetables and raises most of her own meat, she told Feeding America in a recent interview. Still, Donna struggles to make ends meet and often looks to her local Feeding America food bank to get such staples as lettuce, dried beans and rice.“When you’re young, you’re kind of infallible,” Donna said. “I never thought I would have to ask anyone for any help. At 76, you should be retired or you should be able to take care of yourself.”More than 7 million seniors seek food assistance from Feeding America’s network of food banks.Donna said she often has to choose between buying food and paying her electric bill, which is a common tradeoff senior citizens in need have to make.More than 60 percent of older adult households Feeding America serves report choosing between buying food and paying utility bills. The same percentage reported deciding between food and medical care or prescriptions. Meals on Wheels is currently looking to implement new financial models to help support the program. In Maryland, for example, it’s experimenting with social impact bonds with Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. If that program proves successful, the organization will scale the model across the country, Hollander said.She’s hopeful such alternatives will help sustain the organization when federal dollars don’t.“It’s about neighbors helping neighbors,” Hollander said of the essence of Meals on Wheels. “While the social and moral imperative clearly should be enough for the world’s wealthiest country to step up and provide for their senior neighbors, that doesn’t seem to be enough.”"

At the same time, President Donald Trump is threatening to cut funding for critical services that help sustain this demographic.One in 11 seniors in America faces hunger, and that figure is expected to double over the next decade, according to Feeding America, a national food bank network. Advocacy groups are stressing this stat to create a sense of urgency at the start of Older Americans Month, which takes place during May.Their warnings come in the wake of Trump’s preliminary budget outline, released in March, which proposed cutting federal funding for several anti-poverty programs. That included eliminating a Department of Health and Human Services program that doles out grants to a number of initiatives, including some of the network groups within Meals on Wheels, a national initiative that represents 5,000 home-meal delivery organizations.And while the precise details of how Trump’s budget would directly impact Meals on Wheels are still murky, the organization is worried.“Our ability to provide services as basic as nutrition is completely dependent on our ability to raise federal funding,” Ellie Hollander, president and CEO, told HuffPost this week. “The concern remains because there’s a lot at stake.”About 35 percent of Meals on Wheels’ funding comes from the federal government. While Hollander is empathetic to the fact that government cuts have to happen somewhere, targeting programs like Meals on Wheels doesn’t make much budgeting sense, she said. That’s mostly because this program actually saves the government money by helping to keep seniors at home living independently, which is cheaper than what it would cost to send them to an emergency room or long-term facility.Meals on Wheels is able to feed a senior for an entire year for the equivalent cost of one day in a hospital or 10 days in a nursing home, Hollander said.Yet, the Trump administration doesn’t appear to appreciate the value of Meals on Wheels to seniors’ health and its ability to save taxpayers money.

Then there was the counter-argument that those concerned about Obama’s new source of income are just racists.But aside from the accusations of racism, this debate isn’t new. Debates about the propriety of ex-presidential behavior trace back to the country’s founding. But the contemporary question begins 40 years ago with an important decision made by Gerald Ford.Yes, Gerald Ford.Few historians would put Ford, the 38th President of the United States, on their list of most influential and important presidents. His accidental ascension to the presidency after the resignation of Richard Nixon is perhaps best remembered for the pardon he gave his predecessor and his oversight of the country’s official retreat from Vietnam.It was Ford’s time as an ex-president that was truly revolutionary. In a break from every ex-president before him, Ford decided to turn the prestige of the presidency into cash. He joined corporate boards and hit the paid-speaking circuit.“[H]e didn’t just commercialize the former presidency; he created the commercialized former presidency,” Ford biographer Thomas DeFrank said in an interview with the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation. “That’s why I said in my book that every former president should go visit his grave in Grand Rapids and thank him for ensuring that they will be instant zillionaires.”Just like Obama, Ford got serious flak for monetizing the highest office in the nation after leaving it ― from the press, presidential historians and even his former press secretary.Ford even accepted money to hawk a presidential medal collection, signing a 1978 deal with Franklin Mint, which claimed to be the world’s largest private producer of coins. The silver medal set sold for $1,950 and the gold for $2,750. In a letter featuring his official ex-president letterhead, Ford asked recipients to buy the medals: “From the days of George Washington to our own time, the story of the American presidency has been one of continuing challenge and responsibility. That is why I believe the Medallic History of the American Presidency will provide a meaningful way for many American families to enrich their knowledge and appreciation of the heritage of freedom we enjoy.”“We wish he could earn his way without dragging the presidency into it,” the New York Times responded in an editorial. Jerald terHorst, Ford’s first White House press secretary, wrote in the Washington Post that he wished his former boss would stop the “huckstering and hustling and merchandising of the presidency.”“Mr. Ford believes in the free enterprise system, and is engaging in that,” Ford’s assistant, Robert Barrett, countered when asked by the Associated Press in 1978.DeFrank later recounted a similar argument from Ford himself: “I will always remember ... him pounding the desk and saying, ‘God damn it, Tom, it’s the free enterprise system at its finest.’”Ford’s reasoning reflects its place in time. The 1970s featured a number of revolutionary decisions in corporate America to decouple itself from its obligations to labor and society at large and enter into the global marketplace, while still asserting its political power in the U.S. Unsurprisingly, income inequality exploded ― arguably leading to today’s record high levels.The nation’s first brand ambassador-turned-president, Ronald Reagan, also benefited from these new post-presidential perks. Japanese firm Fujisankei paid Reagan $2 million to deliver two 20 minutes speeches in Japan in 1989, less than a year after leaving office. Fujisankei paid an additional $5 million to cover costs related to the former president’s trip.Reagan was also criticized for this ― some guy named Donald Trump even poked fun at him for taking money from U.S. businesses by promoting competitors in Japan. “Former Presidents haven’t always comported themselves with dignity after leaving the Oval Office,”a 1989 New York Times article read. “But none have plunged so blatantly into pure commercialism.”Every president since has followed Ford and Reagan’s lead to varying degrees.George H.W. Bush accepted money for speeches from companies like Amway, Choice Hotels International and Barrick Gold, among others. Bush also received a five-figure honorary role on an advisory board for Barrick Gold, a Canadian mining company. Although a millionaire when he entered the White House, Bush quipped an excuse to the New York Times, “everybody has to earn a living.” His successor, Bill Clinton, took that to new levels, earning around $100 million from paid speeches since leaving office in 2001. Clinton left office with between $2 million and $10 million in legal debts stemming from his impeachment and disbarment hearings, which put him in a slightly different position than most ex-presidents. He used his early earnings to help pay off these debts and those of some of his White House staff. But continued to amass a substantial fortune from speaking gigs ― and has, as everyone is well aware, received substantial criticism for it.George W. Bush was much less popular when his presidency ended, but still made $15 million from paid speeches in the just the first three years after leaving the White House.Now Obama is taking part in the new ex-president tradition of getting really, really rich.It wasn’t always this way.Harry Truman contemplated this issue upon leaving office in 1953 and decided it was indecorous. Though he received numerous offers to make money after moving back home to Independence, Missouri, he wrote in his memoirs that “I could never lend myself to any transaction, however respectable, that would commercialize on the prestige and dignity of the office of the presidency.”Truman was not a wealthy man in the 19 years he lived after leaving office. He spent much of his time responding to letters from admirers around the country, which he said personally cost him $30,000 a year in postage and related expenses. He did, however, think the government should help defray those costs in some way ― a position that he conveyed to his old friend Speaker Sam Rayburn.Truman’s request entered a long-running debate about what to do with ex-presidents. Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first treasury secretary, worried in the Federalist Papers prior to the ratification of the Constitution about the “half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the people like discontented ghosts.”“Of course the subject would be relieved of all uncertainty and embarrassment if every President would die at the end of his term,” Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th president and the only one in history to be elected to two non-consecutive terms, opined in a 1891 speech in Sandwich, Massachusetts.William Howard Taft agreed. In a speech to the Lotos Club in New York City following a failed reelection bid in November 1912, ex-presidents should be administered, “a dose of chloroform … and the reduction of the flesh of the thus quietly departed to ashes in a funeral pyre … to fix his place in history and enable the public to pass on to new men and new measures.” This was undoubtedly a jibe at former President Teddy Roosevelt’s decision to come out of retirement and run in the 1912 election.Luckily for Taft, this practice was never adopted, thus allowing him to become the only ex-president to also serve as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Millard Fillmore, who like Ford was never elected to the position but rather acceded to the position upon the death of President Zachary Taylor, had earlier appealed for some sort of government support for the former heads of state in the New York Herald in 1873: “It is a national disgrace that our Presidents, having occupied the highest position in the country should be cast adrift, and, perhaps, be compelled to keep a corner grocery for subsistence.”While no former president has ever had to open a corner grocery store to get by, many have found other ways of paying the bills. Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th president, was the first to pen a memoir about his life and time in office. Grant died of cancer days after finishing the final draft, but his widow, Julia Grant, received $400,000 in royalties for his memoir, which is still widely considered the finest presidential memoir written before or since. Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president, received a litany of job offers from the business community as his presidency wound down. His reason for rejecting them, “Some of the offers that have come to me would never have come if I had not been President. That means these people are trying to hire not Calvin Coolidge, but a former President of the United States. I can’t make that kind of use of the office.”He added, “I can’t do anything that might take away from the Presidency any of its dignity, or any of the faith the people have in it.” (Coolidge would later take an unpaid board seat at the New York Life Insurance Company.)Truman’s call for support for former presidents garnered sympathy from Democrats in Congress, prompting them to pass the Former Presidents Act in 1958. The bill provides pensions and other benefits to ex-presidents, which have been expanded and increased through legislation in the years since. But Jimmy Carter is the only former president since Ford to follow in Truman’s footsteps in declining to make money through consulting, paid speeches and other means. Carter insisted that it was “inappropriate” for an ex-president to make money in Ford’s “free enterprise system.” To make money, Carter, already the owner of a peanut farm and other real estate holdings, has written more than two dozen books since leaving office.The whole debate over the propriety of ex-presidential money-making now seems rather quaint now given President Donald Trump’s decision to maintain ownership of his real estate and branding business while in the White House, and his regular jaunts to his many eponymous properties. Trump hasn’t even waited until leaving office to monetize the presidency.Take that Gerald Ford."

Uber’s $68 billion valuation is propped up in part by investors’ belief it will be a dominant player in the emerging business of self-driving cars.At issue on Wednesday is Waymo’s demand that U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco issue an injunction barring Uber from using any of the technology that Waymo said was stolen. If Alsup issues a broadly worded order against Uber, it could all but shut down Uber’s self-driving car program while court proceedings continue.Alsup is not expected to rule immediately on Wednesday, but he may intimate which way he is leaning. At a hearing last month, Alsup warned Uber that it may face an injunction, saying of the evidence amassed by Waymo: “I’ve never seen a record this strong in 42 years.”Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has said that autonomous vehicles, though still in their infancy, are critical to the company’s long-term success and future growth.Indeed, autonomous cars promise to change the economics of the ride-hailing business. Among Uber’s biggest expenses is the cost of attracting drivers, who have a high turnover rate. And Uber’s ability to expand into suburban and rural markets, and areas with low vehicle ownership, and continue to offer a ride within three minutes, largely hinges on the availability of a network of self-driving vehicles.“This is central to Uber,” said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University and author of the book “The Sharing Economy,” noting that Uber has more at stake than some of its rivals.“If Google can’t launch their self-driving car for 10 years instead of five, this will be a little blip in Google’s multibillion-dollar revenue. Uber is the one that really depends on it.”Uber has faced a string of setbacks in recent months, including allegations of sexual harassment from a former employee and the public release of a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver. The company, though still growing strongly, is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter, according to information the company released last month.“Any big setback here would likely hit its valuation hard,” said Jan Dawson, an Uber analyst with Jackdaw Research. A blanket ban on Uber’s autonomous efforts “would certainly stall its efforts for a while and put it even further behind Waymo and others.”Uber has self-driving tests underway in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Arizona. It started work on the technology six years after Google began.Other industry watchers say that Uber, which has deep pockets and other value propositions such as huge swaths of traffic and rider data, could ride out a negative ruling in the Waymo case.The Waymo lawsuit, filed in February, revolves around a laser-based technology called Lidar that allows cars to “see” their surroundings and detect the location of other cars and pedestrians.Waymo said Levandowski, who until last week was head of Uber’s self-driving car program, stole more than 14,000 confidential documents before leaving his job at Waymo in January 2016. He formed a self-driving truck startup, Otto, which Uber bought in August for $680 million.Uber has said Waymo’s claims are false, and in a court filing called the preliminary injunction motion “a misfire.” Uber has not denied Levandowski took files from Waymo, but said it never possessed any of the confidential information that Waymo accused Levandowski of stealing.Levandowski himself has invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination because of the possibility of a future criminal probe.

64,POLITICS,Tammy Baldwin On Rumors of Anti-LGBTQ Executive Order: Where's Ivanka Now?,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tammy-baldwin-ivanka-trump-lgbt_us_590a5fd3e4b0bb2d08750b28,The president's daughter has already sunk one discriminatory religious liberty executive order. Another one may be on tap.,2017-05-03,"""Come baaaack, Ivanka!"" -- Sen. Tammy Baldwin, somewhere.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590a60501400008b031a66b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rumors are swirling that President Donald Trump plans to sign a religious liberty executive order on Thursday that would, in effect, license the federal government to discriminate against LGBTQ people.Details are murky, but media reports citing unnamed administration officials suggest Trump may sign off on allowing virtually any federally funded entity with a religious affiliation to refuse service to someone based on religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion or a transgender identity. A draft religious liberty executive order surfaced in February with similar provisions, but Trump later pulled it back, reportedly because of objections from daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who have tried to project support for the LGBTQ community.Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), one of few openly LGBTQ lawmakers on Capitol Hill, is hearing the “same distressing rumors” about Trump’s plan. And she’s wondering what happened to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have gotten lots of attention for being moderating forces in the White House.“The question I have today is, where are they now?” Baldwin said to HuffPost in a phone interview. “Ivanka wasn’t even a White House employee back then. She is now. In fact, I think I read in the past few days that she would be reviewing executive orders.”Ivanka Trump does, in fact, review executive orders as part of her job as an unpaid White House aide.Asked if she sees Ivanka Trump as an ally to the LGBTQ community, Baldwin said she’s just heard that the president’s daughter has argued against taking actions that would discriminate against the community.“But she’s apparently not on the prevailing end of those arguments, if what we expect to happen tomorrow actually happens,” said the Wisconsin senator.A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.For now, Baldwin and others are just waiting to see what Trump does. He’s definitely signing something related to religious freedom. Thursday is the National Day of Prayer, and the president wants to tie executive action to it. He and Vice President Mike Pence are hosting leaders of the White House evangelical advisory board for dinner.The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump may scale back his plans and sign an executive order that makes it easier for churches and religious groups to actively participate in politics without risking their tax-exempt status.Baldwin said even being a U.S. senator doesn’t mean she has a direct line to the president. She’s only talked to Trump once since he became president, at a White House reception for senators. She’s never gotten a call from him.Asked if that made her sad, HuffPost heard only laughter on the other end of the phone. It was unclear if it was the senator or a member of her staff."

Eighty-eight percent of Democrats and 75 percent of Republicans trust scientists at least “a little,” with 5 percent of Democrats and 15 percent of Republicans saying they don’t trust them at all.There’s an even sharper split between voters who supported President Donald Trump in last year’s election, and those who backed his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Nearly three-quarters of Clinton voters but just 10 percent of Trump voters ― and 26 percent of those who sat the election out ― say they have a lot of trust in scientists’ findings.Nearly 40 percent of Republicans, compared with 12 percent of Democrats, say they often worry that scientific studies influenced by political ideology. They’re more wary of the possibility for corporate influence as well ― 40 percent of Republicans, but just 19 percent of Democrats, say they often worry that studies are influenced by pressure from the companies or organizations funding them.Questions about the role of science in America’s political sphere took on new relevance during last month’s March for Science, which some scientists worried risked politicizing the discipline. One study, conducted in the days before and after the march, found that views of scientists’ altruism became more polarized in the aftermath of the march but that views about scientific research did not, according to The New York Times.The partisan divide over trust in science isn’t exactly new, although there are signs it may have grown in recent years. In a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken four years ago, Democrats were 28 percentage points likelier than Republicans to express a lot of trust in scientists’ findings; in 2015, the gap was a relatively similar 25 points. But by last spring, that divide was 31 points, and the most recent poll finds it widened to 41 points, due both to increasing levels of trust among Democrats and a corresponding decline among Republicans.Concerns about the politicization of science, by contrast, have remained relatively stable. Republicans are currently 25 points likelier than Democrats to say they often worry studies are influenced by political ideology, effectively unchanged from the 24-point difference on that question in 2015.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted April 28-29 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

66,ENTERTAINMENT,'From The Ashes' Is A Gripping New Documentary On How The Coal Industry Affects Us All,Stephanie Marcus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/from-the-ashes-documentary-coal-industry_us_5908e38ee4b02655f8418ba3,"""At this moment, people are drinking water somewhere in the United States that is being poisoned because the industry has not been responsible.""",2017-05-03,Coal-ash-contaminated water colorized from heavy metals. Coal ash is loaded with cancer causing chemicals and can lead to developmental disorders and reproductive problems.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590a22111400001f001a65e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A couple of months ago, I walked into the lobby of a New York City movie theater and was approached by a tall, lanky man in his late 20s wearing a backwards baseball hat. He asked if I cared about the environment, climate change and clean energy. He was trying to get Con Edison customers to switch to Green Mountain Energy by espousing the virtues of clean, renewable energy ― oh, and he’d give me a $10 AMC gift card.I ended up switching because I didn’t realize I had a choice of energy service company, nor that I had a say in how that energy was sourced. (As this site points out, it’s impossible to know where exactly energy comes from, but signing up for a greener company sets aside more money for renewable resources.)It’s something I kept thinking about while watching “From the Ashes,” which explores the issues surrounding the coal industry and how it affects Americans. Fittingly, the idea of where our power comes from is one of the first things the film’s director Michael Bonfiglio mentioned to me in an interview the day after the film’s premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. “I think most of us, myself included, until I began working on this film, when we flip our light switch on, we don’t know where it’s coming from. It’s just coming from an electricity factory somewhere. We don’t know what’s actually generating our power,” he said. “We are all making a decision when we turn on our lights. It certainly affects people who are not directly involved in the industry.”About 30 percent of electricity in the United states is generated by coal, but it’s “the most polluting form of energy on the planet. It’s the biggest contributor to climate change,” says Mary Anne Hitt of environmental group the Sierra Club in the film. In March, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back Obama-era energy policies designed to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Trump vowed to begin an “energy revolution” and said signing the order would “eliminate federal overreach” and “start a new era of production and job creation.”But coal company executives have already admitted that Trump’s executive order won’t single-handedly save the industry and bring back jobs. “From the Ashes” shows that many of these jobs have already been replaced by mechanization and aren’t coming back. What’s more, the film explains that coal companies are the reason that states like West Virginia remained reliant on the industry for jobs, halting development of any alternative economic base.“[Coal companies] can block legislation, they can block economic initiatives. Any kind of industry that can compete with them, they want to keep it out,” Appalachia historian Chuck Keeney explained in the film.The documentary, which is an excellent primer for those who don’t know anything about coal, looks at its affects on our climate, public health and the economy. And Bonfiglio even admitted that he “knew next to nothing” when the film was first pitched to him. “You want to make a film about coal? I thought, Is there any more boring topic? You know: It’s a rock. Who cares?” he said. “And then I very quickly started to get educated on the issue and realized that it’s something that has so many different issues and affects people’s lives in ways that we’re not even aware of.”One of the issues concerns coal ash ― the waste material produced from burning coal that contains arsenic, mercury, lead and other heavy metals. “I mean there are these coal ash pits all over the place, and I think as [the Sierra Club’s] Bruce Niles says in the film, ‘They are ticking time bombs all over the country that are unlined pits full of poison.’” Bonfiglio added that even if someone was fully aware that their power comes from coal, they probably aren’t thinking about the next step: What do you do with the leftover ash?“What’s been done for decades and decades is just dumping [the ash] into unlined pits that are usually right near waterways and near the aquifers,” he said. “So, at this moment, people are drinking water somewhere in the United States that is being poisoned because the industry has not been responsible in the way they clean up after themselves. It’s mind-boggling.” Viewers of “From the Ashes” will likely see it that way as well, if not outright infuriating. But Bonfiglio said he hopes people who watch the film will walk away with “some hope that it is possible to make a change and the understanding that the supporting the communities that have worked so hard and made so many sacrifices to keep the lights on in this country for generations.”He continued, “That there are ways to support those communities in making a just transition to [a] cleaner, safer, healthier, more economically sustainable way of life.”“From The Ashes” airs on National Geographic Channel on June 25 at 9 p.m. ET.

The special election will take place June 20.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5909051215000021008c759c.jpeg?cache=lunoLmOeOX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Archie Parnell, a former tax attorney for Goldman Sachs, easily won the Democratic nomination for South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District on Tuesday after receiving the majority vote needed to avoid a runoff.Parnell, 66, defeated Alexis Frank, 26, an Army veteran and homemaker, as well as Les Murphy, a disabled Marine Corps veteran and nonprofit founder. Parnell had 72 percent of the vote late Tuesday to 21 percent for Frank and 7 percent for Murphy, with 84 percent of precincts reporting.Parnell now has a head start on his eventual Republican opponent in the June 20 general election. None of the Republican contenders in the district emerged with an outright majority Tuesday, leading to a runoff on May 16 between top vote-getters Tommy Pope, the state’s House speaker pro tem, and Ralph Norman, a former state legislator.At the end of April, Parnell had raised $333,000 in campaign funds, $180,000 of which he donated himself, according to Open Secrets. Only state Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican, had raised more, reporting $614,000.The 5th District seat opened up when Trump tapped Mick Mulvaney as director of the Office of Management and Budget.The district is a largely rural swath of the state, including the towns of Sumter and Rock Hill, that has trended heavily Republican in recent years. President Donald Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the district by nearly 20 points; then-Rep. Mulvaney, a Republican, had edged out his Democratic challenger by a slightly larger margin.Democrats controlled the seat as recently as 2010, however, until former Rep. John Spratt was ousted after 28 years in office.Now Parnell, a mild-mannered policy wonk from Sumter, is hoping that an energized Democratic electorate will make the district competitive for the first time in years.An alumnus of Goldman Sachs ― and Exxon Mobil before that ― might not seem like the most obvious pick for Democrats at a time when anti-bank populism rages among rank-and-file voters in both major parties.Parnell tries to mitigate this problem by emphasizing his work in the investment giant’s “back office.”“My nickname was The Policeman ... because my focus was on compliance with a lot of complicated rules, both U.S. rules and foreign government tax rules,” Parnell told HuffPost.In fact, Parnell sees his experience in corporate tax divisions as an asset for corporate tax reform, since he knows all the tricks multinational corporations use to “stash their money” overseas. If elected, he would hope to be assigned to the Ways and Means Committee, where he once worked for Democratic leadership as a young attorney.“To be effective in these debates, you need to know how things really work rather than speaking in platitudes,” he said.Parnell holds mainstream Democratic views on issues like abortion rights (he supports them unreservedly) and Obamacare (fix it, don’t repeal it). He also supports preserving the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill and is for strong federal environmental regulations.But he believes focusing on bread-and-butter issues like infrastructure investment and lower prescription drug prices will be his ticket to victory.To that end, he backs the importation of prescription drugs from foreign countries provided that they meet strict safety requirements.“We can buy shirts made in Canada and China. Why isn’t medicine that way?” he asked.To win the district, Parnell would need both higher-than-normal Democratic turnout and significant support from Republicans, many of whom are likely happy with Trump’s performance. As a result, he leavens his criticism of Trump’s attempts to “build on people’s fear” with solemn paeans to bipartisan compromise.“I will fight Donald Trump tooth and nail, when he’s wrong, but if he does things that are agreeable or helpful to the people of SC-5, I will work with him,” Parnell said.“I am the only candidate in this race who is talking about the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together,” he added.The contest for South Carolina’s 5th District is one of several traditionally low-turnout special elections in which Democrats are hoping to flex their political muscles. Although local factors continue to play an important role in these races, newly energized liberal activists widely view them as crucial tests of the anti-Trump resistance.The national party sees 30-year-old filmmaker Jon Ossoff’s bid to put Georgia’s 6th District in the Democratic column as its most promising pickup opportunity. Ossoff, who is headed to a June 20 runoff, leads GOP opponent Karen Handel by a single percentage point, according to a new poll by a Democratic firm.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is responsible for electing House Democrats, has invested resources in Ossoff’s campaign but stayed away from other special elections. It made only a last-minute, symbolic contribution to an April special election for Kansas’ heavily Republican 4th District and has injected a relatively modest $200,000 into the May 25 election for Montana’s open House seat.The national party’s decision not to get involved more heavily in those races has elicited criticism from progressive activists, provoking a heated argument over the party’s electoral strategy. The DCCC maintains that investing heavily in conservative districts can sometimes backfire by nationalizing a race in a district where the Democratic Party is unpopular.“We’re watching the race closely,” DCCC spokesman Tyler Law said of South Carolina’s 5th District special election before the results were announced.The closer-than-expected loss in Kansas’ 4th, however, was a source of hope for many Democrats that the party can be competitive even in the most Republican districts in the country. Democrat James Thompson lost by just 7 points in a district where Trump beat Clinton by 27 points.“If we can replicate that swing here, Archie will win,” Parnell campaign manager Daniel Barash said. “And Archie is talking about taxes, prescription drugs, Social Security, which are important to Democrats, independents and Republicans in this community.” "

Project MIDAS tracks the effects of climate change on the Larsen C.That new rift, which is about 6 miles long, has forked toward the ice-front, or the region where the shelf meets the ocean.“As of May 1, 2017, we have observed a significant change in the rift on the Larsen C ice shelf,” researchers with Project MIDAS wrote. “While the previous rift tip has not advanced, a new branch of the rift has been initiated [approximately] 10km behind the previous tip, heading towards the ice-front. This is the first significant change to the rift since February of this year.”The main crack drew attention earlier this year, when scientists said it had grown more than 10 miles over a few weeks in December and an additional 6 miles in the first three weeks of January. Adrian Luckman, the lead researcher behind the project, declared at the time that a calving would be “inevitable.”“When it calves, the Larsen C Ice Shelf will lose more than 10 percent of its area to leave the ice front at its most retreated position ever recorded; this event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula,” he wrote in a blog post.Scientists aren’t exactly sure when the shelf will separate, Mashable notes. But Luckman said in January that he’d be “amazed” if it didn’t break away in mere months, and rhetoric usually has a not-if-but-when tone.Despite a lack in forward progress at the main rift, it has been steadily separating from the rest of the shelf by a few meters in width per day. The primary fork has currently reached an area of soft ice, called a suture zone, that has slowed its progress, according to the BBC.Luckman told the outlet it’s possible the new crack, which started branching about 6 miles behind the main fork, veered into a patch of more breakable ice as the shelf has slowly been wrenched apart.“Because the rift tip was in this area of basically softer ice that is very difficult to fracture, then the stresses have been transferred elsewhere and something has given, i.e. it has fractured in some of the ice that is more vulnerable to breaking which happens to be about 10km further back than the current rift tip,” Luckman said.MIDAS has said that when the section of the Larsen C breaks off, the rest of the ice shelf will be much more vulnerable to melting and could very well mirror what happened at its sister shelf, the Larsen B. That area “splintered and collapsed” over the course of a month in 2002, NASA said, causing almost the entire shelf to disappear. The agency noted it had never witnessed such a large area ― 1,250 square miles ― disintegrate so quickly."

Its website is hotelcaliforniabaja.com.“Hotel California” is the title track from the 1976 Eagles album of the same name, and won the 1977 Grammy award for record of the year.It is known for its long guitar outro featuring Don Felder and Joe Walsh, and complex lyrics sung by Don Henley.In an interview with CBS News last year, Henley said the song is about “a journey from innocence to experience.

Their wrists were reportedly wrapped in duct tape and an autopsy found that they had been strangled, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The couple was last seen leaving a bar in Corozal on April 25, Matus’ friend, Joe Milholen, told The Canadian Press.Matus was supposed to fly back to Canada the next morning, he said, but when Milholen went to drive her to the airport he found her house empty.“When I went inside, her bags were by her bed, packed and ready to go,” said Milholen, an American who lives in Belize. “She left her passport and her traveling money.”Her car was later found about 10 miles from the bar they were last seen, according to CBS News.A State Department official confirmed DeVoursney’s death to HuffPost on Wednesday but declined to provide additional information at this time.Matus’ friends, speaking to the Toronto Star, described her as a successful realtor and mother of two adult sons who began traveling to Belize four years ago to escape Canada’s winters.“She never flashed her (wealth), she wasn’t like that … She had everything planned and she was very organized,” her friend, Nikki-Monique Kurnath, told the paper. “There was no cause for alarm prior to this.”DeVoursney’s family, also speaking to the Toronto Star, said they were devastated by the news.“I’m not able to really do anything, kind of just sit and think and cry and that’s all I’m capable of at the moment,” said his mother, Cher DeVoursney.She said her other son, David, flew down to Belize with Drew’s best friend and fellow Marine, Brandon Barfield, to retrieve his belongings, as well as his body.Cher DeVoursney shared that her son enlisted in the Marines after the 9/11 attacks and served two tours in Iraq.

Trump, who became the first president since 1981 to skip the Dinner, held one of his signature campaign rallies before a rapturous gathering in Harrisburg, PA. His move forced the networks to air his rally against a literal split-screen of the Correspondent’s Dinner, highlighting the juxtaposition between Trump’s “real America” vs. the despised, self-congratulatory, in-a-bubble “media elite.”Whether you view the first 100-plus days of the Trump Administration as a historic triumph against the establishment or as a threat to the future existence of humankind, it has been a head-spinning, sometimes mind-boggling, hurricane of unpredictability emanating from the White House.Inauguration crowds. Women’s March. Mike Flynn. Steve Bannon. Alternative Facts. Putin. Andy Puzdner. Sean Spicer and Melissa McCarthy. Prime Minister of Australia. Wiretapping Ex-Presidents. Neil Gorsuch. TrumpCare. Awkward handshakes. Currency manipulation. Kellyanne Conway. Mar-a-Lago. JarVanka. Press as the Enemy of the People. Security briefings over dinner. Syria. North Korea. NAFTA. Fake News. Chocolate cake. “Harder than I thought.”Some observers believe this constant activity is a carefully conceived strategy to distract the public and the press from the administration’s aggressive dismantling of the administrative state. Others hold up the unforced errors, indecisiveness, and not-ready-for-prime-time conduct as evidence of a President and his team in over their heads, already destabilizing the world order.There is reason to believe both observations contain elements of truth. Steve Bannon, Steven Miller, their tribe of anti-globalists and Trump himself are all experts in the art of media Three Card Monte. Keep you looking over here while I authorize drilling on federal lands over there.Conversely, it cannot be denied that elements of the administration’s rollout have been marred by undisciplined messaging (if there has been a message at all), pronouncements followed by backtracking, a breathtaking inability to grasp policy fundamentals and conflicting power centers, installed by the President himself. This was apparent in the recent “harder than I thought” reflections coming out of the West Wing.But a third factor may be driving both points of view and with it, much of the presidential whiplash we have been experiencing. While Trump can and will change his thinking on any given topic or individual on an hourly basis, this may not be traced solely to a lack of core principles.One constant in his 40 years in the public eye has been his insatiable desire to be the focus of media attention. It is universally acknowledged that he is incredibly thin-skinned to negative media coverage, with recent reporting showing him to be obsessively fixated on it, to the point of influencing all of his deliberations.This is the man whose New York City office is not adorned with mementos from his Trump-branded empire, but floor-to-ceiling framed magazine covers featuring his likeness. Someone whose every decision drives the news, but then allows the news to drive his decision-making. A leader who appoints Cabinet Secretaries because they look the part then harangues his press secretary because he doesn’t.Every decline in polling is answered with a campaign-style rally somewhere in Trump Country, where Trump delivers the same speech he gave on the campaign trail, basks in the same ritual cheers and chants, and relives the glory days of just a few months earlier.When the moment requires further distraction or some red meat for the base, the Administration serves up another behind-the-Resolute Desk Executive Order. The hope is to distract us from a nonexistent policy or legislative agenda, save handing the “administrative state” over to a cadre of individuals united in their determination to undermine the very institutions they are responsible for leading.The constant need for the limelight, preferably with accolades, drives Trump to be Executive Producer-In-Chief. We continue to view his behavior through our “leader of the free world” lens and can’t seem to understand why he is unable to conform to the traditional expectations of presidential behavior. The people around him are only minimally effective, because Trump is, and always will be, about amplifying Trump.Like many performance artists, he lobs grenades for shock value, with the shock taking precedence over the value. Grabbing your attention by any means necessary can be enough in and of itself. If it happens to advance the agenda, great. If not, at least Trump is front and center. You many not remember the substance, but you always remember Trump.Trump has shown no inclination to master the finer points of policy - or ironically, the subtle art of negotiation - in either domestic or foreign affairs. And it is becoming increasingly clear he has little interest in either. His presidency is descending into a work of performance art, directed by whim, with the primary goal to keep its subject at the forefront of our consciousness, at all times, no matter what the cost – and preferably with a steady dose of applause."

74,POLITICS,"White House Leaning Toward Exiting Paris Agreement By Next Week, Sources Say",Alexander C. Kaufman and Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paris-agreement_us_5908f524e4b05c397683d404,"In the tug-of-war over the historic climate agreement, EPA chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon appear to be winning.",2017-05-02,"President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5908f65f15000020008c7562.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump may pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change as early as next week, sources with knowledge of the plans told HuffPost on Tuesday.The historic agreement between 195 countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, reached in December 2015, is the first global climate accord to include the U.S. and China, the world’s top polluters. While Trump promised to withdraw from the agreement right after assuming office, that hasn’t yet transpired. What to do about the Paris Agreement has reportedly divided the administration, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka wanting to renegotiate the U.S. terms, while Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon argue to pull out.White House lawyers drafted a memo following a meeting last Thursday that argued that the administration could face legal blowback in U.S. courts if it moves to weaken the country’s emissions goals under the agreement. White House advisers convened lawyers from the Department of Justice, EPA and State Department on Monday to discuss the legal arguments. The president said over the weekend that he would make a decision on the agreement in the next two weeks.The administration has yet to take a final decision, sources said. The White House declined to comment. Remaining in the Paris Agreement could strengthen environmental lawsuits against the White House over its climate agenda, such as the rollback of the Clean Power Plan, the sweeping Obama-era regulation to cut emissions from the utility sector, the lawyers argued, according to a source with direct knowledge of the meeting.A source in the State Department said a document circulating in the agency this week contained legal justifications for a U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement. The document, obtained by HuffPost, seemed to originate from State’s legal office, according to the source, and almost immediately caused anxiety among State staff who work on climate issues. “People were calling around, asking if it was real or fake,” said the source, who requested anonymity in order to discuss internal agency documents.The Paris Agreement allows for countries to pull out three years after the accord takes effect, meaning the Trump administration could officially withdraw on Nov. 9, 2019, the memo says. The withdrawal would be complete one year later. “While formal withdrawal could not be initiated until November 2019, in effect the United States could announce a plan to withdraw and reduce or cease participation in Paris Agreement activity earlier,” the memo reads. “We would not have any Paris Agreement reporting requirements to fulfill in the meantime, as the first reports under the Paris Agreement reporting system are not expected to need to be submitted until at least 2021 or 2022.”Any push to exit the agreement sooner “would be inconsistent with international law and would not be accepted internationally,” it said. The Trump administration’s justification for leaving the agreement hinges on its interpretation of one sentence of the Paris Agreement that reads: “A party may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution [NDC] with a view to enhancing its level of ambition.” Those who want to withdraw completely from the agreement appear to be arguing that this is meant only to give countries the freedom to make more aggressive cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, not to scale back the cuts; while those who want to keep the accord and some legal experts say the clause could allow the administration simply to dial back the U.S. commitment.“The bottom line is this: If the administration sets out to renegotiate Paris and either cannot do so or fails to achieve the objective they have in mind, they can always opt out at that point,” Scott Segal of Bracewell LLP, said in a report published Monday by E&E News, an environment and energy news service. “Nothing is risked by trying to get a better deal at the outset.”There has been a simmering tension in the Trump administration over the Paris Agreement. Trump campaigned on the pledge he would pull out ― or at least, renegotiate ― the deal. But then he selected as his secretary of state Tillerson, who supports staying in the deal, as does Ivanka Trump, reportedly. Trump’s virulently anti-climate-regulation EPA administrator, Pruitt, supports leaving the deal, as does Bannon ― who came to the White House from a website that has actively campaigned to kill the Paris accord. Under the Paris Agreement, the United States pledged to cut emissions by 26 to 28 percent of 2005 levels by 2025. The Obama administration rolled out a series of regulations known as the Climate Action Plan that would put the country on a path to meeting that goal. Trump recently directed Pruitt to begin unwinding the Obama administration’s power plant regulations, and the administration has also moved to roll back rules for automobile emissions ― which would almost assuredly prevent the U.S. from meeting its Paris commitment even if it doesn’t formally withdraw.“Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement would turn America from a global climate leader into a global climate deadbeat,” Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace U.S., said in a statement to HuffPost. “The world has already resolved to act on climate, the renewable energy industry is growing exponentially, and people all over the globe are becoming part of the clean energy future.” Read the full memo below: This article has been updated to include that the White House has declined to comment and with details from the memo and comment from Leonard.

Between options lurks an “or,” a subtle warning of our “this or that” restrictions.“Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” the exhibition opening this week at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, operates differently. The show, honoring iconic Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, is divided into several categorical pairings, such as “Then/Now,” “East/West,” “High/Low,” and even “Clothes/Not Clothes.” Yet the slash stuck between each pairing isn’t intended as an “or.” Instead, it’s meant to demarcate an in-between, a space that turns dichotomies into cacophonous harmonies. The exhibition, decisively described as not a retrospective, features 150 garments from Kawakubo’s collections, divided into binary categories she then proceeds to break down. All of the pieces are presented at eye-level, so the viewer can properly observe the magic of their construction. There is no wall text whatsoever, a nod to Kawakubo’s consistent refusal to define her work in rigid terms. “The meaning is that there is no meaning,” she said in 1995.The designer was born in Tokyo in 1942, the oldest of three children and the only girl. At university, Kawakubo studied the history of aesthetics, which incorporated elements of Asian and Western Art. It was in 1973 when she established her now-famous label Comme des Garçons (which means “like some boys”), opening her first store just two years later. Kawakubo made her Western debut in Paris in 1982, disrupting the era’s wave of glamorous power suits with saggy, lopsided black frocks accentuated with holes, shredded fabric and excess layers of more black. Like many great avant-garde works of art, Kawakubo’s collection was initially met with shock and disdain; critics described it as “ragged chic,” “Hiroshima’s revenge” and “post atomic.”One of her most iconic collections came over 10 years later with the spring/summer 1997 collection “Body Meets Dress, Dress Meets Body,” featuring skintight stretch dresses pulled over ballooning pads. The form-hugging attire accentuated the pads’ bizarre humps and swelling, radically transfiguring the wearer’s silhouette. The dresses, which were later adapted into costumes for a Merce Cunningham dance, epitomize Kawakubo’s radical ability to defy the assumptions about clothes you never knew you had. Even if you’re not into identifying fashion designers, recognizing Kawakubo’s work is a cinch. Mostly because her designs barely resemble clothing at all, boldly defying the laws clothes are intended to serve. Most garments cater to the body of their wearer ― flattering the figure by enhancing certain body parts and downplaying others, all in accordance with ideal beauty standards. Even more fundamentally, they follow certain elementary guidelines ― for example, shirts and pants have a set amount of holes.For Kawakubo, these items of clothing are hardly that simple. As she told The Guardian: “I built my work from within instead of satisfying a demand for sexualised and ostentatious clothing.”At times, a Commes des Garçons piece can resemble a cocoon or a gift in haphazard wrapping paper. Some tops contain far too may holes for human arms to occupy, as if designed with another species in mind; others have none at all. Many feature bulging protuberances, while other extreme finishing touches like ruffles or collars seem to be exacting revenge on the wearer.Kawakubo’s designs tend to transform those who don them into mythical personae, otherworldly creatures or conceptual artworks. Instead of aspiring to make a woman look long and lean, Kawakubo endows her models with pillowy hunchbacks and architectural nests for hair, destabilizing the gaze that often governs fashion.For centuries, the act of dressing up has proven capable of turning women into characters ― the bride, the professional, the vixen, the princess, the tomboy. The ability to embody an alter ego just by slipping on a dress can be liberating, though of course, the range of available characters can also be limiting. They can seem like choices that, in reality, are anything but.Kawakubo, however, explodes the vault, queering established feminine tropes and ushering in the masculine, the inanimate, the surreal. Instead of being an “old Hollywood starlet” for a night, how about a pillowcase? A cluster of barnacles? A cobweb? Kawakubo’s clothing invites women to transcend and transmute their bodies, weaving fairytales from their own flesh. In Commes des Garçons’ world, there are no stereotypes, no laws, no masters and no categories: the freedom is absolute and often breathtaking.You might not realize how similarly individuals dress until you set eyes on a woman wearing what looks like a blowfish carcass, something so unmistakably distinct. Even at The Met Gala, where Kawakubo was the theme, Rihanna’s army of petals ― one of the few actual Comme des Garçons dresses worn ― made jaws drop.Today, Kawakubo is known as one of the most respected designers of all time ― only the second living designer to be honored with a Met exhibition, after Yves Saint Laurent’s in 1983. Some repeated themes in Kawakubo’s work include the colors black and red, bulging shapes, punk plaid, allusions to bridal and princess gowns ― somehow mangled and resuscitated ― tattered holes, shredded layers, asymmetrical hems and a sculptural intensity that’s rarely seen on the human body.Most of all though, she’s defined by her inability to be defined. Her work’s most identifiable quality is its sense of boundlessness, which brings into being visions so viscerally peculiar most of us couldn’t conjure them in a dream state. In an interview with The New Yorker, the famously silent Kawakubo revealed that she had “never belonged to a movement, followed a religion, subscribed to an ideology, or worshipped a hero.”She has even denounced those who have hailed her a feminist icon, refusing to belong to any such category. “I am not a feminist,” she said in 2009. “I was never interested in any movement as such. I just decided to make a company built around creation, and with creation as my sword, I could fight the battles I wanted to fight.”Comme des Garçons does, however, liberate women from the monolithic male gaze, from the fashionable tradition of dressing up as a mode of self-improvement. But the label does more. It frees art from existing, cold and untouched, in glass cases and frames. It releases pants from the expectation of being two-legged. And it emancipates human beings from their flesh, inviting people to embody intangible ideas that defy categorization.“Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” runs until September 4 at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The position would not require Senate confirmation.Officials in Clarke’s jail allegedly took away Thomas’ access to water after the 38-year-old mentally ill man apparently tried to flood his cell. Other inmates reportedly were ignored when they warned the guards that Thomas needed help. In addition to the seven officials the jury recommended face charges, another official at the jail abruptly resigned over the weekend.Erik Heipt, an attorney representing Thomas’ family, said such an incident should never happen in an American jail.“All too often these cases get swept under the rug,” he said. “Jail officials and corrections officers are rarely held accountable for citizen deaths, even in horrific circumstances. But this case has been different. The jury’s verdict is the first step toward justice.”Heipt said the jury found probable cause to charge seven members of the staff, including the jail’s commander, the lieutenant who ordered the water to be shut off and the officer who shut it off.“The Milwaukee County District Attorney’s office will now decide whether to bring felony abuse charges against these seven people and may consider additional charges as well, including obstruction of justice,” Heipt said. “Thus far, the DA has done an outstanding job in presenting and pursuing this case. We are confident that they will continue to do so.”Thomas’ death was one of hundreds recorded as part of a HuffPost investigation that examined jail deaths across the United States in the year after Sandra Bland died. Heipt, whose represents the families of many individuals who have died in jail, said this is the first case he’s handled in which criminal charges will be brought forward.“In 20 years of handling civil rights jail and police death cases, many of which entailed unspeakable atrocities, this is the first in which criminal charges will be brought,” Heipt said. “I hope that this is the first step toward justice, not just in the case of Terrill Thomas, but in other senseless jail death cases as well.”"

By a vote of 60 to 36, the Senate voted to proceed to a final vote for Clayton, which he is all but certain to clear. Clayton, a partner at the elite corporate law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, is also one of several top Trump appointees with a Goldman Sachs background, having served as the megabank’s bailout attorney in 2008. Trump’s top economic advisor, Gary Cohn, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin all enjoyed lucrative careers at Goldman.Clayton appeared skeptical of government regulations during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, repeatedly suggesting that an overly aggressive SEC was hurting “capital formation” and preventing small businesses from selling stock to the general public. The SEC has authority over important bank regulations, insider trading cases and the enforcement of foreign bribery prohibitions, among many other responsibilities.Clayton’s legal career included work on behalf of British megabank Barclays and the bailed-out auto finance giant Ally Bank. He helped at least two other large financial institutions reach fraud settlements with the federal government over mortgage-related claims, according to his Sullivan & Cromwell biography. Clayton also made a name for himself as a critic of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a law that bars U.S. companies from bribing foreign political officials to win business abroad. Nearly all of Clayton’s Wall Street biography was deleted from the Sullivan & Cromwell website after Trump nominated him to chair the SEC, but the text can be read here.Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to behind Clayton, and were joined by 10 Democrats, including Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Mark Warner (D-Va). The Democratic support marked a departure from Mnuchin’s confirmation, which was opposed by every Democrat except Manchin.Trump made a slate of promises about Wall Street during the 2016 campaign, including vows to both break up big banks and to repeal the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. As president, however, Trump has pursued a big bank-friendly deregulation agenda and proposed steep tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Clayton had been confirmed. He has cleared the final procedural hurdle prior to confirmation. The article also misidentified Sen. Michael Bennet as representing Utah. He is a senator from Colorado."
80,POLITICS,Arts Funding Gets A Boost From Congress After Trump Suggested Slashing It,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arts-funding-trump-budget_us_59078df1e4b0bb2d08704af4,The budget deal is a rebuke to the White House proposal for draconian cuts.,2017-05-02,"Arts groups at a rally in New York City in April, denouncing the Trump administration's proposed cuts.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5908bc2c2600003596c48ed5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Arts organizations won a major victory this week with increases for arts funding in the congressional budget agreement ― a rebuke of President Donald Trump’s proposal to gut federal support.The bill to keep the government operating until September, expected to pass both chambers of Congress later this week, allocates $150 million each to the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities ― $2 million more than the previous year. It preserves the current level of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.The Trump administration in March proposed gutting funding for the three entities, prompting arts groups around the country to lobby lawmakers and hold rallies. Congress’ budget agreement also increased funding for science research, another area where Trump proposed deep cuts.Many of Trump’s proposals, including funding for a border wall, his signature campaign issue, were not included in the bill, reflecting limited bargaining power on Capitol Hill that contradicts his assertion that he “makes the best deals.”Republican lawmakers likely would have faced consequences going along with Trump’s arts cuts because federal funds provide significant financial support in small towns and rural areas — places that tend to vote for the GOP.The NEA budget, for example, funds grants that pay for arts organizations, cultural groups and projects in every single congressional district. As arts groups told HuffPost in March, those grants are often among the only sources of financing for the arts in rural parts of the country because there are fewer private sources of arts funding than in large, metropolitan communities.Similarly, television and radio stations in rural areas would be hit hardest by cuts to public broadcasting funding.Patrick Butler, president and CEO of America’s Public Television Stations, said in a statement Monday that the budget deal shows “powerful evidence of the growing bipartisan support for our work in education, public safety and civic leadership.” He added: “We are particularly appreciative of the leadership of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for being such stalwart champions of public broadcasting.”But arts organizations warned on Monday that their victory could be short lived. Republicans frequently target arts funding in budget negotiations, arguing that initiatives like the NEA are wasteful. The NEA, NEH and CPB made up a combined 0.02 percent of the federal budget last year.“When you start looking at places that we reduce spending, one of the questions we asked was can we really continue to ask a coal miner in West Virginia or a single mom in Detroit to pay for these programs? The answer was no,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said in March. “We can ask them to pay for defense, and we will, but we can’t ask them to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.”Actors’ Equity, the union that represents stage actors and managers around the country, advocated against Trump’s cuts by focusing on the role that community and regional theater plays in providing jobs and economic development in smaller cities and towns.“We won an important battle this week, but the war is far from over,” the union’s executive director, Mary McColl, said in a statement. “Next year could look very different. When Congress starts work on the next budget, Equity’s talented members and elected leaders will be there to remind Congress that any cuts to the NEA would undermine middle class arts jobs in every congressional district in the country.” "

The public has mixed expectations for whether Trump will Make America Great Again. And there’s a shakeup in the world of exit polling. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, May 2, 2017.FEW TRUMP VOTERS FEEL BETRAYED BY TRUMP’S POLICY SHIFTS - HuffPollster: “[D]espite Trump’s flip-flops on economic and foreign policy issues, most of his supporters still feel they’re getting exactly the man they voted for, new HuffPost/YouGov polling shows. The majority, 63 percent of voters who supported Trump in last year’s election say his current policies are not very or not at all different from the ideas he espoused as a candidate. Only 30 percent of voters who supported Trump in last year’s election say his policy views are ‘somewhat different’ since he took office — and just 4 percent say they are ‘very different.’ And although the sample size of Trump voters who say he’s changed is very small, the results suggest that those voters are more likely to prefer his new positions. At a rough estimate, just over a tenth of the voters who supported Trump believe he’s changed for the worse since taking office, with about 14 percent saying they prefer the policies he now holds.” [HuffPost]Trump’s base remains solid, but the intensity of their support has ticked down - More: “In the first weeks of Trump’s presidency, according to the Economist/YouGov tracking poll, around 90 percent of his voters said they approved of his job performance, with two-thirds approving strongly. While his overall approval with that group has remained relatively stable, the percentage who strongly approve has drifted downward, reaching its lowest ebb ― 51 percent ― in late March, following the failed attempt to pass an Obamacare repeal bill. In the last three weeks, between 56 and 61 percent of Trump’s supporters have said they strongly approve of his handling of the presidency.”PUBLIC IS SPLIT ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL LIVE UP TO CAMPAIGN PROMISES - HuffPollster: “Nine percent of Americans say Trump has already lived up to most of his campaign promises, while another 31 percent expect him to do so in the future. Forty-four percent say he’s unlikely to ever do so….The public has more faith in some of Trump’s promises than others. Most recognize his accomplishment in naming Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and nearly two-thirds think the Keystone XL pipeline, which Trump pushed forward with an executive order, is likely to be built. A majority also believe Trump will succeed in renegotiating international trade deals, temporarily banning refugees from some Muslim countries and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, although few yet credit him with reaching any of these goals. Just shy of half think he has or will eventually bring manufacturing jobs back to the country. But fewer than half of the public now expects Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a feat he promised to accomplish on the first day of his presidency, or to fulfill his perennial pledge to ‘make America great again.’ Fewer than a third thinks the president has or will eventually “drain the swamp” in Washington. And the majority recognize that Trump’s promised border wall, a centerpiece of his campaign, is unlikely to materialize ― and even unlikelier to be funded by Mexico.” [HuffPost] HOW TRUMP’S RATINGS MAY BE AFFECTING HIS PRESIDENCY - Steven Shepard: “While Trump’s average approval rating among Republicans is 86 percent, according to HuffPost Pollster, George W. Bush was at 93 percent among Republicans at the eve of his inaugural 100-day anniversary. Barack Obama was at 92 percent among Democrats. Polarization of views about Trump’s first months in the White House is nearly off the charts...Trump’s average approval among Democrats, according to HuffPost Pollster? Only 10 percent….There are already signs that Trump’s standing after 100 days — Republicans like him, but few others do — is driving the way he is governing: robust executive action, while chafing against the other two branches of government….[P]ublic opinion of him and his job performance could remain stable for the time being, shaping a static, polarized and divided political environment prior to next year’s midterms.” [Politico] OPINIONS OF THE PRESIDENT ARE DIVIDED ALONG GEOGRAPHIC LINES - Dante Chinni: “[T]he socio-economic fault lines on display in the presidential election still very much divide the political landscape in early 2017. Adults living in rural evangelical and working-class communities give the president high marks, with more than six in 10 approving of his performance. However, in large cities and dense suburban areas, his approval rating is lower than 35%. Meanwhile, people living in less diverse, blue-collar Middle Suburbs are divided in their evaluations of Trump….The different opinions about Trump are not a surprise; the U.S. has a diverse community landscape. But the sharpness of these differences is notable at such an early point in a presidency. The divisions in Trump’s job approval are stark when compared with the beginning of Barack Obama’s time in the White House. In the first quarter of Obama’s presidency, his approval rating averaged 45% or higher in every community type in the ACP, and those numbers held through the second quarter. The numbers for Obama later split to show sharper divides at the community level, but not to the degree currently seen for Trump until 2012.” [Gallup]FOX NEWS BREAKS WITH EXIT POLLING CONSORTIUM - Michael Calderone: “Fox News has broken with the National Election Pool, a consortium of five major television networks and The Associated Press that share the costs and results of exit polls for national elections. ‘We’ve had concerns with Election Day exit polling for many years, and this year once again proved that they are problematic,’ Jay Wallace, Fox’s executive vice president of news, said in a statement after HuffPost learned the network was dropping out.’Our plan is to explore and find a more modern measurement of voter sentiment on Election Day.’...With Fox out, The AP and four TV networks — CBS, ABC, NBC, and CNN — will presumably each have to pay more for the exit polling, which is conducted by Edison Research and costs millions of dollars.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this update every Tuesday and Friday morning via email!

The center cannot hold.,2017-05-02,"President Donald Trump said on Monday that he wants the GOP health care bill to be ""good for sick people.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5907e6692600003596c48cbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The White House and congressional GOP leaders swear they’re closer to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, but a vote on the Republican health care plan may be further off than President Donald Trump hopes or thinks, as support among the rank-and-file is squishy and opposition among moderates doesn’t look any less fierce than days before.Republicans were saying the House could vote as early as Wednesday on the health care bill, but that may just be another false start. Instead of members who were “no” coming out in support Monday, the weekend seemed to calcify the most ardent moderate opposition and leave a number of members who are usually reliable cheerleaders of leadership’s agenda with lingering questions. Former Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) told HuffPost that he wasn’t quite ready to announce his support for the bill, and Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) remains undecided.Even some GOP deputy whips, members who are normally dispatched to do leadership’s bidding and build support for proposals, reported on Monday that they were undecided. David Valadao (R-Calif.), Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), and Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), who actually lives with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) when they’re in D.C., all reported Monday that they hadn’t made up their minds.But the most significant news Monday came from another usually solid GOP leadership ally: Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.). Long declared in a statement that he was a no on the health care bill because an amendment worked out between moderate leader Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) and Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) “strips away any guarantee that pre-existing conditions would be covered and affordable.”Long thinks the latest changes undermine coverage for sick people, a key protection of Obamacare that Trump specifically said on Monday that he wanted to protect.“I want it to be good for sick people,” Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News, continuing that the bill is not in its “final form” right now.“It will be every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare,” Trump said.If that’s the standard, centrist Republicans who know that this bill is not nearly as good as Obamacare on protecting people with pre-existing conditions may soon ask why they should be forced to break campaign promises to support the bill.Trump actually called Long on Monday to convince him to support the bill, but his pleas didn’t work. Neither did a long conversation on the floor Monday night with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).Long told HuffPost on Monday night that leadership didn’t need his vote. “They got 40 Freedom Caucus votes,” Long said. “Why do they need me?”(There are about three dozen Freedom Caucus members, and a few members of the conservative group may still vote against the bill even after the caucus was able to drag the legislation further to the right.)There is some resentment among rank-and-file Republicans that the Freedom Caucus was able to significantly change the legislation and undermine the pre-existing condition provision of the GOP health care plan, and there may be a growing feeling among moderates that they shouldn’t allow conservatives to control policy for everyone.But, a senior GOP aide told HuffPost, leadership feels like they’re in a better position trying to flip moderate votes in the coming days than they would if they were trying to flip recalcitrant conservatives.Still, leadership acknowledges they’re short on the votes right now. The optimism coming from the White House is just over how close they think they are. As another senior GOP aide pointed out, however, the White House’s rosy assessment of where the votes stand perhaps shouldn’t be the standard to gauge the whip count. Administration officials were insisting a day before the House was supposed to vote that they had the votes, even though it was clear at that time ― as well as in the aftermath of leadership pulling the bill ― that Republicans weren’t even close.A similar naivete may be at hand now. The White House sees only around 20 Republicans publicly opposing the bill, suggesting that the House is right around a passing threshold. But the reality is that there are potentially dozens of other Republicans who are still uncomfortable with the bill and remain noncommittal. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) told HuffPost on Monday night that he’s “all over the place” on whether he supports the legislation. Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio), who desperately wants to become the next Armed Services Committee chairman, repeatedly told HuffPost he was busy when we asked where he stood.With around 20 hard no votes, Republicans would need almost every undecided and leaning no Republican to side with them. And with Trump seeming to trash the legislation as it currently stands, there aren’t many compelling reasons for wavering Republicans to get on board.Here is the current HuffPost whip count on the latest version of the GOP health care proposal. This whip count is based on conversations with lawmakers and staffers with knowledge of how members are voting. Not every lawmaker on this list has confirmed how he or she will vote ― this is our best guess:This story has been updated to reflect the latest whip count as of Tuesday morning."
85,POLITICS,House Republicans Weigh Another Health Care Amendment,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-republicans-health-care-amendment_us_5908e99de4b02655f84197af,But will it be enough to get them over the finish line?,2017-05-02,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) attends a press conference on May 2, 2017, in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5908eda815000021008c752d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House GOP leaders, unable to find the votes for their health care bill simply by pressuring reluctant Republicans, are now considering changes that will win over moderates.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) began a closed-door meeting on Tuesday by telling members, “Now is not the time to decide what to do or how to do it; now is the time to do it,” according to a Republican present.But just hours later, after it was clear that strategy wasn’t working, leaders were toying with an amendment that would add more funding for the high-risk coverage pools that states would set up to insure people with costly pre-existing conditions. “Obviously some members are looking for changes, but we’ve not made any at this point, and don’t know that we will,” AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told HuffPost. If the current legislation isn’t doing the trick, however, the need for an amendment may become obvious.According to the last Congressional Budget Office estimate, Republicans have roughly $150 billion in savings over the next 10 years that they could dole out to bolster the high-risk pools and mollify centrists. But that assumes other changes in the bill won’t reduce those savings.It’s unclear how the Congressional Budget Office will score other GOP modifications, partly because the office would have to predict whether states will opt out of the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Some members believe that lowering premiums for healthy young people could increase the number of people taking advantage of the government’s tax credits, thereby increasing the overall cost of the bill and eating into the savings. And while Republicans argue that high-risk pools would work for sick people, that historically hasn’t been the case. The Center for American Progress estimated on Tuesday that the Republican health care plan falls $200 billion short of sufficiently funding high-risk pools.Either way, leaders are considering how to shore up support from moderates. And while there isn’t any firm proposal at this point, some moderates on the fence could probably be won over with additional funding for the high-risk pools.“That sounds good,” Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), who is undecided on the bill, said when HuffPost asked him about adding money to the high-risk pools. “That sounds positive.”Another undecided Republican, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), said he’d be willing to look at that change, and Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), also undecided, said that sort of amendment “might help.”(Young also told HuffPost on Tuesday that he thought the GOP health care bill, which would change how rural states are reimbursed for costs, “hurts Alaska,” so his vote might be more difficult to get than leaders think.)Those members are just undecided, however. When HuffPost described the potential amendment to Republicans who have taken firmer stances against the GOP health care bill, it didn’t seem to entice them much.Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.) said that sort of amendment probably wouldn’t change his vote and that he was “not really in play” at this point. Former Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who came out in opposition to the bill on Tuesday, also said the proposal wouldn’t change his mind if Republicans didn’t fix the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. “More money does not do the trick,” Upton said.Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said that even with that sort of amendment, he still would have a number of concerns. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) said she was concerned that Republicans were making coverage for people with pre-existing conditions “in name only,” and that even $50 billion in new funding for high-risk pools would be “a little baby down payment.”When HuffPost asked Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) about how an amendment adding money to high-risk pools would affect his vote, he interrupted, raised his hand and said, “I’m just ‘No.’”Still, the margins on this bill are so tight that any proposal that flips even a few members may make a difference. Various whip counts show a very tight situation.One constant, however, has been a number of hard “No” votes that do not seem to be moving. If Republican leaders can’t start flipping those members, they may never be able to pass the bill. They can only lose about 22 Republicans ― depending on absences ― and they’ve already lost about 20.“Seems to me that adding money to the high-risk pools is probably the easiest way for leadership to attempt to coax some moderates without losing the Freedom Caucus,” one senior GOP aide with a sense of the vote told HuffPost. “The question is, does it flip your hard ‘No’ members, or continue to just help with the undecideds? Seems like at some point, they need to pick off a few of the ‘No’ and ‘lean-No’ members.”Many moderates are having a hard time with a number of the bill’s provisions. The legislation would allow insurers to charge seniors five times as much as young people (currently they can only charge three times as much) and would cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years.The Congressional Budget Office projects that 24 million more people would not have health insurance in 10 years if the legislation is enacted ― to say nothing of these latest changes, which could dramatically increase prices for sick people and undermine what’s covered by health insurance.Moderates also worry that handing the conservative Freedom Caucus a win, particularly when this legislation doesn’t look like it’d go anywhere in the Senate, is a dangerous precedent to set in lawmaking.“There is a concern that this is going to be the model: Try to placate the hard right and get these bills out of the House knowing they have an uncertain fate in the Senate,” Dent said. “Because we know darn well that the bill on the rebound from the Senate won’t satisfy those on the hard right.”“All this political capital is being expended on the first launch, knowing damn well that on the battle that matters ― the last one ― you won’t get the support of those very same people,” he added.The other complication with an amendment that adds money to the high-risk pools is that GOP leadership could lose some conservative support, though conservatives seem relatively happy with the bill after the latest changes. While Freedom Caucus members have always said this bill should cost less than Obamacare, that’s never been the primary reason they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act.“That’s important,” former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said of saving money. “But what’s most important is we keep our word ― which this bill doesn’t quite get there, but it’s a good start ― and that we lower premiums. That’s been our position from the beginning. That’s most important.”Jordan reiterated that the Freedom Caucus would have to review any new changes, but he seemed to support tweaks if they’ll get the legislation over the finish line.It’s just a matter of whether more changes actually will get Republicans there. As it stands now, the current bill appears to fall short.As Dent said on Tuesday, “If they had the votes, we would have voted.”Here is the current HuffPost whip count on the latest version of the GOP health care proposal. This whip count is based on conversations with lawmakers and staffers with knowledge of how members are voting. Not every lawmaker on this list has confirmed how he or she will vote ― this is our best guess:"

The historically black college compared DeVos to the school’s founder, civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune, and stated that the secretary’s mission aligns with Bethune’s legacy. “The legacy of Dr. Bethune is that she was not constrained by political ideology, but worked across all parties to support B-CU,” President Edison O. Jackson said in a press release. Many graduates of Bethune-Cookman and other HBCUs expressed their outrage about DeVos’ whitewashing of the schools’ history. In February, DeVos claimed that the colleges were formed because of “school choice” and not as a response to segregation and racism. Also in February, President Donald Trump met with more than 60 presidents of historically black colleges and universities. During the meeting, Trump signed an executive order to create a direct line for HBCUs to the president, but some in attendance believed it served as a photo-op and not a forum for HBCUs to discuss their grievances. Twitter users criticized Bethune-Cookman for inviting DeVos to speak.BCU graduate Dominik Whitehead started a Change.org petition on Monday to prevent DeVos from speaking at the May 10 ceremony:“Having DeVos speak at the commencement ceremony is an insult to the BCU graduating class, students, alumni, family, friends, and Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune’s legacy. We, the proud alumni of Bethune-Cookman University, do not want Betsy DeVos to have a seat at our table. Please rescind her invitation to speak at the graduation ceremony. The petition has nearly 4,500 signatures as of Tuesday morning, more than 500 short of its goal.The school’s administration sent a tweet clarifying the statement in their press release linking DeVos and Bethune.Jackson also sent a video message to the BCU community later on Monday to address the concerns about DeVos.“She, too, represents someone in a position to have a positive impact on BCU students and thousands like them around the country,” he said. “I would like to reassure all of our supporters that we’re looking to build a bridge for a mutually beneficial relationship with Secretary DeVos.”"

She also opened up about her loss to Trump.“I take absolute responsibility. I was the candidate,” Clinton said. “I was the person that was on the ballot.”But Clinton argued Russian interference, misogyny and FBI Director James Comey also played into her defeat.“I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey’s letter on October 28th and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off,” Clinton said. “And the evidence for that intervening event is, I think, compelling, persuasive.”The Clinton campaign first placed blame on Comey in the days after the election, citing his announcement in late October 2016 that the FBI was investigating emails possibly related to Clinton’s use of a private server during her time as secretary of state. (Comey later said she would not face any charges regarding those emails, many of which had already been reviewed by the FBI.)"
