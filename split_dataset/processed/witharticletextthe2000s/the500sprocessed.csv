9,9,POLITICS,Watch A Trump Surrogate Totally Flip-Flop On Clinton Sex Scandals,Zach Carter and Amber Ferguson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marsha-blackburn-clinton-sex-scandals_us_57f29324e4b082aad9bc6fce,C'mon.,2016-10-03,Rep. Marsha Blackburn thinks it's a bad idea to do what she did.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f2955f170000f70aac915c.jpeg?cache=pnVLbNEBIS&ops=crop_0_117_2916_1666%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) is sick of Donald Trump’s campaign attacking Hillary Clinton over her husband’s infidelity. “I think this is one of those things where he would be well-served not to talk about Mrs. Clinton, her relationship with her husband,” Blackburn, a top Trump surrogate, told MSNBC on Monday. “When I’m talking to constituents, what they wanna hear about is national security, jobs and economic security.”And she’s right. Why would anyone bring up Clinton’s marital troubles? It’s cheap and low and a pretty blatantly sexist tactic. But something seems odd about Blackburn dismissing those old sex scandals. Ah, that’s right. Blackburn herself brought them up unprompted in an MSNBC interview just last week.“I find it so interesting that there continues to be this conversation about what he has said, when you look at what she has done ― Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, my goodness,” Blackburn said last Wednesday. “Lewinsky started an anti-bullying foundation because of what the Clintons did to her.”Watch Blackburn’s flip-flop in the video below:2016. It will destroy your brain. "

We’re here to answer your most pressing, puzzling, even politically incorrect questions, about all things related to the Chinese in Africa and Africans in China.The Chinese say they have a strict “non-interference policy” in the internal affairs of other countries. China “not interfering”? What did everyone call China sending the money (financial aid) to the Sudanese who were sponsoring the paramilitary soldiers who were attacking the civilians in Darfur?— Michael via FacebookDear Michael, I’m going to sound a bit technical here, and I don’t want you to think that I am trying to avoid a straight answer because I’m not… but… the central issue comes down to how you define the word “interfere” as that is a really flexible word depending on what side of the story you’re on.You are absolutely right to point out how the Sudans, both Sudan and South Sudan, are pushing one of China’s foundational foreign policy principles to its limits. The non-interference doctrine was first introduced back in the 1950s by [China’s] former Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. For more than 60 years that policy has served Beijing well. For the most part, the Chinese studiously avoided getting caught up in other countries’ internal rivalries, wars and politics.But that was then. Today, China is the world’s second-largest economy, and has enormous trading interests, huge investments and millions of its people scattered across the globe, particularly throughout Africa. Compared to China under the rule of Zhou Enlai, the country has a vastly more complicated international agenda. Sudan, in particular, is a microcosm of these overlapping interests and highlights the real pressures that China is confronting as it struggles to remain faithful to this once unshakable policy.Before the two Sudans split, it was the Chinese who invested 20 billion dollars to revive its moribund oil production sector, so it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that Chinese officials feel they have a lot at stake in this region.When the second Sudanese civil war (1983-2005) intensified and the war in Darfur kicked off in 2003, the Chinese instinctively aligned themselves with their allies in Khartoum, providing diplomatic cover, financial support, and, yes, lots of weapons. So this is where the point you are trying to make gets really messy. The Chinese government will argue that the selling of arms between two sovereign governments is perfectly fine. There is nothing wrong when the U.S. sells weapons to the Spanish or when Germany sells its military hardware to the U.K., so what is the difference when China sells sophisticated weapons to the Sudanese?In principle, I think they are totally right. We (Westerners) may not like the Sudanese or the Chinese for that matter, but they are two sovereign governments and they should be allowed to trade money or oil for guns just as almost every other country around the world does. While their above board trade is legitimate in my opinion, there is shady stuff that’s offensive and raises the questions of whether China is actually doing more than trading with an ally, and instead is supporting a faction within a civil war (and thus intervening in the internal affairs of another country).For example, in the case of Darfur, there were widespread reports of Chinese arms vendors defying a U.N. arms embargo and then later, in South Sudan, Chinese weapons companies were allegedly selling small arms to even the government, as Chinese diplomats were working as mediators to resolve the ongoing civil war.While I share your outrage over some of what has happened, I think it’s also important to recognize that the situation may not be as clear cut as it looks. Back in 2014 when it was discovered that the state-owned Chinese arms company Norinco was going to sell $38 million worth of weapons to the government in Juba, there were some indications that the arms dealers were acting outside of the political process. Many foreigners don’t always understand that even though companies like Norinco are state-owned, they often do not operate in sync with other elements of the Chinese government (like the foreign ministry, in this case.) This is by no means meant to excuse the behavior of Chinese state-run companies, but it may explain, at least in part, some of the arms sales to Africa that seem to contradict official policy. Chinese combat troops are on the ground in South Sudan as part of the U.N. force. This, together with a legacy of morally questionable, even illegal arms sales, as well as Beijing’s historical preference to support incumbent governments over factional rivals in Africa, make places like the Sudans the most significant challenge to the non-interference doctrine in the policy’s over six-decade history.― EricAsk Eric & Cobus at questions@chinaafricaproject.com.

He tried to resurrect a tactic he employed against former Republican rival Jeb Bush, who Trump had derided as “low energy.”Clinton kept her pneumonia diagnosis private until she was seen nearly collapsing while getting into her vehicle at a ceremony marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York.Ticking off a list of world problems, Trump said, “She’s supposed to fight all of these things and she can’t make it 15 feet to her car. Give me a break.”“Folks, we need stamina, we need energy, we need people who are going to turn deals around,”Trump said.Trump has often told crowds who chant “lock her up” over her use of a private email server as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 to instead help him defeat her.But on Saturday, Trump told thousands of supporters that Clinton’s handling of classified emails and destroying of 33,000 emails that she had deemed of a personal nature meant that “she should be in prison, let me tell you.”Trump did not stop there. He said he did not believe Clinton would be loyal to her supporters and chuckled, “I don’t even think she’s loyal to Bill, to tell you the truth. And why should she be, right? Why should she be?”In 1998, Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, was caught up in a sex scandal involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Trump was widely seen as having lost his first presidential debate with Clinton last Monday although he cites online polls showing he won.In the days since the debate, Trump has been struggling to regain his footing, getting caught up in a back-and-forth with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Trump had criticized for gaining weight.(Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Tom Brown)"

After Monday night’s debate, the former mayor said Clinton was “too stupid to be president” ― a point he elaborated on during the Sunday interview.“What I meant was, after the long, long history of Bill Clinton, Gennifer Flowers, Juanita Broaddrick, I don’t know, 27 people making claims against him, including a settlement with one of them where it was obviously true, when she first heard about Monica Lewinksy, to pretend for five or six months that it was false,” he said. “[S]he was wrong to attack the victim.”Attacking Clinton for attacking her husband’s accusers is the slightly more nuanced approach that the Trump campaign is taking in bringing up Bill Clinton’s past. But this is still treacherous political turf for the Republican nominee, which Giuliani surely must recognize.Back when he was thinking of making a run against Clinton for the New York Senate seat in the 2000 election, Giuliani commissioned a focus group that, among other things, explored voter reactions to attacks on the Clinton marriage. Rick Wilson, a longtime GOP operative, recalled the findings to The Huffington Post.“It was a totally ineffective attack in moving voters to Rudy, even if they weren’t pissed off and offended,” Wilson emailed. “It made [Clinton] more likable and we even had people saying things like, ‘Well, she deserves to be a Senator after how badly Bill treated her.’”"

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said on Sunday. “The American people understand that Hillary Clinton and her marriage is not what’s important in this election,” McCaskill said on “Fox News Sunday.” “And if he really wants to compare his character as it relates to how he has conducted his personal life, over his adult life, with that of Hillary Clinton, even on that score she comes out ahead.” Over the past week, Trump and his surrogates have ramped up attacks on Clinton over her husband, former President Bill Clinton’s, previous infidelity. A favorite method is to praise Trump’s restraint in not talking about the matter. Republicans have warned that going after Hillary over her husband’s affairs could backfire, as McCaskill pointed out. Plus, the thrice-married businessman’s own personal life hasn’t been spotless, nor has his treatment and statements on women. “I mean, this is a guy who goes on national radio and talks about his sex life in detail that is disgusting,” McCaskill said of Trump. “Who does that? Who does that? And that’s why it’s so ironic that he thinks this would be a good idea.”Trump has insisted that the Clintons’ past is appropriate to discuss because Hillary “was an enabler, and she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward.” “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace brought up Hillary Clinton’s statements on Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers, with whom Bill Clinton had affairs. Wallace also played a clip of Hillary Clinton being asked about Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault.McCaskill said “Hillary Clinton may have defended her husband in various situations,” but has done far more for women than Trump has. “This is really not even a close comparison of who has championed women’s rights in their life and who has not,” she said. She also said she regretted bringing up Bill Clinton’s past in 2006, as she has said before. Trump supporter and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended the merits of bringing up Clinton’s personal life on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “She was wrong to attack the victim,” he said. Giuliani also defended Trump for insinuating that Hillary Clinton had actually cheated on Bill Clinton, without any evidence. Trump said Saturday that he doesn’t “even think she’s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth.” “I think it’s fair game,” Giuliani said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” because Clinton had criticized Trump’s past treatment of women and his racist remarks. “That was a sarcastic remark pointing out that Bill Clinton has, you know, quite a past and Hillary Clinton has done quite a job on attacking the people who were victims of Bill Clinton,” Giuliani said.

67,67,POLITICS,Chris Christie: Bombshell Trump Tax Piece Is Actually Good For His Campaign,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christie-trump-tax-story_us_57f108e7e4b082aad9bbbd3d,Nothing to see here. Move along.,2016-10-02,Chris Christie had cleanup duty for the Trump campaign on Sunday morning.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A bombshell New York Times report that suggested Donald Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years was a positive for the candidate, one that exhibited his “genius” and underscored his policy acumen, Trump’s top surrogate said Sunday. Appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” Chris Christie was given the unenviable task of being the first to respond to the Saturday night story that revealed, for the first time, pages of Trump’s tax returns (specifically those from 1995). And the New Jersey governor put a remarkably sunny spin on the entire issue. “This is actually a very, very good story for Donald Trump,” he declared at one point. One might ask how a piece could reflect well on Trump when it showed he lost $916 million in one year and may have used that loss to avoid federal income taxes for much of the next two decades. Well, Christie had some answers.“What it shows is what an absolute mess the federal tax code is and that’s why Donald Trump is the best person to fix it. There is no one who has shown more genius in their way to maneuver around the tax code,” he began. “The early 1990s was a difficult time for lots of folks. ... Donald Trump wrote the book the Art of the Comeback ... He fought and clawed back to build another fortune.” Christie rightfully noted that The New York Times didn’t actually show that Trump did not pay federal income taxes, but just reported that he had the opportunity to do so. Nor, he added, was there anything in the piece that suggested Trump operated outside of the law. And because of that, Christie made the case that an item widely viewed as a huge liability for a Republican nominee who likes to brag about his wealth and complain about his tax burden was actually a reflection of his brilliance.“The genius of Donald Trump is to make sure he follows the law ... and politically he has said he is going to change these laws,” Christie said. He added that Trump should only be “taking a bow for the fact that he has said, well before this story came out, that we need to change the tax laws because they are harming the American people every day.”Genius, apparently, was the main adjective that the Trump campaign was using in its talking points to handle the story. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani used the same descriptor when talking about the candidate. “My response is, he’s a genius. ... Absolute genius,” Giuliani said. “This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code and he would have been a fool not to take advantage of it. Not only that, he would have probably breached his fiduciary duty to investors, to his business. You have an obligation when you run a business to maximize the profits, and if there is a tax law that says I can deduct this, you deduct it. If you fail to deduct it, your investors can sue you.” “Don’t you think a man who has this kind of economic genius is lot better for the United States than a woman and the only thing she’s ever produced is a lot of work for the FBI checking out her emails?” he added.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says he agrees with Hillary Clinton’s characterization of his young supporters, whom the former secretary of state described as “living in their parents’ basement” after buying into a “false promise” in the wake of the Great Recession. Clinton’s comments surfaced on Friday after the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon posted audio of the remarks, which were delivered by the Democratic nominee at a private fundraiser in February and taken from a Clinton campaign staffer’s hacked email.“If you’re feeling like you’re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or, you know, some other job that doesn’t pay a lot, and doesn’t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. I think we all should be really understanding of that,” Clinton said.Over the weekend, Republican nominee Donald Trump sought to capitalize on the hacked audio, tweeting that Clinton “is nasty to Sanders’ supporters behind closed doors,” and is “owned by Wall Street and politicians.”“HRC is not with you,” he added, in a late appeal to Sanders supporters. Asked Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” whether he agreed with the New York businessman, Sanders, who has endorsed Clinton, said she was “absolutely correct” in her assessment of his supporters.“I think what she said ― and, by the way, during the campaign, we do have our differences, Secretary Clinton and I do disagree on issues,” he said. “But what she was saying there is absolutely correct. And that is, you’ve got millions of young people, many of whom took out loans in order to go to college, hoping to go out and get decent-paying, good jobs.”"

Appearing in Pennsylvania, Trump openly mocked Hillary Clinton for her bout with pneumonia several weeks prior and then imitated her collapsing as she was helped into her car. “Here’s a woman, she’s supposed to fight all these different things and she can’t make it 15 feet to her car. Give me a break,” he said at his event in Manheim, mimicking a stumble after he was done. It is not particularly humane, nor politically common, to make light of an opponent’s health. Usually, when it’s brought up in a campaign context ― if at all ― it is with stealth. For a while, Trump adhered to this standard. When Clinton famously collapsed at the 9/11 memorial, from what her doctor suggested was an episode of walking pneumonia, Trump stayed quiet. He even wished her well.But as his campaign has hit a rough patch, he’s dispensed with any such magnanimity. A few days ago in Iowa, he made fun of her for the fall, saying Clinton takes “all those days off” and then “she can’t even make it to her car.”On Saturday night, he actually acted out his taunting. Even for the most contentious campaigns, this is not normal.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Recent polls show about two-thirds of voters are likely to ratify it.Influential former President Alvaro Uribe has led the “no” camp, arguing that rebels should pay for crimes in jail and never be given congressional seats. But most Colombians, including some who see the accord as too soft on the FARC, seem convinced that an imperfect peace is better than more war.“This country needs a change and it has to be today, Fabiel Cruz, 31, an administrator, said after voting yes. “It’s the only chance we have. If it’s not today it will be never,”Under the accord, the FARC, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964, can compete in the 2018 presidential and legislative elections and will have 10 unelected congressional seats guaranteed through 2026.The FARC’s Marxist rhetoric goes very much against the beliefs of the largely conservative Colombian population and most, including Santos, think they will have difficulty finding a political footing.But while the number of seats is not enough to sway legislation, some are still outraged.“I voted no. I don’t want to teach my children that everything can be forgiven,” said Alejandro Jaramillo, 35, angered that the rebels will not serve jail time.“The accord gives a lot of concessions to the guerrillas. They changed their strategy from arms to politics but the goal is still socialism,” said Javier Milanes, 34, a restaurant owner who also voted no.For decades, the FARC bankrolled the longest-running conflict in the Americas through the illegal drug trade, kidnapping and extortion, spreading a sense of terror that left few Colombians unaffected. The conflict claimed more than 220,000 lives and displaced millions of people.If the peace accord is approved on Sunday, Santos likely will turn his focus toward a much-needed tax reform and other measures to compensate for a drop in oil income, as well as possible talks with the smaller ELN rebel group.Voting closes at 4 p.m. local time (2100 GMT) and results are expected by early evening."

An invalid referendum could diminish Orban’s ability to exert pressure on Brussels to change its migration policies.“Based on these data we can rightfully say that today has brought a sweeping victory for all those who reject the forced resettlement (of migrants) ... and for those who believe that the foundations of a strong EU can only be strong nations,” Fidesz lawmaker and the party’s vice chairman Gergely Gulyas told a news conference.Orban is expected to make a speech later tonight, after preliminary results come in.Radical right opposition party Jobbik said the referendum was “a fiasco” and called on Orban to resign if the vote proves invalid.Orban, in power since 2010, is among the toughest opponents of immigration in the EU, and over the past year has sealed Hungary’s southern borders with a razor-wire fence and thousands of army and police border patrols.Along with other ex-communist countries in Eastern Europe, Hungary opposes a policy that would require all EU countries to take in some of the hundreds of thousands of people seeking asylum in the bloc.“I think if turnout is around 40 percent, that is a fiasco for Viktor Orban and the government in international terms,” said Attila Juhasz, an analyst at think tank Political Capital.After casting his vote in a wealthy Budapest district early on Sunday, Orban told reporters that he would go to Brussels next week to start talks, empowered by the referendum result.“And I shall try, with the help of the outcome, if this is an appropriate outcome, to ensure that we should not be forced to accept in Hungary people we don’t want to live with.”He said what mattered was that votes rejecting the quotas should exceed the number of “Yes” votes.Orban also said his government could modify the Hungarian constitution after the vote.In a letter published in a daily newspaper on Saturday, Orban again urged Hungarians to send a message to the EU that its migration policies posed a threat to Europe’s security.“We can send the message that it is only up to us, European citizens, whether we can jointly force the Union to come to its senses or let it destroy itself,” he wrote in the Magyar Idok.HARDLINE APPROACHWhile Budapest says immigration policy should be a matter of national sovereignty, human rights groups have criticized the government for stoking fears and xenophobia, and for mistreating refugees on the border. But Orban’s hardline approach on migration has won allies in Central Europe.Last year, hundreds of thousands of migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East crossed Hungary on their way to richer countries in Western Europe. This year Hungary recorded around 18,000 illegal border crossings.Erzsebet Virag, voting near Budapest’s eastern railway station, where a year ago thousands of migrants camped outside waiting to get on trains towards Vienna, said:“I voted (No) because there are a lot of poor people in our country too and if more poor people come in we will be even poorer and have to work even more.”"

He said a “no” vote would be “catastrophic” and that he would return Colombia to war if the deal was rejected.Santos, 53, was due to address the nation at 7 p.m. local time (8.00 p.m. ET).Opinion polls had shown he would comfortably win and then be able to start implementing a deal painstakingly negotiated in Cuba over the past four years with guerrilla leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.But traditionally conservative Colombian voters, anxious over perceived soft treatment for the guerrillas, confounded forecasts as the “no” camp won with a tiny margin of 50.23 percent to 49.76 percent.Opponents of the pact believe it was too lenient on the FARC rebels by allowing them to re-enter society, form a political party and escape jail sentences.“I voted no. I don’t want to teach my children that everything can be forgiven,” said Bogota engineer Alejandro Jaramillo, 35.Opponents want a renegotiation of the deal with rebel leaders serving jail sentences and receiving no free seats in Congress.“This is a clear message. .. I ask all citizens to trust we will know how to handle this situation without agitation. We’ll work with the government to remake this accord,” said former Vice President Francisco Santos, a prominent “no” supporter.Torrential rain seems to have contributed to an abstention rate of 63 percent. “No” voters appeared more highly motivated, and some Colombians may have felt pressured to tell pollsters they were voting for peace despite private doubts.Regions still riven by the conflict, including poor areas along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, voted resoundingly in favor of the deal, but formerly violent interior areas pacified during the presidency of former leader Alvaro Uribe backed the “no” camp.DISASTER FOR SANTOSColombians were asked for a simple “yes” or “no” vote on whether they supported the accord signed last Monday by Santos and the rebel commander known as Timochenko.The FARC, whose numbers were halved to about 7,000 in recent years because of a U.S.-backed military offensive, had agreed to turn in weapons and fight for power at the ballot box instead.Uribe, still an influential figure in Colombia with a large following, led the “no” camp and the result was a huge victory for him.Under the accord, the FARC, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964, would have been able to compete in the 2018 presidential and legislative elections and have 10 unelected congressional seats guaranteed through 2026.It would also have given up its role in the lucrative illegal drug trade and taken part in reforming rural Colombia.But controversially, many rebel leaders who ordered killings, bombings and displacements would have had to appear before a special tribunal that could sentence them to alternative punishments like clearing landmines.For decades, the FARC bankrolled the longest-running conflict in the Americas through the illegal drug trade, kidnapping and extortion, spreading a sense of terror that left few Colombians unaffected. The conflict took more than 220,000 lives and displaced millions of people.The bloodshed, at its worst, saw the FARC positioned close to the capital and the state on the verge of collapse.Battles between the guerrillas, paramilitaries, drug gangs and the army raged in the countryside and there were atrocities committed on all sides.“How sad. It seems Colombia has forgotten about the cruelty of war, our deaths, our injured, our mutilated, our victims and the suffering we’ve all lived through with this war,” said Adriana Rivera, 43, a philosophy professor standing tearfully at the hotel of the “yes” campaign.The vote is a disaster for Santos, who had hoped to turn his focus quickly to other matters including possible talks with the smaller ELN rebel group and a much-needed tax reform and other economic measures to compensate for a drop in oil income.The government had hoped peace would lead to a boom in investment by commodities investors, in gold mines, oil and agriculture in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy.But after Sunday’s vote, companies will be rethinking the situation.Although the “no” camp has broached the idea of fresh talks, the FARC has said no group sits at a negotiating table to agree to jail time.(Reporting by Helen Murphy and Julia Symmes Cobb; Additional reporting by Carlos Vargas and Monica Garcia; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, Kieran Murray and Peter Cooney)"

Experts say he could still release them publicly if he wished.“Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” the Trump campaign statement said.“That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions,” it said.(Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Richard Borsuk)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

But far from the court’s marble corridors, in Los Angeles, Ginsburg’s life and times will come alive in the form of a new exhibit around Notorious RBG, a best-selling book that traces the justice’s legacy on and off the bench ― and the young, cult-like internet following she has amassed in recent years.Together with the book’s authors, the Skirball Cultural Center and its curators have begun to patch together the pieces and artifacts that will be on display at an exhibit of the same name beginning in 2018 ― a project they expect will give visitors an “experiential” dose of the memes, tattoo art and cartoons that have lit up the Tumblr page that came before the book.And yes, the plans come with the blessing of Ginsburg herself.“I have heard many good things about the Skirball and would be pleased to see Notorious RBG adapted into an exhibition,” the justice said in a letter to the center’s curators, who had asked for her permission prior to moving forward.Cate Thurston, one of the curators who reached out to Ginsburg, told The Huffington Post that the exhibition stands out from others she’s curated in that it’s an outgrowth of something Ginsburg’s millennial fans started.“One of the many things I love about the concept being born out of a meme is that in a contemporary sense it is truly history from the bottom up,” she said. “This is a show that’s been created by the public and we are fleshing it out.” Irin Carmon, an NBC News reporter who co-authored Notorious RBG with attorney Shana Knizhnik, said that Skirball’s “civically minded” culture jibed well with what the book sought to accomplish: placing Ginsburg’s life and struggles in the context of her battle for gender equality and civil rights. The tale is told with no shortage of fan art and illustrations, and with enough archival material and legal commentary to win over skeptics.Folks at Skirball really liked the combination of all these pieces, and so before they pitched the idea to Ginsburg, they asked Carmon and Knizhnik for their thoughts and then they all ran with it.“This book brought in all the elements, and the fact that this book was already a multimedia project really appealed to them,” Carmon said.Though the details are still being hashed out, Carmon said she hopes the exhibit is a “walking experience” of sorts ― a mix of judicial biography and civics with sights, sounds and even things visitors can touch.For some idea of what that might look like, one may look to the Tumblr page that begat the book, which Knizhnik created in 2013 as a frustrated law student after the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.In that case, Ginsburg was on the losing side. But as the senior justice in the minority, she assigned the dissenting opinion to herself ― and her screed was so forceful that she decided to read a version of it from the bench.“The Voting Rights Act became one of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation’s history,” Ginsburg wrote at the time. “Thanks to the Voting Rights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been achieved and continues to be made.”These and other dissents serve as a kind of thematic thread for both the book and online versions of Notorious RBG, and one of Thurston’s challenges will be to make the words on the page ― and Ginsburg’s life story ― come alive in three dimensions.“We want for there to be historic artifacts and we want for visitors to engage and play and touch and create,” Thurston said. “We’re still playing with those ideas but we will definitely want to have many elements in the gallery where visitors can create or perhaps lend their voice to something.” Thurston said it would be an “honor” if the show travels to other cities. “The exciting part of public history is that you can tell this story and share it widely and listen to how our visitors react to that,” she said. Until then, the curators have plenty of material to work with and expect to get a hold of more items. Carmon said her “dream” would be to feature in the exhibit one of Ginsburg’s courtroom jabots ― the neckwear she dons when she’s announcing an opinion from the bench.And if it’s the special one she wore when she dissented in the voting rights decision, even better. “The sky is the limit,” Carmon said.Notorious RBG, the exhibit, will open to the public sometime in 2018. In the interim, Ginsburg’s admirers might want to catch her in action when the Supreme Court returns to the bench on Tuesday. That day also happens to be the release date of My Own Words (Simon & Schuster), Ginsburg’s first book, a compilation of writings and essays."

As the letter of urgent appeal is a formal process of going through proper UN channels and following certain protocol, the organization wanted ensure that the Indigenous and African descendant population also have the opportunity to personally participate in the initiative. It composed a complimentary petition on change.org to top UN officials. To reach Indigenous and African descendant community, the organization launched a social media campaign on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The effort has already reached tens of thousands and the petition which is just a few days old is growing by about two dozen signatures a day and gaining momentum.The effort to address the treatment of Indigenous and African descendants of colonialism and enslavement in the United States has been domestic and international strategy since the founding of the United Nations in 1945. When Walter F. White became the Secretary of the NAACP in 1930, he had already played a vital role in the most comprehensive body of research on lynchings in America. His work sparked a public debate and top notch legal campaign that resulted in the most significant reduction in the number of lynchings that the United States had seen until that time. But he was also involved in the effort to bring global attention to the plight of his community. In its inaugural year, White; W. E. B. Du Bois, the NAACP’s director of special research; and Mary McLeod Bethune, of the National Council of Negro Women, were present as observers at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, largely as a result of extensive organizing campaigns intent on establishing an international activist agenda. White was succeeded by Charles Hamilton Houston, the first Harvard Law Review editor of African descent who went on to recruit the man who would become the first US Supreme Court Justice of African descent, Thurgood Marshall.Following a UN censure against South Africa for its treatment of its East Indian population, the National Negro Congress, submitted the first appeal on behalf of Indigenous and African descendants of colonialism and enslavement to the United Nations In 1946. The NAACP followed in 1947 by submitting a letter of urgent appeal to the now defunct UN Human Rights Commission entitled, “Appeal to the World.” “Therefore, Peoples of the World, we American Negroes appeal to you; our treatment in America is not merely an internal question of the United States. It is a basic problem of humanity; of democracy; of discrimination because of race and color; and as such it demands your attention and action.” The effort was met with widespread support around the world, but did not survive the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, due to pressure from the United States, the influence of Eleanor Roosevelt, who was at the time a UNESCO Commissioner and the concerns of NAACP leadership about the appeal’s state sponsorship by the Soviet Union. Four years later, on behalf of the Civil Rights Congress, artist and activist Paul Robeson submitted a letter of allegation entitled, “We Charge Genocide.” “We maintain, therefore, that the oppressed Negro citizens of the United States, segregated, discriminated against and long the target of violence, suffer from genocide as the result of the consistent, conscious, unified policies of every branch of government.” The allegation charged that the U.S. was in violation of Article II of the U.N. Genocide Convention by failing to intervene in the lynching of Americans of Indigenous and African descent. The U.N. General Assembly adopted the Genocide Convention on December 9, 1948. It later became effective in January 1951. The United States did not ratify it until November 4, 1988. Robeson’s effort with international activism was largely used to destroy his career as an artist and sully his reputation as a patriotic American.In 1950, Ralph Bunche received Nobel Peace Prize for his work as a United Nations mediator in the Palestine conflict of 1948. A self-described “incurable optimist,” Bunche was the first African American and person of color to be so honored in the history of the prize. Yet, it was the another recipient of the prize with whom Bunche shook hands at the United Nations in 1964 that introduced the masses of Indigenous and African descendants in the United States to the significance of global representation. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in Civil and Human Rights in October 1964 and just four days before his assassination, he emphasized the necessity of diplomacy as the most effective strategy for making permanent change. “It is no longer a choice, my friends, between violence and nonviolence. It is either nonviolence or nonexistence. And the alternative to disarmament, the alternative to a greater suspension of nuclear tests, the alternative to strengthening the United Nations and thereby disarming the whole world, may well be a civilization plunged into the abyss of annihilation, and our earthly habitat would be transformed into an inferno that even the mind of Dante could not imagine,” King said in his address “Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution” at the National Cathedral in March 1968. The landmark address in which he spoke against the Vietnam War and made the famous announcement of a “Poor People’s Campaign” that would soon return to the District of Columbia to demand that America meet “its obligations and its responsibilities to the poor” marked a day that he would not live to see. The burgeoning relationship between Indigenous and African descendants of colonialism and enslavement and the United Nations largely went to its rest as well.As the United States is one of the founding permanent members and major financial contributor of the United Nations, it has rarely been on the receiving end of United Nation’s diplomatic critique until recent years. In the last decade, the five permanent members have found themselves on the critical side of the world opinion on matters of human rights, particularly China, Russia and the United States. The US has been particularly challenged on its treatment of the Indigenous and African descendants of colonialism and enslavement within its borders.Returning to the United Nations has quite possibly not been more important for Indigenous and African descendants in the United States in the last forty years than it is right now. In the time since Thurgood Marshall’s departure from the NAACP Legal Defense which he founded, the political sentiment has shifted and the laws that once were so clear in their segregationist definition, now are not as obvious in their discriminatory effect. Policies from housing to criminal justice do not specifically say “no blacks,” but are more often drafted around the empirical data that emphasizes the residual weaknesses among the population. Research that ties those weaknesses to the legacy of colonialism, enslavement and Jim Crow is becoming progressively more marginalized in the mainstream discourse.Yet, the effects of that legacy continue to lay waste to many communities around the country whether in the high rates of under-education and unemployment, people of indigenous and African descent dying at the hands of other people of color and law enforcement or the disproportionate representation on the prison rolls. Malcolm X is often cited as saying, “when (white) America catches a cold, (black) America catches pneumonia.” The gap between the haves and have nots is only widening in America, it is becoming an ever expanding gulf in the indigenous and African community. In his final address to the United Nations, President Barack Obama said, “It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top.” That has been the urgent demand of Indigenous and African descendants of colonialism and enslavement since the first “Appeal to the World in 1947.”"

Sure, for a short 3-day weekend, you may run into the most perfect itinerary and the most amazing trip of your life - or in my case the most perfect trek ever. Yet, be forewarned. The longer the duration is of your travel, the more chances you will run into imperfection. That is not a sad state of affairs. That’s the flow of life at its finest.So get off that cloud of imagination of yours and be real. Bad things happens. And they do so on the trail, or that boat, or bus or plane.

And painfully I ask the ultimate question, “Why did I let this happen?”The truth is, you shouldn’t always believe the tips and advise given on travels. They will often neglect to tell you the challenges of being on the road. You learn best by just doing it. Be mindful of your fears and anxieties. Learn the means to pacify them. But also remember that despite all the preparations, imperfect scenarios will still creep in on you. And that’s okay. Knowing that fact will empower you to be courageous even if it means you do so half-pretentiously. No need to fuss and panic, really. Realize that you also signed up for that.

Soon enough, I learned this is not the best way to handle the downside of travel. You must deliberately take a break from moving, sit on the summit of a mountain on a glorious half cloudy day and just open all your senses to the world. Shut the mind up and be present. Then ask yourself again the question, “Why did I let this happen?” As fear subsides, answers come. The next thing you know, clarity ensues and the experience leaves you full of wisdom and courage. Declare to the world you ain’t perfect and grasp that concept fully as a part of your “new” self. Just think - if traveling puts you in such an unpleasant predicament, be it being faced with long overdue questions about life, or finding romance that fades away with time, or the awful stomach illness you’ve been dreading, or getting injured from falling off the mountain, you are as imperfect as you will ever be, and no travel can change that, not even the one that you wish in your heart to be the travel of your dreams. And that is perfectly fine, you see, for all of us who manage to run away from our imperfect reality. At least, you survived the ordeals of travel with a stronger body, mind and spirit. As a perk, you can tell the stories in your manner of choosing and intentionally neglect to tell them how much you cried, hurt, felt deathly ill or despised your past life along the way. So, next time, reconsider the thought of desiring to travel forever because that would mean enduring a series of imperfections just like your daily realities absent traveling. No, you will not get to sit on a bunch of fluffy clouds as you envisioned. Instead, you will get to hold that mirror steadily in order to see all parts of you and life at their finest, and otherwise.About the Author: Brown Gal Trekker (BGT) is a nomad at heart who loves mountains and survives the wilderness to blog about it.

It’s a stupefying comparison and it’s embarrassing to Filipinos. The murder of six million Jews is considered one of the worst atrocities in human history. And you want to compare your anti-drug campaign to that?Abraham Lincoln said, “[it’s] better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.” And as the saying goes, an empty vessel makes the most noise.The 71-year-old politician wields a large megaphone and he needs to use it wisely. After all, he assumed a job that requires him to juggle many types of responsibilities.

If that happens, who would defend the homeland? The Philippine military, due to decades of corruption and lack of funding, is woefully inadequate to provide basic defense and logistical support.Here’s the bottom line: If U.S. forces are expelled, the Philippines will have a harder task of dealing with external and internal threats. Look at Iraq. Obama’s ineptitude and weakness in ordering the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011 left that country in chaos. ISIS and Iran filled the power vacuum, and that laid waste to thousands of American lives and trillions of dollars spent that were meant to ensure a free and prosperous Iraq.Militarily, the Philippines needs major partners because it’s unable to confront a superior opponent in China. The Chinese possess Coast Guard vessels, jet fighters, artillery pieces, unmanned drones and bombers. The Philippines counters with nothing but political intrigue and diplomatic protests.Worse, Duterte wants the nation to move away from America’s sphere of influence and into the uncertain shadows of China and Russia.

You’d be at the mercy of a hungry tiger.Thus, there’s absolutely no gain in cavorting with tyrants. China wants control of the South China Sea and an obedient Philippines reduces the geopolitical cost of Chinese conquest. For Christ’s sakes, they’re building military bases on disputed territory, and what does Duterte propose? He may concede Philippine territory (such as Scarborough Shoal and others) in exchange for a railway system in Mindanao. That’s an outrage — he’s the commander in chief and he’s supposed to defend the archipelago, not give it away piecemeal to the enemy. Logic says that the Philippine president needs to increase the cost of Chinese incursions, and that requires America’s help.Additionally, conceding territory in exchange for a railway system looks like an immoral quid pro quo. Did China fund your campaign, Mr. President? Secondly, studies show that building infrastructure for the sole purpose of resource extraction (i.e., logging and mining) does not reduce the poverty level of the local population. The South China Sea, on the other hand, is rich in minerals and oil and gas. Therefore, it’s an extremely unfair tradeoff. China is coercing Filipinos to give up precious territory in exchange for economic peanuts. The country needs Duterte to lead the fight, not abandon it.Duterte also has a personal flaw in the form of narcissism. He may feel powerful by shaming a superpower like the United States, but he’s sabotaging the national interest by alienating a decades-long ally that sends over $200 million in aid packages each year. It’s an irrational stance, but unfortunately, many Filipinos are distracted by their leader’s theatrics.In the Philippines, there’s a lack of checks and balances in the political system. Duterte’s ill-advised maneuvers carry minimal political liabilities at home, and this lack of resistance is emboldening, not constraining, an egomaniac. Soon, more investors will reduce the flow of capital and power brokers will increasingly view the Philippines as a problematic state with a rogue official at the helm.Unfortunately, members of the Senate, House of Representatives, business groups and local media are cowering in fear.

Duterte is strong, which is what Filipinos want, but he’s committing mistakes, which is what many locals fail to see.Progress requires change and not all change is constructive. The Philippines is in a weak position geopolitically and militarily. It’s being bullied in the South China Sea and it needs U.S. support.

166,166,THE WORLDPOST,Dozens Killed In Ethiopia After Stampede At Protest,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oromo-protest-stampede_us_57f1471ae4b024a52d2f76e2,At least 50 people were killed in the stampede.,2016-10-02,"Demonstrators chant slogans while flashing the Oromo protest gesture during Irreecha, the thanksgiving festival of the Oromo people, in Bishoftu town, Oromia region, Ethiopia, October 2, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f147fa1a0000f3045b666e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ADDIS ABABA, Oct 2 (Reuters) - More than 50 people were killed in a stampede in Ethiopia’s Oromiya region that was triggered when police used teargas and shot in the air on Sunday to disperse anti-government protesters at a religious festival.The state broadcaster put the death toll at 52, citing regional officials. The opposition also said at least 50 people were killed at the annual festival where some people had chanted slogans against the government and waved a rebel group’s flag.Sporadic protests have erupted in Oromiya in the last two years, initially sparked by a land row but increasingly turning more broadly against the government. Since late 2015, scores of protesters have been killed in clashes with police.The developments highlight tensions in the country where the government has delivered stellar economic growth rates but faced criticism from opponents and rights groups that it has reduced political freedoms.Thousands of people had gathered for the annual Irreecha festival of thanksgiving in the town of Bishoftu, about 40 km (25 miles) south of the capital Addis Ababa.Crowds chanted “We need freedom” and “We need justice,” preventing community elders, deemed close to the government, from delivering their speeches.Some protesters waved the red, green and yellow flag of the Oromo Liberation Front, a rebel group branded a terrorist organization by the government, witnesses said.When police fired teargas and guns into the air, crowds fled and created a stampede, some of them plunging into a deep ditch.The witnesses said they saw people dragging out a dozen or more victims, showing no obvious sign of life.

The opposition also said at least 50 people were killed at the annual festival where some people had chanted slogans against the government and waved a rebel group’s flag.Sporadic protests have erupted in Oromiya in the last two years, initially sparked by a land row but increasingly turning more broadly against the government. Since late 2015, scores of protesters have been killed in clashes with police.The developments highlight tensions in the country where the government has delivered stellar economic growth rates but faced criticism from opponents and rights groups that it has reduced political freedoms.Thousands of people had gathered for the annual Irreecha festival of thanksgiving in the town of Bishoftu, about 40 km (25 miles) south of the capital Addis Ababa.Crowds chanted “We need freedom” and “We need justice,” preventing community elders, deemed close to the government, from delivering their speeches.Some protesters waved the red, green and yellow flag of the Oromo Liberation Front, a rebel group branded a terrorist organization by the government, witnesses said.When police fired teargas and guns into the air, crowds fled and created a stampede, some of them plunging into a deep ditch.The witnesses said they saw people dragging out a dozen or more victims, showing no obvious sign of life. Half a dozen people, also motionless, were seen being taken by pick-up truck to a hospital, one witness said.“As a result of the chaos, lives were lost and several of the injured were taken to hospital,” the government communications office said in a statement, without giving figures. “Those responsible will face justice.”Merera Gudina, chairman of the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress, told Reuters at least 50 people had died, based on details provided by families of the victims.He said the government tried to use the event to show Oromiya was calm. “But residents still protested,” he said.The government blames rebel groups and dissidents abroad for stirring up the protests and provoking violence.

Pat McCrory (R) mobilized the state National Guard, putting troops in charge of helping protect buildings and bridges and highways, and also provided state troopers to help with traffic control in the city.But the protests have highlighted a wide gap between perceptions of the Queen City that many in Charlotte have and the reality facing many of its residents.

Fried chicken and rib shacks speckle the landscape along with abandoned buildings and murals. West Charlotte, where the neighborhoods range from being 80 to 96 percent black, is home to some of the city’s most impoverished areas along with the north side. South Charlotte, which is between 80 and 95 percent white, is home to most of the city’s wealth. Nearly 60 percent of white households in Charlotte bring in over $60,000 a year. Seventy percent of black households make less than that. In 2015, the black unemployment rate was 11.6 percent. It’s only 5.3 percent for white residents. And, out of around 21,000 businesses with paid employees in the Charlotte area, only 5 percent were black-owned in 2012. Residents who live in these areas also have to deal with the byproducts of poverty ― higher crime rates, poor housing options, underfunded schools, inadequate transportation and harsher policing. Black people are 35 percent of Charlotte’s population, yet account for 60 percent of traffic stops, according to a study of 1.3 million stops that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department made over a 12-year period. The study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also found that officers are twice as likely to use force against African-American drivers, while black men aged 16 to 30 are three times more likely to be searched during a stop. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney has tried to build a stronger relationship between CMPD, black community members and local organizations, said Marcus Bass, an organizing member of local activist group The Tribe Charlotte. CMPD has also partnered with Race Matters for Juvenile Justice, which provides implicit bias training for the department. But the predominantly white force still doesn’t have the greatest relationship with the community.  “I’ll be honest. We try to have a relationship but the police will not allow it,” said Dino Davis, a 19-year-old from the city’s westside. “So they not gon’ allow it? We don’t give two fucks.” Most people who are not from Charlotte may not have a firm grasp of CMPD’s expansiveness, Bass said. The department has about 1,840 officers. CMPD regularly compares itself to cities with a similar population, size and mix of urban and rural areas ― like Columbus, Ohio, San Francisco, San Jose, Calif., Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Fla. and Austin, Texas.  CMPD has 2.27 officers per 1,000 residents and, of the cities it compares itself to, only Columbus, Ohio, has more officers per capita (2.34 per 1,000 residents), according to an analysis The Charlotte Observer conducted. And San Francisco, California, which has a larger population, only has less with 1.89 officers per 1,000 residents. “Charlotte, being one of the largest cities, being a banking city, has always had a prominent police force,” Bass said. “Throughout the years, relationships between the community and the police have been tense at times.” Bass pointed to the death of Jonathan Ferrell as a prime example of that tension. The former college football player was shot and killed by CMPD officer Randall Kerrick in Sept. 2013 as he sought help following a car accident. Kerrick was charged with voluntary manslaughter and his trial was declared a mistrial in August 2015. Protests soon followed and now, with the death of Scott, a new tension has arisen between CMPD and the community. “Folks look at their cities ― like Charlotte did before this incident and probably will over the next couple years ― and say ‘We are Charlotte, we are different than these other cities,’” Bass said. “In reality, you are very much so the same.”"

Jackson as Barron in Tim Burton's adaptation of ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f24e13170000f70aac8f80.jpeg?cache=X5qlrQ6k5B&ops=crop_0_38_1000_732%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Tim Burton,As a fan, I feel like you just pissed in my cereal, man. I tried, for many years, to pretend that you weren’t just another out-of-touch, willfully ignorant Hollywood disappointment of a man with a boner for whiteness and eurocentrism. In fact, when I first heard that you’d be directing the big screen adaptation of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, I was fucking stoked. I thought you’d be perfect for bringing the story and characters that I had come to adore to life.The first time I read that book was over two years ago in a “wellness clinic” (psych ward) after a failed suicide attempt. I was terrified and lost, and happened to find that book on the tiny little bookshelf inside the clinic. It sounds cheesy, sure, but the story helped me a lot during a dark time in an unfamiliar place where I felt completely alone, sharing a room with three strangers and little to no security. It helped me to realize that there are other people like me out there, and that I do belong somewhere; it’s just up to me to embrace my uniqueness and live life in a way that draws in kindred spirits. If anyone got that, I thought it’d be you.And then I saw the trailer. Mostly white except for the villain. I cringed, but who doesn’t love Samuel Jackson in literally anything? Not to mention the movie looks aesthetically fantastic, right down to some of the scenes looking exactly as I’d imagined them when I first read Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. And then, Timmy, my guy, you had to go and cough on my food. Fart by my sleeping face. Why couldn’t you just… not say anything? Why did you have to go and pull the whole “anti-PC” bullshit that so many other disappointments and headaches use when they don’t want to confront their own prejudices and the reality of the world?“Things either call for things, or they don’t. I remember back when I was a child watching ‘The Brady Bunch’ and they started to get all politically correct, like, Okay, let’s have an Asian child and a black – I used to get more offended by that than just – I grew up watching blaxploitation movies, right? And I said, ‘That’s great.’ I didn’t go like, ‘Okay, there should be more white people in these movies.’” ― Tim Burton on the lack of racial diversity in his moviesYou found the addition of black and Asian cast members to “The Brady Bunch” more offensive than the often wildly offensive portrayals of black people in blaxploitation flicks? Flicks that wouldn’t have even been made if Hollywood wasn’t so fucking racist and weird when it came to diversity and fairness in casting in the first place? Because you’re such a rebel for wanting to maintain a played out, racially homogenous status quo that doesn’t even reflect the diversity of movie audiences, right? That’s laughable, dude.To add insult to injury, you claim that “things” (movies and other shows?) either call for “things” (diversity), or they don’t. Ok, whatever, I’ll bite. If that’s so, then why did the role of a villain call for a black man? It sends kind of a questionable message. This is the first time you’ve had a person of color in a major role in any of your movies, and according to you, things either call for diversity or they don’t, so you felt the role of a particularly awful villain (we’ve both read the book, I’m sure. That guy is just the fucking worst.) called for a black actor. The only time your films have called for any significant diversity so far has been when you needed someone to be the worst kind of evil? That’s not a good look, buddy. It leaves a horrible taste in my mouth about you that watching “Sweeney Todd” and “Edward Scissorhands” on loop just won’t wash out.I love(d?) all your work because I always connected to it. To the focus on individuals who live on the fringe of society. Weirdos. Freaks. Outcasts. Who in this society is more outcasted than people of color? I thought you were someone who understood what it was like to feel as though you may never really belong or find your place, someone who saw the beauty in outcasts finally accepting themselves and finding love and true homes in the process. But you don’t really understand. You don’t get it at all.In fact, I feel that you’re a fraud because nothing is more typical than a clueless white man who treats diversity like a chore. Nothing is more boring, more common, more bland and expected than an old white guy who acts like people wanting to see themselves reflected in media is an nuisance or a problem as a opposed to a pretty reasonable desire.In fact, numerous studies and a fair amount of research indicate that media representation has a heavy impact on an individual’s self-image and sense of self-worth. So to treat something as important, and quite frankly, realistic and necessary as diversity, as some irritating aside that isn’t or should be something to consciously strive for is pretty fucking lame, dude. You may as well be any other old asshole who’s made uncomfortable by anything other than racial homogeneity and willful ignorance. An “anti-PC,” rich, old white guy? Typical. Laughable. Please hand in your weirdo card. Please give back the label of eccentricity and outlandishness that you’ve branded yourself with. You don’t deserve, it dude.It’s odd to me that someone who has been quoted as saying, “I think a lot of kids feel alone and slightly isolated and in their own world,” doesn’t see the validity and importance of diversity in the media. How do you think I felt as a young black girl, and even now as a young adult, who hardly ever sees people like herself cast in her favorite movies and shows? Isolated and alone. Seeing more than just white character after white character with a few superfluous or negative black characters thrown in could have helped me feel less alone when I needed it. But, you know, “Things call for things or they don’t,” right?I just wish you hadn’t said anything at all. At least then I could buy my movie ticket without feeling like some kind of sucker paying for a movie about outcasts finding their place, directed by a guy who thinks diversity is an optional pain in the ass (unless you need a super awful villain, because that calls for a black man, I guess).

You have hard earned Paid Time Off (PTO) days piling up at work, you're feeling burnt out, and you deserve a break... so take the stress out of planning a vacation and schedule your staycation today! Staycations are wonderful because you don't have to plan them far in advance, worry about getting a good hotel deal or booking a flight that fits in your price range. Never forget that Paid Time Off is part of your salary and work contract, and therefore your personal hours to spend how you wish; you wouldn't give part of your paycheck back to your company, so why would you leave money on the table and not spend your PTO hours!? Below are 7 simple steps you can follow to plan your (easy and free!) personalized staycation.  1. Figure out how many PTO hours you have to spend Knowing how many vacation days you have is key to getting yourself on track to using your earned time off. If you don't know, ask your HR person where you can find how many hours you have accrued - and plan to keep a regular eye on it! You can also make your own tracking chart for the year to ensure you're planning in advance to cash in your salaried vacation days.   Photo Credit: Strategic Stephanie  2. Determine how many days to take off Based on how many vacation days you have to use, decide if you'll be taking a long weekend, a full week off, or somewhere in between. If you start worrying about your workload, remember two things: (1) the work will always be there, but time is flying by and there is no better moment than the present to take care of yourself and (2) that you are literally throwing money away by not using your PTO.  3. Decide on your staycation vibe There is no shame in the staycation game! They are YOUR personal paid time off hours to spend however you wish - whether you are spending time with your kids, working on your side hustle, or staying home to sleep in. Take a deep breath and a few minutes to decide what vibes you need from your PTO. Setting clear expectations or goals will ensure that you enjoy your time off, and come back to the office feeling refreshed. Photo Credit: Strategic Stephanie  4. Prep for PTO work coverage Many fear that staying home will lead to checking work emails and falling into their usual routine. Set expectations prior to starting your staycation with yourself, family, friends, and especially with your co-workers. Your company and colleagues need to be respectful and realize that although you won't be on a vacation with no cell service in a different country, it certainly doesn't mean you're available to work. Prepare your team in advance for you to be fully out of the office, then shut down your work computer and remove emails from your phone. You're the only one who can do that for you, so take control over your time off and follow the guidelines you set.  5. Plan your staycation schedule Or not! This is your Paid Time Off - so use it as you please. If you have plans to be productive, writing out your daily goals will help keep you on track - but don't forget to schedule some downtime to relax. If you need to catch up on sleep, be lazy for once, or just get out and have some fun, then there's no need to create a daily plan. Your goal is to be happy and to arrive back at work rejuvenated and ready to hit the ground running.6. Prepare your home Make sure your home is feeling the staycation vibes too! Since you don't have to pack a suitcase and you're not spending extra money on flights, spruce up your home with your favorite indulgences - whether that means buying flowers, stocking up on your favorite wine, or scheduling a cleaner before your staycation begins. Knowing what staycation vibes you are aiming for will help you figure out how to achieve maximum PTO enjoyment. Photo Credit: Strategic Stephanie  7. Act like a tourist Mindset will be everything to make the most out of your staycation. The night that you wrap up work and your PTO time begins - set aside time to sit down, take a deep breath, and meditate on your goals for the week. Let any work worries or fears go, deactivate work apps from your phone, put on a Hawaiian shirt, pour yourself a glass of wine, and act like a tourist that just arrived in your hometown!  Congratulations will be in order once you take these 7 steps to planning your staycation and spending your vacation time - you may even inspire a few of your burnt out co-workers to take their time off too! Take control and empower yourself to enjoy this time off that you have been working so hard for; soak in that fact that you are avoiding airport security lines, the packing and unpacking of a suitcase, and just revel in your personal hours getting paid to do whatever you desire to do.

Recent polls show Trump's rival Hillary Clinton with a narrow lead in the state.

And the bankruptcy code allows wealthy people to stiff the people they owe by reorganizing their debts under Chapter 11.Trump didn't do anything illegal. Real estate losses are notoriously easy to create. Trump bought buildings with borrowed money. He could then deduct interest paid on that debt. On top of that, he could take depreciation deductions, even when his real estate was appreciating in value.Presto! Trump claimed almost a billion dollars of losses that would cancel his gigantic income gains for years to come. Bankruptcy is also easy to utilize, if you're wealthy enough to find a good bankruptcy lawyer who can use the bankruptcy code repeatedly to shelter your fortune and avoid paying your debts. Trump has used bankruptcy to stiff his creditors at least four times. The real scandal here is that Trump and other hugely wealthy people can get away with this, and do so all the time. It's just another way the system has been rigged -- by rich people who buy off politicians to alter tax, bankruptcy, and other laws and regulations to their advantage, just like Donald Trump has done. ""As a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do,"" Trump told The Wall Street Journal in July 2015. ""As a businessman, I need that.""Trump isn't and was never a smart businessman. He was and is smart at gaming the system. There's a difference."

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb82e2e250000cf003a1c5a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The consensus is that Hillary Clinton won the first debate handily. Yet despite Donald Trump's bizarre behavior during and after the debate, the polls show only a modest bounce in Clinton's favor.We have been here before. Trump has a bad week, Clinton takes the lead -- only to have the race fall back to a near tie. What might she do better in the next debate, October 9, which is a Town Hall format with spontaneous questions posed by an audience of undecided voters?Seemingly, this format favors Clinton, who seems to think better on her feet than Trump when confronted with questions her advisors might not have anticipated. At the same time the town hall leaves a little less room for the sort of direct give and take at the Hofstra debate, in which Clinton was able to bait Trump into losing his initial cool and becoming steadily more reckless.I am in a minority of commentators, in that my experience was that Clinton won the first debate, but not overwhelmingly. In the first half hour, Trump clearly had the upper hand.There were several missed Clinton opportunities. She might have scored more decisively had she not stuck so closely to pre-scripted talking points, especially when Trump gave her huge openings for ad libs.And some of the scripted replies were themselves weak. In general, her positive talking points were wonky. They sounded like a policy paper.Trump is doing a great job persuading viewers not to vote for him. Clinton needs to convince them to vote for her, and not just as the lesser evil.Clinton reeled off several policy ideas that could help working families and young people. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work. Fine as far as it goes, but what was missing was the passion: The indignation that the system is rigged against the young; that the vast majority of working families have been losing both incomes and economic security; that billionaires -- like Trump! -- have been getting too much of the pie. Trump himself illustrates just how they do it -- by not paying taxes, by stiffing their workers, by manipulating the bankruptcy laws, by ripping off customers. Trump is a poster child for all the ways the rules are rigged! Clinton needs to sound more like Elizabeth Warren.Trump was speaking clear, muscular prose. He was wrong in much of what he claimed, but his points were clear to their intended audience. The debate's first exchange, on trade, was a clear win for Trump. He said:We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. Clinton's reply did not engage Trump's claim. Instead, she said:Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. Sorry, not good enough. Lame, actually. Advantage: Trump. Clinton needs a forward -- looking plan to make sure trade helps American workers. Labor standards in trade deals would be a good start. She also needs to debunk Trump's claim that American companies are leaving because taxes here are too high. They are leaving for the cheap labor and because the tax code allows them to book profits in tax havens. Change the rules!Another missed opportunity was the way Clinton explained the 2008 financial collapse.We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. Are you kidding? The collapse happened because banks were allowed to run wild. It had nothing to with tax cuts. Several administrations, including her husband's, were complicit in the deregulation. But the worse excesses, as the bubble was becoming obvious, were under George W. Bush and his Republican allies in Congress. She needs to point that out, and to make clear that she will never again permit bankers to destroy working people.Hillary also needs to let herself relax and do some spontaneous counterpunching, as the opportunity arises. When Trump said not paying taxes was smart business, she needed to ask, ""Do you think people who pay their taxes are suckers? Losers? How are you going to finance all that infrastructure if people don't pay their taxes?""One talking point that she surely rehearsed but missed was Russia. Does Trump really admire Putin? Does he trust Putin? Does he think Putin has America's best interests at heart? Does he think Putin is rooting for Trump because the two can do business -- or because the naïve, ill-informed Trump can be sucker-punched?Clinton, doubtless, will be all over the disclosure that Trump got to deduct over $900 million in paper losses, allowing him to pay little or no taxes over more than a decade. Donald, should that provision of the tax law be repealed?And Trump, as he becomes more unhinged by the day, is very likely to raise the issue of Bill's infidelities. It backfired on the Republicans when they pushed Clinton's impeachment, and it will backfire on the serial adulterer, Trump. Hillary has been there; she doesn't need my advice on that one. She has the wind at her back -- now she needs to relax and maximize the moment.--Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University's Heller School.

235,235,POLITICS,"Flint Residents On Federal Aid Deal: 'Too Little, Too Late'",Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-residents-aid-reaction_us_57ee8d94e4b024a52d2e9dd6,"Residents of Flint, Michigan, still don't trust their water -- and they're tired of waiting for the fix that's needed.",2016-10-01,"A woman holds a sign during a prayer service before a rally for clean water in Flint, Michigan, in February. Flint water remains undrinkable and its residents are losing patience.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ee92891a0000de085b605b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been a bittersweet week for the people of Flint.After the Republican-controlled House of Representatives moved late Wednesday to authorize up to $170 million in aid to address Flint’s ongoing water crisis, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver both applauded the congressional compromise that thwarted the threat of a federal government shutdown next week. Some members of Congress similarly patted themselves on the back.But residents and activists in Flint who spoke with The Huffington Post were far less enthused by the news out of Washington.“For me it’s very insulting,” Nayyirah Shariff, director of the Flint Rising activist coalition, told HuffPost by phone on Thursday. “It’s outrageous.”Shariff is specifically concerned that the House version of the so-called Water Resources Development Act doesn’t contain enough funding, she said. It falls $50 million short of the Senate’s proposed $220 million in aid, and negotiations to address that disparity won’t take place until after the election. “They’re incapable of dealing with a crisis on this level,” she said. “We’re looking to the federal government to act quickly and they have not acted quickly at all.”Both the House and Senate versions of the bill passed this month; they were introduced in May and April, respectively ― two years after the city’s water troubles began and six months after they came to national attention.In the meantime, Shariff pointed out, she and many Flint residents have been fully reliant on bottled water in their homes for cooking, bathing, washing dishes, brushing their teeth and, of course, drinking. And at the same time, they’re being billed for water they consider to be poison — about $150 a month, in Shariff’s case.Laura MacIntyre is in a similar position. The sociology lecturer at the University of Michigan-Flint was born and raised in Flint and lives there now with her family. They’ve been living on bottled water for three years, she said, and it’s taking its toll.MacIntyre’s house is in rough shape. The dishwasher already broke, and the washing machine followed suit this week, filling up with “gunk and sediment” from the Flint water, which she says smells like eggs one day, sewage the next.Dishes are being washed by hand with bottled water. Meals take hours to prepare and process, “unless you want to order pizza every night,” she added.“Everything in our house that has been touched by the water is damaged, destroyed or non-operational,” MacIntyre continued.Even worse, she said, is the effect it’s having on her family’s physical and psychological health. Although she said she and her family’s tests for lead exposure have come back negative, her family is getting rashes. Their hair is falling out and they are feeling defeated.While MacIntyre is happy some aid will be heading the city’s way, she says it’s not enough to address the suffering its residents have endured.“It’s exhausting and demoralizing,” she said. “Very little has changed over the past year for the residents.

236,236,POLITICS,"Flint Residents On Federal Aid Deal: 'Too Little, Too Late'",Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-residents-aid-reaction_us_57ee8d94e4b024a52d2e9dd6,"Residents of Flint, Michigan, still don't trust their water -- and they're tired of waiting for the fix that's needed.",2016-10-01,Flint resident Laura MacIntyre holds a sample of contaminated water taken from her home while speaking to reporters outside a congressional hearing in March.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been a bittersweet week for the people of Flint.After the Republican-controlled House of Representatives moved late Wednesday to authorize up to $170 million in aid to address Flint’s ongoing water crisis, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver both applauded the congressional compromise that thwarted the threat of a federal government shutdown next week. Some members of Congress similarly patted themselves on the back.But residents and activists in Flint who spoke with The Huffington Post were far less enthused by the news out of Washington.“For me it’s very insulting,” Nayyirah Shariff, director of the Flint Rising activist coalition, told HuffPost by phone on Thursday. “It’s outrageous.”Shariff is specifically concerned that the House version of the so-called Water Resources Development Act doesn’t contain enough funding, she said. It falls $50 million short of the Senate’s proposed $220 million in aid, and negotiations to address that disparity won’t take place until after the election. “They’re incapable of dealing with a crisis on this level,” she said. “We’re looking to the federal government to act quickly and they have not acted quickly at all.”Both the House and Senate versions of the bill passed this month; they were introduced in May and April, respectively ― two years after the city’s water troubles began and six months after they came to national attention.In the meantime, Shariff pointed out, she and many Flint residents have been fully reliant on bottled water in their homes for cooking, bathing, washing dishes, brushing their teeth and, of course, drinking. And at the same time, they’re being billed for water they consider to be poison — about $150 a month, in Shariff’s case.Laura MacIntyre is in a similar position. The sociology lecturer at the University of Michigan-Flint was born and raised in Flint and lives there now with her family. They’ve been living on bottled water for three years, she said, and it’s taking its toll.MacIntyre’s house is in rough shape. The dishwasher already broke, and the washing machine followed suit this week, filling up with “gunk and sediment” from the Flint water, which she says smells like eggs one day, sewage the next.Dishes are being washed by hand with bottled water. Meals take hours to prepare and process, “unless you want to order pizza every night,” she added.“Everything in our house that has been touched by the water is damaged, destroyed or non-operational,” MacIntyre continued.Even worse, she said, is the effect it’s having on her family’s physical and psychological health. Although she said she and her family’s tests for lead exposure have come back negative, her family is getting rashes. Their hair is falling out and they are feeling defeated.While MacIntyre is happy some aid will be heading the city’s way, she says it’s not enough to address the suffering its residents have endured.“It’s exhausting and demoralizing,” she said. “Very little has changed over the past year for the residents. It’s too little, too late. They’re gambling with peoples’ lives and we’ve waited long enough. We have to take action now.”Aid workers delivering supplies — like water and baby formula — for some of Flint’s most impoverished residents are also feeling demoralized, and this week’s news from Congress didn’t help.Michael Hood is the co-director of Crossing Water, a humanitarian aid nonprofit based in Flint.

244,244,POLITICS,Donald Trump Doesn't Seem To Have A Clue How To Appeal To Millennials,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-millennials_us_57efc762e4b0c2407cde3432,"Hillary Clinton's campaign, by contrast, is really trying.",2016-10-01,"Hillary Clinton has campaigned with her former rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as a way to reach millennial voters.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57efca881b00007f08ef3afd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to courting millennials, things haven’t gone all that well for Donald Trump’s campaign.First, there was the tweet featuring his children that attempted to connect with millennials but was widely mocked. Then his son Eric Trump laughably claimed that his father appealed to millennials because he was an “entrepreneurial guy” who started with very little and became successful (in fact, Trump benefitted from his father’s wealth and connections throughout his career).Trump’s campaign seems to be banking on the idea that millennial voters ― those aged roughly 18 to 34 ― will support him because he is an outsider who will disrupt established political institutions. Some 50 percent of millennials consider themselves political independents, according to a 2014 Pew Research Survey.“Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat,” Ivanka Trump said at the Republican National Convention in July. “Sometimes it’s a tough choice. That is not the case this time.”But beyond pointing to Trump’s outsider status, the Trump campaign seems to be doing little to directly appeal to millennials ― the nation’s largest generation and an important voting block. And the tactics it has tried haven’t been so successful. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that Trump trails Hillary Clinton among registered millennial voters 50 percent to 34 percent (though the margin was smaller when third-party candidates were added to the survey).Trump’s campaign did not respond to repeated requests to discuss its millennial outreach efforts.“I don’t think that Donald Trump has an appeal to millennials at all. I think they have fully rejected him. Their campaign’s outreach to millennials is a joke, it basically consists of one Instagram post if his children that one of his children put up and that’s essentially it,” Addisu Demissie, Clinton’s voter outreach and mobilization director, told The Huffington Post in an interview.Clinton has also struggled to win over millennials and has had missteps with young voters. This week, for example, audio emerged from a February fundraiser in which she described Sanders supporters as “living in their parents’ basement.” However, her campaign is at least making a concerted effort to reach out to millennials, with at least five staffers dedicated to the task.Last month, she gave a speech addressing what’s at stake for them in the election. Recently the campaign has dispatched several surrogates popular with young voters, including first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). On Friday, her campaign released a video featuring all of them, although the video’s title ― “Squad goals” ― tried a little too hard to be hip. Despite the tendency to group them together, Clinton’s campaign also recognizes that millennials are a diverse generation. “We really have to understand, and we do as a campaign, that when you’re talking to a 19-year-old college student and you’re talking to a 33-year-old mother of 3, you’re not having the same conversation,” Demissie said.The campaign has hosted events targeting different groups within the millennial generation. These have included young professional happy hours as well as events on college campuses, barber shops, sneaker stores and “black girl magic” meetups, where women of color can come together to discuss the issues affecting them.“In our millennial program, like in any other program, we try to go to where people are. And so, barbershops and beauty salons in the black community are where people go to talk about politics often. We leverage that and take advantage of that and make sure that we’re there too to talk about politics, to talk about Hillary Clinton,” Demissie said.Trump, meanwhile, has struggled to connect on college campuses as several college Republican groups have refused to endorse him. The 2014 Pew survey also found that millennials are the “most racially diverse generation in American history,” which bodes badly for a campaign built around insulting minority groups. Trump has repeatedly pledged to ban Muslims from entering the United States and called Mexicans rapists and criminals.The different approaches to millennial outreach are clear from the policies each campaign lays out on their website. Clinton’s campaign website has entire sections dedicated to fighting sexual assault on college campuses, making college debt-free and ensuring equal rights for LGBT Americans. Trump’s website doesn’t address any of these issues.While Trump’s campaign has struggled to connect with millennials, at least they’ve bought a few Snapchat filters.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
253,253,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Told Donors Bernie Sanders' 'Ideas Are Indefensible' Under GOP Onslaught,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-sanders-indefensible_us_57efcc3ee4b082aad9bb9b85,"Proposing middle-class tax hikes made his general election chances ""really, really, really low,"" she argued.",2016-10-01,"Hillary Clinton, left, and Bernie Sanders wave to the crowd at the conclusion of a campaign event at the University of New Hampshire on Sept. 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57efd4b01b00000d0cef3b1e.jpeg?cache=KSiffR8WA7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton told donors at a February fundraiser that Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) “ideas are indefensible,” claiming the middle-class tax increases they require would be both bad policy and a political loser.The remarks, which are public thanks to audio of the fundraiser, which the conservative news and commentary outlet the Free Beacon obtained from a Clinton staffer’s hacked e-mails, are largely just a blunter version of public comments Clinton made in the heat of the primary campaign.But the recording may support a perception among Sanders supporters that, in the company of well-heeled donors, Clinton is more disdainful of the ambitious ideas of her primary challenger than she would ever dare to be in public.“The amount of taxes that would be raised on middle-class families is quite significant,” the former secretary of state says in the recording. “He talks a lot about, ‘We need to be like Scandinavia.’ And OK, Denmark, the tax rate for middle-class families [is] 55 percent with a 25 percent value-added tax on top of that.”The crowd responds with murmurs of astonishment at those figures.Clinton goes on to speculate about the kind of fodder for political attack advertisements Sanders’ proposals would give Republicans.“By the time the Republicans get through rolling that down your TV screens about 30 times a day and talk a lot about socialism and come up with pictures of Bernie visiting Russia during the Cold War and all of that,” she added. “It is not a pleasant sight ― or idea ― to behold.”As a result, Sanders’ chances of winning in a general election are “really, really, really low,” the Democratic presidential nominee says in the recording.Sanders’ only prospect of winning would be if Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination, she says.“Now look, they could nominate Trump and then who knows what might happen,” she says, eliciting guffaws from her audience. “I still think [his chances] would be really, really low.”Clinton’s analysis contradicts Sanders’ campaign, which noted that polling showed he led in general election match-ups against the various Republican candidates. She is not the first to posit, however, that his standing would not endure a sustained assault from Republicans.Sanders freely admitted that, unlike Clinton, he would not limit tax increases to earners making $250,000 a year or more. But many of his most ambitious proposals, like ensuring that public colleges are tuition-free, rely on taxes that fall disproportionately on the wealthy, such as a financial transactions tax.His plan for single-payer health care may have involved the most substantial tax increases of any proposal, but if successful, it would have saved households money elsewhere through greatly reduced out-of-pocket spending.At other moments during her remarks to the donors and responses to their questions, Clinton argues that Sanders has such strong appeal among younger voters because many were hit hard by the Great Recession and are still “living in their parents’ basement.”Clinton recounts a conversation with a group of young African Americans she had earlier that day. One of the young women told Clinton that “none of us feel like we have the job that we should have gotten out of college,” Clinton recalls.This sense of economic disappointment has inspired some young people to embrace Sanders’ message, she suggests.“If you’re feeling like you’re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn’t pay a lot, and doesn’t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing,” she says.Although some have interpreted the remarks as condescending, others, including Mike Casca, who worked on Sanders’ campaign, argued that they showcase Clinton’s empathy. He took issue with Politico for initially describing the comments as “mocking” millennials.Clinton expresses frustration that Sanders does not acknowledge that a “political revolution” would require winning a supermajority in the Senate and regaining control of the House, the latter of which would be nearly impossible before the next census allows redistricting.It is difficult to pinpoint at various junctures whether Clinton wholeheartedly disagrees with Sanders’ ideas or simply considers them unrealistic. “As a friend of mine said the other day, I am occupying from the center-left to the center-right,” Clinton said. “And I don’t have much company there.”The comments appear to suggest a genuine ideological difference, but, immediately after that, Clinton frames her dilemma in terms of pragmatic policymaking.“I don’t want to over-promise,” Clinton says. “I don’t want to tell people things that I know we cannot do.”"
266,266,POLITICS,Donald Trump Goes After The Clintons' Marital History At His Own Peril,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-clinton-affairs_us_57f01536e4b082aad9bba823,The GOP nominee is truly going where no candidate has gone before.,2016-10-01,Donald Trump has hinted he will go after Bill Clinton's infidelities in the next presidential debate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Midway through the nearly hourlong debate, Tim Russert, the host of “Meet the Press” and the evening’s moderator, looked up from his notes at Hillary Clinton, the first lady-turned-Senate aspirant from New York, standing across the stage.“The issue of trust and character has been raised repeatedly in this campaign,” he began, dutifully building the tension inside the room. As Russert finished his preamble, a video began to play, showing an interview Clinton gave two years prior in which she lashed out those who’d accused her husband of having an affair in the White House.Did Clinton regret “misleading the American people,” Russert wanted to know, before asking if she should apologize to those she’d labeled right-wing conspiracy theorists.Clinton, who had watched along, nodded gently and took a breath. A strained look came to her face. Her eyes moved away from Russert as she began speaking in measured, almost pained tones.“Well, you know, Tim, that was a very, a very painful time for me, for my family and for our country,” she said. “It is something that I regret deeply that anyone had to go through.”As she explained that she lacked the perspective from which to properly judge the entire sordid episode, her shoulders shrugged. Occasionally, she glanced back to Russert. But her gaze, by and large, remained downward and her hands moved little.“Obviously I didn’t mislead anyone,” she went on. “I didn’t know the truth. And there’s a great deal of pain associated with that, and my husband has certainly acknowledged that and made it clear that he did mislead the country as well as his family.’’It was an uneasy, fascinating moment, one that The New York Times described as “the most striking” of the evening. But what came next was equally compelling. Russert turned to Rick Lazio, Clinton’s opponent in that race, and read him a past comment in which Lazio said Clinton had “embarrassed” the country.Lazio seemed even less certain than his opponent. As he begins to speak, he fidgeted ― his body swaying left and right. His eyes never looked at Clinton even as he ostensibly addressed her.“I think that, frankly, what’s so troubling here, with respect to what my opponent just said, is somehow that it only matters what you say when you get caught,’’ he replied, a few “uhs” peppering his words. “And character and trust is about, well, more than that.”That moment, in that debate, on that night in mid September 2000 was the most direct challenge an electoral opponent has ever made to Hillary Clinton about her husband’s infidelities.Until now.Over the past few days, Donald Trump’s campaign has launched a sub rosa attack on Bill Clinton’s affairs by praising its own restraint in not bringing the matter up. On Friday, however, Trump removed any lingering doubt that he would aggressively and directly prosecute the issue. In an interview with The Times, he called Hillary Clinton an “enabler” of “the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics.” For a warning shot, he added this dark coda: “She’s nasty, but I can be nastier than she ever can be.”While the Clinton campaign has so far responded with nonchalance, Republicans outside Trump’s orbit seem practically appalled by the prospect. Both they and Clinton’s team are old enough to recall what happens when ― as with that Lazio debate ― Bill’s peccadilloes are turned into campaign grist. “Any number of Republicans have cautioned against Donald Trump taking this low road,” said Brian Fallon, Clinton’s press secretary. “It seems like it is not at all a considered strategy that they are adopting, but rather an impulsive move by Donald Trump that has become their strategy by default… It will backfire on him.” Months before Russert raised the question during that debate, Republicans hoping to block the former first lady from capturing a New York Senate seat had reached a similar conclusion as Fallon. Then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani had flirted with making a Senate run of his own. And his aides convened a voter focus group to test out prospective issues and lines of attack. Longtime GOP operative Rick Wilson had another veteran Republican hand ― Frank Luntz ― conduct the group. As Wilson recalls, women took the attacks against Bill as “totally out of bounds.” It wasn’t just Democrats, but Republicans too. “It was a totally ineffective attack in moving voters to Rudy, even if they weren’t pissed off and offended,” Wilson emailed. “It made [Clinton] more likable and we even had people saying things like, ‘Well, she deserves to be a Senator after how badly Bill treated her.’”The responses could hardly have been mind-blowing. During Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings, Hillary Clinton’s favorability ratings had skyrocketed. She was the most admired woman in Gallup’s 1998 poll, with a number that had doubled from the previous year and dwarfed second-place finisher Oprah (28 percent to 8 percent). Still, the Luntz focus group was a bright red flag that the Clinton marriage, and all its complications, was not to be broached in the electoral arena. While Giuliani ultimately passed on making a run, Lazio largely followed that advice. After his campaign sent out a fundraising letter accusing the Clintons of having “embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts,” he refused to elaborate on what specific embarrassment he was citing. When Clinton was questioned by the press about the Lewinsky affair and the impeachment trial, his campaign remained quiet. And when Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide who claimed Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her, announced that she was ready to help Lazio’s campaign, his aides sought distance. “This campaign is going to be about New York’s future and not the Clintons’ past,” a Lazio spokesperson said. Lazio was forced to address the topic when Russert brought it up. But even then, he walked on eggshells.“I steered away from making a point of any of those scandals during my debate and sidestepped reacting to or amplifying Tim Russert’s question,” he recalled in an email to The Huffington Post. “I was convinced then as I am now that public character was the salient issue, rather than what happened in Hillary Clinton’s marriage.” That 2000 debate would ultimately be remembered for a separate exchange that evening ― one where Lazio appeared to violate Clinton’s personal space by walking over to her lectern and demanding she sign a pledge to get outside money out of their election. The issue of the Clintons’ marriage never again rose, recalled Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for her Senate campaign. Nor did it come up when she ran against Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, recalled Phil Singer, a spokesman for that campaign.By the time the 2016 election rolled around, many Republicans seemed convinced that dredging up the matter was as pointless as it was counterproductive. Katie Packard, a top GOP consultant, practically begged the candidates to avoid doing it. “Republicans have an opportunity” to win over independent women and even some Democratic women voters, she emailed HuffPost in late December. “But the one thing that causes them to come to her defense is when she is attacked for what they perceive as Bill’s moral failings. Whether they relate, or they just feel it’s unfair, they defend her.”Even those who had fought the issue on the front lines sought to keep it in the past. “It’s been litigated,” former congressman Asa Hutchinson, who had helped lead the impeachment hearings in 1998, told Time magazine. “It was litigated, the judgement was made by the United States Senate, and I think we need to move on from that.”For months, Trump ― a candidate with a proclivity for slinging mud but one with a complicated marital history of his own ― appeared to agree. But his poor performance in the first debate and the precarious electoral position he finds himself in has apparently altered his calculus.Not everyone is convinced the strategy will backfire. In a twist, Giuliani, who commissioned that 2000 Luntz focus group, has been egging him on. And even Lazio argued that to attack Clinton for her husband’s infidelity is fundamentally different than to take issue with the way she maligned “the character of the women who might have been involved with her husband.” But the number crunchers and image gurus in the party are notably nervous. As Trump makes his 11th-hour gambit, they see shades of that 2000 debate moment.“Trump looks mean when he goes after Bill Clinton,” said Luntz. “Voters think it’s inappropriate and he is not telling anyone anything they don’t know. He’s not being informative. He’s just being accusatory. There are so many great issues to challenge her on this isn’t one of them. It will create a sympathy for her that does not exist.”J.M. Rieger contributed reporting."

It’s been a year of upheaval for the estranged couple, but the one thing that’s remained the same is their dedication to parenting their three children, Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4.Speaking at a press conference for his upcoming action film “The Accountant” in Los Angeles on Friday, Affleck drew parallels between his own chlidrearing experience and how his character was raised in the film. In “The Accountant” Affleck stars as math prodigy, Christian Wolff, who grows up to be ― you guessed it ― an accountant to some of the world’s biggest criminals. He is also on the autism spectrum, which leads his father to take an almost militaristic approach to parenting, in fear that his son won’t succeed on his own. “That’s what I thought was the most heartbreaking thing about the story and it was definitely moving to me as a parent,” Affleck said, according to People. “I face dilemmas that we all do every day about what’s the right way to raise children, what’s the right thing to teach them? Every moment there comes a crossroad.”“When you have kids, what’s that expression, ‘Your heart is outside your body,’ all of the sudden you feel so vulnerable and this fear of a child being vulnerable is very very powerful,” he continued. “I can see why it made for a really interesting character in the father.

It will return power and authority to the elected institutions of our country. It means that the authority of EU law in Britain will end.”May said that under her plans, the 1972 act would be overturned in advance of Britain leaving the EU but the repeal would take legal effect the moment the UK formally pulled out. Then the European Court of Justice (ECJ) would no longer be able to deliver judgments binding on Britain, she told the newspaper.The ECJ came under fire from many of those who campaigned to leave the European Union before the June referendum, with the official “Vote Leave” group saying Britain lost most of its cases to the court, which it called an “injustice”.The British leader is expected to trigger Article 50 to start formal departure, which can take up to two years to negotiate, early next year, but she has been clear she does not want to give her hand away before the talks.May, who was appointed after her predecessor David Cameron resigned following the referendum, also ruled out an early parliamentary election, saying it would cause “instability” - something that has dampened investment since the referendum.Separately, her Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement that EU law would be transposed into British law on the day Britain formally left the European Union. Laws that were then deemed unnecessary would be repealed by parliament subsequently.(Reporting by Costas Pitas and Elizabeth Piper; editing by David Clarke)"

We sat in a dim room at the McKittrick Hotel, a once-abandoned tavern that used to attract Manhattan’s upper crust and now plays host to the macabre interactive-theater project “Sleep No More.” Its dim corridors could house any of the peculiarities from Burton’s 31-year career, during which he has directed such contemporary classics as “Beetlejuice,” “Batman,” “Edward Scissohrands” and “Ed Wood.” Burton’s latest, “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children,” opens in theaters this weekend. Based on the Ransom Riggs novel about a teenage boy (played by Asa Butterfield) who befriends a tribe of shape-shifting eccentrics at an abandoned orphanage, “Miss Peregrine” is right at home in the pastel fantasies of the Burton oeuvre. So, we talked about exactly that. I live a few blocks over from the Tim Burton–themed bar.Oh, really? Oh, shit! I heard about it, but I’d be too scared. I’ll have to send a pre-scout to see what it’s like.Imagine if the patrons saw Tim Burton walk in the door.It’s too scary, even for me.Because it’s too much of your own work in other people’s hands?Yeah, I don’t even like watching my own movies. I am curious about it. And it’s still open. That’s amazing!I feel your movies have gotten a bit more family-friendly in the last decade.Really?Things like “Miss Peregrine,” “Alice in Wonderland” and “Dark Shadows” retain your aesthetic, but they’re not quite as edgy as some of your previous work. Do you think having children has influenced that?No, I don’t. It’s a possibility, but it’s certainly not something conscious. I did show my 5-year-old “Sweeney Todd.” Is that family-friendly?I wouldn’t call that one family-friendly. It’s the post-“Sweeney Todd” Tim Burton. What did she think?She liked it. I’m a weird person to ask because I grew up watching weird movies all the time. Who am I to know? But it’s a possibility, even though I’ve never consciously thought of that.There’s a lot of chatter right now right now about studios’ reliance on reboots, sequels and adaptations. Yes, I’ve done my fare share of those.Is it harder now than when you first started to get a “Frankenweenie” or an “Edward Scissorhands” made?Maybe, yeah, it’s possible. It feels entering a new era. The rebooting or the redoing used to be infrequent, but now they basically reboot things every year. They do the same stories, just with different actors, which is a new phenomenon. “Spider-Man” is the same “Spider-Man” with a different cast.In thinking about the evolution of blockbusters, it’s hard to deny that “Batman” is one of the most influential movies of the past few decades. It helped to usher in a new model for commercial filmmaking.Well, I do feel lucky to be part of something that felt new at the time. That was the days when the project felt like a new way of doing a superhero film, but also you’d never heard the term “franchise” before. Ah, it was so pleasant not to hear that word. Is it a movie? Is it a fast-food chain? What are we talking about? What does “franchise” mean?You didn’t even know there would be a sequel.No, we had trouble even to begin with. Warner Bros. obviously was into it, but it was different territory.It was an early example of fan acrimony emerging before the product has even been shelved, which is ubiquitous now. People were so upset that Michael Keaton wasn’t a buff hero type.Oh, yeah! No, I know, and it was so funny, over the years, because when the movie came out, it was financially successful, but it was not a critical success.Oh, I don’t know ...Believe me, I was there. And then there was a lot of criticism about Michael Keaton, as you said, even by other actors. And then, all of a sudden, you see every Batman, they all [deep Batman voice] talk like this ― and it’s like, what is this, some kind of Elvis imitator? You guys hated it, then why do you sound like him?You could argue that, in Hollywood, there’s pre-“Batman” and post-“Batman.” Are you a fan of the superhero saturation that’s taken hold?Eh, I liked Batman. That was my favorite character, just because I liked the fact that he was human and I liked the fact that he had the dual, split personality ― the light and the dark. That’s why I like Michael Keaton. You look at his eyes and he’s crazy. And he also needs to dress up like a bat, so there’s all that psychological underpinning, which I loved about him.You love those dual worlds. That’s a recurring theme in your movies. It’s in “Batman,” “Corpse Bride,” “Big Fish,” “Edward Scissorhands,” “Miss Peregrine,” the list goes on.But that’s life, you know? People are always trying to categorize, like, well, this is real, and that’s not real, or this is fantasy, that’s reality. It’s like, really? Turn on the news. If you described real events, you’d say they’re fantasies, or you’d describe these fantastical things and they’d be real. People try to categorize and separate the two, when in fact they’re not. Everything is a weird combination of the two. That’s what dreams are, that’s what movies could be. It always makes me laugh when people try to separate the two.Do you think that’s a symptom of adulthood?Yeah, I don’t know. It’s something I resisted my whole life, this categorization. That’s why being labeled a peculiar child or a weird child ― I never felt weird. I felt like a kid. And that’s what I liked about this. If you didn’t know what their peculiarities are, they’re just kids. And I do think you’re right ― I think as you get older, maybe you’re trying to grasp onto things in a crazy world. You’re trying to put things in a box, and certainly where I grew up, in the time I grew up, in Burbank, there was a real strong sense of trying to pigeonhole people, and I just never liked that.Does having a distinct aesthetic palette become limiting as a director? People have a fixed idea of the types of projects you do.Yes, now, it gets a bit limiting. At the beginning, it was all a surprise, “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure” and “Beetlejuice.” When I got “Beetlejuice,” I thought, “Really? A studio wants to make this movie?” They didn’t know what it was. So the element of surprise with “Batman” was similar. It’s like, whoa. And as that goes on, it becomes more of a thing, you know what I mean? Instead of a human being, you’re some kind of thing.You’re an idea.Yeah, people say, “This would be perfect for you,” and I go, “I don’t think that way.” I don’t think, “Oh, this is my kind of thing.” I just respond to whatever I respond to. It does get a bit strange. That’s why I don’t go on the internet much. That’s why I don’t read much about myself or think of myself. I always try to respond to things emotionally and not like, “Oh, this is my kind of thing.”I think of “Alice in Wonderland” as the ultimate Tim Burton project, like your career was building to it. The dual worlds, the trippy characters, the protagonist’s restlessness. But it was so computerized, which is different.Oh, yeah, that movie was the most backward movie I ever made. We used computers, but we used lots of different elements. We really used a mixture of things, making people’s eyes bigger or their heads bigger. There was never any one element on the set at any time. It was the biggest puzzle I’ve ever been involved with.Your list of unrealized projects is long. I was really surprised to learn you were briefly attached to “Jurassic Park.”Was I? [Laughs] That was the quickest one ever. It was like, [motions picking up phone] “Can we? Oh? No? Spielberg’s doing it?” [motions putting down phone]. I was attached maybe for 10 seconds. [Laughs]Your entire career could be different. What would a Tim Burton “Jurassic Park” look like?I don’t know. That was so quick I didn’t even have a chance to think about it.If you had to pick one of your movies for the proverbial canon, what would it be?I don’t know, it’s hard to say. I guess probably “Scissorhands” or “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” Those are the ones that are real close to me."
305,305,RELIGION,Committee On Homeland Security: Was The Prophet Of Islam A Warmonger And Terrorist?,"Amer Aziz, ContributorWriter, Editor, Speaker with The Muslim Writers Guild of America",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/committee-on-homeland-security-was-the-prophet-of_us_57ee4e08e4b0972364deb0be,To call Muhammad a warmonger and a terrorist is to call defending  human rights as warmongering and terrorism.,2016-10-01,"Mahatma Gandhi, arguably the greatest peaceful protester in history, honored Muhammad",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ee4f461a00001b005b5f55.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Following a spate of terror-related incidences, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security recently held a session called “Identifying the Enemy: Radical Islamist Terror.” Several commentators and experts in the causes of radicalization spoke at the hearing. Some had valuable inputs and feedback, while others were gravely mistaken. Muslim U.S. Congressman Keith Ellison and Professor Sahar Aziz voiced their deep concern of legitimizing extremists by terming their ideology as “Islamic” or “Islamist,” effectively aiding their recruitment campaigns while generating Islamophobia and marginalization of Muslims at large.However, Shireen Qudosi, a self-proclaimed Muslim reformer, stated during the hearing that the founder-prophet of the religion, Muhammad, had elements to his prophetic life that were “warmongering” and “terrorism.” Much as the statement is bizarre and incoherent for someone who claims to be a Muslim, Ms. Qudosi echoed the not unfamiliar narrative ― while Muhammad lived in Mecca, he kept a peaceful and persevering practice which took a radical and militant turn upon migration to Medina from which contemporary extremist movements draw their ideology and validation.Nothing could be further from the truth. The military engagements undertaken by the prophet of Islam were firmly grounded in their moral disposition to defend fundamental freedoms and human rights against undue oppression and aggression.Whereas this Mecca versus Medina narrative if oft touted in discussion and dialogue on extremist ideology, little is understood about why Muhammad faced opposition in Mecca and then gained the invitation to serve as Chief Arbitrator of Medina and the military engagements that followed in its aftermath.The Meccan YearsWhen Muhammad announced himself as a prophet of God and began proselytizing Islam in Mecca, he faced severe opposition and persecution. Muhammad preached monotheism whereas Arab culture of the time was immersed in polytheism. Mecca hosted a lucrative socio-economic platform based on idolatry and pilgrimage that brought with it traders and festivals from Yemen to Damascus. While Mecca was economically affluent and robust, it suffered grave social grievances such as female infanticide, misogyny and nepotism. When Muhammad pursued the rights of women, welfare for the poor and access for all to equity and justice, he clashed with Meccan authorities who saw him as a threat to the status quo.Over a period of thirteen years, the persecution intensified, including an economic and social boycott, torture and even an assassination attempt on Muhammad. The Muslims were ultimately compelled to seek migration. It is at this time that Muhammad is reported to have been met by a delegation from Medina with an incredible offer.Invitation to MedinaWhen Muhammad was extended the offer to serve as Chief Arbitrator at Medina, he had no military experience and had never advocated a militant rebellion against his persecutors. There were other relevant reasons to tap him for the job. Medina was a city torn by tribal strife and conflict. It was a multi-ethnic community with Jewish tribes, Polytheists and some heterodox Christians. Muhammad was a believer in the Biblical prophets and monotheistic (like the Jews in Medina) yet he was raised in a polytheist society. The Muslim community was new and had fresh converts from all the backgrounds found in Medina. Further, despite bitter persecution in Mecca, Muhammad never compromised his principles and advocacy for reform and human rights. This profile and circumstance made Muhammad the ideal candidate for leadership at Medina.The Meccans were furious!Not only had the Islamic movement survived the persecution, but it now had a robust political and leadership platform in Medina, poised to yield and expand. They took to looting the properties of Muslims in Mecca and bound them on caravans to be sold off in Damascus.The Medina YearsGiven the trust and privilege placed in him, Muhammad’s immediate task at Medina was to forge a cohesive set of agreements and accords that would bring the city’s feuding tribes onto a common and functional platform of governance. The culmination of this effort was so great that academics and historians have opined this may well be the first act of a state constitution based on the principles of freedom of conscience and equality of the citizenry ― The Constitution of Medina. The constitutional principles were smack from verses of the Quran. Verse 2:257 of the Quran (revealed at Medina, not Mecca) states Let there be no compulsion in religion (freedom of conscience) and verse 4:136 states Be strict in observing justice, and be witnesses for Allah, even though it be against yourselves, parents or kindred… weather he be rich or poor… act equitably (equality under the law).As such, Muhammad is honored by the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice as one of the greatest law administrators of history. Author Michael Hart wrote that he picked Muhammad as the most influential person in history because not only was he successful as a religious leader but also a secular one. Perhaps no testimony can be greater than that of Mahatma Gandhi, arguably the greatest peaceful protester of history.WarGiven the severe opposition of the Meccans, the feudal environment in Arabia at the time and the protracted warfare between Rome and Persia on the Arabia border, the Muslims found themselves, inexorably, in the theater of war. Yet the core theological grounds for engaging war defined in Quran 22:40 reinforce the protection of freedom of religion:Permission to fight is given to those against whom war is made… who have been driven out from their homes unjustly only because they said, ‘Our Lord is Allah’…. And if Allah did not repel some men by means of others, there would surely have been pulled down cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft commemorated.“Warmonger” and “terrorist” are highly derogatory terms used to denote someone who engages in warfare and violence for naked aggression akin to criminality. To call Muhammad, whose legacy extended far beyond the battlefield, a warmonger and a terrorist is to call defending fundamental freedoms and human rights as warmongering and terrorism. Not only is this narrative historically wrong, it has severe repercussions in terms of marginalizing Muslims and the Islamic faith.If the Committee on Homeland Security really wants to decipher the root causes of extremist violence and seek real solutions with the inclusion of the Muslim community, it should propagate the true legacy of the founder of the Islamic faith and emphatically remove it from the extremist narrative — nothing will do the extremist ideology greater harm."

Family members, family friends, boys who are interested in changing the fact that I’m single, my Uber driver, the lady who works at the nail salon, and every other adult who thinks I’m a generally normal person within the first four minutes of meeting me — thank you for asking me why I’m single because “any guy would be lucky to have me.” I know. But it’s really not a compliment. So please stop asking me why I’m single.I’m 22. I’m not at risk of being single forever, and I still have plenty of time to make babies. My standards are high. I’m not going to lower them just so I can be in a relationship. I have, like, 80 years to be married, so I’m okay with being single now, and I don’t see why that’s a bad thing.I’m really happy being single. If I had complete control over how my life was going, I would keep 98 percent of things as is. It would really take something spectacular for me to be in a relationship that makes me as happy as I am being single.I need to focus on myself right now. Isn’t this the time where we “find ourselves?” I think I’m already pretty found, but just in case, I like my freedom and to spend my time doing whatIwant to do. Nothing pains me more than college-age friends saying they can’t do something they want to do because their boyfriend said no. You do you, girl.I have dreams that I want to accomplish alone. And by this I mean traveling. I want to do it alone... and with friends. But what I don’t want to do is stay in my stinky hostel bedroom while everyone goes out because I wouldn’t want my boyfriend at home to be uncomfortable about it. If you’re in a relationship and your other half is supportive of your dreams and goals, that’s amazing. Let me know if he has any brothers. But for me, I need to accomplish things on my own right now. This is my time to make myself happy because I know later in life, I will be putting my family first.  (Also I want to kiss foreign boys with accents... and I guess American ones too.)You asking why I’m not in a relationship reminds me of all of my failed relationships. Literally every time. Maybe I could be in a happy relationship, but there’s always something that goes wrong. I appreciate the reminder of my mistakes, though.I don’t know. Believe me, if the man of my dreams walked into my life, I probably wouldn’t be single. Did he get lost? Is there something wrong with me? Am I way too picky? (probably) But I believe that there is a plan for my life, and I really don’t need to worry about it, because it will turn out better than I could have imagined. So please stop asking me why I’m single, because although you have good intentions, I’m extremely happy as is, and I just really don’t know."
331,331,GREEN,Bees Added To Endangered Species List For The First Time,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bees-endangered-species_us_57eeeb0be4b024a52d2f2791,Trouble in paradise for seven species of pollinators native to Hawaii.,2016-10-01,"The Hylaeus assimulans, one of seven bee species declared endangered in the US",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eef6db1a0000de085b62a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seven species of bees native to Hawaii were declared endangered on Friday in what The Associated Press said was the first time any bee in the U.S. has received the protection. Hawaii’s various species of yellow-faced bees will be protected by the Endangered Species Act effective Oct. 31. But one of the most effective safeguards ― controls on bee habitats ― won’t be part of the new declaration. The Xerces Society, which advocates for protecting pollinators, pushed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to intervene on behalf of bees in 2009.Friday’s decision “is excellent news for these bees, but there is much work that needs to be done to ensure that Hawaii’s bees thrive,” Matthew Shepherd, spokesman for the Xerces Society, wrote on the group’s website. “Unfortunately, the USFWS has not designated any ‘critical habitat,’ areas of land of particular importance for the endangered bees.” Restrictions would be placed on areas labeled as critical habits, but the Fish and Wildlife Service said it needs more time to identify potential locations. “Accordingly, we find designation of critical habitat to be ‘not determinable’ at this time,” the Fish and Wildlife Service said in posting the new endangered species rule. Yellow-faced bees live in a variety of ecosystems on the islands, from lush forests to alpine deserts 10,000 feet above sea level, according to a fact sheet published on a University of Hawaii website. They play an important role in pollinating plants native to the Hawaiian islands. An additional 42 species of plants and animals on the brink of extinction in Hawaii also received the endangered listing on Friday. The band-rumped storm-petrel, orange-black Hawaiian damselfly, an anchialine pool shrimp and 39 types of plants are endangered because of factors like habitat erosion, invasive species, human interaction and climate change, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.“I’m relieved these 49 unique Hawaiian plants and animals are finally getting the protection they desperately need to survive,” said Loyal Mehrhoff, recovery director at the center. “The Endangered Species Act has already saved hundreds of Hawaiian species from extinction, so this is great news for these irreplaceable plants and animals.”Bees are imperiled elsewhere. The Fish and Wildlife Service this month recommended adding a species from the Midwest to the endangered list, beginning a process that can take up to a year. The rusty patched bumble bee, which once inhabited 26 states and parts of Canada, has lost 90 percent of its range in the last two decades. Fish and Wildlife Service officials did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the common name of a type of bee. It is the rusty patched bumble bee, not the ruby patched bumble bee. "
334,334,POLITICS,Jerry Brown Vetoes Bill Meant To Guarantee Paid Parental Leave For More Workers,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-parental-leave-veto_us_57bce1c9e4b03d51368b994a,The bill would have let more parents bond with new children without fear of losing their jobs.,2016-10-01,California Gov. Jerry Brown said he vetoed the bill out of concern for small businesses.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eefe4a1a0000f3045b62b6.jpeg?cache=rrfNpF2edP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) vetoed a bill Friday that would have guaranteed job-protected time off for many new parents in the state.The bill, introduced by state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), required companies with 20 or more employees to provide six weeks of maternity or paternity leave after the birth or adoption of a child. Under existing law, only companies with 50 or more employees are required to provide job-protected leave.In a veto message, Brown said he rejected the bill out of concern for the potential impact on small businesses. “It goes without saying that allowing new parents to bond with a child is very important and the state has a number of paid and unpaid benefit programs to provide for that leave,” he wrote. “I am concerned, however, about the impact of this leave particularly on small businesses and the potential liability that could result.”The governor continued, “As I understand, an amendment was offered that would allow an employee and employer to pursue mediation prior to a lawsuit being brought. I believe this is a viable option that should be explored by the author.”According to Jackson’s office, the bill would have extended protected leave to 2.7 million additional Californians, or 16 percent of the state’s workforce.California already guarantees workers up to 70 percent of their pay for six weeks to bond with a new child or care for a relative. (The percentage depends on the worker’s income level ― lower-wage workers are guaranteed a higher percentage.) Under the proposed bill, new parents employed by small businesses would have been able to access those funds without fear of losing their job. “I’m deeply disappointed in today’s veto,” Jackson said in a statement on Friday. “This bill would have corrected an inequity in current law that leaves millions of new parents without the ability to take advantage of the Paid Family Leave Program they already pay into without the fear they could lose their jobs if they do.” “I believe everyone deserves the basic right to take time off to care for a newborn,” Jackson continued. “With more women in the workforce than ever before, supporting working families through more family-friendly workplace policies has become elevated as a national priority. As many states move forward with strong policies for parental leave, California cannot afford to be left behind.”The state lawmaker vowed to keep working on the issue.Studies show that paid parental leave has important health benefits for both parents and children, and that parents who take time off to bond with a new child are more likely to embrace a greater role in raising the child later on. However, just 12 percent of U.S. workers have access to paid family leave.The tide does appear to be shifting: Nine states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books similar to the one proposed in California. Earlier this year, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to require companies to give employees at least six weeks of paid parental leave. And some private employers, particularly tech companies, have begun offering expansive leave programs. Public support for paid parental leave is strong. A poll commissioned by the Work Family Strategy Council earlier this year found 61 percent of respondents are in favor of a national paid family leave policy. And in a HuffPost/YouGov poll, 67 percent of respondents supported paid maternity leave, while 55 percent backed paid paternity leave."

I have employed it as well in every workplace, including the Supreme Court,” she continued. “When a thoughtless or unkind word is spoken, best tune out. Reacting in anger or annoyance will not advance one’s ability to persuade.”It’s advice that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, seems incapable of following, as he has relentlessly criticized anyone who has spoken out against him— including a Gold Star family and, most recently, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.Ginsburg also described how she balanced her studies and being a new parent while in law school, writing that she would have been unable to do it without a nanny. Having to divide her time between her coursework and daughter, made her a better student, Ginsburg wrote.“My success in law school, I have no doubt, was in large measure because of baby Jane. I attended classes and studied diligently until 4 in the afternoon; the next hours were Jane’s time, spent at the park, playing silly games or singing funny songs, reading picture books and A. A. Milne poems, and bathing and feeding her,” she wrote. “After Jane’s bedtime, I returned to the law books with renewed will. Each part of my life provided respite from the other and gave me a sense of proportion that classmates trained only on law studies lacked.”Ginsburg graduated from Columbia Law School at the top of her class, but was passed over for a clerkship on the Supreme Court because she was a woman. She went on to found the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project. As a lawyer, Ginsburg pushed the Supreme Court to strike down laws that discriminated on the basis of sex.She noted in her essay in the Times how much things had improved for women in the legal profession and in the business world, but said there was still a long way to go.“One must acknowledge the still bleak part of the picture,” Ginsburg wrote. “Most people in poverty in the United States and the world over are women and children, women’s earnings here and abroad trail the earnings of men with comparable education and experience, our workplaces do not adequately accommodate the demands of childbearing and child rearing, and we have yet to devise effective ways to ward off sexual harassment at work and domestic violence in our homes,” she continued. “I am optimistic, however, that movement toward enlistment of the talent of all who compose ‘We, the people,’ will continue.”"
355,355,POLITICS,Donald Trump Reportedly Pressured His Second Wife To Appear In Playboy,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-playboy_us_57efc120e4b082aad9bb9a0e,We're detecting a pattern here.,2016-10-01,Donald Trump reportedly tried to get Marla Maples in Playboy,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an apparent pique on Friday morning, Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Alicia Machado― the former Miss Universe winner who has become a forceful critic of the GOP presidential nominee ― accusing her of, among other things, appearing in a sex tape. The charges, and Trump, came off as manic; not least because they were leveled at roughly 5:30 a.m. They were also hypocritical. Trump had made a cameo in a softcore porn film in 1999, titled “Playboy Video Centerfold 2000,” BuzzFeed News reported on Friday afternoon. He wasn’t naked or having sex, just breaking a champagne bottle over a car in the video’s opening scenes. Still, of the two principals in this argument, only one ― the accuser ― had actually made an appearance in porn. But the attack on Machado seemed hollow for another reason. Before running for office, Trump showed little disgust with women appearing in pornography. He bragged about watching Paris Hilton’s sex tape with his wife, Melania Trump. And while dating his soon-to-be-second wife Marla Maples in 1990, he reportedly encouraged her to appear in Playboy. Here is how the Sun-Sentinel reported it on Aug. 19, 1990:“Donald doesn’t want Marla to look like she’s against Ivana,” says Trump’s P.R. guru Chuck Jones. “Donald wants picture approval. Donald says to emphasize her early years.”And here is the article in its original format: As Jezebel first reported, this wasn’t exactly a one-time intuition on Trump’s behalf. He also reportedly tried to get Playboy to run a spread on the women who worked for him. The Trump campaign did no return request for comment. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The body camera footage shows Cole roughly throwing Dejuan Yourse to the floor of the porch and punching him as Yourse waited for his mom to come home and let him into the house, according to local news WREG.The council pushed for criminal charges against Cole, but the district attorney refused, saying he wouldn’t “rehash the same evidence,” the Greensboro News & Record reported.Cole and another officer approached Yourse’s house after they were dispatched to investigate a possible break-in on June 17.As seen in body camera footage from both officers, combined below, Yourse explains that he’s waiting for his mom, who has lived in the neighborhood for 10 years, and visits her house every day. Yourse is seen on the video attempting to phone his mom so she can speak to the officers. He gives the officers his ID, which lists the address as his residence, and he suggests the officers ask a neighbor to verify that he lives there. The exchange escalates when Cole places his hands on Yourse’s chest to stop him from walking away. After Yourse sits back down, Cole snatches Yourse’s phone from his hand while Yourse is talking to someone, asking the person to come to his house because “the police is over here and they harassing me.”Cole then throws Yourse to the floor and struggles to handcuff him. Amid the scuffle, Yourse repeatedly asks Cole why he’s punching him. When Cole yells, “I’m going to hit you again,” Yourse yells back, “Why?” The cops charged Yourse with resisting arrest and assault on government officials. The charges were dropped when Cole resigned from his position in August. The second officer involved in Yourse’s arrest, C.N. Jackson, quit her job on Wednesday. Both ex-officers are white.Warning: The video below is violent and contains explicit language.Yourse’s case recalls the 2009 arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., a black Harvard professor who was arrested on the porch of his own home, even after producing his Harvard ID and his driver’s license.Gates’s arrest didn’t turn violent, but it did raise the issue of racial profiling to a national level, The Washington Post reported in 2010. The case led to a nine-month investigation and 60-page report offering lessons on how police officers can prevent “similar incidents in the future.”The mayor of Greensboro called Yourse’s mistreatment “ugly,” “brutal” and “completely unnecessary.” She apologized to Yourse on behalf of city council, the Winston-Salem Journal reported.Yourse told the News & Record that he knew he was “wrongfully messed up.” He wasn’t seriously hurt during the incident.Greensboro police completed their internal investigation on Aug. 30 ― 11 days after Cole resigned from his position. This story was clarified to show that the city council voted to request the state remove Travis Cole’s police credentials."

This was not the first time that gas had been used in World War I, the Germans had already put it to use against the Russian Army in Poland a few months earlier.Following a two-day bombardment, the German Army simultaneously released 168 tons of chlorine gas over a four-mile front. The Germans had hauled 6,000 gas cylinders, each weighing 90 pounds, to the front line. On a prearranged signal, the canisters were opened, releasing their deadly contents. The panic that resulted opened a four-mile gap in the Allied lines. The First Canadian Division was stationed at St. Julien, on the flank of the gap. In what was considered a suicide mission, they were ordered to counterattack and prevent the Germans from advancing through the opening.Lacking gas masks, they improvised by urinating on cloths and holding them to their faces. The ammonia in the urine neutralized the chlorine gas. The Canadians' victory that day marked a second milestone, it was the first time that soldiers from the new world had defeated soldiers from the old on a European battlefield.For all of its deadly affects, chlorine had shortcomings as a weapon of mass destruction. It was easily dispersed by the wind, limiting its effects. To compensate, the Germans developed sulfur mustard, otherwise known as mustard gas, which they used at the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917. German chlorine gas attack during the Second battle of Ypres The gas had a yellow color and smelled of mustard plants and garlic, hence its name. Mustard gas was heavier than chlorine gas, less likely to be dispersed by wind and its effects in the battlefield persisted longer. It has no known uses beyond being a weapon of mass destruction. In total, more than a million people were killed or injured as a result of contact with poison gas during WW I.When WWII broke out both sides stockpiled poison gas fearing a return to the practice of WWI. The Italians used mustard gas during the Abyssinian campaign in 1935, the Polish Army used mustard gas grenades during the Nazi invasion in 1939, and there were reports that the Japanese used poison gas in Manchuria. Winston Churchill authorized the use of gas against German troops if they invaded Great Britain. He also considered using mustard gas bombs against German cities but abandoned the idea. Adolf Hitler weighed using gas during the siege of Leningrad, but also opted not to employ it.US stockpile of 155 mm Mustard Gas artillery shellsSince WWII there have been sporadic uses of mustard gas and other chemical agents on the battlefield. Egypt was accused of using poison gas, possibly mustard gas, during the civil war in North Yemen between 1963 and 1967. There were also unsubstantiated reports that Vietnam used phosgene, another WWI era poison gas, against Cambodian resistance forces, hiding along the Thai border, during Vietnam's 1984-85, Cambodian intervention that toppled Pol Pot. Both South African troops and Cuban troops were accused of using chemical weapons during the Angolan Civil War.It is Iraq and Syria, however, that are responsible for the lion's share of poison gas use since the end of WWII.Saddam Hussein used a variety of chemical weapons, including mustard gas, against Iranian forces during the Iraq-Iran war. Hussein also used poison gas against the Kurdish village of Halabja, and during the al-Anfal campaign against Kurdish civilians and other minorities in Northern Iraq. There were also unconfirmed reports that Hussein used poison gas against Shiite rebels in the Shat al-Arab marshes in the Persian Gulf. Chemical weapons have also been used by Syrian military forces, loyal to the Assad government, against various Syrian rebel groups and civilians. In August 2012, US President Barack Obama warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, that the use of chemical weapons by his forces would represent a red line for the US. Unfortunately, the Obama Administration's threat proved to be hollow and was quickly forgotten when evidence of Syria's use of chemical weapons emerged. Iranian soldier with gas mask during Iraq-Iran Civil WarIn September 2013, Russia, in collaboration with the United States, brokered an agreement under which Syria agreed to turn over its chemical weapons for destruction under UN supervision. These weapons amounted to around 1,000 tons of sarin, mustard gas and VX. Chlorine, the original WWI era poison gas, was exempted since chlorine gas has widespread use in industry. Many municipal waterworks, for example, uses liquid chlorine gas to chlorinate water supplies. Despite the agreement, however, there have been widespread reports that the Assad government has used canisters of chlorine gas in the barrel bombs that it uses to target civilians. There have also been unverified reports that the Assad government retained some stocks of sarin and VX gas.Poison gasses, not surprisingly, are popular among terrorist organizations. They are the cheapest and easiest weapons of mass destruction to produce. The Japanese group Aum Shinrikyo used sarin gas in an attack in Matsumoto, Japan on June 27, 1994. The following year, they released sarin gas into the Tokyo subway system. Russian Chechen and various Sunni jihadist groups in Iraq, including Islamic State (IS), have exploded tanks of chlorine gas, including blowing up tanker trucks full of liquid chlorine, as improvised weapons of mass destruction (IWMD).In addition, according to Pentagon sources, Islamic State has been producing and stockpiling mustard gas since 2015. There have been reports from Kurdish and other sources that Islamic State has fired artillery shells and mortar rounds that contained mustard gas. Follow up tests, however, have proven to be inconclusive. Nonetheless, Sleiman Daoud al-Atari, the recently captured head of Islamic State's chemical weapons program, has admitted to US interrogators that IS has amassed a stockpile of mustard gas, which it intends to deploy in the upcoming battle of Mosul.On Sept 12, 2016, US warplanes destroyed a pharmaceutical factory in Mosul that US Central Command believes had been converted into a chemical weapons manufacturing facility. There have also been persistent reports that IS has been working on developing other chemical agents in laboratories at the University of Mosul. Victims of a mustard gas attack by Syrian military forces, Ghouta, Syria August 27, 2013Mustard gas can be used both as an offensive weapon against advancing troops and, in large quantities, to create area denial zones that prevent the advance of Iraqi troops and force them into preselected attack routes set up as kill zones. In a briefing to the Pentagon, reported in military.com, Army Colonel John Dorrian confirmed that US forces anticipate that Islamic State fighters will use mustard gas, and possibly other chemical weapons, during the Battle for Mosul. He also confirmed that IS has dug tunnels to enable them to attack rear areas of the Iraqi forces. The US has already distributed some 50,000 kits of ""personal protective gear"" to Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Shiite militias, interestingly enough, do not have protective gear in the event of a chemical weapons attack, a factor that may limit their involvement in the Battle of Mosul. Iran, however, is believed to have such gear and could, in theory, supply it if it becomes necessary. Such an action, however, would further highlight Iran's role in arming the Shiite militias.With the exception of the Iraq-Iran war and the civil war in Syria, poison gas in general and mustard gas in particular has been largely absent from post WWI military conflict. After an absence of almost a century, mustard gas is about to return to the modern battlefield.See also: The Battle for Mosul"

Winston Churchill authorized the use of gas against German troops if they invaded Great Britain. He also considered using mustard gas bombs against German cities but abandoned the idea. Adolf Hitler weighed using gas during the siege of Leningrad, but also opted not to employ it.US stockpile of 155 mm Mustard Gas artillery shellsSince WWII there have been sporadic uses of mustard gas and other chemical agents on the battlefield. Egypt was accused of using poison gas, possibly mustard gas, during the civil war in North Yemen between 1963 and 1967. There were also unsubstantiated reports that Vietnam used phosgene, another WWI era poison gas, against Cambodian resistance forces, hiding along the Thai border, during Vietnam's 1984-85, Cambodian intervention that toppled Pol Pot. Both South African troops and Cuban troops were accused of using chemical weapons during the Angolan Civil War.It is Iraq and Syria, however, that are responsible for the lion's share of poison gas use since the end of WWII.Saddam Hussein used a variety of chemical weapons, including mustard gas, against Iranian forces during the Iraq-Iran war. Hussein also used poison gas against the Kurdish village of Halabja, and during the al-Anfal campaign against Kurdish civilians and other minorities in Northern Iraq. There were also unconfirmed reports that Hussein used poison gas against Shiite rebels in the Shat al-Arab marshes in the Persian Gulf. Chemical weapons have also been used by Syrian military forces, loyal to the Assad government, against various Syrian rebel groups and civilians. In August 2012, US President Barack Obama warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, that the use of chemical weapons by his forces would represent a red line for the US. Unfortunately, the Obama Administration's threat proved to be hollow and was quickly forgotten when evidence of Syria's use of chemical weapons emerged. Iranian soldier with gas mask during Iraq-Iran Civil WarIn September 2013, Russia, in collaboration with the United States, brokered an agreement under which Syria agreed to turn over its chemical weapons for destruction under UN supervision. These weapons amounted to around 1,000 tons of sarin, mustard gas and VX. Chlorine, the original WWI era poison gas, was exempted since chlorine gas has widespread use in industry. Many municipal waterworks, for example, uses liquid chlorine gas to chlorinate water supplies. Despite the agreement, however, there have been widespread reports that the Assad government has used canisters of chlorine gas in the barrel bombs that it uses to target civilians. There have also been unverified reports that the Assad government retained some stocks of sarin and VX gas.Poison gasses, not surprisingly, are popular among terrorist organizations. They are the cheapest and easiest weapons of mass destruction to produce. The Japanese group Aum Shinrikyo used sarin gas in an attack in Matsumoto, Japan on June 27, 1994. The following year, they released sarin gas into the Tokyo subway system. Russian Chechen and various Sunni jihadist groups in Iraq, including Islamic State (IS), have exploded tanks of chlorine gas, including blowing up tanker trucks full of liquid chlorine, as improvised weapons of mass destruction (IWMD).In addition, according to Pentagon sources, Islamic State has been producing and stockpiling mustard gas since 2015. There have been reports from Kurdish and other sources that Islamic State has fired artillery shells and mortar rounds that contained mustard gas. Follow up tests, however, have proven to be inconclusive. Nonetheless, Sleiman Daoud al-Atari, the recently captured head of Islamic State's chemical weapons program, has admitted to US interrogators that IS has amassed a stockpile of mustard gas, which it intends to deploy in the upcoming battle of Mosul.On Sept 12, 2016, US warplanes destroyed a pharmaceutical factory in Mosul that US Central Command believes had been converted into a chemical weapons manufacturing facility. There have also been persistent reports that IS has been working on developing other chemical agents in laboratories at the University of Mosul. Victims of a mustard gas attack by Syrian military forces, Ghouta, Syria August 27, 2013Mustard gas can be used both as an offensive weapon against advancing troops and, in large quantities, to create area denial zones that prevent the advance of Iraqi troops and force them into preselected attack routes set up as kill zones. In a briefing to the Pentagon, reported in military.com, Army Colonel John Dorrian confirmed that US forces anticipate that Islamic State fighters will use mustard gas, and possibly other chemical weapons, during the Battle for Mosul. He also confirmed that IS has dug tunnels to enable them to attack rear areas of the Iraqi forces. The US has already distributed some 50,000 kits of ""personal protective gear"" to Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Shiite militias, interestingly enough, do not have protective gear in the event of a chemical weapons attack, a factor that may limit their involvement in the Battle of Mosul. Iran, however, is believed to have such gear and could, in theory, supply it if it becomes necessary. Such an action, however, would further highlight Iran's role in arming the Shiite militias.With the exception of the Iraq-Iran war and the civil war in Syria, poison gas in general and mustard gas in particular has been largely absent from post WWI military conflict. After an absence of almost a century, mustard gas is about to return to the modern battlefield.See also: The Battle for Mosul"

Busy schedules and weekly routines have a tendency to put the brain on autopilot.,2016-10-01,2016-09-25-1474771633-7956570-10FundamentalTruthsWeForgetTooEasilyHP,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-25-1474771633-7956570-10FundamentalTruthsWeForgetTooEasilyHP-thumb,"It's surprising how easy it is to lose sight of the important things in life. Busy schedules and weekly routines have a tendency to put the brain on autopilot.Some of life's essential truths need repeating. Keep this list handy and give it a read any time you need a boost.1. Being busy does not equal being productive.Look at everyone around you. They all seem so busy -- running from meeting to meeting and firing off emails. Yet how many of them are really producing, really succeeding at a high level?Success doesn't come from movement and activity. It comes from focus--from ensuring that your time is used efficiently and productively.You get the same number of hours in the day as everyone else. Use yours wisely. After all, you're the product of your output, not your effort. Make certain your efforts are dedicated to tasks that get results.2. Great success is often preceded by failure.You will never experience true success until you learn to embrace failure. Your mistakes pave the way for you to succeed by revealing when you're on the wrong path.The biggest breakthroughs typically come when you're feeling the most frustrated and the most stuck (this was certainly the case with TalentSmart). It's this frustration that forces you to think differently, to look outside the box and see the solution that you've been missing.Success takes patience and the ability to maintain a good attitude even while suffering for what you believe in.3. Fear is the #1 source of regret.When it's all said and done, you will lament the chances you didn't take far more than you will your failures. Don't be afraid to take risks.I often hear people say, ""What's the worst thing that can happen to you? Will it kill you?"" Yet, death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you.The worst thing that can happen to you is allowing yourself to die inside while you're still alive.4. Your self-worth must come from within.When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself to others, you are no longer the master of your own destiny. When you feel good about something that you've done, don't allow anyone's opinions or accomplishments to take that away from you.While it's impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don't have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people's opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain--you're never as good or bad as they say you are.5. You're only as good as those you associate with.You should strive to surround yourself with people who inspire you, people who make you want to be better. And you probably do. But what about the people who drag you down? Why do you allow them to be a part of your life?Anyone who makes you feel worthless, anxious, or uninspired is wasting your time and, quite possibly, making you more like them. Life is too short to associate with people like this. Cut them loose.6. Life is short.None of us are guaranteed a tomorrow. Yet, when someone dies unexpectedly it causes us to take stock of our own life: what's really important, how we spend our time, and how we treat other people.Loss is a raw, visceral reminder of the frailty of life. It shouldn't be. Remind yourself every morning when you wake up that each day is a gift and you're bound to make the most of the blessing you've been given. The moment you start acting like life is a blessing is the moment it will start acting like one.After all, a great day begins with a great mindset.7. You don't have to wait for an apology to forgive.Life goes a lot smoother once you let go of grudges and forgive even those who never said they were sorry. Grudges let negative events from your past ruin today's happiness. Hate and anger are emotional parasites that destroy your joy in life. The negative emotions that come with holding on to a grudge create a stress response in your body, and holding on to stress can have devastating health consequences. When you forgive someone, it doesn't condone their actions; it simply frees you from being their eternal victim.8. You're living the life you've created.You are not a victim of circumstance. No one can force you to make decisions and take actions that run contrary to your values and aspirations.The circumstances you're living in today are your own--you created them. Likewise, your future is entirely up to you. If you're feeling stuck, it's probably because you're afraid to take the risks necessary to achieve your goals and live your dreams.When it's time to take action, remember that it's always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than at the top of one you don't.9. Live in the moment.You can't reach your full potential until you learn to live your life in the present.No amount of guilt can change the past, and no amount of anxiety can change the future. It's impossible to be happy if you're constantly somewhere else, unable to fully embrace the reality (good or bad) of this very moment.To help yourself live in the moment, you must do two things:1) Accept your past. If you don't make peace with your past, it will never leave you and, in doing so, it will create your future.2) Accept the uncertainty of the future. Worry has no place in the here and now. As Mark Twain once said, ""Worrying is like paying a debt you don't owe.""10. Change is inevitable -- embrace it.Only when you embrace change can you find the good in it. You need to have an open mind and open arms if you're going to recognize, and capitalize on, the opportunities that change creates.You're bound to fail when you keep doing the same things you always have in the hope that ignoring change will make it go away.After all, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. If you struggle with this, an emotional intelligence test should help.Life doesn't stop for anyone. When things are going well, appreciate them and enjoy them, as they are bound to change. If you are always searching for something more, something better, that you think is going to make you happy, you'll never be present enough to enjoy the great moments before they're gone.Bringing it all togetherAre there important truths that I've forgotten? Please share them in the comments section. I learn from you just as much as you learn from me."

Rouhani does not need anymore to use a softer, diplomatic tone, smiles, or hide as a wolf in sheep's clothing. At the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, Rouhani's messages were different from the former ones. He shifted to totally reiterate messages of IRGC and Khamenei. He promoted the following agenda and narratives:• Depicting Iran as the victim of terrorism and frontrunner of fighting against terrorism • Demonizing Iran's ""enemies"" by describing them as contributors to extremism and terrorism • Blaming the US for not adhering to the terms of the nuclear deal • Attempting to attract more investors in order to bring more revenues for IRGC and Khamenei. Through the first narrative, Iran claims to be benefiting the West by fighting terrorism (ignoring the fact that Iran is listed as top state sponsor of terrorism by the State Department). This narrative pressures the West to turn a blind eye on Iran's transgressions., and buttress Iran's argument that the international community needs to support the Assad. By blaming the US, Iran is also attempting to get more concessions from Washington, send a message to the Iranian people that the US remains untrustworthy, and tell the Iranian people that the US is the reason why they have not seen the fruit of the lifting of sanctions.Rouhani's message at the 71st UNGA is different from his previous ones because Iran has achieved its objectives of having the crippling sanctions lifted. The US and the West have lost their political leverages in the UNSC by the lifting of sanctions. Rouhani does not to be hiding as wolf in sheep's clothing anymore, he does need to employ higher level of a softer, diplomatic tone, smiles, or deliver a message that differs from that of Iran's hardliners. Rouhnai is tactically shifting his message to resemble that of the hardline spectrum of Iran. After all, he also needs the blessings of the hardliners, particularly Khamenei, in order to increase his odds of winning Iran's upcoming presidential race. ______________________For more details and nuances you can read full versionon Here.

Designed and built by architects Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and Gianfranco Franchini, the massive arts complex was renovated in 2000, and won the Pritzker Prize in 2007, as its jury noted that the Pompidou ""revolutionized museums, transforming what had once been elite monuments into popular places of social and cultural exchange, woven into the heart of the city."" The Artist.Who does not know René Magritte? The Belgian philosopher/surrealist/manipulative artist who gave us a laugh with a chicken looking at a soft-boiled egg, or a hat without a head resting on a stiff shirt collar. Or perhaps it was a green apple face under a bowler hat, or maybe the multiple umbrella men floating in the sky above a city.Whatever it is you remember most about his art, it is surely a dream-like image, a fiction, a distortion of the senses, a naïve and elaborate visual made of everyday things and objects. Magritte was good at that, a prince of silly matters, a master of deception and a player of subtlety.The often enchanting world of Magritte offers adults and children alike a new way to look at art - a non-serious view of what a fantasy universe would be like. Magritte and Dali were both painters of perfection in a very silly kind of style, and their polished work seduced and endure in the hearts of their viewers as cherished pieces of wonderful memories.""Magritte engaged in a sort of theoretical battle with philosophers,"" said Didier Ottinger, the curator of the exhibition at Beaubourg, ""to prove that pictures can portray thoughts on the same level as words could.""Magritte (1898-1967) lived all his life, and died, in Belgium, except for three years spent in France among other painters.

400,400,GREEN,Sustainable Businesses Beyond Decision 2016,"Gay Browne, ContributorEnvironmental advocate, humanitarian, and founder of Greenopia...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sustainable-businesses-be_b_12273996.html,,2016-10-01,2016-10-01-1475280427-858899-shutterstock_113738845.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-01-1475280427-858899-shutterstock_113738845-thumb.jpg," This week I had the great pleasure to attend SUSTYBIZ16, a three-day event organized by the American Sustainable Business Council and held in Washington DC. Having been in the sustainable business world for over ten years, I knew that the ASBC and its members represented over 200,000 businesses and 325,000 business executives, owners, and investors and that they advocated at both the federal and state level for a broad range of policy initiatives that promote a sustainable economy, but I had not had the opportunity to engage with them. It was when Greg Wendt, a good friend and Founder and Advisor of the Green Economy Think Tank told me about this year's topic, ""Looking Beyond the Elections"" that I was intrigued to the point of jumping on a plane and heading to DC. The theme of this year's conference was to explore what progress we can expect on key sustainability policy issues over the next few years. While sustainability should be a bi-partisan issue, this remains a gray area depending on who the new president is as well as in the composition of Congress and the U.S. Senate. The outcome is critical to me as Greenopia will be in serious trouble if government regulations fail to support the growth of sustainable business practices. We are a company of over 110,000 eco-friendly businesses and growing. Most of these businesses are small to midsize. The better their access to capital and regulatory support, the less of a struggle it is for them to conduct eco-friendly businesses or as I like to say, do business with a green heart.  The first full day I had the honor of meeting and hearing speak several of the ASBC board members including Richard Eidlin, VP Policy and Campaigns, David Levine, co-founder and President, and David Brodwin, VP Media and Communications. I heard Jeffrey Hollender, co-founder and former CEO and founder of Seventh Generation discuss climate change and food justice with US Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Pat Heffernan, Board Member and Founder and President of Marketing Partners speak on a panel on another issue near and dear to my heart, Women and Equity.What impressed me about each one of them, as with everyone else I met and heard speak at the conference, was that this was a group that was passionately committed in that ALL businesses should operate in a sustainable manner, both in front and back end practices. This was a sentiment that was not only echoed by the conference attendees but also the politicians who stopped by to show their support. It was quite thrilling to be among these eco-pioneers and to listen to their stories of both stresses and successes.   But despite the feel good attitude that was pervasive throughout that first day, I could not ignore this gnawing feeling of impatience. Although the ASBC, Greenopia and other sustainable business associations like us have been positively impacting many businesses across the US, there are still hundreds of thousands more to be reached with this messaging. Given the LOHAS (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability) market generates over $300 billion in annual revenue, it astounds me that more businesses are not focused on targeting this growing consumer base who seek low carbon footprints and value sustainable practices.The band of businesses at SUSTYBIZ16 had started as outliers but now really need to be the norm if we are going to slow down climate change. All I could think of as I went to bed that night was how urgent this mission is and what a massive opportunity for green growth it represents!The second day was spent divided between Capitol Hill, lobbying in support of Senator Dianne Feinstein's new Personal Care Products Safety Act, and the White House where we sat in session in one of the meeting halls listening to the various departments explain what they had accomplished and what they were planning to hand off as their green recommendations to the next administration. Zaid Hassan, from the Office of Public Engagement and International Affairs, ran the meeting and kept us on schedule through the various departmental reports. As much as my spirits might have lagged the day before, they were lifted up at hearing all the good things the current administration has accomplished during the past eight years, like the Clean Power Plan that puts our nation on the path toward a 30 percent reduction in carbon pollution from the power sector by 2030, or America's Great Outdoor's Act, the most extensive expansion of land and water conservation in more than a generation, designating more than 2 million acres of federal wilderness, thousands of miles of trails, and protecting more than 1,000 miles of rivers.After two full days of intensive meetings with new people and absorbing mountains of information, I left DC exhausted but I also left with a renewed faith that the Obama Administration was doing everything in its power to secure that the rules supporting green businesses would continue far in the future, no matter what changes occur in the oval office. Just as the founders assured liberty and justice for all, their goal is for ALL businesses to have the freedom to operate in a sustainable manner. This might appear to be a lofty goal, but it's one that's imperative if we all want to survive on this planet and live with green hearts."

The march passes the tourist attraction of Hollywood and Highland where, by coincidence, police shot and killed a man in the intersection. Police say that he had a knife.

The 808 drums bang heavily in your car speakers as a bombastic voice speaks rhythmically over the beat, creating a colorful blend that dances in your ear drums. You vibe, and you start to feel empowered and often hyped from the energy inserted into the track from the producer and the artists that is heightened by the sound engineers. Hip hop music is a soothing, jarring, joyful, somber, and transporting soundtrack to your life. You love hip hop.   On a hot summer day, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre's The Chronic can feel as warm as the cool, calm sunny breeze that glides across your face. Listening to Ice Cube's ""It Was A Good Day"" is like that needed exclamation on a day where catastrophe was avoided and triumph was an accentuation. Chicago artist Twista transports you to the times of Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, and a little Aaliyah to set your backyard barbecue party off you have planned with friends. Lil Durk's ""Dis Ain't U Want"" serves as a boost during the times you feel tried by a boss, coworker, or a friend, and you need a reminder that you are not a push over. On gloomy day, as water drops keep you cooped inside your home, you smile as you sing ""Beep Beep"" as you empathize with Missy Elliot because you too can't stand the rain. After a bad break up, leaving you sulking, staring at your exes' Facebook photos, you gain strength from Jay Z in having ""ninety-nine problems"" but your relationship no longer being one. Biggie Smalls's ""Juicy"" gives you that needed inspiration with the lines ""It was all a dream. I used to read Word Up magazine."" You jump in excitement with all of your friends and sing ""We gon be alright"" with Kendrick Lamar no matter your skin color because you empathize with the fusion of voice and instrumentation in that moment. You even sing passionately, ""Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents"" with Tupac Shakur because part of you can relate to times of struggle. You delight in the beneficial exchange of musical pleasure for a temporarily vicarious empathetic moment. And underneath the music, you are aware of hip hop being predominately made by people of color. You are aware of the struggles that some of your favorite artists have come from and the cycles of mass incarceration and violence that plague their communities. You know that black people are being disproportionately victims of police brutality. You have heard the names of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, and Philando Castile. Your friends of color speak of their hurtful experiences, yet you only vibe with strangers on records who tell similar stories over pulsating beats -- you love hip hop.Yet, when the record stops, in the middle of the darkness of the silent moments of life, you emulate the muted tones. You accept and enforce the dominant idea that black lives are less valuable and that black lives being of lesser value is due to the actions of black people. To say that black lives matter creates inner dissonance, something not experienced with the distance of empathizing an experience over music. You love hip hop, so how can black lives not matter?"

Image courtesy Girlfriend Collective This summer Girlfriend Collective launched the kind of campaign that propelled them into the headlines before they'd even sent out their first pair of leggings. By offering an eco-friendly sustainable product for free they caught the eyes of fashionistas all over the world. The sleek, black leggings made from recycled micro polyester and spandex were offered for free minus cost of shipping. This blend of eco and style helped bring awareness to more than just self-care but environmental-care. Though the fight for more sustainable apparel has been going on for a while in the fashion world, it seems that sportswear could be the key to giving it the cool factor it's been missing. The market is set to generate a revenue of $184.6 billion by 2020, growing at 4.3 percent per year. The recent rise of athleisure has also brought more attention to sportswear making it cool to be worn for more than just workouts. This growth isn't going unnoticed as more designers are entering the sportswear market. As they acknowledge the style potential within sportswear this combination could bring more attention to sustainable fabrics and move away from hazardous textiles like leather and fur.What is sustainability?  Sustainability is the use of eco-friendly textiles that are less harmful to the environment or depleting of its natural resources. In a time of fast-fashion and quick trends, the consumer has started to upcycle in an effort to be eco-friendlier. The benefit of sportswear is that it can be reversible, quick-drying and created with recycled materials like water bottles and plastic bags. Just this year there was a sneaker made without a footprint proving that style doesn't have to mean pollution. Eco initiatives like the Fashion Revolution, Apparel Coalition and the Green Carpet Challenge have been working to open the dialogue on this topic within the fashion industry. In 2011, Greenpeace started their Detox challenge asking brands to sign on and decrease the use of phthalates, perfluorinated chemicals, nonylphenol, and cadmium. These chemicals are hazardous and cause toxic pollution harming not just the planet but those who make the clothes by being exposed to them. Brands that have signed on are H&M, Zara and Valentino though Puma leads the way in their efforts.Sportswear companies and their corporate social responsibilities Sportswear apparel brands have been making the top of eco lists done by Fashion Revolution, Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, Rank a Brand, Greenpeace's ""Detox My Fashion"" and Project Just. Brands like Puma, Patagonia, New Balance, Athleta, and Adidas get praise for their transparency, innovation and initiative though there is always room for improvement. On the other side of the spectrum popular brands like DKNY, Marc Jacobs, and Michael Kors ranked towards the bottom of Rank a Brand's 2014 Feel Good Fashion report. Both the sportswear and luxury apparel markets can do better but the former seems to lead the way in innovation. Although many athleticwear companies are making the tops of these lists, Nike surprisingly is at the bottom. After noticing this, Nike released their plans to run 100 percent on renewable energy by the end of 2025. Ranking companies through an objective lens increases corporate social responsibility as proven by Nike's recent efforts.  Graph from the Fashion Revolution Transparency Index.

In a recent interview with PAPER magazine, Joshua Katcher, a designer, professor and advocate for ethical fashion gave his opinion as to why sustainability isn't sexy just yet. ""Fashion is about identity, and you identify with either the honest true story of how something is made or with the marketing of mythology. It's rarely just about the garment. With brand name things it's about the lifestyle surrounding it."" What makes the luxury textiles sexy is not just their feel but the mystique behind them. Transparency of a company's ethical and environmental efforts aren't always at the forefront of the consumer's mind which is why many high end companies like Chanel and Fendi get away with it. After Chanel's Spring/Summer 2016 Haute Couture show that was inspired by sustainability, Lagerfeld stated that ""at the moment, sustainability is part of an expression of our times."" His remarks deem the eco-friendly movement as a fad rather than a serious initiative. Instead of facing the eco issues, fashion houses favor greenwashing their sites.

From the staple leather jacket to the current must-have fur-lined Gucci slippers, the fashion world can't get enough. However, the chemical processing that they go through creates damaging pollution, which isn't the case with sportswear. While leather is by nature biodegradable being a by-product of the agriculture industry the chemical processing it goes through makes it long-lasting and thereby harder to recycle. With fur not only is the processing hazardous but farming is damaging as well. In order to farm 1 kilogram of mink fur an estimated 110 kilograms of carbon dioxide is produced. In order to farm fur 20 times more Greenhouse gasses are needed than other textiles. Activewear however can be made from recycled materials and organic cotton.

In a recent study by NPD, millennials are said to prefer sports bras over regular bras for their comfort, style and coverage. Even though athleisure is declining in popularity as of late it did help normalize wearing workout gear for more than exercise. Sportswear companies understand that whether it's sports bras, leggings, tanks or shorts they can be reversible, made from recycled materials and fast drying. Companies like Cozy Orange, Columbia and Patagonia work with textile manufacturers to create eco-friendly products. Even in the world of professional sports, the NBA is also decreasing their carbon footprint by teaming up with Adidas for Revolution 30. Since 2010 they've been using apparel with 60 percent recycled material. They're not alone, in 2014 the NFL team The Lions teamed up with Unifi and started wearing jerseys made with Repreve fabric.There is no doubt that these industries have a large influence among consumers. Other recent developments in this market include Columbia's Outdry Extreme Eco Rain Shell jacket dubbed the most sustainable jacket in the world. Moving forward The sustainability movement is in full swing as more non-athleticwear companies are taking part. Fast-fashion retailer Zara recently launched Join Life a new sustainable line after also debuting a new activewear collection in March.

Because that's what Nitty Gritty Dirt Band leader and co-founder Jeff Hanna calls them.When the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band started playing together in 1966, the band's unique brand of music didn't have a name.In fact, it is the founding members of NGDB that helped create what we call Americana music today by mixing elements of bluegrass, folk, mountain music, country and western and rock and roll into a sound that was uniquely, you guessed it, American.""Even though, when we started in 1966 -- me, Jimmy and John - we lived by the beach in Southern California, we were drawn to folk music. We called ourselves 'folk puppies.' We weren't into surf music. We were lucky enough to get to see the Dillards, the Greenbriar Boys, even Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs,"" he said in a phone interview from Raleigh, North Carolina, where the band was preparing for tonight's first-ever appearance at the International Bluegrass Music Association's annual gathering.""This was the stuff,"" Hanna continued. ""Geographically we were fortunate that we were in the right place. We couldn't be in Deep Gap (North Carolina) hearing this music on a porch. The music came to us.""Five decades later, those influences and many more can be heard on the band's ""Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Friends - Circlin' Back: Celebrating 50 Years,"" a CD/DVD recorded live at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, the mother church of country music. It was released on Sept. 30 on the band's own NGDB Records LLC, distributed by Warner Music Nashville. From country classics to deep cuts, the tracklist finds Hanna (guitars/vocals) and bandmates Jimmie Fadden (drums/harmonica/vocals), Bob Carpenter (keyboards/accordion/vocals) and John McEuen (banjo/fiddle/guitar/mandolin) swapping harmonies, trading solos, and shining new light on a catalog of vital, vibrant music.Released in 1972, just six years after the group formed in Southern California, NGBD's ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" paired the young band with legends like Roy Acuff, Doc Watson, Earl Scruggs and Mother Maybelle Carter.Hanna says now the members of NGDB are bringing up the next generation of musicians.""Circling back, it's a subtle reference to touch on the 'Circle' projects,"" Hanna says. ""These folks are all our buddies. We have never recorded together with Jackson Browne even though I think we were the first band to record, 'These Days,"" and he was among the first songwriters we knew.""Other buddies joining them on the new album are John Prine, Sam Bush, Vince Gill, Jerry Jeff Walker, Alison Krauss, Rodney Crowell, Byron House, Jerry Douglas, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer (and early Dirt Band member) Browne and longtime member Jimmy Ibbotson, who left the band about a decade ago.""Sam, Jerry and Vince, they're our younger brothers and Alison is our kid sister,"" Hanna says with a laugh. ""Someone asked if we just called the most famous people we knew to make this record but we just called our friends together. They've all had a significant contribution to our journey. When we were playing at the Ryman, Sam said, 'It's like the Nitty Gritty E-Street Band.' ""Hanna added that Douglas added, ""It was like a 'Circle' record, only quicker.' We were in rehearsal for two days and then went to the Ryman and played. Lights, camera, action. I'm elated, relieved and proud of this record.""In addition to the band's new release, John McEuen also released his solo project on Sept. 30, ""Made In Brooklyn,"" including music from Warren Zevon's ""Excitable Boy"" (reworked into a bluegrass murder ballad) and featuring John Cowan, Steve Martin and John Carter Cash, among many other artists.Hanna says it was just a coincidence both albums dropped on the same day and while they were at IBMA. ""It's a good record,"" he says of his bandmate's new release.While he has performed at IBMA when it was in Nashville, Hanna said the band has never performed as part of the event until tonight.""In 2002, the Circle Vol. 3 won IBMA's best recorded event,"" Hanna said. ""I am very proud of that.""Want to read more stories like this? Visit https://musicreporterblog.wordpress.com/"

The last time I ran a marathon I was living in Monterrey, Mexico. I wasn't out of the closet and so signed up to run a marathon because it seemed like a good excuse to not have to go out on the weekends.It became too exhausting pretending to hit on women, trying to be someone I wasn't. Running a marathon was a reason to avoid being set up and having to answer questions about why I didn't have a girlfriend. ""Sorry guys, can't go out tonight. I have to train in the morning,"" became my saving grace. I didn't realize it at the time, but I hadn't really signed up to run a marathon at all. I had signed up for something that kept me running from myself.My aunt used to tell me, ""You're going to move to Mexico and fall and love with a beautiful Mexican woman and never come back."" Well, part of that is true. I did fall in love, but it wasn't with a beautiful Mexican woman. I came out while living in Mexico. I remember going to the internet cafes that seemed to be on every corner where I lived. I used to research what being gay was and if there was something I could easily do to not be. I never found anything very helpful, so I remember setting up a fake email account to anonymously email my old pastor about his take on being gay. I told him about ""a friend"" I knew who was attracted to men and so wanted to get his perspective. I knew what I heard growing up, but I thought maybe he'd give me a different answer. Instead, he sent me an article from a Christian magazine about a man who had ""homosexual desires."" This man was married to a beautiful wife and had two beautiful children. He was successful in keeping his homosexual desires at bay for more than six years and each night, he and his wife would get on their knees and pray, thanking God for delivering him from his sin.I remember reading the article and thinking how awful it sounded. I remember thinking about the man's wife and how women in general need to feel loved. They need to feel attractive and desired and I wondered if he was ever really able to do that for her. Sure, they had two kids and a seemingly successful marriage by my old pastor's standards, but how did she feel in their marriage. Then I had an image of a scenario in my mind. I envisioned the two parents at a soccer meeting after school. One of their kids was on the soccer team, so I thought what if one day, a new father who had just moved to town brought his kid to a meeting. As he walked in, what if just for a split second the father who every night was on his knees with his wife in prayer, glanced at the new father. Just for a split second, he checked him out. And in that split second, his wife noticed. I thought about how it would make her feel. A marriage has to be built on trust and in that moment, her trust in him would be fractured.I realized I wouldn't ever be able to marry a woman for the very reason it could cause another life to feel uncertain about the one in which they lived. One of the fundamental needs all humans share is safety and thinking about that man's wife, I couldn't imagine she ever truly felt safe in her marriage. I decided to sign up for the L.A. Marathon in March 2017 for a few different reasons. Speaking to a group of seventh graders this week while on a PFLAG panel, I witnessed a young girl come out to her class for the first time. Through her tears, I saw her strength. I was reminded about the power we have in sharing authentically from our hearts and how no one can ever take authentic power away. Sometimes, we'll go to pretty far lengths to avoid looking at our lives and to keep something about ourselves hidden. We might stay in a marriage we don't feel safe in, we might move to another country to come out of the closet, or we might run a marathon in hopes of continuing to run from ourselves. And sometimes, we'll do something as a symbolic gesture to show ourselves that how we did it before was simply because we didn't know any better. By doing it again, we're showing ourselves it's okay now. That no matter what, it will be okay.I've decided to run in the L.A. Marathon for anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide something or couldn't fully be themselves. I want to run 26.2 miles as a symbolic gesture for the woman and her husband who got on their knees every night and prayed. I want to run for the little girl who came out to her class this week and for any other young person struggling to come to terms with themselves. And most importantly, I want to run for myself. This time, I'm not running to run away. I'll be running to run with, alongside and towards. And this time, training won't be an excuse to hide, but a reminder of what it is to be free. If there's something you're trying to avoid or run from, trust me, from someone who has crossed the finish line, with arms high in the air, it's going to be okay.People may not agree or will question you, but it's never about them. It's always about what's best for you and your life. Keep going towards yourself; you won't ever go wrong. And trust that no matter what, it WILL be okay."

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb82db32400005100573980.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been a disgrace to his party and an embarrassment to the nation. He has consistently demonstrated that he does not have the temperament, judgment, background or humility to lead our country. For more that a year, the Trump campaign has been run like a reality show. It has been filled with drama, controversy and interesting characters that often mask over the weaknesses of its golden-haired impresario. Despite his many apparent flaws, Trump was able to defeat all of his GOP opponents, every one of whom is more qualified than he to be president.Trump's campaign road show travels from town to town playing before large crowds that enthusiastically cheer his boisterous rhetoric and divisive bombast. He plays on the fears and concerns of his supporters like Keith Richards plays his Telecaster. ""You can't always get what you want,"" can be heard over speaker systems at the end of his rallies. And Trump has many believing he may be what they need.Trump needs this adulation and praise to feed his huge ego. He is narcissistic and self-centered. In his mind the world revolves around him. He also thinks he is smarter than anyone else, so he believes he is never wrong. Trump reminds everyone that he studied business at the Wharton School. He prides himself on being the best negotiator, and the outcome of every transaction must result in a big win for Trump. He lives in a cocoon, in a bubble, surrounded by loyal and obedient staff members who tell him what he wants to hear, and who carry out his orders.His attacks on his opposition are often personal and childish. ""Lying"" Ted Cruz, ""Little"" Marco Rubio and ""Crooked"" Hillary Clinton are names he proudly spends time thinking up. He mocks and derisively brands his opponents much the same as a schoolyard bully. You are either all in with Trump, or you are the enemy and subject to his ridicule. As a result, Trump lives in an alternate reality.Trump performed poorly at the first presidential debate, held at Hofstra University last Monday. He was unprepared, often uncomfortable, and he seemed to lose his stamina toward the end of his encounter with Hillary Clinton. But he believes he won the confrontation. He cites unscientific internet polls, done immediately following the debate, as proof that he won, and ignores scientific polls by reputable organizations that show Clinton clobbered him. Then there is the matter of the 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Clinton referred to her during the debate, saying of Trump, ""He called this woman Miss Piggy. Then he called her Miss Housekeeping because she was Latina."" Clinton got under Trump's thin skin, and he has since been obsessed with Machado. On Friday, in a flurry of posts on Twitter that began at 3:30am, Trump attacked Machado and Clinton. One read, ""Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?"" This may have been the first time a presidential candidate referred to a sex tape, in fact, one that may not exist. A former Miss Universe has shaken Trump's alternate reality. His campaign, its staff, the media, and the world have been consumed by Trump's Twitter tirades. Now BuzzFeed News has uncovered a soft-core documentary, entitled ""Playboy Video Centerfold 2000,"" in which Trump has a brief cameo appearance. Meanwhile, Trump has started talking about President Bill Clinton's affairs, and has labeled Hillary Clinton an enabler. Of course, Trump has been married three times. During his campaign the all-knowing Donald has insulted women, Mexicans, Muslims, immigrants, and African Americans. He refuses to properly apologize because he believes he is right. And he claims he did a service for the nation by forcing President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate. He refuses to release his tax returns or to be fully transparent with Americans, and he uses his charities as an ATM machine. Trump is unprepared and unfit to be president, and unworthy of the office. Yet most leading members of the Republican Party stand by and defend Trump, even his lies, his distortions, his insults and his bullying. They think that if Trump is elected president they can control him, that he will do what they say, that he will play by their rules. But this is the man who announced to the world, ""I alone can fix it.""This past week may have been an important turning point in the national election. It may be the beginning of the end of the Donald Trump Reality Show."

The man has no discipline, no sense of decorum, and no compassion for others (let's not forget his signature line, ""You're fired""). Indeed, he seems to revel in humiliating others. This was mildly amusing when he was taking on equals on the stage during the Republican primaries, but it's disturbing in the extreme to see him bullying the little guys and gals for whom he's supposedly a champion.So many sane people and major newspapers have gone on record as being against Trump that there's little I can add. Sadly, Trump's followers seem unperturbed and undisturbed no matter his insults and tyrannical behavior.All I can say is this: Trump is not the kind of man my father taught me to be. My dad, who fought forest fires in Oregon in the CCC, a veteran of an armored division in World War II, a city firefighter for more than 30 years until his retirement, treated people fairly and squarely. He was humble about himself and considerate to others. I can't recall him insulting others, certainly not in the intentional and hurtful way that Trump directs at others. Trump is especially fond of attacking women or minorities or anyone he sees as vulnerable, the very opposite of my dad's code of behavior.Don't get me wrong: my dad wasn't perfect. He had his faults. But his faults were not directed at others; he didn't try to demean or diminish other people, as Trump so obviously enjoys doing. Unlike Trump, my dad wasn't boastful; indeed, three favorite sayings of his were: ""Still waters run deep,"" ""Don't toot your own horn,"" and ""The empty barrel makes the most noise.""You were right, Dad. The rushing nonsense from Trump exhibits his shallowness; the man is constantly tweeting his own horn; and, like the empty vessel that he is, he makes an awful amount of noise.Trump: Not the kind of man my father would respect; not the kind of man our country needs.Dump chump Trump.Astore, a retired lieutenant colonel (USAF) and history professor, blogs at Bracing Views."

Parker was acquitted in 2001. Celestin was convicted, though he later won an appeal. The rape charges resurfaced in August, when Variety reported that the woman who accused Parker and Celestin dropped out of Penn State and died by suicide in 2012, which her family claims was a result of the trauma she experienced after the assault.In a teaser released this week by CBS News, Parker told correspondent Anderson Cooper that he didn’t feel guilty. He was quoted in a press release from the network saying that he would not apologize. “I was falsely accused …I went to court …I was vindicated,” Parker is quoted as saying during the interview. “I feel terrible that this woman isn’t here … her family had to deal with that, but as I sit here, an apology is ― no.”When asked if Parker felt he did something “morally wrong,” the filmmaker said, “As a Christian man, just being in that situation, yeah, sure. I’m 36 years old right now, and my faith is very important to me. So looking back at that lens, I definitely feel like, it’s not the lens I had when I was 19 years old.”On Thursday, the day CBS released the teaser of Parker’s “60 Minutes” interview, the sister of the woman who accused him of rape penned a powerful op-ed in Variety harshly criticizing the actor.

In a two-way match-up that excludes third-party candidates, Clinton still maintains her 7-point advantage. She’s ahead by the same margin in New Hampshire, taking 42 percent of the vote to Trump’s 35 percent, according to a WBUR poll. In Florida, Clinton leads Trump by 4 points, 46 percent to 42 percent, according to a Mason-Dixon poll. And in Nevada, a Suffolk University poll finds Clinton with a 6-point advantage over Trump, 44 to 38 percent. Clinton has opened up her lead in the swing state by 4 points since a mid-August Suffolk poll.National polls released earlier in the week also signal good news for Clinton. The first set of post-debate polls found Clinton holding a 3- to 5-point advantage over Trump. According to the HuffPost Pollster average, which aggregates publicly available polls, Clinton is ahead of Trump in three out of the four states: by 4 points in Michigan, 5 points in New Hampshire and 2 points in Florida. In Nevada, the candidates are tied at 42 percent.The HuffPost Pollster national chart has the race at 48 percent to 43 percent, with Clinton in the lead. However, it’s still too early to say if Clinton’s post-debate bounce will last. A clearer picture should emerge as more polls are released in the coming days.The Detroit News-WDIV poll surveyed 500 likely Michigan voters on Sept 27-28.

Using the National Institutes of Health body mass index calculator, Trump’s 236 pounds (also according to Bornstein’s note) would have given him a BMI of 30.3 – just over the threshold qualifying him as “obese.”The calculation using the 6-foot-3 height gives Trump a BMI of 29.5 – close to “obese,” but still technically just “overweight.”(Even the 6-foot-2 claim, though, could be a stretch. Compared to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is 6-foot-4, Trump is significantly shorter, perhaps three inches or more.)The Trump campaign did not reply to Huffington Post queries about the candidate’s height.Of course, the even better news for Trump may have been in an earlier letter from Bornstein. A note released on Dec. 4, 2015, said: “Over the past twelve months, he has lost at least 15 pounds.”That was the same letter in which Bornstein said: “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”"

The results of the study from the Pew Research Center ― which reflect responses from a survey conducted among 4,538 black, white and hispanic adults between Aug. 16 and Sept. 12 ― show that America’s assessment of law enforcement falls heavily along racial lines. These responses come amid heavy racial tensions in recent weeks over the police killings of black men as well as the ongoing discussion around the systemic oppression of minorities in America. Here are four revealing facts from the study that show where white and black Americans stand when it comes to policing: 1. Black people are nearly half less as likely as white people to have a positive view on the performance of their local police. Overall, about a third of Americans say they have confidence in their local police departments but black Americans express significantly higher levels of skepticism. According to the study, 75 percent of white people say police in their community do an excellent or good job at using the right amount of force for each situation and that they treat racial or ethnic groups equally. However, 33 percent of black Americans believe cops use the right amount of force and 35 percent say they treat all racial or ethnic groups equally. As for their take on how local police departments hold officers accountable over actions of misconduct, 70 percent of white people feel these departments do a good or excellent job while only 31 percent of black people feel the same. 2. Black and white Americans have dramatically different views on how they interpret police killings of black victims.Forty-four percent of white people view fatal police encounters with black victims as isolated incidents while only 18 percent of black people feel the same. A large majority of black people, 79 percent, believe these deaths are part of a broader problem within policing, which is a shared belief among 66 percent of hispanics, the study found. 3. White people are more likely to say protests are a result of anti-police bias while more black people say the demonstrations are because of demands for police accountability. A large majority of the public, regardless of race, say that a great deal or some of the motivation for the protests that have unfolded after police killings of black lives are because of a long-standing bias against the police (79 percent) as well as a desire to help hold police accountable for their actions (65 percent). However, when broken down along racial lines, a large number of white people (85 percent) believe the protests were prompted by an antipathy towards the police while a majority of black people (79 percent) say the protests are to help ensure accountability against officers. 4. A majority of Americans favor the use of body cameras and believe they help make police act more responsibly. An overwhelming majority of Americans, 93 percent, believe body cameras, which are used to record a cop’s interactions with citizens, are useful. Many Americans also believe that body cams would help make an officer act more responsibly, which includes a tally of 67 percent of white people, 60 percent of black people and 74 percent of Hispanics who claim to feel this way.

The requests, sent this week to acting DEA Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, build on a similar move in the House.“Given the long reported history of Kratom use, coupled with the public’s sentiment that it is a safe alternative to prescription opioids, we believe using the regular review process would provide for a much-needed discussion among all stakeholders,” reads a letter written by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and signed by Sens.

In a notice published in the Federal Register at the end of August, the DEA claimed that kratom, an herb made from the leaves of Mitragyna speciosa, a Southeast Asian tree related to coffee, poses an “imminent hazard to the public safety” and should therefore be placed in Schedule I as soon as the end of September. Drugs in this category include heroin and LSD and are considered to have no known medical benefit and a high potential for abuse.A separate letter, sent to Rosenberg on Thursday by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and signed by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Wyden, also calls out the DEA for moving so swiftly to ban kratom.“We are concerned that the 30-day comment period for such a proposed regulatory action is not a sufficient amount of time on a drug that, according to recent scientific studies, may be an effective substance to help combat the opioid epidemic,” the senators write.Anecdotal evidence and emerging scientific research suggests kratom can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including chronic pain, anxiety, depression and opioid addiction. Booker’s letter notes that a group of 11 scientists from “well-respected research institutions in the U.S.” wrote Congress earlier this month to express “grave concern” about the DEA’s proposed action.Kratom works by activating opioid receptors in the brain. And while most narcotic opioids have sedative qualities that can lead to respiratory depression and death when taken in excess, kratom is a mild stimulant in low to moderate doses.But in justifying its intent to ban kratom, the DEA focused exclusively on isolated reports of abuse and harm linked to the herb, which critics say are misleading outliers. The agency also notes that because the herbal supplement hasn’t been approved as a medicine under any federal regulatory process, it doesn’t accept any claims about its benefits.The federal government offered no period for public comment ahead of the announcement, and kratom supporters said the news took them by surprise. The ban was initially scheduled to take place as early as Friday, but amid widespread backlash from users, drug policy reform advocates and now members of Congress, such immediate action appears unlikely.In Hatch’s letter, the senators say that scheduling decisions like this must allow for the “full engagement of consumers, researchers, health professionals, law enforcement officials, and other stakeholders.” They also rebuff the DEA for making a unilateral push to enact a prohibition on an herb.“The Congress granted emergency scheduling authority to the DEA based on the need for law enforcement interdiction of new and previously unknown illegal synthetic street drugs that result in injuries and death,” they write. “The use of this emergency authority for a natural substance is unprecedented, so it is important to determine whether the circumstances here necessitate a jump to Schedule I.”The DEA has the power to make emergency scheduling decisions under the Controlled Substances Act. In 2012, Congress enhanced that authority as part of legislation meant to address a spate of emerging synthetic drugs. But in this case, the DEA is targeting two naturally occurring alkaloids in kratom, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Though some more controversial kratom products have been known to mimic synthetic drugs through packaging or marketing, many users who rely on the herb for treatment buy it as a powder made from pure crushed leaves. They and all kratom users would likely become felons if the DEA’s action goes through as planned. Kratom advocates are hopeful that congressional oversight will bring more clarity to the process and expose the DEA’s war on kratom as misguided.“We applaud Senator Hatch for taking the lead on this and hope to get some real answers as to why the DEA believes kratom should be a Schedule I controlled substance,” said Susan Ash, president and founder of the American Kratom Association, a nonprofit that works with consumers, in a statement to The Huffington Post. “We believe the facts and science needed to back up such an aggressive move simply don’t exist.” Hatch, a well-known ally of the nutritional supplement industry, has regularly defended “natural” medicine in Congress, a cause that has attracted criticism among those concerned about the current lack of regulation in the market. As an herbal supplement, kratom has gone largely uncontrolled at the federal level. But over the past few years, states have begun to consider age restrictions and labeling requirements, among other regulatory measures. Although these efforts have received support from some kratom groups, a federal ban would put an end to such nuanced and cooperative efforts.The response in the Senate comes days after the House made a similar request for the DEA to delay its kratom ban. In a letter sent on Monday, a bipartisan group of more than 50 representatives called on Rosenberg to give Congress time to “engage consumers, researchers, and other stakeholders, in keeping with well-established protocol for such matters.” They also cited a number of recent or ongoing studies on kratom that suggest the herb has potential as a step-down or maintentance treatment for opioid addicts and could aid with the development of safer alternatives to prescription painkillers.On Friday, Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) followed up with a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch appealing for a formal stay on the effective date of the ban in order to “allow for the appropriate notice and comment period to take place.”The lawmakers also question the DEA’s characterization of the health risks posed by kratom, including claims that there have been “numerous deaths” linked to the herb. Most deaths associated with kratom have involved people who reportedly tested positive for numerous substances or were suffering from pre-existing medical conditions.“Without more concrete data and analysis, it is difficult to claim Kratom represents an ‘imminent hazard,’” the lawmakers wrote."

The Clinton campaign also pointed out millennials’ reported commitment to volunteering: Demand for AmeriCorps positions is five times greater than the number of slots actually available, according to a 2013 Center for American Progress report that the campaign cited.“However you serve, it feels great to be a part of something bigger than yourself,” Clinton tweeted. “To work toward making something good happen in the world.”"

(Penguin Press, Sept. 20, 2016) The new book tells the story of entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, his idea for a $10 million space prize, and the group of dreamers, engineers, rocket enthusiasts and aviation designers from across the globe who entered the race to become the first team to privately build and fly a rocket to the start of space. June 2001Peter Diamandis arrived at the Skybar, a rooftop watering hole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, with the idea of meeting two young guys who had struck it rich in the dot com boom. Peter, whose lifelong dream had been to get man and machine to space without the government’s help, had heard these Internet entrepreneurs were interested in space. Peter had never heard of the men before the meeting was arranged by a mutual friend, so he wrote down their names: Adeo Ressi and Elon Musk.Peter usually approached pitch meetings with great enthusiasm, but tonight he felt subdued. He spotted Adeo by the Skybar pool, smoking a cigarette and looking out at the gold and glimmering Los Angeles sunset. He was tall and thin, a Giacometti walking man figure, and immediately affable. Adeo said Elon was running late but on his way. Elon was working on getting his pilot’s license and was flying down from San Jose with his instructor. He had a new plane being built.It was Sunday, June 3, 2001, and Adeo, Elon, and Peter were scheduled to have dinner at Asia de Cuba, adjacent to the Skybar in the Mondrian Hotel. Peter took in the beautiful women in filmy tops and short skirts, and felt overdressed in his suit and mock turtleneck. Adeo was in casual slacks and a shirt open at the collar. The music was pulsating, the lychee up martinis flowing, and the entire hotel was bathed in white, with minimalist accents of Hermès orange. Even the matches were stylish, with lime-green tips. Peter had taken notice of the white-clad valet team when he pulled up to the white-façade hotel. The valet attendants all clasped their hands in exactly the same way. Peter joined Adeo for a drink near the pool. Adeo had just sold his Web development firm Methodfive and was working on turnarounds of lagging public companies. He said he and Elon had been housemates at the University of Pennsylvania. Elon was South African and had founded Zip2, a mapping and business services company, and cofounded PayPal, the online payment service being bought by eBay. Their shared interest in space came to light during a late-night car ride the weekend before Memorial Day. As they drove back to New York City from Long Island on a cloudy night, talk turned to what they wanted to do next. As a joke, one of them said, “Why don’t we do something in space?” When the laughter died down, Elon said, “Well, why can’t we do something in space?” The debate went back and forth: Space was too expensive. Why was it so expensive? Space takes a lot of infrastructure. Why does it take so much infrastructure? Space is controlled by governments and strict regulation. What happens if it is taken out of the government’s hands? Finally, they asked each other, Why do we even think space is interesting? This led to a discussion of where they would go if they could go to space. By the end of the car ride, they had their answer about what to do next. They knew exactly where they wanted to go. Before Adeo could continue, Elon arrived and apologized for being late. The three men moved with drinks in hand from the Skybar to the restaurant and ordered a feast: pan-seared ahi tuna, miso grilled salmon, the Asian noodle box, and more. Tracks from the Buddha Bar collection played in the background. Peter found Elon immediately likable: good chemistry from the start, soft-spoken, polite, his words well chosen. Adeo was also great, but more of an extrovert who seemed to enjoy playing devil’s advocate. Peter knew very little about the two coming into the night’s dinner. He’d had a quick conference call the week before with Elon and Adeo, thought they said all the right things, and took Elon’s accent to be British.Adeo made Peter laugh knowingly when he said, “I think every geek is a bit of a space buff.” Peter talked about his various space ventures, including the XPRIZE, which he had launched five years earlier to try to jumpstart the private space industry by offering a $10 million prize for the first team that could build and fly a rocket to the start of space. Peter also talked about Space Adventures, his company with Eric Anderson, which had brokered the final part of the deal to send the world’s first space tourist, Dennis Tito, to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft for $20 million. Peter talked briefly about how NASA had tried to stop Tito from flying, but Tito had launched on April 28 and landed safely in Kazakhstan on May 6. It was big news in space circles that Tito, an American, had to fly with Russian cosmonauts and was not allowed on the U.S. side of the space station. As Peter talked about what the “ultimate space company” would look like, putting on Moon missions and suborbital and ZERO‑G flights, Elon and Adeo said they had set their sights on something different, something even more difficult. They wanted to reach the Red Planet. Their mission, decided that night on Long Island, was to put humanity on Mars. They wanted to spend money to “shame, embarrass, or prod” the government into doing a human mission to Mars.Peter cautioned that he had seen a lot of great missions fail because one wealthy backer or another expected other wealthy individuals to support his vision. “But every wealthy person has his own vision,” Peter said. To make such a mission work, Peter now believed, one very wealthy and determined person would need to be willing to pay for everything, something he had yet to encounter. As Elon listened to Peter talk about Blastoff and his other companies, he thought Peter’s heart was in the right place, and it was obvious that he cared deeply about the future of space travel. But the Blastoff plan didn’t make sense to him. He didn’t think sending a rover back to the Moon was going to reignite space travel.Returning to the subject of Mars, Elon said, “We want to do something that’s significant enough but does something for a reasonable budget—for a couple million.” Adeo added that they had $10 million to $15 million to spend, but wanted to start with a $1 million or $2 million project.Peter was stunned to hear such a low figure of “a couple million,” but knew that in aerospace, a couple million often led to many more millions. He listened to them with interest, but made sure not to get his hopes up.Still, at the very least, even if Elon and Adeo did nothing, Peter had met some smart guys who would be friends. Elon was a major Trekkie. He had watched all of the episodes as a kid in South Africa, dreamed of spaceships, and read Heinlein, Asimov, and Douglas Adams. He said his successes in Silicon Valley had paved the way for his future in space—not unlike what Jeff Bezos had told him.Adeo, Elon, and Peter shared an interest in using small teams to accomplish what only the government had done before, though Elon remarked that he saw the government as “a corporation—the biggest corporation.” And like Peter, Adeo and Elon didn’t see NASA as the bad guy, but instead saw the public’s expectation of perfection as an unnecessary speed limit on innovation. The expectation that everything needed to go right caused NASA to be overly cautious. Elon talked about how he had been trying to understand why the world had not made more progress in sending people to the Moon or Mars. “There was a lot of excitement with the Apollo program and the dream of space travel,” Elon said. “It was ignited, and somehow that dream died or was put into stasis.” He said he was “trying to figure out if there is anything we can do to bring back the dream of Apollo. Maybe even a philanthropic mission.” Peter could see that Elon—a logician and engineer above all else—needed to understand the physical and psychological limitations of why rockets hadn’t improved since the sixties. Peter knew that Elon and Adeo were in research mode, talking to a mix of major players and fringe players in the world of aerospace. Peter told them he thought Mars was a great place to set up a future colony, but “the Moon was economical. The Moon is a place where you can go to gain access to resources and you are close enough to Earth that you can build on it.”But Elon was not interested in the Moon. “Maybe we do a mini greenhouse to Mars,” he said. “Maybe mice to Mars. Maybe we grow samples of food crops.” He said it had been obvious to him since childhood, when the Moon was already reached, that “Mars is next.” Also, Mars was even more mythical, more unattainable. The Moon was 240,000 miles away from Earth. Mars was about 34 million miles away when their orbits were together on the same side of the sun, but as much as 250 million miles apart when the two planets were on the opposite sides of the sun. The Moon was the talcum face in the night sky. Mars was the out‑of‑reach gem. Mars would take at least half a year to reach, using optimal energy cost. It would take a year and a half for the planets to realign, and then it would take another six months to return. Elon said he thought such a mission sounded entirely doable. Earlier, in May, Elon had attended a Mars Society event with Jim Cameron, who was working on a six-episode TV miniseries on the Red Planet. Over breakfast the next morning with Mars Society cofounder Robert Zubrin, Elon had pledged $100,000 to the cause.Peter, who had been in constant pitching mode for what felt like an eternity, tried to sit back and listen, but he kept finding himself back in the mode of selling. Elon and Adeo asked whether a manned mission to Mars was possible for less than $10 billion. Now the budget is edging closer to reality, Peter thought. Peter said enticingly, “I’ve got a way for you to do it for a tenth of the cost, for one billion.” Everyone leaned in. “You could build a one-way mission with existing Russian hardware. You send a few people with the goal of their living on Mars for five years until a resupply or rescue mission gets there. They will be the world’s first Martians.”Adeo and Elon loved the idea and spent the next hour in a fast-paced discussion, going over details and obstacles. Peter then told them that whatever they did in space, they needed to first prove themselves, “step by step.” Even though Peter had figured out quickly that Elon and Adeo had no interest in funding one of his for-profit ventures, he admired how these guys were willing to gamble on space. And the evening offered a pleasant surprise: Elon loved the XPRIZE idea. “I could be a supporter of that,” he said. Elon thought that the XPRIZE could jump-start an industry and rekindle public interest in space. Elon and Adeo appeared keenly interested as Peter talked about the Spirit of St. Louis, Charles Lindbergh, and the teams that had signed up for the XPRIZE. Peter said that the idea for his space prize came from reading about the $25,000 Orteig prize offered first in 1919 to the first aviator who could fly nonstop from Paris to New York or New York to Paris. “I’d love to meet some of the teams,” Elon said. Adeo offered to join the XPRIZE board.Well after midnight, the men finally walked out of the restaurant and were greeted by the white-clad valet. They had plans to meet the next morning to continue the discussion.As Peter drove back to his apartment in Santa Monica, he turned on his recorder and began to reflect. It was strange, he said, how until tonight, he had felt like the kid in the room. Now, at forty, he felt more like the elder statesman. Both Adeo and Elon were weeks shy of turning thirty. They were just starting on space; he had never been anywhere else.“They only have ten million to fifteen million to spend,” Peter said as he drove. “They could be backers of the XPRIZE.

Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said some militants may have been killed in the strike, but many of the victims were civilians, including students, a teacher, and members of families considered to be “pro-government”.“UNAMA reiterates the need for all parties to the conflict to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law,” the United Nations said in a statement.“UNAMA calls on the government and international military forces to launch a prompt, independent, impartial, transparent, and effective investigation into this incident.”The civilians had gathered in a village to welcome the return of a local elder who had completed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and were sleeping when the strike occurred, according to witnesses.The U.S. military command confirmed it conducted an air strike in Achin aimed at Islamic State militants, but said it is gathering information on the allegations of civilian casualties.“We take every possible measure to avoid civilian casualties in these operations, and will continue to work with Afghan authorities to determine if there is cause for additional investigation,” U.S. forces said in a statement."

With his jacket off, sleeves rolled up and tie loosened, Obama was clearly ready to head home.But former President Bill Clinton, who also spoke at Peres’ funeral, was taking his time.Standing at the plane’s doorway, Obama playfully encouraged Clinton to come aboard.“Bill! Let’s go. I’ll take you home,” Obama said.Sky News captured video of the hilarious exchange.Eventually, the famously talkative Clinton makes his way up the stairs, joining Obama on board.Peres, who died on Tuesday at age 93, was one of Israel’s longest-serving politicians, playing an active role in the Jewish state since its founding in 1948. Peres spent much of his career building Israel’s military edge, including its acquisition of nuclear weapons, and leaves behind a controversial legacy.But as Israeli foreign minister, he also was an architect of the Oslo accords, an Israeli-Palestinian agreement that created the first semi-autonomous Palestinian governing body.Speaking at the funeral on Friday, Clinton, who presided over the Oslo accords, called Peres a “wise champion of our common humanity.”"

Over the past two decades, the nation has tried to dismantle the divisive urban planning that was put in place during apartheid, not always successfully.Growing up in post-apartheid South Africa, London-based photographer Alice Mann decided to explore another residual form of apartheid-era segregation, namely social division. In a series of portraits dubbed “Domestic Bliss,” Mann captured black domestic workers in the homes of their wealthy employers in an effort to investigate lingering issues of race and social segregation in Cape Town. She captures her female subjects inside their employers’ homes, suggesting, as she writes online, “a sense of alienation and displacement associated with their roles within these intimate spaces.”Mann contrasts “Domestic Bliss” with her previous series “Southern Suburbs,” a series that focuses on an exclusive and mostly white segment of South African culture. The portraits of domestic workers show individuals of a starkly different socioeconomic background, but who inhabit the same geographic area as “Southern Suburbs.”Mann, a white woman, explains further that she is interested in not only exploring post-apartheid notions of representation, but also the way her own privilege and race affects the ways her images are perceived. Critics across the internet have questioned what it means for a white woman to photograph black subjects in contemporary South Africa, and whether or not her photos are capable of illuminating the realities of these domestic workers.According to her online statement, Mann hopes to continue her series by photographing the domestic workers and their employers together and incorporating the various reactions and responses surrounding her work.See more of “Domestic Bliss” below.An earlier version of this piece originally appeared on HuffPost Italy and has been translated into English."
581,581,RELIGION,American And Israeli Jews Are Strongly Connected But Sharply Divided,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pew-american-israeli-jews_us_57ed6366e4b024a52d2daf3f,The Pew Research Center takes a look at Jewish life in Israel and the United States.,2016-09-30,"In the Jewish tradition, candles are lit on Friday evenings before sunset to usher in the Sabbath, a holy day of rest. In Israel, 56 percent of Jews said they always or usually light the Sabbath candles. In America, 23 percent of Jews reported the same. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ed9d0c170000e00aac84d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"American and Israeli Jews have much more than an ocean dividing them. Four out of five Jews in the world live in either Israel or the United States. And while these two groups feel a strong emotional connection to each other, a new data essay from the Pew Research Center shows that they disagree on a variety of issues ― from religious identity to political ideology to the prospect of peace with Palestinians. Pew researchers pulled together data from a March 2016 survey of Israeli adults and an October 2013 survey of American Jews. The resulting essay illustrates broad ideological differences ― for example, most Israeli Jews place themselves on the center or on the right of their country’s political spectrum. In contrast, most American Jews identify with the center or the left. When asked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, only 43 percent of Israeli Jews believed that Israel and an independent Palestinian state could coexist peacefully, compared to 61 percent of U.S. Jews. Forty-two percent of Israeli Jews agreed that Jewish settlements in the West Bank help their country’s security, while only 17 percent of American Jews thought the same. Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at Jerusalem’s Shalom Hartman Institute, believes this divergence is due to differing life experiences. “Israelis live in the least hospitable region on the planet, not only for Jews, for everybody. And American Jews live in the most welcoming society, the most hospitable society that Jews have ever known in 4,000 years,” Halevi said in a Pew Research Center video. “That means we need to develop opposing strategies for coping. [Israeli Jews] need to be the toughest kid on the block and American Jews need to be flexible.”Without committing to keeping the relationship going, there’s a chance these groups will grow “more and more alienated” from each other,” Halevi adds. Watch Pew’s interview with Yossi Klein Halevi below.American and Israeli Jews also report different ways of connecting with religion. In Pew’s 2013 survey of American Jews, one out of five people who were raised Jewish, or had at least one Jewish parent, said they didn’t identify with any religion. In Israel, nearly all Jews identified Judaism as the religion they follow ― although not everyone is observant. Sixty-three percent of Israeli Jews said they keep kosher at home, while 22 percent of American Jews keep kosher. The Americans were much more likely to say they eat pork than Israelis (57 percent to 16 percent). Since the Sabbath is a day of rest and renewal, some conservative strands of Judaism teach that handling money on the Sabbath is forbidden. Fifty-five percent of Israeli Jews said they handled money on the Sabbath, while 85 percent of American Jews did the same.Some of these differences in observance could be due to the fact that Judaism is an integral part of Israeli society and politics ― while in America, Judaism is a minority religion. “Jewish observance is more ingrained in daily life in Israel than it is in the U.S,” Pew’s essay states. “For example, many Israeli businesses close early on Friday afternoon before the start of the Sabbath. Kosher food is more widely available than it is in the U.S., and major Jewish holidays are Israeli national holidays.”In response to a question about what it means to be Jewish, both groups said that remembering the Holocaust was the most important part of their Jewish identity. They differed on other points. The Americans were more likely than Israelis to say that “leading an ethical and moral life,” “working for justice and equality,” “being intellectually curious,” and “having a good sense of humor” were integral to their identity. The Israelis were more likely than Americans to say that observing Jewish law was essential to their Jewish identity. Dr. Yehezkel Landau, an interfaith education an peace activist, has lived in both Israel and the United States. He told The Huffington Post that it’s important for Jews on both sides of the Atlantic to understand each other because each of these communities has a particular insight into Judaism that the other could benefit from. Since their lives are relatively secure compared to their Israeli counterparts, Landau said American Jews have had the chance to develop a strong connection to what he called the “universalist elements” of Judaism ― the parts of the religion that teach about justice and peace, human dignity, and the sanctity of life. On the other hand, American Jews can learn from Israelis what it means to consecrate life every minute of the day, Landau said, “to aspire to holiness in the marketplace, in military, in business, in government, in education, in every aspect of life. What it means to live a holistically Jewish life.” “There’s a lot to be learned in both directions, which is why they complement each other,” Landau said.Pew documented plenty of good feelings between the two groups about the other. About 40 percent of American Jews said they’ve traveled to Israel, and a similar amount of Israelis said they’d traveled to the U.S. Many American Jews said they felt “very” or “somewhat” attached to Israel, and Israeli Jews said that their American counterparts had a good influence on Israel.Halevi is confident that identifying and confronting American and Israeli Jews’ differences and similarities will help both communities grow stronger. “I think there’s enough wisdom in both communities and enough goodwill in trying to keep the relationship going that we will be able to figure this out,” Halevi said. “But our starting point is that not only are we all Jews together, but we are very different kinds of Jewish communities.”"

This is the second year in a row that the council managed to agree only on a national inquiry, which tends to be one-sided and ignorant of the degree to which people are suffering.The Netherlands withdrew its text on Yemen during the deliberations on Thursday and instead compromised on the draft resolution, which called for the national inquiry and was put forward by the council’s group of Arab states.This decision comes as a relief to Saudi Arabia and the Arab states, which want to avoid international meddling into a conflict that they have a major stake in.A Saudi-led coalition has been targeting Houthis in Yemen since March of 2015 after it helped run the country’s president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, into exile. It has mercilessly bombed civilian-heavy areas in the country, most recently targeting medical facilities and schools.The Houthis, who are supported by Iran, aren’t innocent either. They’ve also been accused of repeated human rights violations, including the use of humans as shields during attacks.Meanwhile, the team from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights working on Yemen is “disappointed” in the outcome, Mohammad Ali Alnsour, special assistant to the high commissioner, told The Huffington Post. “We did not have any say in the final text. It was a package deal so basically we have to live with it,” he said.The resolution asks that the U.N. technical assistance team provide an oral update of its findings at the next council session in March and then put together a written report of human rights violations in time for next September’s session.The OHCHR Yemen team just did this, and it wasn’t easy. It delivered a report recently about the situation on the ground after several months of investigating and found that Yemeni representatives were difficult to work with and didn’t meet the international standards for data collection.Alnsour anticipates that the U.N. assistance team will face the same uphill battle in receiving credible information from the Yemenis this time around, he added.Some were more optimistic about the outcome.“Although imperfect, the Human Rights Council resolution provides the UN High Commissioner a clear mandate to send more investigators to Yemen, vigorously investigate abuses by all sides, and report publicly,” John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “With this vote, council members overcame obstruction by Saudi Arabia and showed they recognize the need for accountability for the grave human rights violations in Yemen.”The U.K., although allied with Saudi Arabia, did shift its position and come out in support of the international inquiry. The United States did the same.It’s also a longtime ally of the Saudis, and reports have indicated that some of the coalition bombs used in Yemen were sold to the Saudis by the U.S.The U.S. delegation is pleased with the resolution, which “includes a much more robust and explicit mandate to report on human rights abuses and violations,” according to Ambassador Keith Harper, the U.S. representative to the HRC. He views it as a major improvement compared with last year.And while diplomats continue to spar in Geneva, the humanitarian situation on the ground in Yemen continues to deteriorate. “At least 7 million people ― a quarter of the population ― are living under emergency levels of food insecurity,” the World Food Programme said in June.The toll of war has been particularly hard on children. Preventing disease and death among children in the country has been set back almost a decade, according to UNICEF. More than 1.5 million children are suffering from malnourishment.

It delivered a report recently about the situation on the ground after several months of investigating and found that Yemeni representatives were difficult to work with and didn’t meet the international standards for data collection.Alnsour anticipates that the U.N. assistance team will face the same uphill battle in receiving credible information from the Yemenis this time around, he added.Some were more optimistic about the outcome.“Although imperfect, the Human Rights Council resolution provides the UN High Commissioner a clear mandate to send more investigators to Yemen, vigorously investigate abuses by all sides, and report publicly,” John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “With this vote, council members overcame obstruction by Saudi Arabia and showed they recognize the need for accountability for the grave human rights violations in Yemen.”The U.K., although allied with Saudi Arabia, did shift its position and come out in support of the international inquiry. The United States did the same.It’s also a longtime ally of the Saudis, and reports have indicated that some of the coalition bombs used in Yemen were sold to the Saudis by the U.S.The U.S. delegation is pleased with the resolution, which “includes a much more robust and explicit mandate to report on human rights abuses and violations,” according to Ambassador Keith Harper, the U.S. representative to the HRC. He views it as a major improvement compared with last year.And while diplomats continue to spar in Geneva, the humanitarian situation on the ground in Yemen continues to deteriorate. “At least 7 million people ― a quarter of the population ― are living under emergency levels of food insecurity,” the World Food Programme said in June.The toll of war has been particularly hard on children. Preventing disease and death among children in the country has been set back almost a decade, according to UNICEF. More than 1.5 million children are suffering from malnourishment.

The U.S. came close to meeting its goal. The State Department’s Refugee Processing Center had resettled 83,661 people as of Monday. And the administration surpassed its goal of resettling 10,000 Syrian refugees.But the rush to meet the target before Friday’s deadline has created a surge of arrivals over the past few months. A huge influx of people in a short period has left the nine government-affiliated refugee resettlement agencies strained for resources. It means that refugees who have arrived in the past few months have received scant attention, are less likely to be placed in decent housing and have limited access to the only people they can call for help.The new beginning in the place they’re now supposed to call home is off to a rocky start. The settlement conditions were more or less satisfactory for the Darbi family, originally from Homs, Western Syria, when they arrived in America from Jordan in July 2015. The Huffington Post has been following them for more than a year. Church World Service, the resettlement agency that helped the Darbis sent someone to pick them up at the airport, found them a home and helped with paperwork, including social security, food stamp and green card applications. It also assisted in their job search and enrolled the Darbi children in school.Mohamed Darbi found a new job in construction that more closely resembles his time as a carpenter in Syria than his previous U.S. jobs in a bakery and a deli.

It was the hardest thing for me to see,” she said. “All my kids crying and refusing enter the apartment on how terrified and horrible the condition was.”It’s thanks to community volunteers that families like the Abarahs have received some of the items that they desperately need. A local charity, Muslims Giving Back, raised money to totally renovate the family’s apartment after a worker saw the squalid living conditions one night while dropping off food.The family’s relationship with CWS has improved slightly since they first arrived, Abarah said.The organization recently brought on a new director, Megan Johnson, who has been trying to heed families’ calls. CWS had previously only agreed to subsidize two months’ rent, but they have since offered 120-180 days to her family, Abarah said.The charity acknowledged that its Jersey City case load increased more than expected. “More arrivals at one time makes it harder to find housing, find jobs and even find schools,”Johnson said. “It can be a challenge in our capacity but I know that CWS as a whole is very excited about increasing resettlement numbers.”It had relied on volunteers and donors to help furnish apartments over the summer and brought on a temporary worker to help with the heftier caseload, she added.About 20 miles north in Paterson, New Jersey, the International Rescue Committee has also been busy resettling Syrian refugees.

Um Jamal’s children answered the door without flinching, as if they were used to greeting cops.“We left fear and terror to come in a place still filled with fear and terror,” she said.Um Firas, another Syrian woman who lives upstairs with her husband and their three children, showed photos she took of an unconscious man in their stairwell, his pants partly removed.

When she called the IRC to alert them to their safety concerns, they sent a staffer who didn’t speak Arabic and tried to communicate via Google Translate. When the IRC brought them their lease, the families living in the Paterson building initially refused to sign, Um Jamal said.“But we were forced into a one-year contract,” she added. And she said the IRC required that they put the additional money given to them by the agency toward the apartment security deposit. The IRC only agreed to pay one month of their rent, she said.“If I had enough money I would go back to Jordan,” said Um Shadee, who has four children and is the third Syrian mother living in the building.The IRC did, however, send an Arabic speaker to help them enroll in schools and apply for food stamps, she said.And the agency is taking full responsibility for the areas in which it knows it needs to do better. “We have been having conversations with our clients about their housing and if they do have concerns in terms of safety and whether the housing is sanitary we work really closely with the landlords,” said Avigail Ziv, the IRC’s director for New York and New Jersey.If safety continues to be an issue, especially for some of the Paterson families, Ziv plans to move them to a new location, she added.

It takes time to forge new relationships with community members in order to find more ideal housing options.Secretary of State John Kerry told lawmakers this month that the Obama administration would set a goal of welcoming up to 110,000 refugees in the 2017 fiscal year.Even this 30 percent increase requires agencies to hire more people in their local offices if they are expected to provide every new refugee with the same quality of service.Resettlement agencies are eager to accept as many refugees as the government will allow, but any type of surge “taxes our structure,” said Mark Hetfield, chief executive of HIAS, one of the nine resettlement agencies.

Gossip Cop reported that the two allegedly weren’t seeing “eye to eye” on certain production details, though Pratt’s rep told the outlet that was “completely untrue.”The actress confirmed that she and Pratt were not in a fight and (more important) would both appear in the upcoming “Jurassic World 2.” Pratt echoed his co-star’s thoughts and also said that the two were getting along perfectly fine. Throwing “love you” and “worship” around and adding a million exclamation points and emojis definitely proves the two are totally fine and not fighting at all, right?

604,604,WOMEN,One Woman’s Story Shows Why Government Funding For Abortion Care Matters,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-womans-story-shows-why-government-funding-for-abortion-care-matters_us_57ed4ed2e4b0c2407cdc7a72,"40 years after the Hyde Amendment was passed, it’s time to overturn it.",2016-09-30,Abortion services are out of reach for many low-income women. Overturning Hyde would help. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ed672d1b00000d0cef3422.jpeg?cache=lNA8OU6YRW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"September 30 marks the 40th anniversary of the Hyde Amendment, a policy that blocks federal Medicaid coverage for abortion services unless a woman’s life is in danger, or in cases of rape and incest.Reproductive rights advocates have been loud and clear on the many ways that Hyde ― a policy rider that has been tacked onto annual appropriations bills since the 1970s ― harms low-income women. Some 30 percent of black women and nearly a quarter of Latina women in the United States are enrolled in Medicaid. And although many states have extended coverage for abortion services to low-income women, more than half of Latinas and 70 percent of black women live in a state that does not allow Medicaid coverage for abortion. Many low-income women are forced to miss rent payments, forgo food and miss bill payments just to scrape together the money to cover care they have a legal right to.To demonstrate how much Hyde hurts women, HuffPost Women spoke to Mary, a 26-year-old who has shared her story with the 1 in 3 Campaign. She was uninsured when she had her abortion three years ago, but qualified for financial assistance for her abortion from her state. That government help was the only thing, she says, that allowed her to be able to afford the service. Her story shows exactly how hard it is for many low-income women to pay for abortion services, and how overturning Hyde and expanding coverage would ease their burden.Here is her story. *****In April 2013, I was 23 and in a very crappy long-distance relationship that I now realize was emotionally abusive. I had been on and off the pill for a while. I’d go stretches without refilling my prescription, partly because my boyfriend and I were only seeing each other once every three or four months. He came for a visit and I’d recently gone back on the pill. I thought it would be effective, but I’d only been taking it for about a week. I guess I was wrong, because I got pregnant. At the time, I was a student at my local community college and I was working 40 hours a week. I was earning minimum wage ― $7.25 an hour ― in a tuxedo rental shop in my local mall, cleaning tuxedos. It was very mundane work. To pay for school, I was getting financial aid and I took out student loans. I live in Asheville, North Carolina, which is expensive, so sometimes I’d use my student loans to pay my rent and prevent eviction ― even though I was living with roommates in a not nice place to keep costs down. I’d use the money I earned from work to pay for my groceries. I had a cat I’ve owned since I was 9 and I paid for him. I didn’t have a lot of other expenses. I don’t own a car. I was paying for the monthly bus pass. Because I’ve been on and off birth control, my period has always been irregular. I’ve had some pregnancy scares in the past, but had never actually been pregnant before so I think maybe I got lulled into a false sense of security. I took a test in the bathroom stall at the mall before work, which was really stupid. There I was, shaking and crying. I called my boyfriend and the first thing I said, while sobbing, was “Don’t be mad at me.” That’s a good sign it was a terrible relationship.It sounds callous, but I knew really quickly what I wanted to do. I love kids. In the future, I really want children. But I grew up financially disadvantaged. My family had been on welfare. Partly, I knew I couldn’t have the baby because I knew how bad my situation was with my boyfriend, but mostly it was financial. I know what it’s like to grow up on welfare, and I know what it’s like to be that kid at school whose clothes are torn up and dirty, or who is really hungry and doesn’t have anything for dinner aside from, like, a peanut butter sandwich. I couldn’t justify making a child go through that. I did some research and went to my local Planned Parenthood clinic. They told me I was seven weeks along, but when they did an ultrasound, they said it looked more like I was four weeks. I am, unfortunately, a smoker. Before I knew I was pregnant, I’d been smoking the whole time. I asked them, “Is it my fault that it looks like I’m only four weeks?” and they told me they couldn’t say, they weren’t sure. They did say that if I chose to take it to term, they weren’t sure how it would turn out, they really didn’t know. When I made the appointment for the abortion, the woman told me that based on my income I would be eligible for financial aid for part of the cost. I was uninsured at the time. I eventually convinced my boyfriend to pay $200 of what we owed beyond that, which was a terrible ordeal of many drawn out arguments about why I needed help with this. I think I paid about $50, maybe $70 myself.On the day of the abortion, I took a day off work and missed some classes. My best friend from college came with me, and of course there were protestors outside. One of them chanted “young mother” at me, which is stuck in my head forever. I didn’t look at them or talk to them.I was terrified the entire time. I have this paranoia of painkillers, so they gave me a nose mask with something ― I think basically laughing gas ― to help keep me calm. There was a doula-type woman there to hold my hand, and they kept telling me to breathe in, but I guess I wasn’t really inhaling enough, because I certainly felt cramping and pain. Once the procedure was over, the doctor told me to put my arm down. I realized I’d been crushing this poor woman’s hand, and I had to let her go. I’m not sure if it was the laughing gas, or me just being a crazy person, but in the waiting room after I was being loud and crying. They came and told me that I just really needed to calm down, because women in the waiting room could hear me.That night, I stayed at the house of a friend from college, crying and having angry fights with my boyfriend and trying to get him to come and see me. For a while, I was a mess. I think the big thing for me was getting past my guilt. But I was never going to have this child. I would have felt awful watching my baby trying to survive on WIC checks, living in bad places, or maybe even being born with a defect of some kind because of what I’d done. The thing is that now, I have a good job. I have a nice home. I’m in a stable relationship. I’m a volunteer with my local literacy counsel. And I think a lot about how all of those things would not have been possible if the state had not paid for part of the abortion. I really would have carried that pregnancy to term.

616,616,ENTERTAINMENT,Stephen Colbert Explains Why Donald Trump Wouldn't Dare Return To 'Late Show',Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-explains-why-donald-trump-wouldnt-dare-return-to-late-show_us_57eebc0de4b0c2407cddd5bd,Hint: 🐔.,2016-09-30,Donald Trump visits The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2015. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eebc5a170000f70aac889b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The last time Stephen Colbert invited Donald Trump to appear on “The Late Show” in late 2015, he was accused of going soft on the presidential nominee. Not Jimmy Fallon–soft, but Colbert, like far too many talk show hosts this political season, went for the laughs instead of holding Trump accountable for his actions. Talking with SiriusXM host Bill Carter on Friday, Colbert revealed that if the opportunity presented itself again, he would take a much different approach, but there’s one thing standing in the way of a second interview: Trump. “I don’t regret the attempt, I regret that that’s probably the only bite I’m going to get at that apple,” he told Carter. “I would have him on tomorrow, but he’s a coward ... It’s clear that Donald Trump is a coward, because he won’t come back on the show.”When Carter jokingly cautioned him about the potential blowback from making Trump’s refusal to appear on the “Late Show” public, i.e., a signature Trump tweet meltdown, an unconcerned Colbert broke it down for the radio host. “He’s a chicken. To put it in his own terms — let me translate it into his own language [chicken clucking noise],” Colbert added.“What would I give [for a tweet]. What an honor to have him talk about my sex tape,” he continued, of course, referencing Trump’s latest and most repulsive attack on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. “That would be so exciting. Can we get on that?”When asked about the overwhelmingly negative reception to late-night rival Jimmy Fallon’s interview, Colbert stood by the comedian, explaining that he didn’t “understand the furor.”Hmm. Maybe it was Fallon making Trump seem like that kindly and slightly racist relative you avoid at Thanksgiving, instead of the potential future leader of our country. “I think the host has this obligation — to be honest with their audience,” Colbert explained. “And you have to go with your honest instincts. My honest instinct is to ask at least one question of some kind of substance with your guest. Even if the person is there only to push something that is not substantive.”He added, “For me, I have to do that with every person who represents a political idea. But that’s not every host’s responsibility. Every host’s responsibility is to be honest with themselves and with their audience about the kind of show that they do. So I fault no host who acts consistently and honestly.” Watch a clip from Colbert’s 2015 interview with Trump below: Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

He also said he didn’t run the idea by anyone prior to delivering it as part of his presidential announcement speech in June of 2015.The videos were released after several news outlets including BuzzFeed, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times filed a motion to access them; transcripts of the exchange were already public.In the deposition, a lawyer asks Trump about his comments:Q [lawyer]: With respect to the speech that you made, and specifically the focus on Mexicans and immigrants, did you write the statement in advance? Was it written?Trump’s speech angered people across the political landscape and set the tone for his xenophobic and nativist campaign. The nominee has talked about how he’s an off-the-cuff speaker, and he often has to walk back his controversial remarks after making them.The immigration comments prompted two restaurateurs, Jose Andres and Geoffrey Zakarian, to drop their plans to open restaurants in Trump’s new hotel in the landmark Old Post Office building in downtown Washington. The deposition was part of a breach of contract lawsuit Trump filed against the two restaurants, which had already signed leases with the hotel. The two videos, which are available on YouTube, are each about an hour long. You can watch them both below, or read a text version of the deposition here.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Blige sat down with Hillary Clinton for her new show, ""The 411.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eeb4321b00007f08ef3904.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mary J. Blige’s full interview with Hillary Clinton for her show “The 411” is finally available on Apple Music.After Apple Music shared the promo video, many social media users had some questions (and jokes) about why she was interviewing the presidential candidate in the first place. Before she began her interview, Blige said when she met Clinton and performed at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, she said she was inspired to interview the secretary for the debut episode of her new show. “I wanted this to be my first interview for the show because I represented, for so long in my music career, a movement of women who are trying to stay strong... and represent leadership,” said Blige, who told Billboard that she’s a singer before she’s a journalist. “I want to move people. The way I move them in my music, I want to move them in my TV show as well.”During the interview, the two discussed womanhood, police brutality against, gun violence and Clinton’s plans for making change in the White House.The meat of the interview begins at about 18 minutes in when Blige starts singing her emotional rendition of “American Skin (41 Shots)” ― the segment featured in the promo which many people didn’t take seriously. In the video, Clinton advised Blige that she should sing in every interview she does. More pressing than the song, however, was the artist’s question about how the country should handle violence against black people. “Where do we go from here?” she asked the candidate with teary eyes.“We have to put ourselves in each other’s shoes, feel the pain that a mother and a father feel when their son and daughter can go out the door and they don’t know what’s gonna happen to them,” Clinton responded. “I particularly want white people to understand what that’s like and to feel that they must be part of the solution.”She noted that law enforcement needs training to remove implicit bias and to learn how to deescalate tension in a more effective way. Clinton also said she plans on finding a solution to gun violence within communities.“I have pledged that I’m going to do everything I can to bring our country together, to take on this violence, to work with our police, to take change mindsets... and to do what we can to take on the gun lobby,” she told Blige. “To get the guns out of our neighborhoods that are being used to kill so many children and young people. So I hope that we will make progress on this.”Blige asked Hillary if she was worried about her initiatives being blocked in Congress because she’s a woman, especially since many believe President Obama faced this issue due to his race.“I know how hard it is to get anything done because I watched my husband, I watched president Obama. But I know it’s possible because I watched both of them break through the opposition to achieve important goals for our country,” Clinton said. “I’m going to get up every day and work hard. I’m not going to take anything or anybody for granted and I’m going to try to build relationships to find common ground.”Awkward moment aside, Blige and Clinton touched on some serious issues. But there wasn’t much new information revealed (despite the fact that Hillary and Mary are now on first name basis). However, Blige’s new platform may have bridged the gap between her fans and Clinton’s message.In the interview, Clinton toyed with the idea of doing a follow up interview in four years, if she’s elected, to talk about what she’s accomplished. Given that Clinton sat down with the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul in the first place, it’s not too far fetched.Watch the full interview on Apple Music. "

Pat McCrory's (R) decision to sign HB2 into law has cost the state a significant amount of business. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ee7a4b1b00007f08ef378f.jpeg?ops=crop_6_96_2994_1631%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Atlantic Coast Conference football championship game will be held in Orlando on Dec. 3, after conference officials decided to pull out of North Carolina because of the state’s new law that discriminates against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. The law, known as HB2, bars cities and localities from enacting anti-discrimination policies that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It also prevents schools from allowing transgender students to use the restroom that correspondents with their gender identity, rather than the gender on their birth certificate.North Carolina has had a steady stream of bad press and businesses leaving the state since Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed HB2 into law in March. The ACC championship game was originally supposed to be held in Charlotte. But this month, officials put out a statement saying it would be moved. “Every one of our 15 universities is strongly committed to these values and therefore, we will continue to host ACC championships at campus sites,” the ACC statement said. “We believe North Carolina House Bill 2 is inconsistent with these values, and as a result, we will relocate all neutral-site championships for the 2016-17 academic year.”Florida does not have a law that provides protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Orlando, however, has a human rights ordinance that does include those categories. The Orlando Sentinel reports that local community leaders received a questionnaire from the ACC “inquiring about the inclusiveness of the area, working to confirm legislation and ordinances were in place that would prevent a situation similar to the North Carolina controversy.”Charlotte actually did have LGBT protections at one point ― which is what set off the backlash from Republicans. The city council passed a nondiscrimination ordinance in February, leading to state officials pushing HB2 in order to overturn it. "

His grandmother, who didn’t have more than a fifth-grade education, raised him and his six siblings. The family lived in one of Chicago’s most violent neighborhoods. Krishaun Branch grew up in the same neighborhood, in public housing with his mother and brother. Both of Branch’s parents have gang histories, and by the time Branch reached high school, he had also been involved in gang activities.Henderson and Branch weren’t the type of kids who typically get into and graduate from college. And yet, despite many bumps in the road and thousands of dollars of student debt, both earned college degrees in four years. Their stories ― glimmers of hope for a struggling community ― are the subject of a recent PBS documentary called “All The Difference.”The documentary follows the two young men through their senior year of high school and four years of college, including several moments when ― had they not had the right mix of luck, family support and resilience ― they might have easily fallen off track. For disadvantaged students like Henderson and Branch, the film shows, the combination of many little things that can make all the difference. “All The Difference” was also inspired by writer Wes Moore’s book, The Other Wes Moore. It tells the story of someone with the same name as the author, from the same neighborhood and background, who went down a vastly different path. The other Wes Moore is serving a life sentence for murder, while the author is a military veteran, former White House fellow and social entrepreneur.Wes Moore and his mother, Joy Thomas Moore, served as executive producers on “All The Difference.” Together with filmmaker Tod Lending, they said they want the film to highlight the many structural barriers to success for low-income students of color. HuffPost recently spoke with them about making the documentary. How did Robert and Krishaun become the subjects of this documentary?Tod Lending: They both represent their community in that they both come from very tough backgrounds. Both of them had entered high school two to three grades behind in reading, writing and math. We felt like these two young men, they have stories that we think a lot of young African-American men can relate to, coming from situations of poverty. We made it a real point to not select two guys who were considered exceptional students, who were, of course, going to make it through college.We also wanted to tell a story that was not a pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps story. The success that they ended up finding was a result of not only their own self-determination ― which, of course, that plays an important role ― but most importantly it was about the support systems and support structures around them.Joy Thomas Moore: One of our goals in making this film is that we wanted to flip the script on who is considered college-worthy: Who do you expect to go to college? Who do you expect not to go to college? So many young men, early on, are told by those around them, their teachers, others in society, that they’re never going to make anything of themselves. What do you want the takeaway of this film to be for audiences?JTM: People need to believe that kids who they might not assume can make it can, in fact, make it ― if we as a society put those opportunities in place.TL: We want audiences to walk away with a sense of a counter-narrative of what we see when we think of young African-American men coming from backgrounds of poverty. Especially this year and in Chicago, we have just been inundated with negative media. It instills in the public a stereotype of young African-American men being violent and uneducated, unmotivated, uncaring. We desperately need these types of stories, like “All The Difference,” that present a different story of what’s going on in these communities. Wes Moore: We need people like Robert and Krishaun to win. Our communities are better, our society is better, our neighborhoods are better if students like them win. One of the things I really like about the film is the idea that oftentimes, a narrative about why people don’t make it through is ‘Oh well, they should have focused more or worked harder,’ or all these other false narratives that exist about all the challenges so many people are having. Is that a portion? Absolutely. But people have to understand why people don’t make it through ― it’s because structural barriers do exist. How are the boys doing now?TL: They’re doing well. Krishaun is working at [his former high school] Urban Prep Academies in admissions and doing recruiting as well. He’s excellent at it ― the young men can really relate and identify with him.Robert did really well at [the education-focused nonprofit] City Year ― he did a year of community service. Once he completed that, he went to Colorado to do more math tutoring with students coming from situations of poverty. He’s in transition right now. He’s been accepted into the Peace Corps, so he’s thinking about that. And then he’s also applied for the police academy in a suburb outside of Denver.That’s the other beautiful thing about this film, and there’s no way we could have predicted this ― that the young men, upon graduating each with over $40,000 in debt, they decided to go into jobs that were public service oriented.This interview has been edited for length and clarity."

And, according to Clinton’s website, upon registering to vote, each participant will be entered to win a chance to fly with a friend to meet the hip-hop artist backstage during one of his concerts.The political paring isn’t all that surprising. In July, Pusha tweeted about a developing “call of action” for voter registration.Pusha previously dished to Business Insider about his initial meeting with Clinton to register voters in his home state of Virginia.“I’m sure she was hip and briefed,” he told the website about Clinton’s previous knowledge of his music. “But [the conversation] was simply about engaging, and being engaged, and making sure that I engage people to vote, and get my demographic to vote. Get people out to the polls, that was her main thing.”Keep pushing, Pusha.For more info on Hillary Clinton and Pusha T’s voter registration drive click here."

The object he was said to be carrying was not specified.The next day, Mayor Bill Wells confirmed the victim’s identity as Alfred Olango, a 38-year-old Ugandan immigrant with a U.S. felony record of convictions for drug and weapon offenses, according to federal court records.Friends and activists said Olango was mentally ill and may have been suffering a seizure in the moments before his death.Police said they obtained cellphone video of the shooting from a bystander, but authorities released only a still frame showing two officers pointing weapons at a man who was aiming an object at them.In a separate video clip taken moments after the shooting and posted on social media, a woman who refers to herself as the victim’s sister is heard crying in anguish, “Oh my God. You killed my brother. I just called for help and ... you killed him.”Wells told a news conference on Wednesday that he had seen the footage obtained by police. He described it as “certainly enlightening,” adding, “I don’t believe that this is going to be a tremendously complicated process for people to figure out what happened.”“I saw a man who was distraught, a man who was acting in ways that looked like he was in great pain, and I saw him get gunned down and killed, and it broke my heart. If it was my son I would be devastated,” Wells said.Wells said all 120 officers on El Cajon’s police force receive training from San Diego County’s Psychiatric Emergency Response Teams, or PERT, program, though no PERT-assigned officer was available for dispatch to Tuesday’s call.

The predominantly white city is home to some 100,000 people, including many residents who are immigrants from the Middle East and Africa.Civil rights activists and several hundred protesters returned to the streets on Wednesday, gathering first outside the police department to chant “murder,” “justice for Alfred Olango” and “black lives matter.”“We are not going to stop until we get justice,” the Reverend Shane Harris, president of the National Action Network’s San Diego chapter, said at the rally.Protests continued after dark with hundreds of people marching from the shooting scene to City Hall and back, shouting Olango’s name, taunting police and periodically blocking traffic.The crowd later staged a boisterous but peaceful rally near the site of Olango’s death that turned tense when police officers, who initially kept a low profile, made a renewed show of force in riot gear.A standoff appeared on the verge of escalation as some protesters hurled water bottles at police, who stood their ground before pulling back in what seemed to be a tactical retreat.Demonstrators milled about the streets afterward, but the mood grew more relaxed and the crowds gradually diminished with no immediate signs of further lawlessness.The San Diego County District Attorney was investigating the shooting, and police said the bystander’s video would be released once that probe was complete.

She and her colleagues write in JAMA Cardiology that over 300 million people use Twitter to communicate with each other, but it was unknown whether researchers could separate messages of substance from noise and ultimately analyze those messages.For the new study, they searched approximately 10 billion English-language Twitter posts - known as tweets - originating in the U.S. between July 2009 and February 2015 for messages about five cardiovascular and related diseases: high blood pressure, heart attack, cardiac arrest, heart failure and diabetes.The search terms included heart attack, coronary attack, diabetes, mellitus, heart arrest and heart failure. Overall, they found 550,338 tweets tied to cardiovascular disease. Of those, about 240,000 mentioned diabetes and about 270,000 mentioned myocardial infarction, the technical name for a heart attack.The researchers then did a deeper analysis of a subset of 2,500 tweets.They found tweets mostly discussed risk factors, followed by tweets meant to raise awareness and those discussing treatment and management of health conditions.Supportive tweets, such as a thank you note sent to Tom Hanks for revealing his type 2 diabetes diagnosis, were the least common type of messages.“We were looking at not just what were they talking about but who were posting these tweets,” said Merchant.Those who sent tweets about cardiovascular disease tended to be slightly older than average Twitter users, with a mean age of 28.7 years, versus 25.4. They were also more likely to be female.“We also wanted to get a sense of the speed with which information travels,” Merchant said.She and her coauthors report that Twitter users respond to events - like World Diabetes Day - within minutes or hours.Merchant told Reuters Health that she hopes other researchers will come up with questions and projects that use Twitter.“We have billions of tweets about how patients and health providers are thinking about health and heart disease,” she said.In an editor’s note accompanying the study, Drs. Mintu Turakhia and Robert Harrington, of Stanford Medicine in California, write that there are still many questions left to answer about Twitter’s use in research.Beyond asking whether there is useful information in all the noise, they wonder if Twitter is representative of the larger population, what are the standards for analysis and are there any ethical issues.“Although digital health, broadly defined, is in its infancy, the evidence development is a major priority for JAMA Cardiology,” they write.SOURCE: bit.ly/2dfFoAL and bit.ly/2dfEhkA JAMA Cardiology, online September 28, 2016."

MJB caught wind of the criticism and chimed in on Twitter. “EVERYBODY SHUT THE F**K UP!!!!!📢” she said in a tweet on Tuesday which HuffPost screenshot before it was deleted.She went on to instruct her critics to “#takethat” and called them haters, crabs in a barrel and simpleminded ― all through hashtags.The last time Blige saw this much criticism over an ad was in 2012 when she stood atop a table in Burger King and sang about how tasty the flour tortilla holding together a crispy chicken wrap was. The commercial was pulled and Blige apologized to “everyone who was offended or thought that I would do something so disrespectful to our culture.” Though the ad for “The 411,” which airs September 30, probably won’t have the same fallout as the Burger King ad, Mary clearly doesn’t give a damn what any of us think.Bet she laughed at those memes, though.

So it’s somewhere that bullying can’t thrive.”In November, Colorado voters chose to have the state keep the money made from marijuana sales taxes.

It’s hardly ideal, but there really isn’t much else to do. Thirteen NFL teams are entering Week 4 in exactly that position, and three are talented and mature enough to dig themselves out of such a hole.Let’s look more closely at those three.Cincinnati BengalsAfter last season’s magical 8-0 start, the Bengals stumbled into the playoffs before losing a heartbreaking home game to Pittsburgh. This season, meanwhile, has started rather ominously, after Marvin Lewis and company squandered a fourth quarter home lead to Trevor Siemian. Yes, this Trevor Siemian.But help is on the way ― likely in Week 5 ― and it comes in the form of tight end Tyler Eifert, a matchup nightmare who hauled in 13 touchdowns last year despite catching just 52 balls ― the best catch-to-touchdown ratio in the league. Eifert, nursing an ankle injury, is arguably the most important player on the Cincy offense. With respect to All-Pro wide receiver A.J. Green, Eifert’s ability to run seam routes and create doubles inside the 20s helped quarterback Andy Dalton enjoy one of his most efficient professional seasons in 2015. And it’s no coincidence that sans Eifert, Dalton has just one touchdown pass to a wide receiver through three games this season.Carolina PanthersCarolina’s Week 1 loss in Denver should be excused, but it’s hard to overlook a Week 3 home debacle against Minnesota. The 22-10 loss snapped their 14-game home winning streak. Remember, this is a team that lost just one regular season game all of last year.Go back and watch the tape: The Panthers ― arguably pro football’s most physical team ― were completely out-worked and out-muscled by Minnesota. Cam Newton never found his rhythm and was clearly missing injured running back Jonathan Stewart, particularly in the pass game. His replacement, the second-year man Cameron Artis-Payne, could only muster 47 yards on 12 carries.Naturally, Newton makes everyone look better ― see Ted Ginn Jr. ― and he’s so special with his legs that a lack of protection often gets overlooked. But not against Minnesota and not while his most dangerous target went invisible. The involvement of wideout Kelvin Benjamin ― held catchless against the resurgent Vikings ― might just be the key factor to the Panthers’ offense getting back on track. Despite missing all of 2015 with a torn ACL, the 6-foot-5, 245 pound Benjamin amassed 13 catches for 199 yards and 3 touchdowns.“That can’t happen. That can’t happen,” Newton said. “And if I’m speaking for it, that won’t happen again.” When Newton proclaims something ― anything really ― he tends to back it up. And we should believe him. Even at 1-2, Carolina remains in great shape to win the NFC South and have the opportunity to reach a second consecutive Super Bowl.Arizona CardinalsArizona has perhaps been the biggest disappointment through three weeks, even more so than Carolina. To go on the road against a reeling Buffalo team and not just lose, but get embarrassed, 33-18, is completely uncharacteristic of a Bruce Arians team.Arians is a head coach known for preparation and his team typically reflects it. But so far, both his offense and defense have been underwhelming. Quarterback Carson Palmer’s four interceptions (and a 13.4 quarterback rating) are a rarity though, and between David Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, John Brown and Michael Floyd, there are simply too many weapons for Palmer not to right the ship.The defense, however, remains a concern. Unable to create third-and-longs ― mostly because of its inability to stop the run ― Arizona has allowed opponents to convert 45.2 percent of their third downs, tied with lowly Indianapolis for fifth-worst in the league. Just as bad, though, is a Cardinals defense ranked 28th in rushing defense, an area in which it excelled last year when it ranked sixth. The danger here is the temptation to start bringing its safeties into the box, especially on first and second down. And when they do that, their defense naturally becomes susceptible to play-action and the deep ball.Part of the blame ― on both sides of the ball and in special teams ― can be attributed to the Cards’ youth movement. But the 63-year-old Arians has earned the benefit of the doubt. That’s what happens when you turn one of the NFL’s struggling franchises into Super Bowl contenders practically overnight.“We’ve got a lot of young guys,” Arians said. “We have some new faces that are doing their own thing and not following the example set by these guys. And it’s a two-way street. They can only lead you to water, but you’ve got to drink it.

742,742,BUSINESS,"No, Donald, Pregnancy Isn't An Inconvenience For Employers",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/workplace-gender-diversity_us_57ed612ce4b024a52d2dab52,Generous maternity leave literally makes companies more valuable.,2016-09-29,Donald Trump told NBC in 2004 that pregnancy was an inconvenience for employers; a large body of research debunks that claim.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ed62171b00000d0cef33f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A certain political candidate once said that an employee’s pregnancy is an inconvenience to her employer. The thing is ― and I’ll employ his style of phrasing ― that assumption is wrong. When a company treats its pregnant workers well it can actually strengthen its business. Good maternity leave not only lowers costs, as studies have found, but can even boost a company’s stock price, new research from Morgan Stanley finds. Not only that. Companies with greater gender diversity have better performing stocks, according to the analysis, which updates similar findings from earlier this year.The findings were so compelling that Morgan Stanley now uses gender diversity to rank stocks, along with more traditional measures.“This isn’t just some marketing fluff to make us look good,” Adam Parker, an equity strategist at the bank who coauthored the study told The Huffington Post. “This is now impacting the investment advice we’re giving our clients.”Put another way, a major bank now sees that feminism is a core part of making money. The findings come as more and more businesses are offering more parental leave to their employees and paying attention to gender equality issues.Parker said an increase was notable in 2015 and showed up in the bank’s findings. The study should provide more ballast to those advocating that the U.S. needs to joined the rest of the world and mandate paid leave through federal law.For its report, Morgan Stanley analyzed about 1,600 public companies around the world and considered five measures to rate gender diversity: the percentage of women at the top, gender pay equity, work-life benefits and leave and diversity policies. The bank found that the stocks of companies that ranked high on gender diversity performed better ― they were less volatile, didn’t jump around as much and increased in value at higher rates. The stocks of gender diverse companies also have slightly higher profitability, Parker said.Looking at gender diversity is “a new and better way of investing,” he said.The bank’s findings are part of a wider body of research that has shown over the years that firms with more women perform better. Companies where women hold at least 30 percent of leadership roles see profits go up by about 15 percent, according to one study of over 22,000 companies released last year. When more women sit on a company’s board, it also does better, research from the women’s nonprofit Catalyst has found. McKinsey has also found that companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity have higher financial returns.The Morgan Stanley findings are notable because they look beyond the boardroom and include things like maternity leave and flex work policies. Taken together these could provide a more robust sense of whether women are treated equitably at work. So for example, gender-diversity ratings were not necessarily higher for companies where there are quotas on the percentage of women in the boardroom, Parker said. In Japan there are very good work-life programs and generous maternity leave, but there are almost no women leaders at its biggest companies, he pointed out.Why more diverse companies perform better isn’t definitively known but intuitively it makes sense that companies are better served when they’re making decisions based on a wider range of view points. (No one is arguing an all-female company would be ideal.) For consumer-facing companies, gender diversity is key to understanding their customers. The Morgan Stanley study didn’t look beyond the numbers: So we don’t know if diversity causes business success or if success leads companies to work harder on diversity. If you look at a company like Google, which ranks high for work-life, leave and diversity policies, you can see a mix of forces at work. The company was already financially successful in 2007 when it increased the amount of maternity leave on offer to 18 weeks, but after it did that the rate at which new mothers quit the company fell by 50 percent. “Mothers were able to take the time they needed to bond with their babies and return to their jobs feeling confident and ready,” Susan Wojcicki the YouTube CEO and a former Google employee wrote in the Wall Street Journal. “And it’s much better for Google’s bottom line — to avoid costly turnover, and to retain the valued expertise, skills and perspective of our employees who are mothers.”Parental leave naysayers like to point out that the cost calculations of offering generous leave are different for the non-Googles out there ― small businesses can’t afford to be so magnanimous. They have a point. That’s why most paid leave advocates recommend government policies that spread the cost of leave around. In California, which has already mandated leave, companies have found the program to be just fine ― in some cases boosting their profitability.Hardly inconvenient."

Kaufman and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/airbnb-tax-deals-scrutiny_us_57ec2589e4b024a52d2c8871,"Does the $30 billion startup, accused of covering up illegal hotels in New York, have something to hide?",2016-09-29,Airbnb has struck tax deals with major cities like Los Angeles and Paris -- but not New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ec27781700004007ac7f25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― As Airbnb enters into a flurry of voluntary tax agreements with cities across the country, one progressive advocacy group is trying to find out more about how these deals are struck and how they function.Facing accusations that it’s upending neighborhoods and violating regulations, the home rental service has recently been lobbying local governments to allow it to collect lodging and tourist taxes from its sprawling network of renters as a way to compensate cities. But American Family Voices, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, says these agreements effectively allow Airbnb to be taxed on the honor system ― and make it harder for local governments to shut down hosts who are running illegal hotels out of rental properties.On Monday, the group told The Huffington Post that it’s filing freedom of information requests with 11 cities, states and counties to learn more about the tax deals they’re cutting with Airbnb. Competing hotels are closely regulated and strictly taxed by municipalities, but renters and owners who sell nights in their homes on Airbnb’s platform are not necessarily covered by those same regulations, nor do they pay the same taxes, American Family Voices says.“Airbnb should play by the same rules as every other business is required to play by law,” the nonprofit stated in a press release Thursday.Airbnb pitches voluntary tax agreements as a way for the company to help bolster cities’ revenues.“Our community wants to pay their fair share and we want to help,” Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, told HuffPost by email. “These taxes were designed for big hotels with teams of lawyers and accountants, not regular people who occasionally share their space. As a result, they often go uncollected. Airbnb makes it easy for cities to collect this new revenue at virtually no cost.”So far, the company has collected $110 million in more than 200 cities and towns around the world, including Chicago, Paris and its hometown of San Francisco, through such agreements. Now valued at $30 billion, Airbnb began collecting a tourist tax in Los Angeles, the second-largest city in the United States, last month.But it’s been much harder to strike a tax deal with the country’s largest metropolis. Last November, New York City officials vowed to spend $10 million over a three-year period to target illegal hotels, which Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration blamed for exacerbating the city’s affordable housing crisis.In June, New York state lawmakers passed a bill that heavily fines people who list on Airbnb or similar sites apartments for fewer than 30 days without the presence of the owner. The legislation, introduced last December, targets landlords with multiple listings who list apartments on Airbnb instead of leasing to city residents. Violators could face fines of up to $7,500. Earlier this month, Airbnb threatened to sue the state if Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs the bill into law.The bill basically reinforces existing state law, last updated in 2010, that prohibits buildings with three or more units from renting out an apartment for 29 days or less.A June report commissioned by two housing advocate groups, MFY Legal Services and Housing Conservation Coordinators, found that 28,765 of the site’s 51,397 New York City listings last year ― about 55 percent ― violated that law.The report also found that neighborhoods already struggling with the social upheaval of gentrification ― such as the Bedford-Stuyvesant, a historically African-American enclave of Brooklyn ― were among the biggest hotbeds for illegal short-term rentals.After months of pressure from city officials, Airbnb released a year’s worth of borough-level data that showed 95 percent of users who rented their entire apartment had only one listing. The company billed this one-year “snapshot” as evidence of its transparency, and used it to burnish its image as a revenue source for low- to middle-income families trying to make rent. But the move backfired two months later, when independent researchers accused Airbnb of tampering with the data and purging more than 1,000 incriminating listings.“The intervention was so specific, and the timing so close to the date of the New York City snapshot, that the conclusion is inescapable: Airbnb removed listings from its site so that its data set would paint a more attractive picture of its business, to better influence media and public opinion,” Airbnb critics Murray Cox and Tom Slee wrote in a report they released in February. “It was a cover-up, not a move to transparency.”Collecting taxes from renters could be a way to further obscure the effect Airbnb has on residential neighborhoods, said Cox, a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident whose website Inside Airbnb tracks housing data on the company.“You have a platform that incentivizes illegal commercial activity that Airbnb has no interest in curtailing, and their investors have no interest in curtailing,” Cox told HuffPost. “They’re trying to maximize their revenue and grow as fast as they can for a potential IPO. Any kind of limitations would be bad for their business and bad for their valuation.” It may be tempting for some cash-strapped cities to cut deals with Airbnb. But residential property taxes are usually lower than levies on commercial spaces, meaning that, unless Airbnb starts effectively policing its platform, cities lose money on properties that now essentially function as hotels.“If these residential properties are being converted into hotels, there’s nothing that really compensates the city for that conversion,” Cox said. “For example, there should be higher property taxes on that property because it’s no longer residential.”"

Nathan Carman, 22, told reporters in Boston on Tuesday that he hadn’t seen or heard his mom in the minutes before their 32-foot aluminum boat sank off the coast of New York on Sept. 18. A week later, a passing freighter discovered him floating alone in a four-person lifeboat near Martha’s Vineyard.“I know I wasn’t responsible for the boat sinking,” Carman told ABC News. “I know that I wasn’t responsible for anything that resulted from the boat sinking. I know I wasn’t responsible for my mom’s death.”He said his 54-year-old mother, Linda Carman, was in their boat’s cockpit and he was at the front when the vessel began taking on water. He didn’t activate a distress signal, he said, because everything happened so quickly.“I didn’t know that we were sinking,” he told ABC. “I knew that we had a problem but I didn’t know that we were sinking until we sank.”Police obtained a search warrant and searched Carman’s Vernon, Vermont, home on Monday. Authorities retrieved three items, Windham County Sheriff Keith D. Clark told The Huffington Post on Thursday: a modem, a GPS SIM card and a letter written by Carman. The sheriff declined to say what the letter was about.The warrant lists Carman as under suspicion for reckless endangerment resulting in a death, news station WMUR reports. It asserts that the boat was in need of repair and that Carman could have made it unsafe ahead of his trip with his mother. Carman told ABC that he had done repairs on it but believed it to be safe. Police had previously investigated Carman as a suspect in hisgrandfather’s 2013 death, the Hartford Courant reported, citing a search warrant. That case remains unsolved, and there is a $250,000 reward offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the crime.Police believed Carman was the last person to see his grandfather alive. John Chakalos, 87, was found dead in his Windsor, Connecticut, home on Dec. 21, 2013. Police reportedly said Carman couldn’t be accounted for between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. that day. His accounts of his activities around that time included “several inconsistencies,” and allegedly he discarded his computer’s hard drive and the GPS unit that he had used on the morning his grandfather’s body was found. At the time, police requested a warrant for Carman’s arrest but it was returned unsigned by a prosecutor who requested more information. Windsor police did not immediately respond to a request about the warrant. Chakalos’ home was worth about $40 million, according to the Courant. His four daughters, including Linda Carman, were beneficiaries of about $21 million.

Nathan Carman, 22, told reporters in Boston on Tuesday that he hadn’t seen or heard his mom in the minutes before their 32-foot aluminum boat sank off the coast of New York on Sept. 18. A week later, a passing freighter discovered him floating alone in a four-person lifeboat near Martha’s Vineyard.“I know I wasn’t responsible for the boat sinking,” Carman told ABC News. “I know that I wasn’t responsible for anything that resulted from the boat sinking. I know I wasn’t responsible for my mom’s death.”He said his 54-year-old mother, Linda Carman, was in their boat’s cockpit and he was at the front when the vessel began taking on water. He didn’t activate a distress signal, he said, because everything happened so quickly.“I didn’t know that we were sinking,” he told ABC. “I knew that we had a problem but I didn’t know that we were sinking until we sank.”Police obtained a search warrant and searched Carman’s Vernon, Vermont, home on Monday. Authorities retrieved three items, Windham County Sheriff Keith D. Clark told The Huffington Post on Thursday: a modem, a GPS SIM card and a letter written by Carman. The sheriff declined to say what the letter was about.The warrant lists Carman as under suspicion for reckless endangerment resulting in a death, news station WMUR reports. It asserts that the boat was in need of repair and that Carman could have made it unsafe ahead of his trip with his mother. Carman told ABC that he had done repairs on it but believed it to be safe. Police had previously investigated Carman as a suspect in hisgrandfather’s 2013 death, the Hartford Courant reported, citing a search warrant. That case remains unsolved, and there is a $250,000 reward offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the crime.Police believed Carman was the last person to see his grandfather alive. John Chakalos, 87, was found dead in his Windsor, Connecticut, home on Dec. 21, 2013. Police reportedly said Carman couldn’t be accounted for between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. that day. His accounts of his activities around that time included “several inconsistencies,” and allegedly he discarded his computer’s hard drive and the GPS unit that he had used on the morning his grandfather’s body was found. At the time, police requested a warrant for Carman’s arrest but it was returned unsigned by a prosecutor who requested more information. Windsor police did not immediately respond to a request about the warrant. Chakalos’ home was worth about $40 million, according to the Courant. His four daughters, including Linda Carman, were beneficiaries of about $21 million. Chakalos’ wife had died from cancer weeks before he died.Carman on Tuesday again denied any involvement in his grandfather’s death.“He loved me very dearly,” he told the Courant. “I was like a son to him; he was like a father to me.”His father, Clark Carman, has stood by his son’s word.“He was not involved with his grandfather, with his mother.

Doctors even have a term for it: dermatography. These medical tattoos are not butterflies or lightning bolts; rather doctors use subtle coloration to make discolored areas match surrounding skin more closely.While it doesn’t cure disease, cosmetic changes made by tattoo needles can still have lasting health benefits, said one of the study’s authors, Dr. Rick van de Langenberg.“Scar and skin graft color abnormalities can result in impaired physical, psychological, and social well-being, especially in the facial area that is constantly visible to the patient and others,” van de Langenberg, a researcher at Diakonessen Hospital in Utrecht, said by email.For the study, researchers focused on 76 patients who received medical tattoos to cover scars and skin grafts left on the head and neck after cancer treatment.Most of the patients were female, and the participants ranged in age from 19 to 86.Many of the participants had skin cancer or melanoma, though some had oral or thyroid tumors or other types of malignancies.Researchers asked patients to rate how their scar or graft looked on a 10-point scale, with zero as “very ugly” and 10 as “very nice,” before and after they got tattoos. After the tattoos, average scores increased by 4 points to 7.8.In addition, researchers asked patients to assess their level of concern about the scar or graft contributing to a worse appearance or quality of life on a 5-point scale with one indicating “not at all” and 5 indicating “very much or often” concerned.This questionnaire had nine questions and after patients received tattoos the average score for each one of the questions increased by around one point.One limitation of the study is that it only included patients who decided to get tattoos, who may have had more concerns about their appearance or quality of life than people who opted not to do these procedures to modify scars or grafts, the authors note.Because researchers asked people after they received tattoos to rate their feelings about the results compared to how they felt before the procedures, it’s also possible that patients who benefited the most were more likely to join the study, the researchers also point out in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery.Even so, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that improving the appearance of scarred skin can profoundly impact patients’ quality of life, said Dr. Jill Waibel of Miami Dermatology and Laser Institute.“Scars are usually a reminder to a patient of a negative life event – car accident, cancer surgery, fire, explosion, war related injury,” Waibel, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.Medical tattoos are most often done to create nipples for women after breast reconstruction following surgery to remove cancer, and this may be covered by insurance in the U.S. when reconstructive surgeons offer the service, Waibel said.Overall, though, insurance coverage for tattoos and other types of scar revision treatment can be difficult, said Dr. Tina Alster, a dermatology researcher at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., who wasn’t involved in the study.There are also risks to consider. Like the ink done by tattoo artists, work done by doctors still carries a risk of infection and scarring as well as challenges for doing certain medical imaging techniques on the site in the future, Alster added by email.Whether tattoos or other techniques such as laser procedures are used, altering the contrast between the color of scars or grafts and surrounding skin can have a big impact on how people perceive their appearance, said Dr. Chad Hivnor, a private practice dermatologist in San Antonio, Texas, who wasn’t involved in the study.“Color is one of the first things other people will notice, and thus social confidence will be improved with a closer color match,” Hivnor said by email. “Our eyes pick up sharp lines quicker than softer lines and so that stark contrast in color between the two types of skin will be minimized.”SOURCE: http://bit.ly/2czvwze JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery, online September 22, 2016."

PATH has resumed service.HOBOKEN, N.J. ― Commuters braced for what could be weeks of disrupted train service in the wake of a deadly crash in Hoboken, New Jersey. A New Jersey Transit train slammed into the Hoboken Terminal during rush hour Thursday morning, killing a woman on a platform and injuring more than 100 others. The train destroyed the platform as it sped into the busy station, which thousands of people use every day to commute between New Jersey and New York City. Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, 34, a mother whose child was in day care at the time, was killed as she stood on the platform and was hit by debris from the collapsing terminal, according to NBC New York. Some passengers were trapped on the train after the 8:45 a.m. crash.New Jersey Transit suspended operations through the station, which needs major repairs, until further notice. The agency said that it was expanding bus and rail services to and from other stations, but that commuters should expect overcrowding and delays.Metro-North said that it was honoring tickets from customers who normally ride the NJT’s Port Jervis & Pascack Valley line trains through Hoboken.PATH train service to and from the station had also suspended, but resumed Thursday afternoon.National Transportation Safety Board officials are now working to determine the cause of the crash, and estimated that the investigation would taken seven to 10 days. Structural damage, leaks and “the possibility of asbestos” prevented investigators from immediately accessing the engineer’s control car, officials said.Witnesses on board and at the station described the train as approaching “way too fast.”Authorities said they would pull the train’s “event recorder” to determine speed and braking. The engineer, who was treated at a hospital for critical injuries, was cooperating with law enforcement, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said.“We have no indication this is anything other than a tragic accident,” Christie told reporters at the station on Thursday.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said the “silver lining” is that the massive destruction only killed one person.Kaitlin McCabe, who arrived at the station after the crash, told CBS that “there was water in the tracks ... the roof of the ceiling had collapsed.” Another witness told the BBC that “there was water coming down off the roof and people climbing out through the windows. There were people sitting down with blood coming from their head. There were lots of injuries.”Fifty-one people, including 40 with injuries described as minor, were treated at Jersey City Medical Center, officials there said. Others were treated at Hoboken University Medical Center. A New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said some of those injured were in critical condition.One Hoboken resident who rushed to the crash said she saw “so much blood, everywhere. It’s something I’ll remember for a long while ... It was very scary.”Janice Feinstein, 54, who lives 10 blocks from the crash, said her husband was headed to work at 8:50 a.m. when she heard about the crash. “I was devastated. My husband takes the PATH every day. He took a bus this morning instead,” Feinstein said.“It’s a scary thing,” she said. “It’s not an everyday thing, thank God, but still scary.”Jaime Weatherhead-Saul, who was on the train, told CBS that the car was packed and she’d been standing when it crashed. Passengers typically get up from their seats and move toward the doors as the train pulls into a station.“I saw bloody noses,” Jason Danahy, another passenger, told The New York Times. “I saw people crying.”The crash was on the Pascack Valley Line, which runs more than 30 miles south from New York’s Rockland County, through New Jersey’s Bergen and Hudson counties. It terminates at Hoboken Terminal, just across the river from Manhattan. There, morning commuters can transfer to continue travel into New York City.Matthew Brand, 17, who lives in Hoboken and takes the PATH train regularly, said outside the station that that it was important for commuters to keep in mind those affected by the accident.“I think we have to think about the people involved, the lives lost, over the idea of when I can get to work,” Brand said.Hoboken’s mayor tweeted a message of support for those people and thanks to emergency personnel: New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez (D) said he was returning to the state on Thursday morning:Ryan Grenoble and Kim Bellware contributed reporting."

R. Martin. All trespassers must die.We’re already halfway to that big thing-you-think-you’re-watching-is-not-what-you’re-watching twist that series co-creator Ryan Murphy promised around Episode 6, but things have already gotten pretty weird and very bloody. Most importantly, we learn that Matt and Shelby’s (Cuba Gooding Jr and Sarah Paulson) house is super haunted thanks to the murderous Roanoke colonists who once lived on its land. But “lived” may be a generous term. Through a flashback provided by medium Cricket (Leslie Jordan), Episode 3 reveals that the colonists are led by Tomasyn White (Kathy Bates) after her husband, John White, sailed back to England for supplies. Unhappy with Tomasyn’s decision to stay put instead of moving the group inland to search for supplies themselves, a group of men revolt. The men, including Tomasyn’s son, abandon her with an iron cage locked over her head in the woods. She begins to wither away ― until a mysterious entity shows up.Surprise, bitch: It’s Lady Gaga! The same Lady Gaga fans spotted in Episode 2 dressed as a deranged witch creature.Witch Gaga offers Tomasyn a delicious snack of still-beating pig heart ― in exchange for her soul, because pig hearts don’t cost nothing ― and Tomasyn, channeling her inner Khaleesi, takes it.Tomasyn then earns her nickname, “The Butcher,” as she sends her “regards” to the group of colonists who betrayed her, sparing only her son.In her last act of the flashback, she moves the remaining colonists inland, to the very land legally belonging to Matt and Shelby. In the spirit world, however, that land is already claimed, and thou dost not argue with Kathy Bates and her crew of stabby ghosts.It’s not yet clear whether the remaining colonists ― including Flora’s frienemy Priscilla ― accepted Witch Gaga’s disgusting proposal, too, or if they’re still hanging around House Miller for another reason.Perhaps the well-informed interviewer behind this season’s “confessional” segments has a clue. Maybe he can also tell us why Matt wandered into the woods to have sex with Witch Gaga and doesn’t remember it.Luckily, all of the ghosts seem to have one pretty simple Kryptonite: the word “Croatoan.”So, we say: Croatoan. Croatoan. Croatoan.“American Horror Story: Roanoke” airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET on FX."

I don’t believe true readers of the editorial page are surprised by this at all, because over the past year we have been writing scathing, scalding articles about Donald Trump.”Boas told The New York Times there was no consideration of disgruntled readers in his paper’s decision to back a Democrat for the first time in its 126-year history.“We know we’re doing the right thing,” he said. “We feel very good about this decision.” The Arizona Republic’s editorial said GOP presidential nominee Trump “is not conservative and he is not qualified.” Other reasons the editorial board cited for not backing the brash businessman included lack of foreign policy proposals, his refusal to release his tax returns and his insulting comments about women and minorities.“Each of those comments show a stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect,” the editorial board wrote.Other traditionally conservative papers have lined up behind Clinton in this year’s election, including the Dallas Morning News and the Cincinnati Enquirer. The Detroit News, New Hampshire Union Leader and Richmond Times-Dispatch each chose to endorse Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson over Trump.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Now, its largest bank needs help.",2016-09-29,German Chancellor Angela Merkel will likely try to prevent Deutsche Bank's collapse without bailing it out directly.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ed87b91a0000de085b5d75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What is the European Union’s wealthiest and most powerful nation to do when it risks running afoul of the rules it has spent years enforcing on other countries?We may soon find out when Germany acts to shore up Deutsche Bank, a financial colossus teetering on the brink of collapse.The government is likely to try to thread the needle with an unofficial bailout that allows Germany to claim it is still obeying post-financial crisis rules forbidding such measures, according to Mark Blyth, a political science professor at Brown University who specializes in international finance.“The Germans know the rules aren’t working and that they are backwards, but they are kind of in a bind with their own voters,” Blyth said. “When you have basically said that all debts will be paid and insist on your European partners paying debts, and then you bail out your own bank, that looks like a huge inconsistency ― which it is.”As a result, the “smart money,” Blyth said, is on the German government helping facilitate a takeover of Deutsche Bank by its smaller competitor, Commerzbank. In that scenario, the government would provide sweeteners and guarantees that would enable the acquisition to occur, but not a direct capital infusion or partial nationalization of the bank.Deutsche Bank is in trouble following the U.S. Department of Justice’s announcement earlier this month that it is asking Germany’s flagship bank for $14 billion to settle an investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. The bank is likely to negotiate a lower sum, but it now faces a crisis of confidence from investors that jeopardizes its existence.That poses a quandary for German leaders. They must prevent Deutsche Bank from failing for the sake of the country’s economy, but cannot be seen by the public to be rewarding banks’ bad behavior ― or viewed by other countries as violating the rules Germany has so strictly enforced.Germany, the de facto leader of the EU, has gone to great lengths to police other countries’ efforts to rescue their institutions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi against bailing out Italy’s foundering banks over the summer.Italy is a recent case study, but the successive onerous bailouts Germany has imposed on Greece exemplify the costs of Germany’s high-minded narrative about its own behavior. The EU, led by Germany, first bailed out Greece’s government in 2010 largely in order to save German banks like Deutsche Bank, which were overexposed to Greek debt. Most of the money Greek citizens have been forced to repay through several rounds of public spending cuts and tax hikes has gone to financial institutions ― whether foreign or domestic.But by structuring the first bailout as an emergency loan to the Greek government rather than for its own banks, German authorities convinced their public that they had given undeserved charity to the lazy, spendthrift Greeks. That has primed Germans to back ever harsher austerity measures, which have plunged Greece into a prolonged economic depression with no end in sight.Blyth anticipates that a non-bailout might have the added benefit of relaxing Germany’s official stance toward an Italian bank rescue ― effectively providing a “green light” for extraordinary action by the Mediterranean country’s government.But don’t expect it to change Germany’s posture toward Greece. The EU’s powerhouse approved the latest tranche of loans to Greece, but has failed to commit to restructuring Greece’s debts, which economists agree the small country will never be able to pay."

Their numbers are almost inconceivably vast, yet they have mostly not benefited from a wave of improvements to farm animal welfare policies announced in recent years by large meat producers and food chains.Of the 9.2 billion land animals slaughtered in the U.S. last year, well over 8 billion of them were broiler chickens. This massive number led animal groups to pursue more attainable reforms, such as banning the practice of confining mother pigs and egg-laying hens to restrictive cages for most of their lives.But with momentum on their side, welfare advocates are expanding their focus to the chickens we eat. Overwhelmingly, the lives of these 8 billion animals are nasty, brutish and short. Today’s broiler chickens are mere babies when we eat them.

In the famous words of Beyoncé’s ***Flawless, Kapoor unequivocally writes that no, she does not look red-carpet ready when she get out of bed in the morning. It takes an entire team of makeup artists, stylists and sometimes photo editors to make the star look flawless every day. “For every teen girl leaning into her bedroom mirror, wondering why she doesn’t look like a celebrity: Please know that nobody wakes up like this. Not me. Not any other actress. (Not even Beyoncé. I swear.),” Kapoor wrote. “... It takes an army, a lot of money, and an incredible amount of time to make a female celebrity look the way she does when you see her. It isn’t realistic, and it isn’t anything to aspire to.”Kapoor, who was born in a suburb outside of Mumbai, is the daughter of Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor. Her career took off after starring in the 2013 film “Raanjhanaa” and is now one of the highest paid actresses in the Indian film industry She described dealing with a lot of body image issues as a young girl, which led to “an unhealthy relationship with food.” She obsessively dieted and sometimes even starved herself for an entire day to lose a few pounds. “We’ve been taught that women need to be flawless even when our flawlessness is wildly implausible, sexy even when our sexiness is a break from plot,” Kapoor wrote. “We’re sprinting through Jurassic Park in heels, fighting super villains in strapless corsets, being stranded on deserted islands for days without a hint of stubble. Real female bodies are so taboo that hair-removal-cream ads show hairless legs even before the cream is applied.”The thing that keeps Kapoor grounded is the women in her life. “All the women who’ve championed me have taught me that kind, genuine support can change your friend’s or sister’s or colleague’s life,” she wrote. “Think of how much better your day is when it starts with a compliment. Think of how easy it is to give that to someone else. Do it every chance you get.” The Bollywood actress described all the women in her life who have made her feel beautiful just the way she is. From her makeup artist to her sister ― Kapoor writes that these are the women who have taught her that kindness and sisterhood goes such a long way. Now, Kapoor writes, she realizes that our imperfections are what makes each of us beautiful in our own way. “I know now that there’s nothing wrong with stretch marks, cellulite, or scars. They’re markers of our growth,” she wrote. “There’s beauty in their realness.” Head over to BuzzFeed to read Kapoor’s full essay.  "

By Sunday night, all the accounts had been reinstated.But journalists and activists continue to distrust Facebook, claiming that the company is targeting outspoken Palestinians because of pressure from the Israeli government to shut down alleged “incitement” from activists online. The activists argue that when they post material meant to critique occupation, Israel sees it as encouraging violence. Facebook executives held high-profile meetings with Israeli officials earlier this month.“Our meetings with the Israeli government were part of an ongoing process of dialogue with government representatives globally,” Facebook’s statement said. “We care about the voices, opinion and rights of all the different communities on Facebook and we will protect and work with them all, whatever their race or religion. Palestinian voices will be as safe on Facebook as every other community on our platform.”Amer Abu Arafeh, an editor at Shehab News Network, believes Israel is trying to reduce the criticism it receives for censorship by manipulating Facebook.“If I had been inciting violence, the occupier would have arrested me, as I live in the Khalil in the West Bank under the occupation,” Abu Arafeh told The Huffington Post this week. “What’s happening is they don’t want us speaking out, but they don’t want to shut us down themselves ― so they do it through Facebook.”The Israeli government is frequently accused of silencing Palestinian activists. In the past year, more than 400 Palestinians have been arrested for material they’ve posted online. This is a brutally effective form of censorship in the Middle East, where online communication is a popular organizing tool that’s generally seen as independent of government interference. Palestinians often use social media to spread information about people who have been arrested or killed by government forces.“Things like demolitions, tree uprootings, incursions into Gaza, shooting, harassing and taking captive our fishermen, shooting tear gas at school children walking to class ― the world would never hear about these things without social media,” said Saleema, a Palestinian activist who asked to be identified by her first name only, in a Twitter message to HuffPost. “With a giant like Facebook trying to shut us down & censoring us I feel like we are being shut off behind another wall that we can’t break through.”The Israeli government also has a history of jailing Palestinians over online postings. In July, 25-year-old Samah Dweik was arrested for sharing a Facebook image that she said was only meant to express support for people who have died at the hands of Israeli military personnel. Members of Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, a network of nongovernmental organizations, raised the concern of censorship to the United Nations on Tuesday.Israeli officials say they are simply trying to prevent violence inspired by social media posts. The meetings between Facebook and Israeli officials followed a wave of Palestinian knife attacks on Israeli civilians and military personnel over the past year, which Israeli officials have blamed on social media incitement. From September 2015 to July 2016, Palestinian attackers killed 34 Israelis. (In the same time frame, Israeli forces killed 200 Palestinians.)“Just as ISIS video clips are being monitored and removed from the network, we want them to take the same action against Palestinian material that incites terrorism,” Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said at the International Conference on Counter-Terrorism near Tel Aviv earlier this month.But Palestinians say the violence is not occurring because of social media posts ― it’s happening because of the deep anger that many people hold over 50 years of military occupation and human rights violations.Blaming social media for the aggression allows Israelis to focus on something other than their own state’s role in the occupation, experts say. When the debate is framed around social media, it means technology companies like Facebook have to worry about their own alleged liability in the fighting in the region ― and thus have an incentive to repress even innocuous posts that could one day get them in trouble. The pressure on social media providers is real: In July, the families of Israelis killed by a Palestinian sued Facebook for $1 billion.“What’s really upsetting about all this [talk of online incitement] is how it sterilizes Israel’s own role in creating these conditions, and attributes it to Palestinian culture ― saying Arabs and Muslims are inherently violent,” said Noura Erakat, an assistant professor at George Mason University. “The unfortunate part is that Facebook has been responsive to this, because they’re trying to protect themselves from a lawsuit.”If Facebook makes it harder for Palestinians to describe their own reality, social media will fail to deliver on its promise to help amplify the voices of oppressed communities, Erakat argued.Still, the Palestinians say they are not deterred. Abu Arafeh plans to continue reporting in the region and using Facebook when he can, he told HuffPost.“Treat the Palestinians as you treat the Israelis ― we don’t want any violence, we just want our messages to be heard,” Abu Arafeh said. “We are only asking to have the freedom to express our opinion.”"

But the U.S. refugee system goes far beyond the displaced Syrians. And, as President Barack Obama expands the refugee resettlement program next fiscal year, the number of Africans to be admitted will increase the most, for the second year in a row. The U.S. will aim to admit up to 110,000 refugees in fiscal 2017, up from 85,000 in the current fiscal year, Obama announced on Wednesday. Administration officials proposed the figure earlier this month. The presidential determination, the largest Obama has made as president, comes as anti-refugee sentiment is being stoked by Republican politicians and their presidential nominee, Donald Trump. The figure is broken down by world region: 35,000 spots allocated for Africa; 12,000 for East Asia; 4,000 for Europe and Central Asia; 5,000 for Latin America and the Caribbean; and 40,000 for the Near East and South Asia, which includes the Middle East. The remaining 14,000 spots are unallocated. The largest increase in the allotment is for refugees from Africa, with 10,000 more spots than in the 2016 fiscal year. The largest number of refugees thus far this fiscal year came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by Burma, Syria, Iraq and Somalia, according to State Department figures.The numbers are laid out by region, not by country, so there is no set figure for Syrian refugees. But the administration’s goal is to admit at least 12,000 of them, up from about 10,000 this fiscal year, Simon Henshaw, principal deputy assistant secretary of the State Department’s Bureau Of Population, Refugees, And Migration, told senators earlier Wednesday.Trump has promised to suspend refugee resettlement for Syrians entirely, along with restricting all immigration and travel for individuals from the country and others with terrorism concerns. (He has seemingly abandoned his initial proposal to ban Muslims in favor of a slightly less overt call to block certain Muslim-majority countries and screen for ideology.)Senate Republicans hammered Obama administration officials on Wednesday over refugee resettlement, pressing them repeatedly on whether the screening system is sufficient. Many senators, along with Trump, have argued screening barely exists at all.León Rodríguez, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services at the Department of Homeland Security, told senators the system was continuing to improve. The extensive process includes multiple interviews and repeated screening through databases, he explained. Rodríguez promised he would later provide senators with information on the number of former refugees convicted on terrorism charges since the 2001 terror attacks, after which the refugee screening process was strengthened. Sen. Jeff Sessions’ (R-Ala.) office tallied about 40 such convictions. In January, the State Department said there had been fewer than 20 refugees arrested or removed based on terrorist concerns since 9/11. The last instances of refugees killing Americans in terrorist attacks were in the 1970s, according to a report from the conservative-leaning think tank Cato Institute.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), raising the politics of the issue, asked for figures on terrorism convictions for the past eight years ― while Obama was president, not when Republican President George W. Bush was in charge.Cruz, who last year proposed admitting Christian refugees while excluding others, accused the Obama administration of trying to keep out Christians.“The refugee program as administered by this administration seems to have an enormous preference for Syrian Muslim refugees and seems to actively keep out Syrian Christian refugees,” Cruz said. Henshaw said that although Christians made up about 10 percent of the Syrian population before the war, they are only about 1 percent of Syrian refugees who have fled the country because many still reside in government-controlled areas. He said the U.S. is trying to strengthen its screening infrastructure for refugees in Lebanon, where some Syrian refugees have fled. Sessions insinuated repeatedly that refugees were responsible for honor killings in the United States, even though a report he cited on such killings made no reference to refugees. He also questioned why an individual’s literacy, knowledge of English and job skills were not considered when the U.S. determines whom to admit as a refugee. Henshaw told him that refugee acceptance is based on who is vulnerable.“I see no evidence to show that refugee communities are bringing these values into the United States,” Henshaw said of honor killings and anti-American acts. “What I see is they’re becoming good American citizens, members of the military, members of our police, people with ... American values.” Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), whose state has a large refugee population, said he thinks “one awful thing happening is one too many,” when it comes to terrorism. But Americans, he said, must weigh their values. “Let’s talk about what kind of country we are,” Franken said. “Are we a country that’s just terrified? Are we political leaders, are we officeholders whose job it is to give in to terrorists and tell them we’re not going to live up to our values that are there on the Statue of Liberty? Or are we going to be a bigger people?” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The actor is currently being investigated by the LA County DCFS as part of an ongoing investigation regarding an alleged incident involving child abuse. The outlet confirmed with DCFS that it is “very standard” for parents involved in an abuse investigation to undergo drug testing. “He takes the matter very seriously and says he did not commit any abuse of his children,” a source told People. “It’s unfortunate that people involved are continuing to present him in the worst possible light.” According to TMZ, who first reported the incident, the actor reportedly became “verbally abusive and physical” with Maddox, 15, while on the family’s private plane, which prompted Angelina Jolie to immediately file for divorce. Pitt’s parenting techniques and consumption of marijuana and alcohol also reportedly factored into the incident and subsequent divorce filing. While a source confirmed to People that Pitt is “cooperating fully” with the ongoing DCFS case, it’s unclear if the FBI will continue with its ongoing investigation of the actor. Since the alleged incident of child abuse occurred in the air, the FBI has jurisdiction. Calls to the FBI for comment were not returned. In her divorce filings, Jolie requested full physical custody of the couple’s six children, Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox.“This decision was made for the health of the family,” attorney Robert Offer said on behalf of Jolie at the time, in a statement to Reuters. “She will not be commenting and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time.” Pitt released a statement to People after news of the split, writing, “I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids.

The Veterans Equal Access Amendment would have nullified a Department of Veterans Affairs standard that keeps its doctors from recommending medical cannabis as treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, pain and other conditions experienced by veterans. Veterans currently seeking medical pot must obtain a doctor’s recommendation outside of the VA system and pay the expense out of pocket. The amendment, authored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Sens. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), passed both chambers of Congress earlier this year as part of a spending package funding the Veterans Affairs department. But in June, the provision was stripped from the final version of the bill during conference committee. Blumenauer, Daines, Merkley and other supporters of the provision lobbied their colleagues to get the amendment added to the bill again.“We feel the failure of the Conferees to include either provision is a drastic misfortune for veterans and is contrary to the will of both chambers as demonstrated by the strong bipartisan support for these provisions,” read a letter sent to congressional leadership. The amendment was never readded, and the Veterans Affairs spending package passed Wednesday as part of the continuing resolution to fund the government. “It’s incredibly frustrating and disappointing that despite broad bipartisan, bicameral support, a handful of out-of-touch lawmakers put politics over the well-being of America’s wounded warriors. Our veterans deserve better,” Blumenauer said in a statement on Thursday. “We will continue to seek every opportunity to make sure they have fair and equal treatment and the ability to consult with, and seek a recommendation from, their personal VA physician about medical marijuana.”Medical marijuana is currently legal in 25 states and the District of Columbia, and several other states will vote in November on whether to legalize cannabis for medical use. The VA doesn’t condone medical marijuana as a treatment for PTSD or other conditions due to the lack of studies on the effectiveness of the substance in easing post-traumatic stress. Still, many veterans have turned to the substance as an alternative to prescription antidepressants or painkillers, and some states specifically list PTSD as a condition for which doctors can recommend cannabis. The Drug Enforcement Administration announced in August it would open the door to more research on medical uses for marijuana, which could lead to eventual acceptance by the VA. However, the DEA still classifies all forms of cannabis as Schedule 1, the “most dangerous” category of drugs. The American Legion, the country’s largest wartime veterans organization, came out earlier this month in support of allowing veterans to access medical marijuana, and urged Congress to remove cannabis from the Schedule 1 designation."

Parker was eventually acquitted while his “Birth of a Nation” writing partner Jean Celestin was convicted (though he later won an appeal). Loeflerr’s sister later died by suicide in 2012, which her family claims was a result of the trauma she experienced after the rape. “[My sister] was harassed and hounded, and ended up dropping out,” Loeflerr states in the piece, as told to Variety reporter Gene Maddaus.“She had just aged out of the foster care system, so it was a big deal for her to go to college. She had a chance at a brand new life, but that was stolen from her.”Loeflerr goes on to criticize Parker and Celestin for including a fictionalized rape in the Nat Turner biopic ― a rape which galvanizes Turner (played by Parker) to launch a rebellion against cruel white slave masters. “I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape,” Loeflerr says.“I take it as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory.”The op-ed concludes that while the Nat Turner story is an important one, Parker’s version does not do it justice. “I will wait for a true version of this story to be told — one that respects history and does not re-exploit my sister,” Loeflerr declares.Read the full op-ed at Variety.

But the government thinks otherwise.,2016-09-29,"The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a case brought by The Slants, who are fighting a law against trademarking offensive names.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ed4ae91a0000f3045b5b95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The frontman of The Slants doesn’t like the name of Washington’s NFL team. He thinks the term is “an inherent racial slur” that is demeaning to Native Americans.And yet Simon Tam, who is Asian American, is an unwilling ally of the team, if only legally. In separate cases, the two are battling the federal government over the cancellation of their trademarks under a federal law that forbids the registration of “disparaging” marks.The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear Tam’s case, but not because he asked. He and his band were on the winning side in a December ruling against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that found the law in question violated the Constitution.“It is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment that the government may not penalize private speech merely because it disapproves of the message it conveys,” said the appeals court in the ruling, which noted that denying The Slants the request for a trademark amounted to “viewpoint discrimination.” The trademark office had earlier determined “The Slants” would be offensive to people of Asian ancestry.The Obama administration promptly appealed, urging the high court to review the ruling because, in its view, the disparagement prohibition “does not restrict any speech or restrain any form of expression,” and The Slants were free to use and advertise their name even without a registered trademark.The law “simply reflects Congress’s judgment that the federal government should not affirmatively promote the use of racial slurs and other disparaging terms by granting them the benefits of registration,” the government said in its appeal.But then something weird happened: Five days after the government made its move, the Washington football team ― whose own trademark had been canceled and was appealing the decision ― wanted in on The Slants’ case. Team lawyers filed a brief begging the Supreme Court to hear both cases together, because the issues are very similar and the justices would be well served by neatly disposing of both at the same time.The high court on Thursday only agreed to hear The Slants’ case, and if a look at the court’s docket is any indication, it appears that the NFL team and its owner, Daniel Snyder, won’t get the same chance. The justices may very well reject their petition on Monday, when they’re expected to deny thousands of appeals that accumulated while they were on summer recess.That should serve as a kind of consolation for Tam, who has taken great pains to distinguish his band’s name and cause from any purported justification Snyder may offer for his own team’s name.Through editorials, the band’s website, and even a TED Talk, Tam has maintained that his band ― a self-described “Chinatown dance rock” outfit that happens to be made up of all Asian-American members ― exists to break down racial stereotypes about their ethnicity.And if that takes dismantling a part of federal trademark law, so be it.“The fact of the matter is that this law has been unfairly targeting minorities since it was drawn up in the 1940s, and overcoming it would be a small but important victory in the greater battle for equality,” Tam wrote last year.The Supreme Court will hear Lee v. Tam during its new term, which begins next week.UPDATE: Oct. 3 ― The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the NFL team’s bid to have its trademark appeal case heard alongside that of the Slants. That case is still being appealed before a lower court, which means a favorable ruling for the band could also boost the team’s chances."

I have a son who’d never speak like that.”",2016-09-29,"GOP nominee Donald Trump has been fat-shaming women for decades, which probably won't help him dig out of his hole with female voters.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON― There was a time in the early 1990s when it was considered cool for a woman to be so skinny her tights looked baggy around her legs.As magazines glamorized the “heroin chic” look, women’s health suffered. It was estimated that more than half of American women ages 10-30 were battling an eating disorder, and in the U.K., the incidence of bulimia tripled between 1988 and 1993. Around the same time, a rich New York businessman named Donald Trump was body-shaming his wife, Ivana, while carrying on an affair with a thin 26-year-old model. Ivana Trump reportedly blamed herself, telling a New York Daily News columnist that her husband wouldn’t touch her because she was less attractive after giving birth to their daughter. “She threw herself into my arms, sobbing and crying and saying, ‘Donald doesn’t want me anymore. He has told me he can’t be sexually attracted to a woman who has had children,’” columnist Liz Smith recently recalled to PBS.According to a 1990 Vanity Fair story, Ivana Trump underwent a face-lift and breast augmentation to try to appeal to her husband, but he continued to body-shame her while he was seeing Marla Maples:He began belittling her: “That dress is terrible.” “You’re showing too much cleavage.” “You never spend enough time with the children.” “Who would touch those plastic breasts?” Ivana told her friends that Donald had stopped sleeping with her. She blamed herself.In 1996, when Trump owned the Miss Universe pageant, he called Venezuelan contestant Alicia Machado “Miss Piggy” because he thought she’d gained too much weight after winning the Miss Universe crown. Machado said the insults caused her to develop a severe eating disorder, like many other women who resorted to desperate measures to meet society’s beauty standards. Twenty years later, it’s no longer cool to be deathly thin or acceptable to shame women’s bodies. This year, a “plus-size” model landed the cover of Sports Illustrated’s notorious swimsuit issue, in a first for the magazine. Women are proudly sharing photos of their soft, stretch-marked, post-baby bellies on social media to inspire other women to feel good about themselves, and those posts are going viral for the right reasons. Celebrities are posting less flattering, un-retouched photos of themselves next to their magazine covers to remind people that photoshopped bodies aren’t real. But none of this has changed Donald Trump’s fat-shaming tendencies. As Americans embrace an unprecedented body positivity movement, the nation is also potentially weeks away from electing a president who viciously and unapologetically criticizes women’s bodies. “She was the worst we ever had,” Trump said of Miss Universe winner Machado this week, echoing his “Miss Piggy” comments from two decades ago. “She was the winner, and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.”In a 2013 interview, the GOP presidential nominee said that Kim Kardashian had gotten “a little bit large” and shouldn’t be dressing like she weighed 120 pounds. He reportedly told managers at Trump National Golf Club that the restaurant hostesses “should be fired and replaced with more attractive women.” And during Monday’s presidential debate, he defended himself for calling comedian Rosie O’Donnell “fat” and a “slob.” “Somebody who has been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell ― I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,” Trump said. Women are not impressed. Republican strategists are frustrated that Trump squandered a chance to pick up suburban female voters ― a demographic whose support he needs to win. And more than a dozen Republican-leaning women in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, told The New York Times that Trump’s name-calling and fat-shaming of women is a huge turn-off, suggesting that he may even lose some female supporters.“That is embarrassing,” said Kim Gray, a Trump backer in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “I have a daughter. I have a son who’d never speak like that.”Women’s votes matter: President Barack Obama defeated his GOP opponent Mitt Romney in 2012 thanks partly to overwhelming support from women. While there was a historic gender gap in that election, the gender gap in 2016 is shaping up to be even more extreme: A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found Clinton leading by 19 points among women and Trump leading by 19 points among men. But women tend to turn out to the polls in greater numbers: In 2012, female voters made up 53 percent of the electorate. Similar numbers this year could spell trouble for Trump.“I know this may be hard for you to comprehend,” actress Dawn Neufeld tweeted on Wednesday, “but it’s not okay to publicly fat-shame people when you’re running for president (or ever).” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Earlier in the summer, when nearly every survey of the race showed him behind, his supporters instead embraced poll denialism. And this week, in the aftermath of a presidential debate performance widely seen as moderately disastrous, Trump tweeted this:First of all, this is not true. Online polls from Morning Consult and YouGov both showed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “winning” the debate, as did snap polling from CNN and the Democratic firm PPP.Furthermore, what sets those polls apart from the ones Trump is citing is that they’re actually scientific.Scientific polls can be conducted by phone, via online panels or some other way, and use a mix of sampling and weighting to make their numbers representative of the larger population whose opinions they’re measuring ― whether that’s all adult Americans, or just likely voters. Recent changes in technology have complicated that process, but the underlying principle remains basically the same.That’s why, even if a scientific poll reaches relatively few people, it can accurately depict the opinions of a much larger group.In contrast, reader polls, like those Trump cites in the tweet below, make no such attempt to weight their responses or to represent anything beyond the number of people who happen to have clicked on them.As tools to accurately gauge public sentiment, such unscientific polls fail on a number of levels. The people reading any particular website aren’t representative of the public at large. Those who take the time to read a particular story ― and to weigh in on it ― are even less so.For a quick visual example of why that’s a problem, let’s look at some of The Huffington Post’s own surveys. HuffPost partners with the polling firm YouGov to conduct scientific polls using an online panel. When we report the results of those surveys, we’ll also often include a reader poll in the story as well.Those reader polls are just for fun ― the results aren’t actually used for anything. But it does give us the opportunity to compare the actual poll’s results, which are representative of the American public, to the reader poll’s results, which are representative of ... well, the people who took the poll. HuffPost readers who took a reader poll in one election story, for instance, were twice as likely as the average American to be “extremely enthusiastic” about the election:Respondents to another reader poll were far more likely than the public as a whole to say they’d fought with their friends over the presidential race.And, for whatever reason, readers who answered this Thanksgiving poll were rather notably biased toward stuffing.And that’s without getting into what’s possibly the worst problem with reader polls ― there’s often nothing to prevent people from voting multiple times.That leaves them vulnerable to intentional manipulation by people with a vested interest in the outcome ― a fact that some Trump fans took full advantage of. (For a similar example, see this tale of how the internet nearly named a research ship “Boaty McBoatface”). Trump isn’t the only one in his circle who seems to be confused ― or eager to blur the lines ― over what constitutes an actual poll. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, tweeted a link to a Daily Mail story referencing reader polls. As a pollster herself, Conway almost certainly knows better. She deleted the tweet a few minutes later.Fox News was also forced to circulate a memo after several of the network’s hosts, including Sean Hannity, cited unscientific polls about the debate.“News networks and other organizations go to great effort and rigor to conduct scientific polls — for good reason,” wrote Dana Blanton, Fox’s vice president of public opinion research, according to Business Insider. “They know quick vote items posted on the web are nonsense, not true measures of public opinion.”Handy rule of thumb:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Those who take the time to read a particular story ― and to weigh in on it ― are even less so.For a quick visual example of why that’s a problem, let’s look at some of The Huffington Post’s own surveys. HuffPost partners with the polling firm YouGov to conduct scientific polls using an online panel. When we report the results of those surveys, we’ll also often include a reader poll in the story as well.Those reader polls are just for fun ― the results aren’t actually used for anything. But it does give us the opportunity to compare the actual poll’s results, which are representative of the American public, to the reader poll’s results, which are representative of ... well, the people who took the poll. HuffPost readers who took a reader poll in one election story, for instance, were twice as likely as the average American to be “extremely enthusiastic” about the election:Respondents to another reader poll were far more likely than the public as a whole to say they’d fought with their friends over the presidential race.And, for whatever reason, readers who answered this Thanksgiving poll were rather notably biased toward stuffing.And that’s without getting into what’s possibly the worst problem with reader polls ― there’s often nothing to prevent people from voting multiple times.That leaves them vulnerable to intentional manipulation by people with a vested interest in the outcome ― a fact that some Trump fans took full advantage of. (For a similar example, see this tale of how the internet nearly named a research ship “Boaty McBoatface”). Trump isn’t the only one in his circle who seems to be confused ― or eager to blur the lines ― over what constitutes an actual poll. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, tweeted a link to a Daily Mail story referencing reader polls. As a pollster herself, Conway almost certainly knows better. She deleted the tweet a few minutes later.Fox News was also forced to circulate a memo after several of the network’s hosts, including Sean Hannity, cited unscientific polls about the debate.“News networks and other organizations go to great effort and rigor to conduct scientific polls — for good reason,” wrote Dana Blanton, Fox’s vice president of public opinion research, according to Business Insider. “They know quick vote items posted on the web are nonsense, not true measures of public opinion.”Handy rule of thumb:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

One of them, unhappy with his party’s choices for the U.S. Senate, had taken a selfie after writing in his dead dog’s name.The state defended the measure, arguing that it existed “to prevent new technology from facilitating future vote buying and voter coercion.”A lower court last year didn’t buy that justification and struck down the prohibition, noting that New Hampshire had offered no evidence that either of those evils had happened since the late 1800s. The appeals court on Wednesday didn’t buy it, either.“New Hampshire admits that no such vote-selling market has in fact emerged. And to the extent that the State hypothesizes this will make intimidation of some voters more likely, that is no reason to infringe on the rights of all voters,” Lynch wrote.The ruling represents a victory of sorts for Snapchat maker Snap Inc., which filed a brief in the case and was hoping the state ban wouldn’t survive constitutional scrutiny. The company got several shoutouts in the ruling.“Amicus Snapchat stresses that younger voters participate in the political process and make their voices heard through the use of ballot selfies,” the court observed in one footnote, which also pointed to research on how voters often flock to social media to publicize how and for whom they vote.In a statement, the social media giant praised the ruling.“Today’s ruling is a victory for free speech in the digital age,” said Chris Handman, Snapchat’s general counsel. “We’re thrilled the court recognized that ballot selfies are an important way for Americans ― especially younger Americans ― to participate in the political process.”Some legal experts have warned that ballot selfies could bring down the republic, but Wednesday’s ruling should help assuage some of those fears.As for everyone else outside of New Hampshire, check with local election authorities before you Instagram your vote in November."

976,976,BUSINESS,Danny Meyer Steps Up And Gives His Workers Paid Parental Leave,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/danny-meyer-parental-leave_us_57ec190be4b0c2407cdb5a5f,It's a heartening sign of change in the notoriously low-paying restaurant industry.,2016-09-28,"Danny Meyer, restaurateur and the CEO of the Union Square Hospitality Group, introduced a tipping ban at his restaurants last year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ec19b21a0000f3045b57bf.jpeg?cache=PIRVzt6dbD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"First, he banned tipping. Now, famed restaurateur Danny Meyer is giving all workers at his New York restaurants eight weeks of paid parental leave, according to Eater.com. The policy is particularly notable in the service industry, where the pay is low and the benefits mostly nonexistent. Meyer is CEO of the Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns 13 popular Gotham haunts, including Blue Smoke, Gramercy Tavern and The Modern. He also founded Shake Shack, which went public last year and isn’t affected by the new policy.Full-time employees of Meyer’s New York City restaurants will get four weeks of parental leave at full pay, and the next four weeks at 60 percent of base pay. Everyone who’s worked at the company for more than a year is eligible ― from busboys to cooks to servers to bartenders. The new policy starts in 2017 and covers all new parents, male or female, adoptive or otherwise. Meyer’s move is a sign that the restaurant industry, for which even paid sick time is a rarity, is feeling the pressure to step up benefits for its workers. Only 48 percent of workers in the service industry get paid sick leave, according to the Labor Department. Far fewer have access to paid parental leave. The U.S. is one of three countries in the world that has no paid maternity leave policy.If any restaurant chain was going to provide this benefit, it was going to be Meyer’s. He sent ripples through the industry last year when he announced his tipping ban. (Instead of tips, a service fee is included in the price of eating at his restaurants.) Other restaurants in New York and elsewhere have followed Meyer’s lead.“We applaud [Union Square Hospitality Group] for being a pioneer on paid leave in the restaurant industry, as it has been on pay,” said Ellen Bravo, the executive director of leave advocacy group Family Values @ Work, in a statement. “The policy will allow their employees to be more productive while being better providers and caregivers to their families.”"

Brahima, Ivory Coast, 2012, Ballpoint pen on paper",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ea9d991b00003007ef2902.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"”Since I can remember, I was always making things,” artist José Alvarez (D.O.P.A.) explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. “It was my way of dealing with everything that around me. It still is.”Alvarez, born Deyvi Orangel Pena Arteaga, grew up in Venezuela in the 1960s, amid a religious, traditional family. (He’d later adopt the moniker José Alvarez while illegally assuming the identity of an American citizen, adding the acronym D.O.P.A. to pay tribute to his origins.)As a gay man, Alvarez’s home country was anything but a home. Homophobia was embedded in the fabric of Venezuelan culture and Roman Catholicism, leaving Alvarez subjected to violence and discrimination from a young age. “It reached a point where I had guns pointed at my head because of who I was,” he said.Amidst the oppression and resulting isolation, art offered a rare vestige of clarity and control. “It was this space where I could handle the world around me,” he said. “I could be in control of the things I was making. You find solace and meaning and hope. I drew and I made objects, ceramics, all kinds of things.”Although he had a passion for making things, Alvarez didn’t immediately realize that he could make a career out of his artistic talent. The same cultural machismo that warned against homosexuality presented art as something emasculating, silly and without value. “To spend all day thinking about colors ― it’s just not a manly thing to do,” he added.It was the legacy of Andy Warhol that eventually moved Alvarez to pursue art as more than just a pastime. The iconic pop artist didn’t just work in drawing, painting, and photography. His whole life was a work of art, an endless stream of images and gestures charged with creative energy and fire. “He represented everything that I felt,” Alvarez said. Shortly after this realization, however, the course of Alvarez’s life was entirely uprooted. He had climbed a mountain in Caracas with three of his male friends. They were all sharing their future plans while looking over the city. “Suddenly we had all these Jeeps surrounding us,” he recalled. “They had guns to our heads, they went into our car and started ripping it apart. I was shaking. I thought, ‘I can’t do this.’ I just decided to leave.”Alvarez immigrated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a destination he selected because of its thriving gay and art communities. He did so with a student visa. It was a simple relocation given the extreme lengths many immigrants endure to have a shot in America, though the apparent ease came with an expiration date. After years of absorbing strategies designed to help pass himself off as straight, or hide altogether, Alvarez finally had a space in the U.S. where he felt free. “There was a community, there were all these places for someone like me to go. It was amazing, really eye-opening.” During this time, Alvarez also fell in love with the man who would eventually become his spouse. The whole time, however, he was counting down in the back of his mind, waiting for the moment when his time in the United States would run out. When it came time to leave the country, Alvarez weighed his options, desperate not to return to the place that viewed homosexuality “as a pathology.” With few resources and fewer choices, Alvarez was desperate. “Somebody offered me false papers,” he said. “Up to that point, I had never done anything remotely illegal. But there were no other options.” Alvarez was told that the papers offered to him belonged to someone who had since passed away. He resolved to use them temporarily, and sort out the situation later. “If we had been a straight couple, none of this would have happened,” Alvarez said. “I wouldn’t have had to make such crazy decisions for such a normal situation. As a gay couple we had no rights whatsoever.”In 2012, over 20 years later, it was revealed that the original José Alvarez was, in fact, very much alive. He was living in the Bronx as a teacher’s aide, and was denied a passport when trying to attend his sister’s wedding, subsequently investigated for identity theft. Eventually, artist Alvarez was arrested for identity theft and sent to Miami’s Krome Detention Center ― one of the largest holding sites for immigrants awaiting hearings or deportation ― for two months, as punishment for his violations.Krome detainees have long complained of horrific conditions within the facility. In the 1980s and ‘90s, inmates attested to being beaten and raped by guards. Although circumstances have improved in the years since, detainees still speak out against the corruption and abuse perpetrated behind closed doors.Much of the abuse is credited to the private security company Doyon-Akal, which was in charge of Krome’s surveillance until 2014. According to the Miami New Times, the company has been sued dozens of times in federal court, for offenses ranging from discrimination to negligence and wrongful death claims. “You get treated like an animal in there,” Venezuelan Noel Covarrubia, who spent four years at Krome, told the New Times.Alvarez had a similarly horrific experience. “It was really horrible, the worst time of my life. I was just sleeping for days because I was just so distraught and hopeless.” A fellow detainee named Julio, who came to the U.S. from Brazil, interrupted Alvarez one day, imploring him to persevere. “He said, ‘You can’t allow depression and hopelessness to take over. You have to fight it.’ At first I thought, mind your own business. But he began asking me questions.” It didn’t take long for Alvarez to share the fact that he was an artist. That led Julio to ask: “Well, why aren’t you drawing?” The inmate went to his bunk bed and returned with a pen and paper. “Draw me,” he said. Before long, other Krome inmates were crowding around Alvarez, hard at work, asking to be next. Not only had most of Alvarez’s fellow inmates never been drawn before, many of them felt they had never been truly seen. The Krome residents, who were referred to by the detention center using their home country and their detainee number instead of a name, had been stripped of their identity, dignity and even humanity. “They had been condemned to being invisible,” Alvarez said. “To most of the country, they have no faces, no names, no needs. They do not count. Through the act of drawing them, they felt significant.”More and more people approached Alvarez in the hopes of being drawn, a prospect the artist was thrilled to realize. “It was out of desperation ― a way of having something to do,” he said. “But at the same time, I knew it was an important thing. I thought, if people only knew what we went through to get here, it would create some kind of conversation.”Alvarez’s drawings, rendered with black and blue ballpoint pen on paper (the only materials available inside the detention center) don’t experiment much in terms of aesthetic or technique. That’s not really the point. The drawings capture, in plain and legible lines, the faces of real individuals who’ve spent their lives being overlooked. “It made us forget where we were,” Alvarez said. “It was a way to create a sense of dignity. That was the whole point.”As he was drawing, Alvarez would listen to the countless stories of risks taken, atrocities endured, families ruptured, lives lost, all for the possibility of a better life. One man named Roberto, born in Guatemala, told stories of visiting soccer fields as a kid, looking for deflated balls to cut in half and use as shoes.Ricardo, from Mexico, spoke of his harrowing travels through the mountains to reach the U.S. border, traveling for three days and two nights. The empty expanse he encountered was littered with kids’ toys and the bodies of those who did not make it, scattered around all “stiff and blue.” Two older women on Ricardo’s journey were lagging behind the group. They too were eventually left behind.Through his series, Alvarez hopes to shed light on the individuals who, over time, have normalized their invisibility as means of survival. “These are people who do work on people’s houses and no one even looks them in the eyes,” Alvarez said. “I’m just asking for a little bit of compassion and a little bit of awareness for this humongous group that has no rights. They have no acknowledgement by society and they are criminalized by the law. They go into hiding by necessity.”With the presidential election on the horizon, Alvarez’s work is as crucial as ever. Republican nominee Donald Trump has built a campaign on bigoted and hateful rhetoric lodged against immigrant populations. In 2015, Trump made sweeping claims against Mexican immigrants. “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists,” he infamously said, disavowing an entire population out of fear and prejudice. Alvarez hopes that, in the face of such blind hatred, people simply take a moment to suspend their disbelief, to imagine what life is like for people like Adrian from Columbia, Julio from Brazil, or Brahima from the Ivory Coast.“There is a lot of hate everywhere,” Alvarez concludes. “The only thing I would like to achieve with this project is to ask people to put themselves in these people’s shoes. Erase their anonymity. If you were in a situation in which none of your life needs were met. If you were afraid for your life. These are the innumerable stories I have heard. Please, give them a chance. Give me a chance.”Jose Alvarez D.O.P.A.’s “Krome” is on view until Jan. 8, 2017, at the Boca Raton Museum of Art in Florida. "

Before long, other Krome inmates were crowding around Alvarez, hard at work, asking to be next. Not only had most of Alvarez’s fellow inmates never been drawn before, many of them felt they had never been truly seen. The Krome residents, who were referred to by the detention center using their home country and their detainee number instead of a name, had been stripped of their identity, dignity and even humanity. “They had been condemned to being invisible,” Alvarez said. “To most of the country, they have no faces, no names, no needs. They do not count. Through the act of drawing them, they felt significant.”More and more people approached Alvarez in the hopes of being drawn, a prospect the artist was thrilled to realize. “It was out of desperation ― a way of having something to do,” he said. “But at the same time, I knew it was an important thing. I thought, if people only knew what we went through to get here, it would create some kind of conversation.”Alvarez’s drawings, rendered with black and blue ballpoint pen on paper (the only materials available inside the detention center) don’t experiment much in terms of aesthetic or technique. That’s not really the point. The drawings capture, in plain and legible lines, the faces of real individuals who’ve spent their lives being overlooked. “It made us forget where we were,” Alvarez said. “It was a way to create a sense of dignity. That was the whole point.”As he was drawing, Alvarez would listen to the countless stories of risks taken, atrocities endured, families ruptured, lives lost, all for the possibility of a better life. One man named Roberto, born in Guatemala, told stories of visiting soccer fields as a kid, looking for deflated balls to cut in half and use as shoes.Ricardo, from Mexico, spoke of his harrowing travels through the mountains to reach the U.S. border, traveling for three days and two nights. The empty expanse he encountered was littered with kids’ toys and the bodies of those who did not make it, scattered around all “stiff and blue.” Two older women on Ricardo’s journey were lagging behind the group. They too were eventually left behind.Through his series, Alvarez hopes to shed light on the individuals who, over time, have normalized their invisibility as means of survival. “These are people who do work on people’s houses and no one even looks them in the eyes,” Alvarez said. “I’m just asking for a little bit of compassion and a little bit of awareness for this humongous group that has no rights. They have no acknowledgement by society and they are criminalized by the law. They go into hiding by necessity.”With the presidential election on the horizon, Alvarez’s work is as crucial as ever. Republican nominee Donald Trump has built a campaign on bigoted and hateful rhetoric lodged against immigrant populations. In 2015, Trump made sweeping claims against Mexican immigrants. “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists,” he infamously said, disavowing an entire population out of fear and prejudice. Alvarez hopes that, in the face of such blind hatred, people simply take a moment to suspend their disbelief, to imagine what life is like for people like Adrian from Columbia, Julio from Brazil, or Brahima from the Ivory Coast.“There is a lot of hate everywhere,” Alvarez concludes. “The only thing I would like to achieve with this project is to ask people to put themselves in these people’s shoes. Erase their anonymity. If you were in a situation in which none of your life needs were met. If you were afraid for your life. These are the innumerable stories I have heard. Please, give them a chance. Give me a chance.”Jose Alvarez D.O.P.A.’s “Krome” is on view until Jan. 8, 2017, at the Boca Raton Museum of Art in Florida. "

It still is.”Alvarez, born Deyvi Orangel Pena Arteaga, grew up in Venezuela in the 1960s, amid a religious, traditional family. (He’d later adopt the moniker José Alvarez while illegally assuming the identity of an American citizen, adding the acronym D.O.P.A. to pay tribute to his origins.)As a gay man, Alvarez’s home country was anything but a home. Homophobia was embedded in the fabric of Venezuelan culture and Roman Catholicism, leaving Alvarez subjected to violence and discrimination from a young age. “It reached a point where I had guns pointed at my head because of who I was,” he said.Amidst the oppression and resulting isolation, art offered a rare vestige of clarity and control. “It was this space where I could handle the world around me,” he said. “I could be in control of the things I was making. You find solace and meaning and hope. I drew and I made objects, ceramics, all kinds of things.”Although he had a passion for making things, Alvarez didn’t immediately realize that he could make a career out of his artistic talent. The same cultural machismo that warned against homosexuality presented art as something emasculating, silly and without value. “To spend all day thinking about colors ― it’s just not a manly thing to do,” he added.It was the legacy of Andy Warhol that eventually moved Alvarez to pursue art as more than just a pastime. The iconic pop artist didn’t just work in drawing, painting, and photography. His whole life was a work of art, an endless stream of images and gestures charged with creative energy and fire. “He represented everything that I felt,” Alvarez said. Shortly after this realization, however, the course of Alvarez’s life was entirely uprooted. He had climbed a mountain in Caracas with three of his male friends. They were all sharing their future plans while looking over the city. “Suddenly we had all these Jeeps surrounding us,” he recalled. “They had guns to our heads, they went into our car and started ripping it apart. I was shaking. I thought, ‘I can’t do this.’ I just decided to leave.”Alvarez immigrated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a destination he selected because of its thriving gay and art communities. He did so with a student visa. It was a simple relocation given the extreme lengths many immigrants endure to have a shot in America, though the apparent ease came with an expiration date. After years of absorbing strategies designed to help pass himself off as straight, or hide altogether, Alvarez finally had a space in the U.S. where he felt free. “There was a community, there were all these places for someone like me to go. It was amazing, really eye-opening.” During this time, Alvarez also fell in love with the man who would eventually become his spouse. The whole time, however, he was counting down in the back of his mind, waiting for the moment when his time in the United States would run out. When it came time to leave the country, Alvarez weighed his options, desperate not to return to the place that viewed homosexuality “as a pathology.” With few resources and fewer choices, Alvarez was desperate. “Somebody offered me false papers,” he said. “Up to that point, I had never done anything remotely illegal. But there were no other options.” Alvarez was told that the papers offered to him belonged to someone who had since passed away. He resolved to use them temporarily, and sort out the situation later. “If we had been a straight couple, none of this would have happened,” Alvarez said. “I wouldn’t have had to make such crazy decisions for such a normal situation. As a gay couple we had no rights whatsoever.”In 2012, over 20 years later, it was revealed that the original José Alvarez was, in fact, very much alive. He was living in the Bronx as a teacher’s aide, and was denied a passport when trying to attend his sister’s wedding, subsequently investigated for identity theft. Eventually, artist Alvarez was arrested for identity theft and sent to Miami’s Krome Detention Center ― one of the largest holding sites for immigrants awaiting hearings or deportation ― for two months, as punishment for his violations.Krome detainees have long complained of horrific conditions within the facility. In the 1980s and ‘90s, inmates attested to being beaten and raped by guards. Although circumstances have improved in the years since, detainees still speak out against the corruption and abuse perpetrated behind closed doors.Much of the abuse is credited to the private security company Doyon-Akal, which was in charge of Krome’s surveillance until 2014. According to the Miami New Times, the company has been sued dozens of times in federal court, for offenses ranging from discrimination to negligence and wrongful death claims. “You get treated like an animal in there,” Venezuelan Noel Covarrubia, who spent four years at Krome, told the New Times.Alvarez had a similarly horrific experience. “It was really horrible, the worst time of my life. I was just sleeping for days because I was just so distraught and hopeless.” A fellow detainee named Julio, who came to the U.S. from Brazil, interrupted Alvarez one day, imploring him to persevere. “He said, ‘You can’t allow depression and hopelessness to take over. You have to fight it.’ At first I thought, mind your own business. But he began asking me questions.” It didn’t take long for Alvarez to share the fact that he was an artist. That led Julio to ask: “Well, why aren’t you drawing?” The inmate went to his bunk bed and returned with a pen and paper. “Draw me,” he said.

Trump’s statements, actions, and “how he conducts himself,” she said, left the conservative editorial board “no choice but to endorse Hillary Clinton.”Carroll stressed Wednesday that the paper’s endorsement of a Democratic nominee ― the first in its 126-year history ― was an affirmative recommendation of Clinton and not simply an anti-Trump stance. Indeed, editors touted Clinton’s “steady hand, a cool head and the ability to think carefully before acting.” Trump, they wrote, “is not conservative and he is not qualified.”The Arizona Republic’s board is the latest in a string of conservative editorial boards who broke with precedent to back Clinton.The Dallas Morning News endorsed Clinton earlier this month, making her the first Democratic nominee in more than 75 years to win the paper’s approval. “There is only one serious candidate on the presidential ballot in November,” the editors wrote. Last week, the Cincinnati Enquirer broke a nearly century-long streak. The paper, located in the critical swing state of Ohio, described Trump as “a clear and present danger to our country.”The New Hampshire Union Leader and Richmond Times-Dispatch, which have endorsed Republicans for a century and more than three decades, respectively, chose Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. The Tulsa World, meanwhile, decided not to endorse anyone after more than 75 years supporting Republicans. Trump struggled throughout the 2016 election to win over the more sober and intellectually rigorous columnists and commentators on the right. Most prominent conservative writers and pundits sided with Trump’s rivals during the Republican primary due to everything from his erratic temperament to racially insensitive views to his break with party orthodoxy. Some have continued waving the “Never Trump” banner into the general election.During the primary race, Trump won only a couple significant newspaper endorsements. He received a lukewarm April endorsement from Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post, which noted the candidate’s “amateurish, divisive” and “downright coarse” language. The New York Observer, a weekly paper owned by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, endorsed him days later. (Trump also won the support of the National Enquirer). Those three publications will likely remain in Trump’s corner and it’s possible he’ll pick up a few other endorsements, such as the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. But Clinton will surely win the overwhelming majority of newspaper endorsements, not only because more lean left, but because it’s becoming clear many conservative boards won’t stand behind Trump.Newspaper endorsements have arguably have less clout with each passing presidential cycle, especially as the media landscape becomes increasingly fragmented. And Trump was clearly successful in winning votes during the Republican primary without them, even as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio racked up endorsements. “Editorial boards do not pick presidents,” former top Rubio adviser Alex Conant told The Huffington Post. “At the most local level, they have a fair amount of influence. At the state level, they have some influence. At the presidential level, I think it’s minimal.”Still, Conant said he believed some endorsements were beneficial in the primary. “For the Des Moines Register to endorse [Rubio], and say he was experienced enough to be president of the United States, was helpful,” he said. Whether or not the endorsement swayed Iowa voters, Conant said it “resulted in a lot of really good publicity at a point in the race where we needed all the good publicity we could get.”Similarly, Conant suggested the trend of center-right editorial boards endorsing Clinton could bring positive coverage, even if it doesn’t necessarily translate to votes. John Weaver, a top Kasich strategist, told HuffPost that winning all the important New Hampshire endorsements ― except the Union Leader ― and the nearby Boston Globe helped boost his candidate’s name recognition and visibility. Kasich finished second in the state’s primary. Weaver doesn’t believe newspapers endorsements have the same sway as they did even four years ago ― and certainly not four decades back ― but he suggested support from Republican-backing newspapers may help Clinton in swing states.“I believe those do matter,” he said, “especially in a tight race when there are thoughtful Republicans [and] particularly suburban, college-educated Republicans struggling with their choice.”"

997,997,POLITICS,Police Body Cameras Are Pointless Unless Cops Use Them Correctly,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-body-cameras-charlotte_us_57eab405e4b0c2407cd9e77f,The devices can't help bring transparency and accountability if they're not turned on.,2016-09-28,"A Los Angeles Police Department officers demonstrates a body camera. As more and more officers are equipped with the devices, the policies that govern their use are coming into focus.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eab98d1b00007f08ef29b7.jpeg?cache=eBu3yhNZDN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Officers involved in at least two controversial fatal police shootings this month failed to activate their body-worn cameras, leaving critical gaps in evidence that threaten to undermine the primary purpose of the devices.Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, have come under fire for how they have handled video recordings related to the shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott, a 43-year-old black man killed by an officer on Sept. 20. The department’s patrol division is equipped with body cameras, but its tactical division ― to which many of the involved officers belong ― is not.At least one officer on the scene, although not the one who opened fire, was outfitted with a camera. The department later released the captured footage, which doesn’t show the shooting and doesn’t include audio of the events leading up to it. The officer was wearing a device that backtracks and saves a silent, 30-second portion of video once it’s activated, so the footage suggests the officer didn’t activate the camera until after the shots were fired. The lack of clear documentation has contributed to ongoing disputes between Scott’s family members, who say he was unarmed and clutching a book, and police, who say he was carrying a gun. On Sept. 11, an officer in Washington, D.C., shot and killed Terrence Sterling, an unarmed 31-year-old black man who police claim intentionally rammed a cruiser with his motorcycle. Although the Metropolitan Police Department’s patrol division is equipped with body cameras, the officer who fired that fatal shot didn’t activate his device until after the shooting. The department has since released body camera video recorded by the officer, but it only shows unsuccessful attempts to revive Sterling. In that footage, eyewitnesses can be heard saying that Sterling “didn’t do anything.”Body cameras have become a rare point of agreement between activists and law enforcement as routine police killings of civilians ― and disproportionately black men ― have created a push for transparency and accountability.The U.S. Department of Justice has given out tens of millions of dollars in grants to help equip local police departments with the devices. Many cities are in various stages of developing body camera programs, which law enforcement and city officials say will help build trust between officers and the communities they police.But crucial lapses like those in Charlotte and Washington are troubling reminders that body cameras can only provide a clearer picture of an incident if officers use them correctly. There have been numerous examples of police failing to meet these standards, either deliberately or due to possible mistakes.As more departments adopt body cameras, there will undoubtedly be more high-profile instances of noncompliance. And if their leaders don’t adequately address these issues, they risk completely jeopardizing the integrity of these programs.“The whole point of body cameras is that they’re supposed to serve an oversight function, and if police officers are not turning them on or are free to turn them on when they feel like, they will not be serving that function,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union’s speech, privacy and technology program, told The Huffington Post.“If they’re not helping with oversight, they’re merely another surveillance device focused especially on communities of color,” he added.There is little evidence that police officials are taking an aggressive approach to discipline. A review of the police body camera policies in 17 of the 30 largest U.S. cities found that most departments have laid out detailed language about when officers are “required” to record incidents. But as of the end of last year, only Denver’s agreement contained specific guidelines about how officers would be punished for violating these rules. Officers there must violate guidelines three times in a 12-month period to trigger a formal disciplinary case, and it remains to be seen if the penalties the department has established will be strong enough to deter bad behavior. Most body camera policies, including those in Charlotte and Washington, don’t mention discipline at all. A few include vague language about departments taking violations seriously, according to a policy scorecard of current programs. But overall, the matter is seemingly left up to the discretion of the officer’s superiors ― a trend that concerns people who are skeptical that leaders in law enforcement are interested in holding their own officers accountable.“A rule without enforcement is as bad as not having a rule at all,” Stanley said. “Disciplinary action of some kind at least must be taken against officers who fail to follow recording rules or intentionally interfere with a camera.”Although the ACLU and other activists say it’s essential for departments to show a commitment to cracking down on misconduct, figuring out exactly how to handle these sorts of policy violations is more difficult. There’s no indication that the officers involved in the shootings of either Scott or Sterling intentionally avoided documenting the incidents, for example. They may have simply forgotten to turn on their cameras.It remains to be seen how ― or if ― they’ll be punished for their missteps. But there are legitimate extenuating factors that could make police wary of setting concrete standards for discipline.“It’s hard to say officers should definitely get punished if they don’t turn it on ― there’s limited storage capacity, for example, so some footage might not get recorded,” said Phillip Atiba Goff, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and president of the school’s Center for Policing Equity.And in the case of police-involved shootings, where officers may be responding to rapidly evolving situations, the considerations get even more complicated.“In these critical incidents, police are always going to have a self-preservation argument, which is going to make it very difficult to hold them accountable,” Goff said.Officials will get better at determining the difference between intentional tampering and tactical errors as body camera programs evolve, Goff hopes. Refining that process may make it easier to lay out guidelines for appropriate sanctions or remediation.But in cities like Charlotte, where taxpayers are already on the hook for the millions of dollars and thousands of hours that have been spent equipping and training officers with body cameras, not everyone is willing to be patient.“It speaks to the culture of the police department that even when policies and procedures are put in place, that they feel they don’t have to follow them,” Corine Mack, president of the Charlotte NAACP chapter, recently told the Associated Press. “People want to know why we don’t trust the police department?”Like many proposals surrounding police accountability, body cameras won’t succeed without a department-wide commitment to building public trust through voluntary actions ― in this case, activating the devices at the proper time. And if we want body cameras to be more than just fancy new toys, we’ll have to pay close attention to the policies that govern their use.“We’ve been focusing a lot on giving police things, but not so much on how they’re actually going to use them,” Goff said."
1000,1000,POLITICS,Trump Backers Blasting Clinton For Poor Vetting Should Maybe Think This Through,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-machado-vetting_us_57ebd3b3e4b0c2407cdaa54d,"Did they miss Don King, peddling spin on Trump's behalf?",2016-09-28,"Boxing promoter Don King arrives for the presidential debate.

Clearly stung by his rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and her deployment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado ― a one-time target of Trump’s angry, xenophobic harangues ― Trump surrogates are now dredging up a criminal accusation from Machado’s past, in an attempt to shade the Clinton campaign for poor vetting.It’s a little rich, when you consider who Trump had in the spin room of Monday’s presidential debate, waxing poetic about his greatness.But more on that in a minute. In Machado, the Clinton team found someone from Trump’s past that confirmed a great many of the existing narratives about the former reality-television host. She was one of the central figures in a May New York Times article that detailed Trump’s interactions with women. Machado, who gained weight after taking home the 1996 Miss Universe title, says she was continually derided by Trump, who referred to her as “Miss Piggy,” as well as “Miss Housekeeping” ― a slight at her Latina heritage.However, prior to her ending up in the focus of the 2016 presidential race, Machado was briefly under investigation for being a possible accomplice in a 1998 murder attempt involving her then-boyfriend, Juan Rodriguez Reggeti. In this case, Reggeti was accused of shooting his brother-in-law, while Machado allegedly drove the getaway car. Machado had an alibi, and the judge in the case eventually declined to indict her for any wrongdoing, citing the lack of sufficient evidence tying her to the scene of the crime. Later, this judge would publicly accuse Machado of threatening his life after he indicted Reggeti.Monday night, Machado would once again find herself as the key figure in a would-be indictment, this time of Trump’s character.Since then, Trump backers have seized on Machado’s past with the sort of vigor that they ought to apply to Trump’s debate prep.The Washington Examiner’s Byron York is also sippin’ on this Kool-Aid.It is, of course, possible that the Clinton campaign did vet all of this and came to this determination: “So what?” But this discussion of vetting inevitably returns us to the puzzling decision of the Trump campaign to deploy former boxing promoter Don King as a surrogate ― an effort that’s been ramped up in recent days, and that brought King to Trump’s side at Monday night’s debate. King’s presence on Trump’s campaign trail is an incident that defies logical understanding, since it, too, confirms a particular narrative about Trump’s life as a fraudster. Jack Newfield’s 1995 book, The Life and Crimes of Don King, details several instances in which King was accused of defrauding boxers. More recently, King has had to settle out of court after being accused of similar acts of flimflammery by boxers Terry Norris and Mike Tyson (who is also a Trump supporter). King also unsuccessfully attempted to sue ESPN in 2005, claiming that the network’s “SportsCentury” program defamed him by, among other things, pointing out that he once threatened to break boxer Larry Holmes’ legs.Oh, and King also killed a couple of guys.Back in 1954, King gunned down a man named Hillary Brown after he discovered Brown robbing the illegal gambling parlor King was operating in Cleveland. A court would rule this a “justifiable homicide,” but it seems fair to say that all of the parties involved in this gunplay had made the sort of poor life choices that force words like “justifiable” to do a lot of heavy lifting.And 12 years later, King ― well ... he straight up stomped a man to death over $600. Per Complex’s Sean Evans:When, according to King, one of his employees “ran off with (some) money,” King pistol-whipped him and stomped him to death outside a bar in Cleveland. The employee owed $600 and his purported last words were, “I’ll give you the money, Don.”It’s enough to make you wonder if Trump is capable of the “extreme vetting” he promises to bring to America’s immigration system. Suffice it to say, however, this rather frenzied effort to tag Clinton with Machado’s past in a bid to discredit Machado’s specific and well-documented accounts of the abuse Trump foisted upon her is a dog that won’t hunt. Or rather, if it does, it will hunt down Trump buddy Don King and a pair of corpses.Nice doggy. Good boy.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."

Contenders and pretenders become far more evident, and hot quarterback play often halts with road tests. Week 3 of the 2016 season only reaffirmed this.Here are the three most important things we learned.The Eagles Are For Real This shouldn’t have been much of a question mark, but after completely dominating Pittsburgh in a 34-3 rout, we can confidently call the undefeated Eagles the real deal. As we examined last week, it all starts with 23-year-old rookie quarterback Carson Wentz, who has yet to commit a single turnover while amassing a 103.8 quarterback rating ― seventh best in the league ― along with five touchdown passes. Wentz has developed an instant connection with young receivers Jordan Matthews (204 yards, 2 touchdowns) and Nelson Agholor, both of whom struggled immensely in 2015 with Sam Bradford under center. And Wentz has been buoyed by a surprising Philly defense.After shutting down Cleveland and Chicago, the Eagles’ defense showed real promise Sunday by holding the red hot Steelers offense to three points on 251 yards. Ben Roethlisberger, meanwhile, threw for a season low in yardage and was held without a touchdown pass. In fact, through three games, Philly has allowed just 27 points. In other words, get used to hearing a lot more “Fly Eagles Fly” and “Wentzylvania.”Trevor Siemian Is More Than Just A Game ManagerSiemian, drafted in the seventh round last year before nearly retiring to pursue a real estate career, is still undefeated after going on the road to Cincinnati and beating one of the league’s better defenses. And in doing so, he became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for 300 yards and 4 touchdowns in a road debut. To put that number in perspective, consider that his boss ― John Elway ― only did it six times throughout his Hall of Fame career.This stuff just doesn’t happen ― not in this league, not with that lack of pedigree, and certainly not this early on in a career. But Siemian ― playing for just above the league minimum at $525,000 ― defied logic Sunday, when he led Denver to a fourth-quarter comeback, which included a gorgeous deep ball to Demaryius Thomas that iced the game. His perfect 158.3 fourth quarter QBR says it all. Not unlike Wentz, Siemian ― attempting to guide the Broncos to a second consecutive world championship ― displayed an uncanny ability to audible out of bad plays, only to find the correct play. “He didn’t just play. He played big in the game today,” Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said.The Pats Are Really GoodSurprise, surprise. After Jimmy Garappolo tried his best Tom Brady imitation, rookie third-rounder Jacoby Brissett performed admirably against a Houston defense we thought was pretty good. The bigger story here though, is New England’s rare ability to game plan and scheme regardless of who’s under center. With Brady set to return in Week 5, the Patriots will only get that much better, particularly with a defense that has allowed a mere six red-zone trips in three games, according to ESPN.com.Credit defensive coordinator Matt Patricia, along with Jamie Collins ― a longtime favorite of mine ― who might just be the premier linebacker in pro football.

1027,1027,CRIME,Suspected Chelsea Bomber Allegedly Attacked Family In 2014,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chelsea-bomber-domestic-violence_us_57e9534be4b0e28b2b552eee,"Like many men who commit atrocious acts of mass violence, Ahmad Khan Rahami is accused of first targeting those closest to him.",2016-09-28,"Ahmad Khan Rahami's father said his son attacked the family ""for no reason.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ebed211700002900ac7dc4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ahmad Khan Rahami unleashed his fury on those closest to him ― his family ― long before he allegedly planted a string of bombs in New Jersey and New York.That’s according to a 2014 police report obtained by the Associated Press. In it, Rahami’s sister, Zobydha Rahami, claimed that her brother threw items at her, punched her in the face, threatened to hit her with a dumbbell, and attacked her mother with a phone charger wire. When another one of her brothers tried to intervene, Rahami stabbed him.Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Afghanistan, was only charged for the stabbing. He spent a month in jail, and a grand jury ultimately declined to indict him. His father told reporters that Rahami was violent toward his family “for no reason.” It was that incident that inspired him to report his son to the FBI.But that was not the suspected serial bomber’s first encounter with law enforcement. Two years earlier, Rahami was arrested for violating a domestic violence restraining order. It is unknown who the order was intended to protect, as those documents have not been publicly released. If this pattern sounds familiar, it should. Over the past few years, many men accused of committing atrocious acts of public violence have had a documented history of abusing their families. A partial list: Omar Mateen, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, was accused of beating his former wife. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who planted bombs at the Boston Marathon, was arrested for beating his girlfriend. Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, the man who rammed his truck into a crowd in Nice, France, abused his wife and his mother-in-law.More recently, the young man accused of opening fire inside a mall in Burlington, Washington, and killing five, had a lengthy history of allegedly abusing his family.Arcan Cetin, 20, faced at least three domestic violence assault charges involving his stepfather. He was not convicted on any charges. In 2015, a judge told him that he was not to possess a firearm. CBS News reports a formal no-contact order was entered for both of his parents. Former classmates said Cetin was also known for sexually harassing women. “He would grope women in high school and middle school,” said one student. Another said he often talked about girls and rejection. While most domestic abusers reserve their violence for the vulnerable people inside their own homes, a rare few go on to commit heinous crimes against others. For example, most mass shootings in the U.S. involve a perpetrator targeting a family member or intimate partner. And according to one analysis of criminal offenders in Washington State, a felony domestic violence conviction may be the single greatest predictor of future violent crime among men. Domestic violence perpetrators typically blame their spouse or family members for their own failings, and feel entitled to hurt them, explained Chitra Raghavan, a professor of psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In contrast, she said, people who commit public acts of violence generally feel a sense of grievance against a group of people, and attribute their personal failures to society as a whole.So what would make a person go from attacking their family to attacking members of the public? One theory, Raghavan said, is exposure to jihadist propaganda. Latching onto a justification for violent behavior may give some abusers the permission they need to take out their anger on society, instead of their parents or spouse. “One possibility for the motivation is to shift the feelings of self-hatred and failure away from the self to society,” she said. “What starts as deeply personal then conveniently becomes ideological.” While Raghavan said it’s not reasonable to screen domestic abusers for their potential to commit terroristic acts, once a person is on a terrorist watch list, it would be appropriate to investigate their domestic violence history as a potential warning sign.______"

Garza, in an interview with Complex published on Sept. 23, spoke out against the idea of being more outraged over broken windows and lost property than over the police failing to take “accountability for the violence that they enact in our communities.” “The things that people get so concerned about is how do we stop the violence in Charlotte, but yet we’re not thinking about the fact that there’s been violence in Charlotte since way before whatever is happening there has happened,” Garza said. For the 35-year-old activist, unrest in disenfranchised black communities should come as no surprise. Instead of placing sole blame on the black people who live in these communities, Garza argued, we should explore the circumstances that lead to this unrest. “How do we stop violence, looting, and riots? The way that we stop that is by making sure that people have the things that they need to thrive,” Garza added.“When people are systematically denied their right to adequate housing, adequate schools, to adequate food, to dignity ― this is a response and a reaction that we should absolutely expect.”Protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, have continued peacefully ― a midnight curfew imposed during the violent protests that erupted last week was lifted on Monday."

He has vowed to rip up trade deals, negotiate with allies to make them pay more for their U.S. defense protection, and have Mexico pay for a wall he has proposed along the southern U.S. border. If elected, he would be the first billionaire to serve as president, according to Forbes.Details of Trump’s wealth are not publicly known because, bucking a decades-old tradition of U.S. presidential candidates, he has refused to release his tax returns. His Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, earned $10.75 million in 2015 alongside her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, their tax filing showed.Clinton and others, including some prominent Republicans, have pressed Trump to release his returns. They have also raised questions about his net worth as well as his charitable contributions and business ties.Forbes said its analysis did not place any value on Trump’s brand. It also disputed Trump’s assertion in Monday night’s presidential debate that he reported $694 million in income from last year to the Federal Election Commission. Forbes said Trump mixed revenue and income in the document.Trump has so far given $54 million to his presidential campaign. His campaign has also paid his companies for office space in Trump Tower and use of his private airline, among other expenses, federal election filings have shown. Politico reported separately on Wednesday that Trump is considering giving more money to his campaign to fund an advertising blitz, citing three sources close to him.Amid the campaign, Trump made just one real estate deal in the past year: purchasing a Charleston, South Carolina, warehouse that was in foreclosure, Forbes said.(Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson and Grant Smith; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry)"
1045,1045,SPORTS,Former USC Football Player Sues NCAA Over 'Unpaid Wages',Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/usc-ncaa-college-athlete-lawsuit_us_57ebd3eee4b024a52d2bb092,A new lawsuit claims that NCAA athletes are employees who aren't properly compensated.,2016-09-28,Lamar Dawson (55) says the NCAA and PAC-12 violated federal and state wage and hour laws while he was a football player at USC.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ebda5c1700002900ac7d35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"College athletes are employees who should be paid wages, a former University of Southern California football player asserts in a lawsuit filed against the NCAA and the PAC‑12 Conference this week.Lamar Dawson, who played linebacker at USC from 2011 to 2015, filed the proposed class-action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Monday.The lawsuit differs from other high-profile cases against the NCAA, which have alleged that the governing organization for college sports has violated antitrust law by placing artificial caps on the amount of money athletes can receive.This suit, by contrast, contends that athletes meet the definition of “employees” under both federal and California state wage and hour laws, and that the NCAA and PAC-12 violated those laws by not properly compensating them for work and overtime. Players, it says, were required to work more than eight hours a day and 40 hours a week without adequate compensation, and the suit seeks unpaid wages, overtime pay and damages.At USC, Dawson was “repeatedly paid a substandard wage insofar as he was denied full pay for all hours worked, including overtime pay, and was frequently permitted to work without receiving required minimum wage payments,” according to the suit. Both the PAC-12 and NCAA said they disagreed with the claim.“We are currently evaluating the claim, but strongly disagree with the notion that college students participating in athletics are employees,” NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy said in an email statement. “Our experience is that these college students, like their non-athlete colleagues, are very focused on their academic endeavors. Moreover, they have a passion for their sport and a commitment to their teammates that can’t be equated to punching a time clock.”“We have conducted an initial review of the complaint and will vigorously defend ourselves,” a PAC-12 spokesperson said. “As has been made clear through the legal process, student-athletes are not employees.”The suit’s claim rests on the argument that under NCAA and conference rules, school athletic programs exert enough control over athletes to qualify them as employees under federal and state labor law. That argument is similar to the one Northwestern University football players made when they attempted in 2014 to create the first players union for college athletes ― however, those players made no mention of wages.The Chicago regional chapter of the National Labor Relations Board agreed that the Northwestern athletes met the definition of “employee” under federal labor law. The full NLRB, however, invalidated that ruling when it declined last year to assert its jurisdiction in the case.In February, a federal court in Indiana dismissed a suit filed by track and field athletes at the University of Pennsylvania that was similar to Dawson’s. The athletes have appealed the ruling.Mark C. Rifkin, one of Dawson’s attorneys, believes the new case is stronger because it involves college football players.“I think there’s something special about players in the big-revenue, big-money sports like [major conference] football,” Rifkin said. “It’s just different. All athletes make great sacrifices, and they all make great contributions, but players who play in big-time, big-revenue sports really stand in a different position. It’s a totally different relationship between the conference and the player and the NCAA and the player.”The NCAA is currently facing at least two other major legal challenges over compensation for college athletes. A class-action antitrust suit originally brought by former UCLA basketball star Ed O’Bannon could soon end up in front of the Supreme Court; in August, a federal judge rejected the NCAA’s efforts to dismiss another antitrust case headed by prominent labor attorney Jeffrey Kessler.Rifkin’s case differs from those, but he said it takes on the same basic idea.“These are all part of a sort of growing trend toward recognizing student-athletes as participants in a major business venture, and treating them fairly given their role in that business,” Rifkin said."

But his latest declaration that the real estate mogul had scored an important victory in the race for the presidency grabbed headlines left and right.The filmmaker praised Clinton for her performance and noted her “exquisite sense of humor” on Wednesday.

If the court finds Moore liable, it could remove him from the state Supreme Court for the second time in his career. Moore stands accused of ordering Alabama probate judges to defy a federal injunction in violation of his ethical duties as Alabama’s top judge.Expelling Moore would require unanimity from the special court’s nine judges, while a simple majority could enact more modest punishments. The court will announce its decision within 10 days.The chief justice effectively admitted to the charges against him in his testimony on Wednesday, according to Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery-based civil rights group that submitted the original complaints against Moore.“Roy Moore’s own words convicted him,” Cohen said. “I wish everyone in Alabama could have been in the courtroom to hear him.”Liberty Counsel, the law firm that defended Kim Davis, an anti-same-sex marriage county clerk in Kentucky, is representing Moore in court.Mat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, said he was “very pleased with how the case went today.” It is clear, Staver added, that Moore’s January ruling was a “status report,” rather than an order. “The Alabama Supreme Court had the case pending about what to do with the federal orders and they did not rule on it,” he said.The trial on Wednesday was among the final stages of a last-gasp, conservative stand against federal same-sex marriage law that began with Moore’s administrative ruling in January.In taking steps to prevent state probate judges from providing same-sex marriage licenses, Moore argued that the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision in June 2015 only explicitly overturned same-sex marriage bans in the handful of states whose bans were challenged in the case. Alabama was not one of them. A federal court had already overturned Alabama’s same-sex marriage ban several months prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, however. But Moore and his court’s intervention following that ruling brought much confusion to same-sex couples, even after the high court declared they had a constitutional right to marry.The Southern Poverty Law Center lodged an ethics complaint against Moore with the state’s Judicial Inquiry Commission shortly after Moore’s administrative ruling in January. The commission decided in May to proceed with ethics charges against Moore before the Court of the Judiciary, resulting in his suspension, which remains in effect.Crowds of Moore’s supporters and critics were on hand at the Court of the Judiciary on Wednesday. Moore has held controversial religious positions for decades ― and gotten in trouble for them. He was previously kicked off the bench in 2003 for refusing to obey a federal order to remove a stone monument to the Ten Commandments from the state Supreme Court. (He installed the monument in the court’s rotunda overnight one night in 2001.)The way Moore’s obstructionism affects ordinary people sometimes gets lost in the legal jargon and pitched political rhetoric. Paul Hard, an Alabama resident, married his late husband in Massachusetts in 2011. But when his husband died in an accident a few months later, Hard was unable to obtain legal standing as his spouse, precluding him from initiating a wrongful death lawsuit.“Throughout my struggle with recognition, the last person in Alabama holding up the recognition of my marriage was Roy Moore,” Hard wrote in an AL.com op-ed on Wednesday.Although Moore’s removal might provide relief for Alabamans like Hard and deter other would-be legal crusaders, it is far from a political death knell for Moore.Alabama voters elected Moore chief justice again by a wide margin in 2012 after his 2003 removal.If removed from the state Supreme Court once again, Moore will not be eligible to run again, but that will not stop him from seeking other political posts. In fact, another ejection may lift Moore’s political fortunes.Moore unsuccessfully sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2006 and 2010. There is speculation he may do so again.“Some people have criticized us for filing complaints against him because he will ride those complaints into martyrdom in the governor’s mansion,” Cohen said. But, Cohen concluded, “We cannot speculate about political consequences down the road. We have got to do what needs to be done.”"

In Charlotte, rioting prompted the authorities to impose a state of emergency.Similar deaths have added to a torrent of accusations over racial bias in U.S. law enforcement and calls for greater police accountability for the killings of black people.The El Cajon Police Department said two officers had responded to a call regarding a man walking in traffic. He refused their instructions to remove his hand from his pocket and then pulled out an object from his pants and pointed it at them, the department said in a statement.The officers then simultaneously shot and Tasered the man who died after being taken to the hospital, the department said.During a news conference hours after the shooting, El Cajon Police Department Jeff Davis said no weapon was found on the scene. He did not say what exactly the man pointed at the unidentified officers.The incident prompted crowds of people to gather throughout Tuesday night at the scene and at the El Cajon Police Department, where they demanded information about the shooting, according to local media.Video emerged on social media purportedly showing the moments after the incident at the scene. In the video, a woman, who claimed to be the man’s sister, is heard saying that she called police.“Oh my God. You killed my brother. I just called for help and ... you killed him,” the unidentified woman said as she sobbed.A bystander voluntarily provided investigators cell phone video that captured the incident, police said.Police released a still photo from the video that depicted what appeared to be two officers pointing weapons at an individual who was pointed an object at them. At least one of the officers in the photo appeared to be white.A study released in July shows police used force on black people at rates more than three times higher than for whites.“Now is a time for calm,” Davis said at the news conference.“I implore the community to be patient with us, work with us, look at the facts at hand before making any judgment.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros is pushing to litigate her sexual harassment claim against ex-Fox News chief Roger Ailes in court and has new documents that bolster her case, her lawyer said Wednesday. Tantaros has accused Ailes and other leaders at the network, including co-president Bill Shine, of harassing her. Her attorney, Judd Burstein, says a recent court filing with sworn statements from Tantaros’ former clinical therapist corroborate these claims. Dr. Michele Berdy said in the sworn affidavit filed Sept. 15 that Tantaros initially came to see her in late 2013 to cope with her brother’s death. Soon after, she said, Tantaros brought up how she was being treated by Ailes, Shine, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly and Fox News PR boss Irena Briganti. Berdy affirmed Tantaros’ previously reported claims that Ailes asked her to turn around so he could view her backside; advised her to wear tighter dresses; asked her about the sex lives of various Fox News employees; inquired whether she planned to marry; spoke to her about how he thought she would look in a bikini; and berated her over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend.“Dr. Berdy’s affidavit unequivocally demonstrates that Mr. Shine and Mr. Ailes are not only misogynists; they are liars,” Burstein said in a statement. Berdy said she reached out to Tantaros after reading that Fox News was denying the former host’s claims.“I emailed Andrea to let her know I knew she was telling the truth because she had told me, in a therapeutic setting where she would have no motive to lie, about the conduct of Mr. Ailes, Mr. Shine, Mr. O’Reilly, Ms. Briganti and others at the time,” Berdy wrote. Tantaros waived her patient-client privilege regarding these sessions, according to Burstein.Ailes stepped down from his role as chairman and CEO of the network in July with a $40 million severance. Tantaros is one of about 20 women who has accused him of harassment. Fox News reached a $20 million settlement with former host Gretchen Carlson, who reportedly recorded incriminating conversations with Ailes, earlier this month. Tantaros has rejected a “seven-figure” payout to renounce her claims, Burstein said. Fox News’ parent company, 21st Century Fox, filed a motion last month to force Tantaros into arbitration.“This is not going to be a case of just writing a large check,” Burstein told The Huffington Post by phone Wednesday. “Our view is that if Roger Ailes can walk off with a $40 million award for being a sexual predator, one of his victims should at least receive as much.”“There’s no amount in the world that will result in just a settlement — she’s not going to settle for just dollars,” he added. “There has to be an admission of what was done to her, and there has to be systemic change.” “We stand by our earlier motion to compel arbitration,” Fox News said in a statement. Tantaros’ goal is to clean house at Fox News and eradicate what Burstein called a “sexist, humiliating, eroticized culture of misogyny, intimidation and pervasive sexual thuggery.” Tantaros maintains she was demoted in retaliation for resisting Ailes’ advances and complaining about how he treated her, including to Shine and the company’s human resources department. A spokeswoman for 21st Century Fox did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The company has previously said that Tantaros was not retaliated against for her complaints but rather disciplined for breaking company policy after she failed to let the network vet a book she wrote.This article has been updated with a statement from Fox News.

Scientists say we won't see a month below that symbolic benchmark ""ever again.""",2016-09-28,"This year is on track to be the hottest on record. Climate change has been linked to several extreme weather events this year, including droughts and floods.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eb8fd41b00007f08ef2be6.jpeg?cache=2mtTJiFHfx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The world has hit a global warming milestone it may never recover from.Scientists at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii announced in 2013 that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a daily average above 400 parts per million for the first time in history. CO2 concentrations “haven’t been this high in millions of years,” said scientist Erika Podest at the time. “This milestone is a wake-up call.”But the situation has only gotten worse. Worldwide, 400 ppm, which indicates the ratio of carbon dioxide to other gases in the atmosphere, started to be read more consistently and in more locations. Last March, global CO2 levels topped the symbolic benchmark for an entire month — a first since record-keeping began. Antarctica, the last place on Earth without a 400 ppm reading, finally reached it in May.Now scientists say we’ve arrived at yet another critical climate change juncture: CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm this month— and it may not fall below that mark ever again.“I think we’re essentially over for good,” said Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps Institute for Oceanography’s carbon dioxide monitoring program in May.Keeling explained in a Friday blog post how CO2 levels had consistently topped 400 ppm for the month of September ― typically the time of year when atmospheric carbon dioxide is at its lowest. The Scripps Institute monitors CO2 levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory, the world’s marquee site for carbon dioxide monitoring.“The low point reflects the transition between summer and fall, when the uptake of CO2 by vegetation weakens and is overtaken by the release of CO2 from soils,” he wrote. “Is it possible that October 2016 will yield a lower monthly value than September and dip below 400 ppm? Almost impossible.”Though one-off lower measurements could still be read in the coming weeks, Keeling said “it already seems safe to conclude that we won’t be seeing a monthly value below 400 ppm this year ― or ever again for the indefinite future.”And since carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds, sometimes thousands of years, even the most rigorous climate action won’t dampen this figure. Not this century, anyway. If CO2 emissions, for example, somehow plummeted to zero tomorrow, carbon dioxide levels “probably wouldn’t change much ... but would start to fall off in a decade or so,” Gavin Schmidt, NASA’s chief climate scientist, told Climate Central. “In my opinion, we won’t ever see a month below 400 ppm.”The 400 ppm level is more a symbolic number than a “tipping point,” as some have suggested. There isn’t, for instance, a marked difference between the climate impacts of 390 ppm and 405 ppm. But scientists say the psychological effect of the figure is significant.“When you focus on the fact that it’s moving through thresholds like that, you get an appreciation for how it’s actually changing,” Keeling told The Hufington Post in an earlier interview. “I think people accept the reality that CO2 is rising, but they don’t have a grasp of what it means quantitatively. I hope people remember this moment so that when the hear the carbon dioxide levels are 420 parts per million in a matter of years, they’ll say, ‘I remember when it was 400.’”Scientists say 420 ppm is in our near future, based on current trends. Carbon dioxide levels are increasing by more than 2 parts per million per year.“The momentum we’re seeing right now, going upwards, I think is going to easily carry us through 450 parts per million,” Keeling said. “And then I would say even stabilizing before 500 parts per million is probably not going to be very easy.”Carbon dioxide has been the primary driver of climate change since the industrial revolution. CO2 has caused the Earth to warm about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since then ― a shift that’s led to record temperatures, melting ice sheets, extreme weather events and other significant impacts. "

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is poised to become the Senate Democratic leader next year, led the charge to override Obama's veto. That's awkward.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ebd1171a0000f3045b55ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In a stinging blow to President Barack Obama, the Senate voted Wednesday to override his veto of a bill to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in the terrorist attacks.It’s the first time a chamber of Congress has had the votes to overrule Obama on a veto. It’s also the result of some unusual alliances: Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who is on track to become the next Democratic leader, led the effort against the president alongside Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), a conservative member of Republican leadership. “This is pretty much close to a miraculous occurrence,” Cornyn said before the vote. “All of us have come together and agreed this is the appropriate and right thing to do.”It takes two-thirds of the Senate to override a veto. Party leaders got well above that level. The final tally was 97-1. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was the lone opposition. Two senators didn’t vote at all: Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate, and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was Clinton’s runner-up in the presidential race.A Kaine spokesman later told HuffPost that the senator was traveling during the vote, but had he been there, he would have voted to sustain the veto. That puts him on the same page as Clinton, who has said she backs the bill.The House voted later on Wednesday to override the veto, causing the bill to become law.The bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It overrides the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren’t designated state sponsors of terrorism.Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, but the Saudi government denies any role in the attacks and multiple U.S. government investigations have cleared it of blame.“I deeply respect the president and the reasons he has given for vetoing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said ahead of the vote. “But I urge my colleagues to move swiftly and soundly to reverse this veto so that these families can have their day in court.”The White House has fought against the bill for months, to no avail. Administration officials warn that it would put Americans overseas at legal risk and leave the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits ― and hefty bills ― in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it, in the name of protecting sovereign immunity. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets.But those arguments didn’t sway lawmakers, who say the White House’s case is overblown. The bill originally passed the House and Senate without a single “no” vote.“The bill is near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker because it would allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice,” Schumer said Wednesday. “Courts in New York have dismissed their claims against foreign entities alleged to have helped in the 9/11 attacks. They are following an incorrect reading of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.”Obama vetoed the bill last week and issued a lengthy statement with it. In sum, he said he sympathizes with 9/11 victims and has expanded efforts to help them, but that JASTA undermines “core U.S. interests.”White House press secretary Josh Earnest last week downplayed the significance of Obama getting such a strong rebuke from Congress, including from Democratic leaders.“The president is not particularly concerned about that,” Earnest said in his Friday briefing. “This president has gone longer in his tenure in the White House than just about any other president in modern history before facing the prospect of having his veto overridden.”This post has been updated to note that two senators did not vote but Kaine would have voted to sustain the veto. Also, the House voted to override the veto later on Wednesday."

The company aims to send the first humans to Mars in 2025.“I’m open-minded but skeptical that anyone actually wants to live out his or her life on Mars any more than anyone wants to colonize Antarctica,” Nye told The Huffington Post in an email. “Mars is an exotic place and in some ways very romantic. But it’s cold, barren and you can’t even breathe.”And the cost for getting to Mars will be astronomical. Musk anticipates charging folks about $200,000 apiece for a trip to the red planet ― and that’s after the price comes down.Musk has long considered the colonization of other planets a life-or-death imperative, given the existential threats to life on Earth posed by runaway climate change, killer asteroids and the like.“Ultimately, the thing that is super-important in the grand scale of history is, are we on a path to becoming a multi-planet species or not?” Musk said in 2011 (and has been saying ever since). “If we’re not, that’s not a very bright future. We’ll just be hanging out on Earth until some eventual calamity claims us.”Nye, who was on hand in Guadalajara for Musk’s well-attended presentation, is known for climate activism as well as for his enthusiasm for space exploration.But establishing a Mars colony clearly isn’t his first priority.“I very much hope we conduct a thorough, careful search for life on Mars before we consider landing dozens of tons of people and cargo,” he told HuffPost.That search is already underway, of course. For decades now, NASA has been sending landers and rovers to Mars ― and the space agency has its own plan to send astronauts there sometime in the 2030s. By then, Musk’s colonists might have been living on Mars for years.In any case, Nye praised SpaceX for changing how the world thinks about spaceflight. “Watching the crowd go absolutely wild today,” he added, “tells me that the best is yet ahead for space exploration.”"

Bush had wasted 15 years and billions of dollars without being able to defeat the Taliban, he added.“There is a choice for the upcoming president, whether he or she would like to suffer human and financial losses to continue their invasion of Afghanistan or they want to let the people of Afghanistan decide their affairs,” Zabihullah said.“If the new president doesn’t change policy, the Taliban will continue their armed struggle until they are expelled from Afghanistan.”"

We are continuing to look into these allegations.”Determining which victims were civilians and which were militants would not be possible until an investigation was complete, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor.Thousands of U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, with many recent air strikes and special operations missions aimed at Islamic State in Nangarhar, as well as helping Afghan forces in their fight against the Taliban in various parts of the country.Between January and August this year, American aircraft released more than 800 weapons and flew more than 3,500 close air support missions in Afghanistan, according to U.S. military reports."

1126,1126,POLITICS,Congress Hands Barack Obama The First Veto Override Of His Presidency,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-obama-veto-override-911_us_57ec0dd9e4b0c2407cdb441c,Democrats and Republicans force a law into effect that enables 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia.,2016-09-28,"Just months before leaving office, President Barack Obama is handed his first ever veto override. Don't let the door hit you on the way out!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ec10411b00007f08ef2f02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Congress delivered a powerful rebuke to President Barack Obama on Wednesday by overriding his veto of a bill allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged ties to the terrorist attacks.It’s the first time one of Obama’s vetoes has been overruled.It takes a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override a presidential veto, which is why it’s so rare. In this case, both chambers had well above that threshold: The Senate voted 97-1 to override, and hours later, the House voted 348-77. The bill now automatically becomes law without the president’s signature.Wednesday’s vote brings an end to a monthslong scuffle between the White House and Congress over the measure known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. The bill prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It trumps the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren’t designated state sponsors of terrorism.Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, but the Saudi government denies any role in the attacks and multiple U.S. government investigations have cleared it of blame.Obama administration officials have warned that the bill would put U.S. service members overseas at legal risk and leave the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it in the name of protecting sovereign immunity. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets.But those warnings just didn’t sway lawmakers, who think the White House’s case falls short. When the bill passed the House and Senate earlier this year, it sailed through both chambers with zero opposition.Even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguably Obama’s strongest ally on Capitol Hill, voted Wednesday to override his veto. She said it wasn’t personal.“It’s not against the president. It’s against an idea, an interpretation of a bill,” Pelosi told The Huffington Post during a roundtable with reporters on Tuesday. “I have a close relationship with the [9/11] families. I have for 15 or 16 years. I will be supporting their day in court.”One Republican lawmaker, who requested anonymity, said some of his GOP colleagues were just eager for the chance to deny Obama a veto before he leaves office.“Since we’re on background, a lot of people saw a chance to override the president’s veto finally,” this member said.The bill forged some unusual alliances. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is set to become Democratic leader next year, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a conservative member of Republican leadership, ushered the bill through the Senate. In the House, Republicans and Democrats from New York took the lead.A handful of Republicans and Democrats did raise concerns about the bill. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said it “abrogates a core principle of international law for foreign sovereign immunity.” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) noted that the Joint Chiefs of Staff warned that the bill could unintentionally end up hurting service members overseas, though he voted for it in the end.Weirdly, right after nearly all senators voted to override Obama’s veto, 28 of them wrote to the bill’s sponsors, raising concerns about its “unintended consequences.”White House press secretary Josh Earnest didn’t mince words when asked for a reaction to the Senate’s override.“This is the single most embarrassing thing the United States Senate has done, possibly since 1983,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One, according to a pool report. He was apparently referring to the year the Senate overwhelmingly overrode President Ronald Reagan’s veto of a land bill that granted a few acres to some retired couples who had paid for it, only to discover later that the land was still government property due to a surveying error.One Republican senator was quoted as saying he was “not quite sure what the bill actually did,” Earnest said. “To have members of the United States Senate only recently informed of the negative impact of this bill on our service members and our diplomats is, in itself, embarrassing.”The only senator who voted to sustain Obama’s veto was Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).He showed “courage,” Earnest said.Ryan Grim contributed reporting. This story has been updated to include information about lawmakers’ concerns about the bill and their reasons for overriding the veto."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eaceb81a0000f3045b527f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last fall, Indonesian novelist Eka Kurniawan made his American debut. His two translated books, Man Tiger and Beauty Is a Wound, had been written and published in Indonesian over a decade prior, but to English-language audiences, his work was brand new ― and exciting.Man Tiger, a slim work of magic realism about a teenage boy with spiritual bond to a mysterious white tiger, was longlisted for the 2016 Man Booker International Prize. Though American readers have been critiqued for sticking too close to home in their choices, Kurniawan’s novels were warmly received on this side of the Atlantic. The Huffington Post reviewed Man Tiger, writing: “Kurniawan’s prose holds an often-leashed power much like the tiger inside Margio; he can stun with a single sentence, like the crackling opening line of the novel or its heart-thudding concluding one.” Monday night, Kurniawan was honored again for Man Tiger when he was awarded the Emerging Voices Award for Fiction, presented by the Financial Times and Oppenheimer Funds. “It surprised me,” he said in apparent shock after being called onstage. “I never won anything in school.” He was joined on the shortlist by two Chinese authors: Yu Hua for The Seventh Day and Yan Lianke for The Four Books.The Emerging Voices Awards, now in their second year, honor artists, filmmakers, and fiction writers from emerging market nations. As you’d expect from an award founded by a financial newspaper and a global asset manager, its interest is molded by economics as much as art. “There is a remarkable structural shift in the world, propelled by economic progress in the developing markets and the advanced reach of the internet,” the awards site explains. “The Financial Times and OppenheimerFunds are delighted to provide a platform to recognize the people contributing to these markets.”Nonetheless, with judging panels composed of top talent in each field and brilliant honorees in each category ― the winners for Art and Film were Gareth Nyandoro and Clarissa Campolina, respectively ― the awards were inarguably inspiring. It’s hard to argue with the value in shining more light on art and storytelling created outside our familiar American boundaries. Shortly before the awards ceremony Monday night, when Kurniawan was announced as the winner of the 2016 Emerging Voices Award in Fiction, he took a few minutes to chat with HuffPost about revisiting his older works, what it means to be an “emerging voice,” and the power of reading internationally:You’re being honored a lot for Beauty Is a Wound and Man Tiger, which came out in translation recently. But you actually wrote the books quite a while ago. What is it like to revisit them now, and discuss them with people like me whom the books are so new to?I think it’s something. It’s not easy for me to talk about this book because I published it very long ago. I just wrote another novel, so I try to remember again what I did a few years ago ― it’s not easy. I think sometimes when I speak about the book, I try to interpret myself, because I don’t remember what I really was thinking 13 years ago.Do you ever go back and read what you wrote in the past?Usually no. I read Beauty Is a Wound in English translation because I wanted to see that there is true quality, but usually I don’t read anything I wrote. I usually leave that to readers.When you read in translation, does it seem like a totally different book, or do you still feel like it captures it?When I read the book in translation I found the book is kind of like an English novel, but I think that’s a good thing because it’s [something] in the translation. But I still think it’s my story, and there’s my soul in there. So I think it’s perfect, that combination.You write in Indonesian, but you’ve said that you didn’t grow up speaking Indonesian. So what is it like to write in a language that you didn’t grow up speaking every day?We Indonesians essentially grow up in oral tradition, so I was growing up in Sundanese. I speak with my mother, my family, even my friends in Sundanese. But I learned Indonesian in school. I think Indonesian is something like a written language. I read a lot in Indonesian. When I started to write something, it was actually in Indonesian, because I never learned to write something in Sundanese. Actually if we speak about a writer’s language, it’s Indonesian from the very beginning. In my mind, in my head, I think sometimes in Sundanese, sometimes in Indonesian.We’re obviously at the Emerging Voices Awards. Do you think of yourself as an emerging voice, at this point in your career?I don’t know, because I’ve been writing stories and books for almost 16 years. I’m kind of a middle-aged man. But maybe they think I’m a kind of an emerging voice because my book just published in English two years ago. This is depending on what you feel an “emerging voice” is.You’ve talked about how American and English critics compare you to Pramoedya Ananta Toer and talk about you as the great hope of Indonesian literature and how that’s maybe not how Indonesian readers think of you.Yeah.Are there any other contemporaries of yours in Indonesia that you think should be read more widely outside of Indonesia?Of course, I think Americans or people outside Indonesia ― maybe they know only Pramoedya from Indonesia, so naturally they compare me with him. But actually there are a lot of [other authors]. I’m not objecting [to the comparison], because I love Pramoedya’s books. He influenced me most. But I think there’s a lot of Indonesian writers who I think they should read a lot of. For example, there are writers like Seno Gumira Ajidarma ― younger than Pramoedya, but one generation before me. I think readers outside Indonesia should read a lot of Indonesians’ books. Do you think that we’re moving in a positive direction in terms of the globalization of literature and people reading more in translation? Or do you think that there’s more that needs to be done?Yeah, I think that the globalization moves in two directions. There is a lot of open space, so we can read more and more foreign literature. Americans read Indonesian, Indonesians read European, for example. But at the same time, some people maybe fight back to make it more closed, more “we don’t want to read anything from outside and we don’t want our work to be read by outsiders.” So I think the situation is more complicated than what many may think.Do you think that it’s better for there to be some sort of encouragement of reading what is written within your country, or do you think it should be more open borders?Yeah, I think it’s important to read more works from other traditions, other countries, other languages. Because, last week I visited Berlin and I visited the museum for the Berlin Wall. I think it’s a good reminder for us because we destroyed a wall to fight to save one city, Berlin. But at the same time I think literature can break all the walls ― between country, between language, between religions. So I think it’s good to translate more and more literature.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

If we stay, the government will forcefully evict us,” said Ananda Chandra Parida, who has lived since 2007 in Bhubaneswar’s Kargil slum, home to 2,000 families.“The houses they are building for us are small, and many of us cannot afford them,” said Parida, 40, who lives in a two-room brick house with his wife and two children.Government officials say India’s cities - 13 of which are among the 20 most polluted in the world - desperately need the $7.5 billion makeover.About a third of the country’s 1.25 billion population lives in cities with numbers growing every year as tens of thousands of migrants leave their villages to seek better prospects in urban areas.Many migrants end up in overcrowded slums, lacking basic facilities. Activists say the Smart Cities Mission is neglecting the needs of millions of people like them.“(The plan) will only benefit a few and exclude the most vulnerable from the resources they so badly need,” Rajendra Ravi of the National Alliance of People’s Movements (NAPM), an umbrella organisation of rights groups, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.FANCY ENCLAVESAbout 65 million people live in India’s slums, according to 2011 census data, which activists say is a low estimate.Most cities that have submitted development proposals in order to be picked as a Smart City, plan on spending more than 70 percent of funds on developing an area for the benefit of only about 4 percent of the city’s population, said Bhanu Joshi, a researcher at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi.“It’s a very exclusionary plan that doesn’t take into account everyone who makes up an urban space,” Joshi said.“Simply monetising the land and building fancy enclaves does not make a city inclusive or sustainable or smart.”Government officials, who have unveiled 60 Smart Cities so far, say the project will boost investment and create millions of jobs.In Bhubaneswar, campaigners say about 50,000 slum dwellers will be evicted, many of whom will also lose their livelihoods.There have also been demolitions and evictions in slums in the cities of Indore and Bhopal in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, which were named as Smart Cities. About 1,200 families were evicted in Indore, according to NAPM.City officials in Bhubaneswar defended the plan.“Our plan is very inclusive,” said Krishan Kumar, vice chairman of Bhubaneswar Development Authority.“We are planning 6,000 units of affordable housing which would be allotted to them near their locality at a highly subsidised rate,” he said, without specifying how slum dwellers will pay 150,000 rupees ($2,256) for each of these homes.RANDOM SPOTSIn the hill city of Dharamsala, which was also picked as a Smart City, about 300 families were evicted from the Charan Khad settlement in June. Most were low-caste Dalits and indigenous people who had lived there for 30 years.“In a smart city, the poor have no role,” said Bipin Bharadwaj, an activist with Lok Raj Sangathan in Dharamsala.The city’s mayor told reporters there was no option but to relocate residents, that due process was followed, and that they had been given enough time to make alternative arrangements.Even when slum dwellers are offered accommodation, officials are applying an eligibility criteria based on the number of years spent there, thus excluding many, NAPM’s Ravi said.“They just want us to go far away. They don’t want huts in the city area,” said Ramesh Kumar, a cobbler who had lived in Charan Khad and now rents a tiny room in town.“You want to make a smart city and you think we look poor and are dirty; where should we go?” he said.($1 = 66.479 Indian rupees) (Additional reporting by Abhishek Madhukar in Dharamsala, Editing by Katie Nguyen.

If we stay, the government will forcefully evict us,” said Ananda Chandra Parida, who has lived since 2007 in Bhubaneswar’s Kargil slum, home to 2,000 families.“The houses they are building for us are small, and many of us cannot afford them,” said Parida, 40, who lives in a two-room brick house with his wife and two children.Government officials say India’s cities - 13 of which are among the 20 most polluted in the world - desperately need the $7.5 billion makeover.About a third of the country’s 1.25 billion population lives in cities with numbers growing every year as tens of thousands of migrants leave their villages to seek better prospects in urban areas.Many migrants end up in overcrowded slums, lacking basic facilities. Activists say the Smart Cities Mission is neglecting the needs of millions of people like them.“(The plan) will only benefit a few and exclude the most vulnerable from the resources they so badly need,” Rajendra Ravi of the National Alliance of People’s Movements (NAPM), an umbrella organisation of rights groups, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.FANCY ENCLAVESAbout 65 million people live in India’s slums, according to 2011 census data, which activists say is a low estimate.Most cities that have submitted development proposals in order to be picked as a Smart City, plan on spending more than 70 percent of funds on developing an area for the benefit of only about 4 percent of the city’s population, said Bhanu Joshi, a researcher at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi.“It’s a very exclusionary plan that doesn’t take into account everyone who makes up an urban space,” Joshi said.“Simply monetising the land and building fancy enclaves does not make a city inclusive or sustainable or smart.”Government officials, who have unveiled 60 Smart Cities so far, say the project will boost investment and create millions of jobs.In Bhubaneswar, campaigners say about 50,000 slum dwellers will be evicted, many of whom will also lose their livelihoods.There have also been demolitions and evictions in slums in the cities of Indore and Bhopal in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, which were named as Smart Cities. About 1,200 families were evicted in Indore, according to NAPM.City officials in Bhubaneswar defended the plan.“Our plan is very inclusive,” said Krishan Kumar, vice chairman of Bhubaneswar Development Authority.“We are planning 6,000 units of affordable housing which would be allotted to them near their locality at a highly subsidised rate,” he said, without specifying how slum dwellers will pay 150,000 rupees ($2,256) for each of these homes.RANDOM SPOTSIn the hill city of Dharamsala, which was also picked as a Smart City, about 300 families were evicted from the Charan Khad settlement in June. Most were low-caste Dalits and indigenous people who had lived there for 30 years.“In a smart city, the poor have no role,” said Bipin Bharadwaj, an activist with Lok Raj Sangathan in Dharamsala.The city’s mayor told reporters there was no option but to relocate residents, that due process was followed, and that they had been given enough time to make alternative arrangements.Even when slum dwellers are offered accommodation, officials are applying an eligibility criteria based on the number of years spent there, thus excluding many, NAPM’s Ravi said.“They just want us to go far away. They don’t want huts in the city area,” said Ramesh Kumar, a cobbler who had lived in Charan Khad and now rents a tiny room in town.“You want to make a smart city and you think we look poor and are dirty; where should we go?” he said.($1 = 66.479 Indian rupees) (Additional reporting by Abhishek Madhukar in Dharamsala, Editing by Katie Nguyen.

The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act sailed through the Senate and the House with unanimous support ― despite the disapproval of U.S. allies and top national security experts, as well as multiple U.S. investigations that have found no proof of an official Saudi role in 9/11.In a letter to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Obama said he respects 9/11 families and is committed to fighting international terror, but opposes the bill because it takes aim at the internationally accepted principle of sovereign immunity. The president believes the measure could expose American officials to countless lawsuits in foreign courts.“JASTA sweeps much more broadly than 9/11 or Saudi Arabia, and its far-reaching implications would threaten to undermine important principles that protect the Unites States, including our U.S. Armed Forces and other officials overseas, without making us any safer,” Obama wrote. “That’s why I vetoed the bill and why I urge you to vote to sustain the veto.”The message mentioned that Reid and Obama had also spoken about the bill over the phone.The president has had a difficult time rallying Democrats to his side over the issue. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has already said she will vote for the bill once again.If the upper chamber votes for the override today, the House will hold its own vote later this week. A presidential veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate.Read Obama’s full message below: UPDATE: 3:20 p.m. ― The president’s letter seems to have had some impact. Reid was the only lawmaker to dissent in the Senate vote, which ended up overriding Obama’s veto 97-1. Of course, Reid is not up for re-election in November ― or ever again.Hours later, the House voted 348-77 to override the veto as well."

Security Council on Monday. The ballot showed former Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres is still leading the race to replace Ban Ki-moon.Sofia had said it would reconsider its support for Bokova if she did not come first or second in the latest ballot.Prime Minister Boiko Borisov announced the nomination of Georgieva during a meeting with the cabinet attended by reporters. “We consider that this will be a more successful nomination,” he told ministers.Georgieva, a former World Bank economist, said in a statement she accepts the nomination and plans to present her credentials and vision for the top U.N. job to member states.“I am deeply honored by the decision of the Government of my country to put my name forward for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations,” she said.Foreign Minister Daniel Mitov said Bulgaria needed to support a candidate who has a greater chance to become the first Eastern European to lead the global organization.“This was a difficult decision, but it was necessary, so that we give a chance to the (U.N.) Eastern European group to have its secretary-general,” Mitov told reporters.Mitov said U.N. procedure did not allow for a country to withdraw a nomination and that Bokova would have to decide how to proceed, but pointed out that Bulgarian support now goes withGeorgieva.Bokova was not immediately available for comment but had earlier told a Bulgarian newspaper that she saw no reason to quit the race and pointed that a nomination of a second candidatewould only hurt the chances for success for both.Georgieva has been given a month’s leave by the EU executive while she seeks election, a spokesman said on Wednesday. Guenther Oettinger, the German commissioner who handles digital affairs, will step in for October to cover her portfolio running the EU budget and personnel matters.Georgieva, 63, has a significant role in the Commission.The European Union is revising its current seven-year budget, which runs until 2020. It is also gearing up for negotiations on a new seven-year package with the added complication of taking into account Britain’s exit from the bloc at a date still unknown.Monday’s secret ballot was the fifth held by the security council in this leadership race, and these polls will continue until a consensus is reached. The council will then formally recommend thecandidate to the 193-member General Assembly for election.The next ballot is scheduled for Oct. 5.Ban steps down at the end of 2016 after serving two five-year terms."

On Tuesday, it was revealed that minorities only made up 40 percent of the photos in the binder.

Jerry Brown (D) announced Sunday that he’d signed a bill meant to counter the widespread bullying of Muslim and Sikh students in the state. The Safe Place To Learn Act requires the California Department of Education to ensure that school districts “provide information on existing school site and community resources to educate teachers, administrators, and other school staff on the support of Muslim, Sikh, and other pupils who may face anti-Muslim bias and bullying.”According to a November 2015 report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, 55 percent of Muslim students aged 11 to 18 in California reported being bullied or discriminated against due to their faith. That’s double the national average of kids, including non-Muslims, who report being bullied at school. Twenty-nine percent of California students who wear hijabs said they’d experienced “offensive touching or pulling of their hijab.” Ten percent said they’d been physically harmed or harassed for being Muslim. Almost 20 percent said their fellow students had made offensive comments to them online. And nearly 20 percent of students said they’d experienced discrimination from a school staff member.The bullying in California of Muslim students and students perceived to be Muslim came into focus earlier this year when Bayan Zehlif, a senior about to graduate from Los Osos High School in Rancho Cucamonga, discovered that someone had changed her name to “ISIS” in the school’s yearbook. Once a popular girl’s name, “ISIS” these days is more commonly associated with the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. It’s also become a slur commonly hurled at American Muslims. The pervasiveness of anti-Muslim bullying reflects a growing wave of Islamophobic hostility and hate crimes in California and across the nation. The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. Take a stand against hate."

Protesters flooded the city’s streets in the days after his death, demanding justice. On Thursday, demonstrators gathered outside police headquarters and shut down a major highway. Police in riot gear were trying to chase them off the road when the heated, profanity-laden exchange took place.The video captures an altercation after a black man ― who is not in uniform but is standing with his arms folded along with the police ― pushes one of the protesters who is actively de-escalating the situation.A second protester lashes out, accusing the black man who’s not in uniform of “trying to impress these white people.”“You ain’t no fuckin’ hero!” the protester says. “You wanna be a hero? Take yo’ bitch ass overseas like I did!”The man standing with the police replies that “I did too, son,” and says he spent 13 years with the Marines.“Then you should know how the fuck we feel!” the protester replies.The Marine fires back, questioning the veteran’s patriotism: “If you served your country, maybe you should have some.” “My country don’t respect my kind,” the veteran responds. The protests in Charlotte turned violent at times, with some demonstrators throwing objects at police, breaking store windows and looting. Those incidents might explain why the Marine ― whether he realized it or not ― perceived the black protesters as “unpatriotic.”In the brief exchange, the Marine suggested that the veteran was being disloyal to his country by joining the demonstrations. The tired question of whether black protesters are “patriotic” has come up repeatedly as activists across the country take on issues of police brutality.Disrespectful, rowdy and unpatriotic — these labels are often bestowed upon black people who stand up for their rights. Their methods are always criticized, whether they’re marching peacefully, burning flags or breaking windows in stores.Questioning the patriotism of black protesters has deep historical roots. Shortly after Navy veteran Sammy Younge Jr. was killed for trying to use a “whites-only bathroom” in 1966, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) became the first major civil rights organization to publicly oppose the Vietnam War. The group’s argument was simple: Black men shouldn’t fight for “the desire of the United States government to guarantee free elections abroad” when black people didn’t have rights at home.“We are in sympathy with, and support, the men in this country who are unwilling to respond to a military draft which would compel them to contribute their lives to United States aggression in Vietnam in the name of the ‘freedom’ we find so false in this country,” they wrote. “We ask, where is the draft for the freedom fight in the United States?”Both white people and civil rights groups slammed SNCC for being “unpatriotic.” A prominent current example of such disapproval is the criticism of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.Since Kaepernick first refused to stand for the national anthem on Aug. 26, football fans and others have lashed out. One 49ers fan posted a video of himself burning the quarterback’s jersey as the national anthem played in the background, suggesting that denouncing someone like Kaepernick was the truly patriotic thing to do. Even Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Kaepernick should leave the U.S. if he can’t respect the flag.But black protesters are often incredibly patriotic ― just maybe not in a way that white America finds comforting. Protest has always been in America’s DNA; the founding fathers protested Great Britain and fought a war to win their freedom. It’s worth noting that black protesters are far less violent by comparison. They know their God-given rights. They know that, quite often, the liberties given to other Americans are not afforded to them ― like when officers in the Baltimore Police Department regularly stop, frisk and arrest poor black residents without legal cause. Or when a man is shot in the street because cops think he’s got a blunt. Many Charlotte protesters wore Kaepernick jerseys because they, like the quarterback, want to bring attention the staggering rates at which black people are killed by police. In many of those cases, the black people are unarmed, and the officers are not held accountable. The demonstrators congregated outside of the Bank of America Stadium, home of the Carolina Panthers, on Sunday, taking a knee as the anthem played.When people question the patriotism of black Americans for not participating in rudimentary customs such as standing for the national anthem, or for not protesting in a way that makes them comfortable, they fail to see why some black folks aren’t very fond of America at the moment. Black people are disproportionately unemployed, poor and killed during encounters with police. Black people have been forced into segregated neighborhoods (regardless of their household income), and black children are more likely than any other racial group to attend underfunded schools. Those same children are also more harshly disciplined and funneled into the school-to-prison pipeline. So, yeah, some black folks are angry. They’re angry about the lack of equal opportunity and justice for all. Their allegiance is to standing up for their own community ― a point the veteran made in his argument with the Marine. “Fuck patriotism!” the veteran yelled. “I’ll tell you what I’m patriotic about ― I’m patriotic about this black skin!”"

We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they’re well-prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that’s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.” Clinton was one of many public officials who called on the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department to release the video of Scott’s death.  Republican nominee Donald Trump, who did not comment publicly on the shooting, simply responded to the question by accusing Clinton of not wanting “to use a couple of words ― and that’s ‘law’ and ‘order.’”“We need law and order. If we don’t have it, we’re not going to have a country,” Trump said. “And when I look at what’s going on in Charlotte ― a city I love, a city where I have investments ― when I look at what’s going on throughout various parts of our country … we need law and order in our country.”Charlotte Mecklenburg police officers shot and killed Scott on Tuesday, after they encountered him in his vehicle while searching for another person. Witnesses said the shooting was unprovoked, while police maintained that Scott was armed and threatening.After increased demands from the community, Charlotte police released two partial videos of the shooting. Footage from a body camera shows an officer attempting to enter Scott’s SUV. Dash cam footage shows an officer firing a Scott, who appears to be backing up with his hands by his side. Protests rocked the city after Scott’s death, with more than 12 officers injured early on Wednesday morning. Though things subsequently calmed down, tensions still ran high throughout the week.Protesters rallied outside of the Bank of America stadium during a Carolina Panthers game on Sunday. National Guardsmen and police officers in riot gear patrolled the area, forming a barrier between peaceful protesters and game attendees.At least 174 black people have been shot and killed by police this year, according to a tracker from The Washington Post. On average, police in Charlotte kill a civilian every two months.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

When Hillary Clinton pointed out during the first presidential debate that Trump’s only public tax returns show he paid nothing for several years, the GOP nominee replied by saying, “That makes me smart.”When Clinton later disputed the idea that the United States doesn’t have enough money because funds had been “squandered,” suggesting instead that it was because Trump hadn’t paid any taxes, he answered: “It would be squandered, too, believe me.”Trump remains the only presidential nominee in the past four decades not to release his tax returns, meaning voters have no way to determine with precision how he derives his income, what sorts of deductions and credits he claims, and how much money, if any, he donates to charity.“So if he’s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health,” Clinton said. “And I think probably he’s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he’s trying to hide.”Trump and his supporters continue to claim that his lawyers and accountants have advised him not to release the returns until an IRS audit is finished, even though the agency has said nothing precludes Trump from releasing the information while the audit continues. (Republican President Richard Nixon released his returns, even though he was under IRS audit.)Trump said Monday that he would ignore his lawyers’ advice and release his returns if Clinton released 33,000 emails she deleted from her private email server.Clinton apologized for setting up the server and said it was a mistake she would not repeat. She did not respond to Trump’s offer of a trade. After the debate, Trump’s campaign staff and supporters said the GOP nominee’s statements did not mean he hadn’t paid federal taxes over the years.“Mr. Trump pays considerable taxes,” spokesman Jason Miller said. “Of course he pays federal taxes.”“When you’re leader of a corporation, and people own stock in that corporation, it’s your duty to not pay more taxes than you have to,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top Trump supporter.Months before he officially began his presidential run last year, Trump promised on conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt’s program that he would release his tax returns.“I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns,” Trump said in February 2015.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

As he crossed home plate, Gordon gestured to the sky before returning to the dugout, where his teammates ― each wearing Fernandez’s now-retired No. 16 jersey ― came to comfort him.The emotional scene inside Marlins Park could not have been scripted more perfectly. In a tribute to his teammate, Gordon, a lefty batter, stepped to the plate batting right and wearing Fernandez’s batting helmet. After taking the first pitch, Gordon swapped the helmet for his own, and switched to the left-handed batters’ box. With a 2-0 count, Gordon homered to right field to give the Marlins the early 1-0 lead. “Unbelievable,” a game announcer said after Gordon’s at-bat. “Just unbelievable ― his eyes wet with emotion as he rounded the bases, his first home run of the season.” Fernandez, 24, and two others were killed in a boating accident early Sunday in south Florida. In a statement confirming Fernandez’s death, the Marlins announced the team had canceled Sunday’s home game against the Atlanta Braves. “Sadly, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest,” Marlins owner Jeffrey H. Loria said in a statement. “José left us far too soon, but his memory will endure in all of us.”Monday’s game against the New York Mets was the Marlins first since Fernandez’s death. After four innings, the Marlins led the Mets 7-0."

The 5-pound bags were sold at Costco stores nationwide, while the 20-pound bags were sold to a single wholesaler in Pennsylvania, Tyson told HuffPost. The plastic bits ranged in size from 21mm in length and 6.5mm in diameter, the USDA said, and “may have come from a round, hard plastic rod used to connect a plastic transfer belt.”Customers in possession of either of the products may cut the UPC number and date code from the back of the packages and mail them to Tyson for a full refund. This latest recall comes on the heels of a Sept. 23 incident, in which nearly 8,000 pounds of ham were recalled from Costco and Sam’s Club due to contamination with pieces of rubber. "

1275,1275,POLITICS,Government Shutdown Hinges On Republicans Helping Flint,"Matt Fuller, Jennifer Bendery, and Michael McAuliff",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-flint_us_57eab486e4b024a52d2af6c6,"If the question is which side will cave, the answer could be both.",2016-09-27,"Republican leaders' unwillingness to commit to include funding to help with the lead water crisis in Flint, Michigan, is holding up passage of a bill to continue funding the government.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eab6251a0000f3045b51fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With the government set to run out of money in three days, the Senate failed to pass a government funding bill that Democrats oppose because it does nothing to help the residents still dealing with lead-poisoned water in Flint, Michigan.The Senate didn’t approve a procedural vote, 45-55, for the continuing resolution Tuesday. Several Republicans also objected to the bill that would fund the government only until Dec. 9, and 13 voted against moving the bill ― including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), which allows him the option to bring up the measure for another vote.The largest sticking point, however, appeared to be Republicans’ failure to deal with Flint’s lead crisis, even as they rushed to help flood victims in other states, especially Louisiana.“Would it be asking too much for the speaker of the House, the leader of the Senate, the Republican leader of the Senate, to stand and say, ‘We’re going to get that thing done, we’re going to pass it, we’re going to make sure that the bill that passed overwhelmingly in the Senate is going to become law?” asked Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), referring to a separate bill, the Water Resources Development Act, that includes funding for Flint and other lead mitigation efforts. “But they ignore that. They ignore the people of Flint.”McConnell countered that Republicans in the Senate are committed to passing the Flint bill after the elections, and accused Reid and Democrats of manufacturing a crisis by insisting on helping Flint.“The White House said yesterday that the WRDA bill is an appropriate vehicle for the Flint funding,” McConnell said. “It’s almost as if a few Democratic leaders decided long ago that bringing our country to the brink would make for good election-year politics. And then they’ve just made up the rationale as they go along.”But Reid and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) argued the House had a chance to deal with the Flint problem starting Monday night, when it drew up the rules to pass its own version of the water resources bill. That’s when Republicans explicitly barred an amendment to address Flint.Republicans haven’t given Democrats much reason to trust that Flint funding will get put into the WRDA later, when the two chambers eventually get together in a conference committee to align their differing versions of the legislation.“It isn’t promised that it will be in there. It’s promised that it will be considered,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters Tuesday.Pelosi said the bottom line for Democrats is that Flint funding needs to end up in one of the two bills by week’s end, and it doesn’t necessarily matter which one.“We’re hoping to leverage it one way or another,” she said. “Our minority caucuses do not want to vote for a bill that does not have Flint in it.”At issue is roughly $220 million that is partially directed toward Flint. The Senate WRDA bill included $100 million for subsidized loans for water infrastructure improvement, but any state that receives a federal emergency declaration could eventually get part of that money. (Currently, only Michigan would be eligible.) The Senate legislation also includes $70 million for financing costs associated with loans for water infrastructure around the country, as well as $50 million for national health programs associated with lead poisoning.When pressed on why Republicans wouldn’t put the Flint aid in the continuing resolution, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) shifted blame onto the House. “The Senate’s already solved it,” Cornyn said, referring to its support of the Flint package. “The challenges in the House are adding additional things on the CR which may jeopardize their ability to pass it there. We can’t ignore that.”Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said last week that he sees Flint as “more of a local government issue,” and he wasn’t much more reassuring Tuesday, telling reporters that he isn’t going to negotiate Flint through the press.He told reporters Flint funding is “not germane in WRDA itself,” but noted the Senate version of the bill did include Flint.“That means we’re going to conference,” Ryan said, adding that he wasn’t “going to get into the particulars about negotiations.”But if Republicans aren’t willing to give Democrats real assurances that Flint will be in a final bill, why would Democrats give up their leverage on the stopgap funding bill? And if Republicans are so sure Flint will be dealt with eventually, why not give Democrats the Flint funding now?House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) was asked that question Tuesday, and his answer again cast doubt that congressional Republicans believe they have a responsibility to deal with Flint.“As I’ve said, this is a local issue. Or state,” Rogers said. “Every city in the country, every town in the country, has a degree of the same problem, and that’s corroding old pipes. That’s traditionally something local communities deal with, or state, like the WRDA bill would allow them to do.”Pressed that it sounded as if he didn’t want to handle Flint in federal legislation, Rogers agreed. “Sure,” he said.With House Republicans sounding so sketchy on including Flint funding in the WRDA, Democrats seem to have taken a firm line. “Put it in the CR, put it in the WRDA bill that’s in the House now ― not some promise that, ‘Oh well, we’ll pass the WRDA bill and maybe it will be in conference,’” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters.Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) was also skeptical of Ryan’s promises. “Why isn’t he making it happen? Why isn’t he helping us? We can’t trust the House,” she said in a Senate floor speech.As much as Democrats want to get Flint funding in the government funding bill, some seem willing to accept a solid commitment from GOP leaders that it will end up in the final version of the WRDA bill. Two Senate Democratic leadership aides told The Huffington Post that Democrats could probably accept a promise that Flint ends up in the WRDA bill after conference.Whether that would be forthcoming, however, remained unclear. Asked whether Ryan was willing to commit to making sure Flint funding ends up in the final version of the WRDA bill, Ryan’s chief communications adviser, Brendan Buck, said he had nothing to offer at this point.Without that commitment, and without Flint money in the government funding bill or the WRDA, Democrats don’t appear willing to budge.“Why don’t they just do it now?” Pelosi asked, snapping her fingers. “Like that, the speaker could put it in the WRDA bill right now.”Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."

The find was no doubt an eerie and heartbreaking reminder of a tragedy that has shocked the city of Miami and the Major League Baseball community.The bag was reportedly discovered by a beachgoer and turned into a lifeguard tower at 24th street, about a mile north of where the 24-year-old pitcher and two friends were killed after their 32-foot boat hit rocks and capsized. Miami Beach Ocean Rescue Division Chief Vincent Canosa told WSVN 7 News the items appeared to belong to one of the deceased.Fernandez and his friends Emilio Jesus Macias, 27, and Eduardo Rivero, 25, were killed early Sunday morning when a 32-foot SeaVee boat, owned by Fernandez, plowed at high speed into a jetty at the entrance of Miami Harbor, the Miami Herald reported. The crash remains under investigation and authorities have said they do not believe alcohol or drugs were a factor.On Monday, the Herald reported that Fernandez had been seen at a Miami bar earlier in the night and may have been upset about an argument with his girlfriend.The Marlins took the field Monday evening for its first game since the ace pitcher was killed. As a tribute, every player wore a Fernandez jersey and team owner Jeffrey Loria announced the team will retire Fernandez’s number 16. In a bit of magic that could not have been scripted more perfectly, Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon stepped up to the plate Monday wearing his fallen teammate’s jersey and crushed a lead-off home run ― his first of the season ― to give his team an early 1-0 lead.The Marlins went on to beat the New York Mets 7-3."

But occasionally it gets lost amid all the other elements of this unpredictable election. Only men have debated each other for the office of the presidency. As of Monday night, that no longer is the case. At a minimum, it’s an important milestone. More importantly, it will serve as an inspiration for other women to consider a run for office. "
1300,1300,POLITICS,This Is Trump's Idea Of Bad Temperament In A Woman,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-bad-temperament-clinton_us_57eab8e2e4b0c2407cd9efc7,"Hillary Clinton spoke forcefully, so she's obviously unhinged.",2016-09-27,"But this person is not ""out of control"" because this person is a man.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eabad81700004007ac7931.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the more confusing moments of Monday night’s debate came during a discussion about presidential temperament.A lot of voters ― millions, probably ― have wondered if Donald Trump has the proper temperament for the job. People in the audience laughed when he claimed to have a better disposition than his opponent, Hillary Clinton.“I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament,” he boasted. “I have a winning temperament. I know how to win.”But as moderator Lester Holt tried to turn to Clinton for a retort, Trump didn’t step back from the microphone. He accused Clinton of having some kind of unpresidential meltdown in some way related to the AFL-CIO labor federation.“The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don’t know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control,” Trump declared. “I said, there’s a person with a temperament that’s got a problem.”At the time, nobody seemed to know what Trump was referencing. The Huffington Post, eager to learn more about Clinton’s heretofore unreported implosion, asked the AFL-CIO what Trump was talking about.“Actually, we’re not quite sure what he was referencing either,” Jasmine Nazarett, an AFL-CIO spokeswoman, responded by email.Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks was able to clear up the confusion. She told HuffPost that Trump was probably referring to a recent speech by Clinton that addressed “why she wasn’t leading by 50 points” in the polls.That steered us to a clip of Clinton speaking by video last week to members of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, or LiUNA, which has endorsed her. (Trump must have been confused on this point: LiUNA is not the AFL-CIO, although it is a member of the larger federation.)In the video, Clinton urges union members to help her make the case against Trump, running through the reasons why she said he’d be a bad president for union workers.“Having said all of this, why aren’t I 50 points ahead, you might ask,” Clinton continues in the video. “Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”Breitbart picked up on the video and paired it with a misleading headline: “Hillary Clinton Shouts At Camera: ‘Why Aren’t I 50 Points Ahead’ Of Donald Trump?” Of course, Clinton was not asking that question earnestly; she merely said that some LiUNA members might be wondering why she wasn’t up 50 points if Trump’s as bad as she claims. And whether Clinton was actually shouting probably depends on whether the listener was a man or a woman.Like many female candidates running for high office, Clinton has had to negotiate male voters’ unforgiving line between “strong and passionate leader” and “overbearing and shrill crazy woman.” Speak calmly and seek common ground, and you’re not presidential. Speak strongly and forcefully, and they tell you to lighten up and stop yelling. Wall Street Journal editorial board member James Taranto wrote that Clinton came off as “bitter and angry” in her LiUNA speech. He urged Trump to watch the video ahead of the debate, “if for no other reason than to boost his confidence.”Apparently, Trump did watch.Watch an excerpt from Clinton’s speech to LiUNA:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
1312,1312,POLITICS,Donald Trump's New DC Hotel Was The Perfect Place To Watch The Presidential Debate,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hotel-dc-first-presidential-debate_us_57ea804fe4b024a52d2a9281,"There were $29 appetizers, an impossible all-you-can-drink special and a surreal atmosphere befitting a surreal election.",2016-09-27,A crowd of more than 350 gathered at Donald Trump's downtown D.C. hotel to watch Trump and Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ea94dc1a00002c005b514f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Here’s what I discovered a few minutes into watching the first presidential debate of the 2016 election at the Benjamin, the bar and lounge in the lobby of the new Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue: a special debate menu that included a $29 bowl of hummus named after Hillary Clinton, and an equally-priced plate of sliders covered in something called “smoked ketchup.” A $100 offer to drink as many American beers as I pleased from 8 to 11 p.m. And a lot of people who wanted Donald Trump to become the next president of the United States.Here’s what I did not see, at least at first: obvious supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic nominee who is now the only person who can prevent Donald Trump from becoming the next president of the United States.Trump’s hotel is a lovely summation of the candidate himself, and of what his supporters love and his detractors hate most about him. It is garish, with gold-plated bathroom fixtures, gaudy furniture and crystal decanters lining a floor-to-ceiling shelf behind the bar. It is a gouge: The rooms start at $700-something a night, the $100 drink special necessitates slugging roughly five beers an hour for three hours just to break even, and, well, The Donald is already fighting the city over taxes. It is loud: The cheers of people who lost their minds every time Trump attacked Clinton rattled off the walls and reverberated to the top of the nine-story atrium.Trump has claimed that the hotel opened “under budget [and] ahead of schedule.” This happens not to be true, but to his supporters, it was yet more proof of why Trump should be president ― and a major reason why this hotel was the perfect place to watch him debate Clinton.“You look at an establishment like this where we are, the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. ― what he’s done with this establishment, and the opportunities that he has to turn the country around,” said a local Trump supporter who didn’t want to give his name. “I came here because I’m a proud supporter of Donald Trump and I’m committed to supporting his brand and getting him in the White House.”Trump’s going to be lucky to win more than 5 percent of this city’s votes on Election Day. But five blocks from the house that might soon be his, in a hotel that already is, you’d forgive a random tourist for thinking the nation’s capital was a hotbed of Trump support. In here, at least, he was ahead 95 to 5.“It just goes to show you how many Trump supporters there are in D.C.,” the local Trump fan said. It made for a surreal atmosphere that felt pretty appropriate amid a mind-bogglingly surreal election season.At one point, Trump aimed a zinger at Clinton on an economic matter: “You’ve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just now thinking of this?” At that, a man standing at the bar in a boxy black suit pumped his fist in the air, let out a triumphant “Woo!” and kissed the woman next to him. When Trump said he would only release his tax returns if Clinton made public the 30,000 emails she kept on a private server, the bar was in stitches.But after those first few minutes, Trump started to unravel. And the few Clinton supporters in attendance, who had barely made a sound during the first half hour, began to show signs of life. They were especially responsive to Trump’s attack lines, most of which incorporated basic falsehoods that debate moderator Lester Holt ― who’d said he wouldn’t fact-check the candidates ― couldn’t abide.Trump accused Clinton of “fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” evidently unaware that at 68 years of age, the former secretary of state is at least four decades older than the militant jihadist group. He repeatedly argued (incorrectly) that “stop and frisk” ― the New York City policing program that was ruled unconstitutional for discriminating against black and Hispanic people ― had reduced crime rates, and that it hadn’t, in fact, been tossed out by a judge. He took credit for getting President Barack Obama to release his birth certificate. He suggested his temperament was his strongest quality, while also continuing his bizarre and pointless feud with Rosie O’Donnell (“Nobody feels sorry for her,” he said).Each new line, and Clinton’s response to it, brought another Hillary fan out of the woodwork.A woman named Jessica ― she declined to provide her last name ― stood up from her seat on a couch near the bar after one such attack, and peeled off a sweatshirt to reveal a brand-new “Hillary Clinton 2016” T-shirt beneath. Another woman cheered loudly whenever Clinton pushed back against Trump. A man seated at a table nearby hooted and hollered for the candidate who wants to become the first woman to serve as U.S. president ― especially when Trump attacked what he called her lack of “stamina.”“What kind of stamina do you have?” the man yelled. “How many sit-ups can you do?”Not the best trash talk, perhaps. But if the Trump fans had shown up here because the hotel was a symbol of why they thought their candidate should lead the free world, the Clinton fans were clearly here for another reason. They had come to Trump’s hotel, it turned out, because it provided a perfect venue for trolling the man whose persona ― and entire candidacy, really ― might feel like its own giant troll job if it didn’t also seem so... dangerous.“We thought it would be kind of funny, because we couldn’t make it to a Trump rally, to come here and see people in their natural environment,” Jessica said. She and her partner live in the United Arab Emirates (she’s an American citizen) and were visiting D.C. on vacation. “We thought it’d be entertaining, if nothing else.”Tara Young, a native of southeast D.C., sat with a group of friends at a table in the middle of the lounge. She took exception to Trump’s claim that black people like her were “living in hell,” but she hadn’t necessarily come here to challenge every point the Republican nominee made. Asheru, a D.C.-area hip-hop artist sitting next to her, had organized the group ― 15 or 20 people, all of them black ― through a Facebook post that suggested gathering at Trump’s hotel bar “for shits-n-giggles.”“There needs to be some checks and balances in the room,” Young said. “We’re here for the Trump supporters. Maybe their world is so small they don’t get to communicate with people with different opinions.”Akili West, a southeast D.C. resident who sat with Young and Asheru, is leaning toward Green Party candidate Jill Stein for the moment. But he couldn’t resist the chance to poke Trump in his own backyard.“We thought it would be an excellent backdrop for watching the debate,” West said. “Many people in the African-American community feel that he’s a bigot, so we just thought it would be classic to come and sit in his hotel.”For the most part, they exchanged pleasantries with the closest Trump supporters, who found it funny that Clinton fans were present. But at one point, a nearby table had a conversation about stop and frisk that was meant “for us to hear,” West said. So Young stood up and pantomimed a stop-and-frisk routine on every person sitting at her table.“I just wanted to show how ridiculous that is,” she said. “My head wants to explode sometimes.” When the debate finally ended, no one seemed quite sure what to do next.Jessica and her companion stayed for one last round of gin and tonics, their bright white “Hillary 2016” shirts standing out in a crowd of men in suits. Asheru’s party gathered for a picture in the lounge, presumably for maximum shits and giggles. A group of Trump fans finished a final glass of wine at a table nearby. Above them all, Fox News recapped the debate on four separate TVs. The sound had long since been turned off. Everyone, it seemed, had gotten something out of this, which was more than you could say for that plate of Hillary Hummus.Jessica laughed when I told her that for $29, the dish was pretty bland.“How else are they gonna pay for this?” she said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The players and coaches for the two teams came to the center of the field and joined hands to form a unity circle following the national anthem. Saints coach Sean Payton contacted Falcons coach Dan Quinn about the idea, though the two ultimately let their quarterbacks decide how their teams would make a demonstration of unity while also standing in honor of the national anthem, ESPN reported. “Obviously, everybody knows what’s been going on throughout this entire year and for a long time.

Others, like Chicago Bears coaching legend Mike Ditka, model Kate Upton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have criticized Kaepernick or the protest as disrespectful. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees was also critical of Kaepernick’s protest, saying he “wholeheartedly” disagreed with the manner of it, and was bothered by it because he views the American flag as “sacred.” Following the Saints’ loss to the Falcons on Monday, Brees said he felt the pre-game circle was “an appropriate way” to show unity. “[It was] the way we would like to give attention ― after the national anthem ― in a way that shows we’re all in this together,” Brees told ESPN.

But there is a big difference between the word and actions of other people,” Trump said in the video. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.” Trump’s statement capped a frantic day on the trail in which his campaign was rocked by the revelation of the hot-mic moment. Several Republican lawmakers responded by pulling their support from the nominee. Staring straight into the camera, a dulled look on his face, Trump admitted that he had “said and done things I regret and the words released today on this more than decade-old video are one of them,” “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologized,” he said. But in pledging “to be a better man tomorrow,” he also offered up some glaring contradictions ― beyond just insisting that scandals from Bill Clinton’s days in office were fair game, while his hot-mic moment decades later was old news. Trump also urged voters to keep their focus on the “important issues we are facing today.” And then, within a few sentences, he said he would be attacking Bill Clinton’s personal life more aggressively in “the coming days.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

We strongly denounce the heinous act that has once again taken the lives of innocent men and women. The attack brought to a brutal end the aspirations of men and women who were part of our collective human family, and we are therefore equally hurt by the heartless action of the attackers.The attack comes at a time when the region and Kenya in general have been experiencing relative calm and we commend the government and security apparatus for the progress made so far in preventing such attacks. It is due to their swift response and readiness to serve that the security forces were able to save the lives of many other Kenyans in this latest attack.Today we join Kenyans everywhere in our resolve to stare down these violent extremists who wish to spread violence and mayhem through terror. We pay tribute to the population in Mandera, its citizens, staff and development workers, working tirelessly every day, and ensuring every effort to build a future, improved livelihoods and peaceful coexistence.Recently under the leadership of the government of Kenya, the UN family together with Kenya Red Cross and MSF (Switzerland) fought off the twin outbreak of cholera and chikungunya in Mandera county. The local health workers and volunteers in Mandera county were at the front lines of this initiative to assist and heal the men, women and children affected by this twin disease outbreak.Various agencies of the UN have for a long time with the national and county authorities of Mandera and other hard-to-reach regions of the country supported humanitarian and development programmes such as food relief, immunize women and children, ensure and maternal and child health programmes and agro-business development. We are collaborating with NGOs, private sector partners and faith-based organizations in initiatives that advance youth and women empowerment in regard to health, education and economic resilience. We will scale up our efforts in ongoing and new initiatives that will provide a sense of inclusiveness and equal opportunity, and these will in turn help to prevent our youth from the snares of radicalisation and extremism.Terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and we believe the greater East African region must intensify regional efforts to prevent and counter terrorism and violent extremism. While the incidents that happened in Mandera are heart breaking, we must work to defeat terror through development, resolving inequity, ensuring basic services and human rights for all.The UN in Kenya hopes that all those responsible for this massacre will be expeditiously found and brought to justice under the laws of Kenya. We remain convinced that the upward trajectory of Kenya’s destiny will not be upset by violence and terror.I assure the Government and people of Kenya that they have an unwavering ally in the UN family, fully determined to support all initiatives aimed at eliminating the scourge of terrorism which is an affront to the ideals of human rights that the UN upholds.

UNGA, as it is better known, is an annual gathering of world leaders in New York to discuss the most pressing issues, in a series of high-level meetings. One such issue is Education in Emergencies. Also referred to as Safe Schools or Emergency Lessons, this is a phrase that has been going around a lot lately. It refers to the worrying trend of displaced children being denied the right to education. This can be due to conflicts, disasters or diseases. By now, you might have figured the number of children affected by these factors is unacceptably high - 75 million children to be precise. Many of these children are refugees. In fact, according to Uprooted by UNICEF, 1 in 200 children worldwide are refugees and 1 in 2 refugees are children. If you include the number of children out-of-school due to the other reasons, the figure is too high. I was selected as one of two A World at School Global Youth Ambassadors (GYA) worldwide (and the only one from India) to attend many meetings during the UNGA in New York and to support the cause of Education in Emergencies.On Sunday, 18th September, I attended the launch of a detailed report by the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, or the Education Commission, citing recommendations that were presented to UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon. Five former prime ministers and presidents and three Nobel Laureates are among the 20 world leaders who sit on the commission to review the state of global education. A youth panel - which includes Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai - also makes up a part of the Education Commission. I met a few of the youth panellists over brunch before we headed to the United Nations Headquarters for the launch. I also had the opportunity to meet the Education Commissioners and other prominent figures in the field of education, and speak to them about their views on the issue: Gordon Brown, Education Commissiom Chair, UN Special Envoy for Education & Former British Prime MinisterJulia Gillard, Education Comissioner & Former Australian Prime MinisterKailash Satyarthi, Education Comissioner & Nobel Peace Prize RecipientAnant Agarwal, Education Commissioner, CEO of edx & Professor, MITResearch is a crucial aspect of problem-solving: you need to have a clear understanding of the issue before attempting to find a solution. Education is no different. Over the course of the week, I attended a myriad of research-based discussions. Education Equity 2030: Met By All, explored research and statistics of the inequality in education. This event brought together multiple organisations that are working towards the same goal - education equity. These included Save the Children, FHI360, UNESCO Institute of Statistics, UNICEF, Theirworld and PALNetwork. The launch of USD 10 million research envelope known as Evidence for Education in Emergencies (E3) by Dubai Cares at an event jointly hosted by INEE (International Network of Education in Emergencies) proved to be an important milestone, showing evidence to aid policy-makers to better tackle education in emergencies. Some of the astounding facts presented, emphasised the importance of this form of research in the field of education in emergencies. The panellists and attendees included David Miliband, President & CEO, International Rescue Committee (IRC); Tariq Al Gurg, CEO, Dubai Cares; Justin van Fleet, Director, Education Commission; Carina Omoeva, Director, Education Policy and Data Centre, FHI360; HRH Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan, advocate, maternal and newborn health; and representatives of various UN bodies, and non-profit organisations. Left-to-Right: Ousmane Ba (fellow GYA), Dean Brooks (Director, INEE) and meWith Princess Sarah Zeid of JordanPlan UK’s Real Choices, Real Lives research discussion gave a human face to the statistics in education inequality. The event showcased case studies and stories of some of the 142 young girls followed for a period of 10 years, in 9 countries. These girls have routinely faced gender-based discrimination. The panelists were: Tanya Barron, CEO, Plan International UK; Rebecca Marmot, Unilever, Global Vice President Partnerships & Advocacy; Lili Harris, Real Choices Manager; Anette Trompeter, Country Director, Plan International Brazil; Nora Fyles, UN Girls Education Initiative (UNGEI) Secretariat; and Takyiwa Danso, UK Youth Delegate. There were also 2 young advocates from Malawi, who spoke from their personal experiences. The all-female panel explored the role of poverty, gender and age on girls’ education. Together for the 2030 Agenda: Partnering for Women, Children and Adolescents, to Thrive and Transform the World (co-organised by Every Woman Every Child (EWEC), the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement, the Zero Hunger Challenge (ZHC), in collaboration with the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and Sanitation and Water for All (SWA)) saw numerous decision-makers, world leaders and advocates talking about the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals in communities in general. Speakers included Aung San Suu Kyi, Michelle Bachelet, Alice Albright, Kevin Rudd, Helle Thorning-Schmidt and many others. Ousmane and I with Kevin Rudd (centre), Chair, Sanitation & Water for All & Former Australian Prime MinisterWith Helle Thorning-Schmidt, CEO, Save the Children International & former Prime Minister of DenmarkLater that day, Sarah Brown, President, TheirWorld and wife of former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, spoke to me about my work as a youth advocate and my organisation, Child Awareness Project (CAP).My final event of the week was a Global Business Coalition for Education (GBC-Ed) breakfast meeting; followed by a roundtable discussion chaired by Julia Gillard and Sarah Brown. This invoked the partnership between corporates and non-profits while placing emphasis on the social impact of businesses, with a special focus on education. The meet saw various leaders, educationists, business heads, and government representatives. With Amel Karboul, Education Commissioner & former Minister of Tourism, TunisiaThe week was expectedly hectic, packed with numerous meetings, panel discussions and events (including a vigil for #ChildrenFirst by UNICEF). As a young advocate for children’s rights, I was happy to see the time and effort put into ensuring education for all children: the research, the funding, and the collaborations. All of this will go a long way in making education a reality for many, by 2030. Youth involvement is usually noticeably minimal in high-level events such as these. Our role as youth ambassadors served to remind leaders that young people are watching - and expectant. It also sends a powerful message that youth representatives must be frequently included in such discussions, as they are one of the most important stakeholders in this issue. ***Ousmane Ba (my co-GYA at the UNGA from Sierra Leone) and I documented each day’s events during the UNGA week.

Melania Trump was already pregnant at the time.The GOP nominee was not always respectful of Melania Trump during her pregnancy.“I mean, she really has become a monster — in all the right places,” he told Howard Stern in December 2005.“I mean monster in the most positive way,” Trump added. “She has gotten very, very large — in all the right places.”During an interview with the talk show “Soap Talk,” Arianne Zucker, the “Days Of Our Lives” star with whom Trump appeared in a scene, recalled flirting with the former reality TV personality during their time together at the end of 2005.“I did flirt with Donald,” Zucker said. “He’s my new best friend.” “He is cute, isn’t he?” Lisa Rinna, then-co-host of “Soap Talk” said.“He is so cute and charming,” Zucker responded.Rinna, the co-host, has soured on Trump in the interim.Less than 24 hours after they went public, Trump’s 2005 remarks on the hot microphone ahead of the taping with Zucker have set off a political firestorm that threatens to sink the brash businessman’s candidacy. Top Republicans have almost universally condemned his comments and several current and former officials have called for his resignation as GOP nominee.In the explosive video, Trump can be heard talking to then-“Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush about aggressively hitting on a married woman. Trump then explains that he is using Tic Tac mints ahead of greeting Zucker, just in case he feels tempted to kiss her.He confessed to kissing women without their permission, which he said they allowed because he is a “star.”“Grab them by the pussy,” Trump added. “You can do anything.”Ryan Grim contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.This article has been updated to include new details about Trump describing his wife as a “monster” when she was pregnant."

Given Trump’s decades in the spotlight, including 14 seasons as the star of NBC’s “The Apprentice,” there is presumably a lot more archived, unaired footage of the Republican nominee. But it remains to be seen if any newsworthy material will come to light in the election’s waning weeks. On Friday afternoon, The Washington Post published a leaked 2005 recording of Trump telling then-""Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush how he could grab women “by the pussy” and get away with it because he’s a celebrity. The thrice-married Trump also discussed trying to “fuck” a married woman and kissing women regardless of whether they consent. Although Trump has done more than 100 interviews with “Access Hollywood,” a syndicated entertainment news program owned by NBCUniversal, a spokesperson indicated Saturday that producers haven’t found any similar footage.“We have combed through every interview we have done with Mr. Trump over the past 20 years and at this time, we have not uncovered any other footage that rises to this level,” the spokesperson told The Huffington Post. Trump has promoted his properties ― and himself ― in television appearances, and there could be still-unearthed outtakes or b-roll from news and entertainment show. But the treasure trove of candid Trump footage would presumably be from his years hosting “The Apprentice,” a reality competition show owned by Mark Burnett Productions. Former “Apprentice” producer Bill Pruitt suggested Saturday on Twitter there’s “worse” footage than what surfaced Friday. Pruitt did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Mark Burnett Productions spokeswoman also did not immediately return a call. Although “The Apprentice” aired on NBC for more than a decade, the company’s news division doesn’t have access to the program’s archives.“We don’t own the footage,” an NBC News spokesperson said. “We’re pursuing it along with every other news organization reporting on this story.”Trump’s misogynistic behavior has been on display throughout his career in business and television, as well as during the 2016 presidential campaign. Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s first question during the first Republican primary debate, in August 2015, was about the candidate’s history of sexist remarks about women ― calling them “fat pigs,” “dogs” and “disgusting animals.” Days later, Trump suggested on CNN that Kelly was menstruating when she asked it. And Trump has shown no sign of changing since winning the GOP’s nomination. He has sought the advice of former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who left the network in disgrace amid rampant sexual harassment allegations. On the morning after the first presidential debate, Trump criticized a former beauty pageant winner for gaining weight. News organizations are expected to vet presidential candidates’ past conduct and have highlighted examples of Trump’s inappropriate behavior in recent months. Slate’s Seth Stevenson reported in June on Trump’s off-camera misogyny on the set of “The Apprentice,” a topic that gained more traction this past week.The Associated Press’ Garance Burke reported on Monday that Trump “repeatedly demeaned women with sexist language” while shooting the reality show.One former crew member told the AP that Trump would make inappropriate comments about women when there were “10 or 12 cameras rolling and getting that footage, which is why everybody was like, this guy just doesn’t care.”It was this investigation ― which included interviews with more than 20 interviews with former crew members, editors and contestants ― that apparently prompted an “Access Hollywood” producer to dig up the 2005 video of Trump and former co-host Bush.Executive producer Rob Silverstein and his team examined the video days later and debated how to proceed, according to CNN’s Brian Stelter. “Access Hollywood” was reportedly preparing a story, but hadn’t planned to air it on Friday’s show ― meaning it wouldn’t run until after the second presidential debate.It remains unclear what, specifically, was holding up the show’s producers from airing a clearly newsworthy video and what motivated the source to leak it on Friday. Around 11 a.m. Friday, a source brought the tape to the attention of The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold, a reporter who has stood out this election cycle for doggedly digging into Trump’s murky charitable giving. Fahrenthold contacted the Trump campaign, “Access Hollywood” and NBC for comment, and published the story around 4 p.m.NBC News became of aware of the 2005 footage last week, but was holding back on reporting on it until “Access Hollywood” ran its segment. However, NBC News posted its own piece online within minutes of the Post breaking the story, and immediately began covering the subject on MSNBC. The leaker’s identity remains a mystery, but Silverstein said Friday it wasn’t him. “I am the last person in the world who would release that tape,” he told The New York Post. “Trust me. Let’s remember that. No chance. Don’t even infer it’s me. I don’t know who leaked it. I have no idea.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

88,88,RELIGION,"Why I Can No Longer Support My Former Employer, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship","Matthew D. Taylor, ContributorBorn fundamentalist, raised Evangelical, seminary trained, now...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-i-can-no-longer-support-my-former-employer-intervarsity_us_57f9623ce4b0d786aa52b463,They have drawn the wrong line in the sand.,2016-10-08,"Students pray during Intervarsity Christian Fellowship meeting at Cal State Northridge on SEPTEMBER 22, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fb8fcf1a00006e145b8413.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday, I discovered in a Time.com article, that my former employer, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, an interdenominational evangelical ministry to college campuses, had drawn a line in the sand for its employees and that any of them who did not affirm in whole the organization’s stance on sexuality, including its theological opposition to gay marriage, would be summarily fired. This came as a disappointment but not a shock.Over the past few years, InterVarsity has had a series of high profile conflicts about their theological requirements for student leaders, accusations of discrimination against gay and lesbian students, and battles over derecognition and bans from particular private colleges. In 2014, I wrote a letter to then-president of InterVarsity Alec Hill, detailing my concerns about the unnecessarily confrontational and rigid stance that InterVarsity was taking with regards to issues of sexuality, to which I received a thoughtful and congenial but still disagreeing reply.I was involved with InterVarsity for more than a decade (four years as a student leader, seven years as a paid staff-member and team leader), and I am still grateful for many of the things the organization gave me. I entered the fellowship as a wide-eyed college freshman from a Fundamentalist-Evangelical and only-private-Christian-school background now dislocated at a large, secular state school. I found in InterVarsity a ragtag community of fellow Christians who wanted to enjoy the college experience and maintain their faith. I liked that the IV people drank beer and cursed (strict no-nos where I came from), but more importantly they had a generous open-heartedness, a willingness to welcome people from Catholic, Mainline Protestant, evangelical, and non-religious backgrounds.I loved the way that IV bucked the trends of many evangelical institutions, taking strong stances in favor of racial and ethnic reconciliation, advocating for social justice, and unequivocally affirming women in leadership. I was proud to come on staff with the organization after college to work mentoring students and leading Bible studies. I left IV in 2010, but many of my friends are still campus staff members there, and I have followed with interest the developments of recent years.InterVarsity’s decision came in the last few months after a several-year process of internal theological refinement. The organization is quick to clarify that it is not doing this as an anti-gay thing, but rather as a part of their holistic commitment to an“orthodox” theology of human sexuality. I understand why InterVarsity and its leaders have felt compelled to take the stance that they have. From their perspective, our culture has shifted rapidly and evangelical faith takes courage to stand for what you believe in and, legally, they could be in a bind if they don’t strictly define what they believe before they enforce it. I also understand how they interpret the Bible as not allowing any room for sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage. I used to be within their consensus.Some in seeking to defend the firm stance InterVarsity has taken have pointed to the parallel case in the early 20th century when Fundamentalist Protestants staked out what they believed to be the clear, if previously undefined, “orthodox” commitments to the infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible and to the premillennial return of Christ. This is an apt and telling comparison in that the Fundamentalists’ inelastic and narrow definitions of what you must believe and say to be a true Christian in the modern world have not stood the test of time very well. Sure, there are still inerrantists and premillennialist individuals and organizations out there, but many evangelical institutions like InterVarsity itself have eschewed those distinctions and scrupulously avoided including such phrasings in their statements of faith. I recall shrugging with my former colleagues in IV at how laughable and hair-splitting the fights among evangelicals about the metaphysics of the Bible and the timelines of eschatology can get.The lesson I take from my study of Christian history is that orthodoxy takes centuries to define and does come with some sharp edges, but orthodoxy is also capacious and preserves the mystery of the Christian faith rather than anxiously enumerating every fine point and every jot and tittle of the Law. Sure, Arius gets kicked out of the church at the Council of Nicaea because he won’t say homoousios, but the end product of that Council is a creed that Catholics and Protestants and Eastern Orthodox can say in unison and agreement nigh 17 centuries later. There is room for disagreement and debate within orthodoxy, hence the entire adventure of Christian theology through the millennia.InterVarsity and its defenders feel that they are defending what the Bible says and a biblical theology of human sexuality. But the Bible doesn’t say anything, or, if it does, it doesn’t speak with a single voice. What we get in the canon of the Bible is a whole lot of inspired disagreements and discussions, a cacophony of reflections on God and on the Christ event, and a strong sense of the squabbles and foibles of the early Christian church. Then, as now, the Christian faith was contentious and extroverted, and if we can in retrospect reconcile Paul and James on faith and works, we are probably going further than they ever did. Simply put, the Bible doesn’t resolve the great debates of Christian history; it occasions them. That is why Arius and Athanasius were both quoting the New Testament and why advocates for LGBTIQ rights in Christian communities and their detractors are still wrestling with and exegeting the same passages.My difficult message to my InterVarsity friends is this: The truth of the Bible and the boundaries of orthodoxy don’t rest upon 20-page position papers on human sexuality. It’s much, much more complicated than that. There’s a reason the great ecumenical creeds don’t define sexuality (or, for that matter, a singular approach to interpreting the Bible). Orthodoxy lives in the disagreements among Christians of good will who come to the scriptures genuinely and openly.So I am withdrawing my financial and moral support from InterVarsity. I think that they have drawn the wrong line in the sand, that it is a line that is arbitrary, that ends discussion and dialogue rather than encouraging them, that hurts real people in the name of a narrow interpretive consensus. It is my hope that my friends who remain with the organization will remain my friends. I doubt that my meager, Ph.D.-student contribution of $75 a month will make much of a dent in InterVarsity’s bottom line. And I will continue to hope that the important, nay essential theological conversations of our time will be carried forward in an irenic, ecumenical and generous spirit that is worthy of the God in whose love we have room for debate."

What’s left to do in this presidential campaign except shout about women’s hoohas?Ana Navarro, a Republican CNN contributor, went ahead and took care of that early Saturday. Hours after a bombshell video surfaced of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump making lewd comments about women ― he talked about grabbing women “by the pussy,” among other things ― Navarro tore into Republicans still standing by him.“I think that every single Republican is going to have to answer the question, ‘What did you do the day you saw the tape of this man boasting about grabbing a woman’s pussy?’” Navarro said angrily. “Period.”That was too much raunch for fellow panelist Scottie Nell Hughes, a Trump surrogate, who chided Navarro for using the “p” word.“Will you please stop saying that word?” Hughes said. “My daughter is listening.”That did NOT go over well with Navarro.“You know what Scottie? Don’t tell me you’re offended when I say ‘pussy,’ but you’re not offended when Donald Trump says it!” Navarro shouted at Hughes. “I’m not running for president. He is.”Hughes tried to interject, but Navarro kept going.“Don’t act outraged and offended when I say the word that you’re not offended by the man who you are supporting for president is saying,” Navarro continued. “That is absurd.”“I said I was offended by him saying that too,” Hughes said quietly.Here’s a video of their exchange:The show had to go to commercial break, but not before Navarro ended the segment with an agitated, “Mmmm.” When the show came back, she was missing from the panel. She tweeted soon after that she was going to bed.The best thing that came from the segment may be this Vine video of panelists’ reactions to Navarro’s tirade. It doesn’t get old.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

100,100,GREEN,Arkansas Town Is Dropping Live Turkeys From Plane Again This Year,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-drop-trot-yellville-arkansas_us_57f92100e4b0b6a43032b9e4,"""This is a horrific act of abuse.""",2016-10-08,"The annual ""turkey drop"" in Yellville, Arkansas has sparked outrage from animal advocates.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f92329170000c316aca72c.jpeg?cache=W0bXtsov0g&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For some, “turkey drop” refers to the Thanksgiving-vacation breakup that commonly occurs for college freshmen in long-distance relationships.Not in Yellville, Arkansas. There, the phrase refers to a longstanding tradition of dropping live turkeys from a plane 500 feet in the air at the town’s annual “Turkey Trot” fall festival.The practice is continuing this year, despite opposition from animal rights groups and social media users after an Arkansas Times blog post condemning the drop went viral. A letter-writing campaign resulted in more than 1,000 emails going out to each of the event’s 13 sponsors.On Friday, six turkeys were chucked from the plane. One died on impact, while five were able to use their wings to glide to the ground, Arkansas Online reports. Spectators caught two of the surviving turkeys. One turkey-catcher told the news outlet his family will eat the bird, while another said he didn’t know what he’d do with the turkey because he hadn’t “thought that far ahead.”More turkeys were set to be dropped on Saturday. KARK4 News Reporter Mitchell McCoy tweeted video showing a drop on Saturday morning.Defenders of the drop point out that wild turkeys can fly, so throwing them from the plane won’t kill them. That defense would seem to be weakened by the death of one of the birds at Friday’s festival. It’s also unclear whether the turkeys are wild or domesticated. The moderator of a community Facebook page for the Turkey Trot did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Huffington Post.But even though some of the turkeys are able to survive the drop, the experience itself is terrifying, poultry science professor Yvonne Vizzier Thaxton told Arkansas Online.“Placing turkeys in an environment that is new to them is stressful,” she said. “In the case of an airplane, the noise would also be a stress-producing fear reaction. Dropping one from 500 feet is a horrific act of abuse.”This story has been updated with news that more turkeys would be dropped Saturday and that the event’s sponsors had received 1,000 emails."
112,112,POLITICS,Most Voters Already Thought Donald Trump Didn't Respect Women,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-respect-women-poll_us_57f81eeae4b068ecb5de89f8,The latest news cycle probably won't help.,2016-10-07,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Henderson, Nevada, this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f821531b0000e218ef56c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even before tapes of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women emerged Friday, fewer than one-third of voters thought the GOP nominee respected women. In a HuffPost/YouGov survey taken earlier this week, 54 percent of registered voters said Trump does not respect women, while just 32 percent said he does. Only 28 percent of female voters believe Trump respects women.Coming on the heels of Trump’s recent crusade against former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, those numbers are perhaps unsurprising. What’s notable, however, is that it actually marks something of an improvement for the Republican nominee. In April, just 26 percent of voters said he respected women and 62 percent said he did not.So, which voters changed their minds? Not Democratic or Democratic-leaning ones: Just 6 percent believe Trump respects women, virtually the same as the 7 percent who said so in April. Voters who don’t lean toward either party have grown slightly more likely than they were to say Trump respects women ― 38 percent now do so, up from 33 percent in April. But the biggest shift by far was among Republican and Republican-leaning voters. In April, 48 percent said they thought Trump respected women. Now, 60 percent do. The change was especially noticeable among female Republican voters. Fifty-nine percent say in the poll that Trump respects women, up from just 43 percent in April.“I think people make mountains out of molehills,” Cindy Korol, a Michigan Trump supporter, told HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn at a rally earlier this month. “He may have said some things, but look at what [Clinton’s] done. She’s a liar. ... For him to call somebody ‘fat,’ big deal.”One explanation is that Trump has genuinely convinced a significant share of GOP voters that he values women. His general election campaign, however, has been regularly marred by controversies over his treatment of women.A more cynical explanation is this: During the primary election, when Trump wasn’t yet their party’s nominee, Republicans were more comfortable expressing doubts about his behavior. Now, having rallied behind him, they’re willing to ignore or downplay any attendant issues in the name of partisanship.That raises the question of how much damage Trump will actually suffer on the basis of yet one more story ― albeit an unusually graphic one ― focused on his interactions with women.Past polling, however, has suggested that his past disparaging remarks toward women, including Carly Fiorina and Megyn Kelly, have been genuinely off-putting to voters.Even if Trump manages to suffer no further damage from the newest controversy, he already faces a notable deficit against Hillary Clinton on gender issues. The most recent Quinnipiac survey shows him lagging her by 20 points among female voters.A 56 percent majority of voters in the HuffPost/YouGov poll say Clinton respects women. They say by a 14-point margin, 41 percent to 27 percent, that electing her as president would be generally good for women. By a 21-point margin, 42 percent to 21 percent, they say electing Trump would be generally bad.The survey also reveals significant partisan disagreement on the obstacles women currently face. Eighty-two percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say women face some or a lot of discrimination in the U.S. Just 40 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say the same.There’s an even wider divide along views of Trump’s treatment of women. Voters who believe Trump doesn’t respect women are more than three times as likely as those who do to say that women face at least some discrimination, at 83 percent and 25 percent, respectively.Full results of the survey, among all Americans, here.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 5-Oct. 6 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum 23.1 percent for a branded drug.Mylan said will record a pre-tax charge of about $465 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30.The company, citing changes to the EpiPen consumer discount program and upcoming launch of a generic version of the treatment, said it now expects full-year 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $4.70 to $4.90, down from a previous range of $4.85 to $5.15 per share.

Thirty-two percent said that they were voting for Republican candidate Donald Trump, while 19 percent said they were voting for the Democratic pick Hillary Clinton ― meaning that this year, Trump is leading by only 13 percentage points. The results could be a symptom of a division within American Christianity. While a number of prominent Christians have sided with the Republican nominee, many evangelical leaders are firmly in the #NeverTrump camp, pointing out that the candidate’s policies and actions don’t reflect Christian values.LifeWay researchers also asked the pastors what characteristic matters the most when choosing a candidate. The two most popular answers were personal character (27 percent) and the candidate’s likely Supreme Court nominees (20 percent). Other factors included the candidate’s ability to protect religious freedom (12 percent), his or her position on abortion (10 percent), and ability to improve the economy (6 percent).Interestingly, pastors who said they are casting a vote for Trump were more likely to choose “likely Supreme Court nominees” and “position on abortion” as the candidate’s most important characteristic. The Trump voters were also less likely to say that personal character matters most. On the other hand, Protestant pastors voting for Clinton were more likely to say that personal character and immigration issues were important in choosing how to vote this election season. According to LifeWay Research, the survey was conducted before the first presidential debate, between August 22 and September 16. The Washington Post reports that the firm’s survey this year was conducted slightly earlier than the surveys done in 2012 and 2008. The margin of error for the 2016 study is plus or minus 3.2 percent.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

In most cases, the payments were worth less than $50, researchers found. But a few doctors were taking industry payments worth at least $93,622.“Most dermatologist in the U.S. – about 73 percent according to this database – received some form of payment from industry,” said lead author Dr. Marie Leger, a dermatologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian in New York City. “That being said, most dermatologists get a modest amount from industry.”It’s difficult to know what these payments mean, but seeing how money flows from industry to the dermatology profession is important to understanding the relationship between those two groups, Leger told Reuters Health.She and her colleagues analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Sunshine Act Open Payment database, which records payments made to doctors from U.S. medical manufacturers and group-purchasing organizations.They found that in 2014, 8,333 dermatologists received 208,613 different payments totaling about $34 million. Those payments could take a number of forms, including gifts, grants, education, consulting and food and beverages. That $34 million, however, represents less than 1 percent of the roughly $6.5 billion paid to doctors in 2014, the researchers report in JAMA Dermatology.A quarter of dermatologists received less than $100, 63 percent received less than $500 and 78 percent received less than $1,000. The top 10 percent of doctors received at least $3,940, which represented 90 percent of the total paid to dermatologists.“I think we knew there were interactions, but we didn’t know how many interactions there were,” said lead author Dr. Hao Feng, of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. “We were surprised that in general it was a modest amount of money.” The top 1 percent of dermatologists received at least $93,622, which accounted for 44 percent of the total.About 81 percent of the compensation to the dermatologists came from drug companies.Almost a third of payments were listed as speaking fees, about 22 percent were listed as consulting fees and about 17 percent were listed as research payments.Dr. Jack Resneck, of the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, points out in an accompanying editorial that the payment database is limited.He wrote that it can be improved if providers are allowed to see what payments industry submit and by the categories better describing interactions.“Some straightforward changes would substantially improve the situation,” he wrote.Since the database is missing information about the context of these payments, it’s difficult to get a better understanding of the interaction between industry and doctors, Feng told Reuters Health.“That’s something that is really difficult – if not impossible - to get from this database,” said Feng.For example, Leger wondered if the financial connection between industry and dermatology may affect how the specialty advocates for patients in terms of drug costs. “I think this study maps points of contact in an important way and I think there’s more to explore for what those points of contact mean,” she said.SOURCE: bit.ly/2dIi6pj and bit.ly/2dIhQ9T JAMA Dermatology, online October 5, 2016."

The severe drought has depleted its levels to about 50 percent of its capacity.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f7b3fa1a000067145b7bbf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Unless the world takes drastic steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which spur on climate change, the U.S. Southwest’s chances of facing devastating, multi-decade “megadroughts” will only continue to grow — and that risk remains even if precipitation rises, according to a new study published this week in the Science Advances academic journal.The study, authored by scientists at Cornell University, Columbia University and NASA, notes that the chances of a megadrought ― a drought that lasts more than 35 years ― will rise from a 5 to 15 percent risk over the past century to a 20-50 percent risk in this one under a business-as-usual scenario of ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.The region’s risk of a megadrought, which the researchers say would impose “unprecedented” stresses on the region’s water resources, increases even more depending on how high average temperatures rise in the coming years.If a temperature rise of 4 degrees Celsius, or 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit, is accompanied by an unchanged level of precipitation, the risk rises to 90 percent. If precipitation decreases, the risk grows to an almost-certain 99 percent. This is because when temperatures rise, the atmosphere’s demand for moisture also increases, which leads to moisture in soil and plants evaporating at a faster rate.The fact that megadrought risk did not dissipate even in scenarios where precipitation increases came as a surprise to the scientists and was a key takeaway from the research, lead author and Cornell earth and atmospheric sciences professor Toby Ault told The Huffington Post via email.“It is obviously important because it forces us to rethink our expectations for the amount of water that will be available to us in the changing climate of this century,” Ault said.The only scenario when the researchers observed a significant decrease in megadrought risk was one where greenhouse gas emissions were cut dramatically — keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Farenheit — which nearly slashed the risk in half.Is such action possible? Ault is cautiously optimistic, pointing to the global Paris climate agreement, which was ratified this week, as a sign of progress.He also sees hope in increasing private sector investments in alternative and renewable energy sources, helped along by consumer preferences and market forces that are making those investments more economically viable.“Changes are happening, awareness is growing, and I’m hopeful the changing political and economic climate will allow us to avoid many of the worst case scenarios of the changing physical climate, only one of which would be megadrought,” Ault noted.Meanwhile, the region still remains gripped by extreme drought conditions and water conservation efforts have begun to lose momentum. As the California drought enters its sixth year, the state has experienced three consecutive months of reduced water conservation. And in the Colorado River Basin, where drought conditions have persisted for 16 years, its largest reservoir, Lake Mead, shrunk to its lowest water level ever earlier this spring.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

He was accused last December of attacking a fellow student on the basis of that student’s ethnicity, reportedly asking the victim if he was “from the Middle East,” grabbing him by the throat and threatening to put a bullet in his chest.So what does any of this have to do with Trump?Well, after Tavella admitted to police that his attack was racially motivated, his lawyer, Wayne Bradburn, tried to get the felony charges dismissed by claiming Tavella had been inspired by the Republican presidential nominee.As the Centre Daily Times reported:Tavella’s attorney, Wayne Bradburn, requested Sinclair throw out the felony charge of ethnic intimidation, because the statute requires the defendant had “malicious intent.”The “Donald Trump inspired me to do it” defense may seem like a novel legal theory. But because hate crime or “ethnic intimidation” laws typically require a high standard of proof, it wasn’t the craziest gambit ever trotted out in a courtroom.Alas, the Republican nominee is capable of a lot of things, but getting Tavella off the hook apparently wasn’t one of them. The former student is now scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 18.Bradburn did not return The Huffington Post’s request for comment.The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

Browne will not legally change his name or undergo a physical transition until his hockey career is over, he said he told the league.“The Commissioner immediately responded that all would be taken care of, and made it clear that the league office had my unconditional support,” Browne wrote. “That was so nice to hear.”“At the end of the day, Harrison is the same player he was last year,” Rylan told ESPN. “We’re here to support him.

The “Jane the Virgin” actress will produce and host Marie Claire Young Women’s Honors, a televised award ceremony intended to spotlight the accomplishments of diverse women who are making a difference in the world. In a statement released Thursday, Rodriguez said her goal in creating the event is to foster “inclusivity” and celebrate women’s unlimited potential – a mission that is near and dear to the Chicago native’s heart.“As a young Latina, I had to break down barriers and overcome naysayers,” she said. “When you see someone following their dreams, it gives you allowance to follow your own.” Especially if that person comes from a similar background or culture. In a promotional video for the event (above), the 32-year-old explained she was fortunate enough to have had positive role models who looked like her, and she wants to ensure that other young women do, too. “I want to infuse [the media] with heroes that look like them, that are from similar backgrounds or similar cultures, similar communities, that allow them to have a blueprint for a life that they can have themselves,” she shared. Rodriguez went on to say the award show is about enriching people’s lives.“I want to create a platform of these young women, that they can speak to as many people as possible to share their story, to exchange stories, and to then give hope that others can create a story just as beautiful and successful as theirs,” she said. The show will honor young women who are breaking barriers and blazing trails in various fields including philanthropy, technology, science, education, and environmentalism.

Kids in hospitals across the state are getting free dance lessons, thanks to the nonprofit organization Dancin Power. Instructors with the Oakland, Calif.-based group adapt their lessons to accommodate kids’ physical and emotional restrictions. That way, everyone is able to dance. Dancin Power got started in 2006 and has gotten special attention recently, after a video about the organization went viral.The lessons ― in Hula, traditional Brazilian dance, hip hop and other forms of dance ― are designed to make the children’s days a little brighter.“For that moment, the patients and their families are able to interact with one another in a non-medical way,” Vania Deonizio, the group’s founder and president, told The Huffington Post in an email. “They are laughing, learning something new, having a good time, feeling happy together!”The instructors first check in with the hospital to see which patients they’re working with and what restrictions they have. Then the instructors work with the youngsters in groups or one-on-one.If necessary, classes are held in patients’ hospital rooms ― with special precautions taken to avoid jeopardizing the kids’ sometimes precarious health.“Sometimes we have kids that are undergoing chemo and have very low immune system and have to be in isolated areas,” Deonizio told HuffPost. “In those cases our Dancin Power teachers then have to wear masks, gowns, gloves to go teach those kids at their bedside.”Deonizio said it was important to involve the patients’ loved ones as well as the kids themselves.“We believe when a child is sick, it truly affects the entire family,” she told HuffPost. “By having the whole family, and at times their doctors and nurses too participating, we create community, a very supportive and fun one.”The classes have a big impact on the kids’ outlook, Deonizio said. The children may be a bit uncertain at the start, she said, but once they get involved “the shyness goes away, and laughter and joy come in.”Dr. Mai Ngo of UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital has seen the program in action. She told HuffPost in an email that it is “one of the most feel-good services offered to patients” ― and that it’s especially helpful to kids recovering from severe injuries.“Getting them out of bed and into a wheelchair to move their bodies in Dancin Power helps prevent de-conditioning, so their muscles do not get even weaker from immobility,” she explained. “It improves their mood and builds their confidence in the control they have of their own bodies in medical situations when they feel completely out of control.”And the patients aren’t the only ones who benefit from the program.“Every time I teach I learn something new from my students/patients,” Deonizio told HuffPost. “[A] few of the most important lessons I take every time I teach is the reminder of being completely present, appreciate the moment, have gratitude and never give up.”To learn more about Dancin Power, visit their website here.

Those headlines do not necessarily reflect how her own campaign viewed Clinton’s speeches, which were an issue during the primary contest against Sen.

About 13,000 visitors are expected for this year’s go-round, Jennifer Tavares, president of the local chamber of commerce, told HuffPost.The weekend “is like a dream come true for many children and their parents,” she said. “Events like this are a truly unique experience to which watching the movies cannot compare.”This year, more than 35 vendors and businesses will offer special activities for the weekend: There will be movie showings, themed food tastings and even Horcruxes hidden around town for young wizards to find.The festival’s main street fair is completely free, though a few events, like the adult “potion-making” (aka cocktail-making) classes, are ticketed. Even hotels are getting in on the action, offering deals for out-of-town fans.There are no reservations necessary for Wizarding Weekend: All you’ll need to do is hop on a broomstick er, car or plane to Ithaca, about a four-hour drive from New York City."
247,247,POLITICS,Donald Trump: Undocumented Immigrants Are Pouring Over The Border To Vote,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-immigrants-election_us_57f7b7cae4b0e655eab39e8b,Another reason he thinks the election is rigged against him.,2016-10-07,"Donald Trump is concerned that the Obama administration is letting immigrants ""pour into the country"" to vote in the presidential election. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump is accusing the government of letting undocumented immigrants “pour into the country so they can go and vote” in November ― the latest conspiracy theory the Republican presidential nominee is perpetuating to delegitimize the election. “You hear a thing like that, and it’s a disgrace,” Trump told members of the National Border Patrol Council, a union that has endorsed him, at Trump Tower in New York on Friday. “Well, it will be a lot different if I get elected.”Trump was responding to a comment from the union’s vice president, Art Del Cueto, who said immigration agents are setting aside criminal background checks because they’re “so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected.”“They want to hurry up and fast track them so they can go ahead and vote in the election,” Del Cueto explained, apparently referring to immigrants who are waiting to become naturalized U.S. citizens.But naturalization is a wholly separate issue from illegal border crossings. And the idea that unauthorized immigrants will pour into the country to vote is flawed for a few reasons: For one, undocumented immigrants are not allowed to vote. Also, it takes about five years to become a U.S. citizen after obtaining a green card. And while conservatives have long accused undocumented immigrants of committing voter fraud, a 2013 report found that that very rarely happens. It’s also true that a large number of green card-holders are applying for citizenship this year ― some of them in hopes of voting against Trump ― but it is legal for them to do so. Some Republicans have accused the Obama administration of trying to speed up approval of those applications ahead of the election. Groups that encourage immigrants to naturalize and vote say the opposite is happening, and that a backlog could prevent some applications from being processed in time. The National Border Patrol Council has been very critical of the Obama administration for not being sufficiently committed to deportations. Last year, the group falsely accused the president of “threatening” border patrol agents to implement his executive actions on immigration. Trump, meanwhile, has complained numerous times that the presidential election is “rigged” against him, including during the GOP primaries. After courts struck down voter ID laws as discriminatory in August, he said he expected a lot of voter fraud to occur in November. “People are going to walk in there, they’re going to vote 10 times, maybe. Who knows? They’re going to vote 10 times,” he said.White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters he had not seen Trump’s comments accusing undocumented immigrants of coming to the U.S. to vote, according to a pool report. “I have no idea what he would use to back those up,” he said.In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron did not address Trump’s meeting with border patrol union members directly, but stressed that “our borders are not open to illegal immigration” and outlined the legal requirements immigrants must meet before voting in an election.“Under federal law, an individual must be a U.S. citizen either by birth or naturalization to vote in a federal election in the United States,” Catron said. “If a foreign national seeks to naturalize, he or she would need to meet many requirements before doing so, generally including residing in the United States as a lawful permanent resident for at least 5 years.”U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on Trump’s statement.Cristian Farias and Elise Foley contributed reporting.

Rick Scott (R) refuses to extend his state’s voter registration deadline because of Hurricane Matthew, a Category 4 storm approaching the U.S. southeast coast. The storm, predicted to be the strongest to make landfall in the U.S. in more than a decade, prompted Hillary Clinton’s campaign to call for extending voter registration beyond next Tuesday’s deadline.“We’re hoping and expecting that officials in Florida are adapting deadlines to account for the storm,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Thursday. Scott, who has endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump for president, said he wouldn’t honor that request.“I’m not going to extend it,” Scott said during a press conference Thursday evening. “Everybody’s had a lot of time to register. On top of that, we have lots of opportunities to vote, early voting and absentee voting, so I don’t intend to make any changes.”Scott quickly faced pushback. Speaking with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D) said she and other members of the state’s congressional delegation would send a letter to Scott pressing him to extend the deadline from Tuesday to Friday.“It’s clearly the responsible and essential thing to do, we have people who have been expecting to have a few extra days before that deadline to register to vote,” Wasserman Schultz said. “That’s the most fundamental right we have is to be able to register and cast our ballot to select our leaders and, you know, I certainly hope Gov. Scott will ... reconsider.”Wasserman Schultz’s office told The Huffington Post that all members of the Florida delegation, including Republicans, are invited to sign the letter.South Carolina, which the storm also is forecast to hit, has already extended its voter registration deadline.Read more on Hurricane Matthew here. On Friday, Wasserman Schultz sent the letter to Scott urging him to extend the registration deadline. Nine other House Democrats and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) also signed the letter.“It goes without saying that our democracy is stronger when more people vote,” reads the letter. “With a natural disaster on our doorstep, registering to vote understandably will not be possible in the immediate aftermath of such a significant storm. Of course, clean up and dealing with storm-related damage will be many Floridians’ priority.”The letter continues: “Therefore, we respectfully request an extension of the voter registration deadline so that we may ensure the franchise, the integrity of our democracy, and the rights we as Americans hold dear, are fully protected.”"

The organization estimates that 500,000 children in the southern departments of Grande Anse and Grand South ― who make up half of the region’s total population ― are at risk of illnesses linked to water contamination.UNICEF isn’t seeing this yet, Walther added, but it’s anticipating a resurgence of sicknesses like diarrhea and cholera.Cholera has plagued Haiti since the devastating earthquake that struck the country in 2010. U.N. peacekeepers who had been in Nepal brought the disease with them when they arrived in Haiti. The U.N. didn’t admit its role in the outbreak until last month.In the last six years, cholera has killed at least 10,000 people. And 27,000 cholera cases have been recorded between January 2016 and right before the hurricane, Walther said.UNICEF also fears the spread of malnutrition. “It’s harvest season right now,” Walther explained. “There has been inadequate rain in the last three years and all infrastructure has been eliminated. Now, with new destruction, we can expect malnutrition.”Aid workers are busy trying to see that this doesn’t happen. Before the storm hit, UNICEF had made emergency preparations capable of reaching 10,000 people.But three days in, the extent of the damage in Haiti indicates there’s a much greater need.The organization’s highest priority is getting children access to potable water ― but this has grown exponentially more difficult, given Haiti’s lack of infrastructure and hurricane-ravaged roads.“A truck came yesterday with a delivery of aqua tablets,” Walther said. “But it’s clear that it’s not enough.” "

On Friday, it dived about 10 percent from levels around $1.2600 to $1.1378 GBP=D4 in a matter of minutes in thin early Asian trade.That low was later revised to $1.1491 ― still the weakest level for sterling since 1985 ― by Thomson Reuters, which owns the Reuters foreign exchange brokerage platform RTSL and said an outlying trade had been cancelled.The drop in Asia came after French President Francois Hollande said the EU needed to remain firm with Britain, after it appeared Prime Minister Theresa May had opted for a tougher exit from Europe. The hardline stance from both parties left investors fretting about the pound’s future.“Of course, some in the market may see sterling’s overnight volatility to be the result of French President Hollande demanding tough Brexit negotiations,” said Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The new British government under May appears to have chosen an economic course which could bear substantial risks.”Sterling recovered and was last fetching $1.2275 GBP=D3, still down 2.7 percent on the day. The euro also rose to 94.03 pence EURGBP=D4, its highest since early 2009, before easing to 90.66 pence, up 2.5 percent. All of which saw the sterling trade-weighted index down 1.6 percent at 74.7 =GBP, its lowest since January 2009.Global markets have been on edge in recent days on worries about how Britain will exit the EU and about May’s comments on loose monetary policy, which some saw as a thinly veiled attack on the Bank of England.Many investors think May’s government is leaning towards a hard Brexit, where Britain gives up full access to the single market in order to impose full control on its borders. Some fear that could hinder trade and constrict the foreign investment needed to fund Britain’s huge current account deficit, one of the biggest in the developed world.HSBC said on Friday it forecast the pound to drop to $1.10 and parity against the euro by the end of 2017.“The pound used to be a relatively simple currency that used to trade on cyclical events and data, but now it has become a political and structural currency. This is a recipe for weakness given (Britain’s) twin (budget and current account) deficits,” HSBC’s global head of FX research David Bloom said.MODERN VERSION OF SOROSSterling is set for a weekly loss of 5.4 percent, trading below the psychological $1.25 mark and removing various technical support levels on the move lower, spooking traders, including computer-driven algorithms.“Once the pound started moving lower, then more technical algos could have followed suit, compounding the short, sharp, selling pressure,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index.“Thus, the pound has been the victim of the digital, headline-driven world that we live in. For sterling, algorithms have become the modern-day version of a George Soros.”Billionaire Soros earned fame in 1992 by betting against the pound, which was eventually forced out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and sharply devalued on Black Wednesday.Earlier this year, the South African rand suffered a similar plunge and analysts said the sharp drop in sterling will do nothing for confidence in a market that has seen volumes drop as tougher regulations for banks, traditionally the dominant force, bite and curtail trading by humans.“The greater share of the market that automated algorithmic trading takes in a less reliably liquid market, the greater the risk of these types of moves going forward,” said Derek Halpenny, head of research at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi.The weakness in the British pound helped support the dollar before U.S. jobs data later on Friday. The dollar index .DXY was up 0.3 percent at 97.093, its highest since late July.The employment report is expected to show U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 jobs in the month, according to the median estimate of 100 economists polled by Reuters. A strong report would increase bets that the U.S. central bank is gearing up to raise interest rates in December.(Additional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in Singapore; Editing by Catherine Evans)"

The Obama administration and the International Rescue Committee, which Texas had named as defendants, did not oppose the motion. This means the court will dismiss the case altogether.A federal judge in June ruled that Texas had no legal recourse against either party. The state had alleged it had a right to be consulted before the U.S. government and the refugee organization entered into a contract to resettle Syrian refugees.Texas’ change of position comes days after a conservative three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Chicago chastised Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) over his attempts to bar Syrian refugees from his state.Paxton, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on dropping the appeal. After his case was dismissed in June, he said Texas was acting to protect “the safety of Texans from domestic and foreign threats.”Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, seemed surprised Paxton wouldn’t comment on withdrawing the appeal. The ACLU represented the refugee organization in the litigation.“Whatever was in the attorney general’s mind, I hope that other states take these lessons to heart,” Wang said. “They’re just wrong in the law ― their mean-spirited and ill-informed efforts to block Syrian refugee families from resettlement have gone nowhere.”Donna Duvin, the executive director of the International Rescue Committee’s Dallas office said in a statement that the state’s decision is in line with the lawfulness of refugee resettlement in Texas.“The move also aligns with what’s actually happening in Texas communities where refugees typically are warmly welcomed and supported as they rebuild their lives here,” said Duvin, who renewed her organization’s call for Texas to reconsider withdrawing from the federal refugee resettlement program.Syrian refugees go through extensive vetting before coming to the U.S. ― including interviews, research through multiple intelligence agencies’ databases, health checks and social media screening. Intelligence officials have said that it’s difficult to vet people from a war-torn country, and impossible to guarantee a risk-free process, but that the screening system is better than ever.At the vice presidential debate this week, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) reminded Pence about the court ruling against him, which essentially accused him of discriminating on the basis of national origin.“The governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here,” the court wrote in that ruling. “No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation.”In July, a federal judge in Alabama dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by that state against the federal government over Syrian refugee resettlement. Alabama is appealing.So far, no state has won a legal challenge to refugee resettlement efforts.Elise Foley contributed reporting."

Advocacy groups are calling for the government to decriminalize prostitution, saying it would protect sex workers against exploitation and violence.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f7b5fb1a00006e145b7bcf.jpeg?cache=ubcUxDe8it&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As South Africa’s government debates whether or not to decriminalize prostitution, advocacy groups say the current strict legislation denies women and children some of their basic rights and puts them at greater risk of violence.South Africa is home to an estimated 153,000 sex workers who are at high risk of violence, HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases. The law in South Africa currently criminalizes both the buying and selling of sex.But rights advocates say the legislation has had a host of damaging consequences, including the denial of healthcare treatment, legal protection and employment rights to sex workers as well as violence by clients and police. In the past few months, groups such as the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT), theCommission for Gender Equality and the African National CongressWomen’s League have amplified their calls to decriminalize sex work. In August, the country’s parliament held a meeting toconsider decriminalization that, if it happens, would make South Africa one of only a handful of countries in the world to lift legal sanctions against prostitution.Women & Girls Hub spoke with Nosipho Vidima, lobbying and advocacy coordinator at SWEAT, about what decriminalization might mean for South African sex workers.Women & Girls Hub: What is the nature of sex work in South Africa?Nosipho Vidima: When we are talking about sex work we are talking about a trade that actually happens everywhere, and it is not an industry that is as dark as everyone thinks. Sex work is work.The numbers of South African sex workers are difficult to estimate, but sex work is taking place where the service is demanded – in brothels, in homes and on the street. Street-based sex workers face danger from their work locations, clients and police. Brothel-based sex workers also face dangers from clients, but also from exploitation by pimps in some cases. However, in some cases pimps provide security and support to sex workers.Women & Girls Hub: Why does SWEAT want decriminalization rather than any other model of sex work?Vidima: There are four main models of sex work around the world, but only decriminalization provides for sex workers to work in safer environments, without arbitrary zoning or regulation, and reduces the human rights violations against sex workers.Firstly, we want sex work decriminalized because sex work is a victimless crime that often arises out of conditions of economic constraint. South Africa is a poverty-stricken country, women are more likely to be unemployed and the choices available for work are not necessarily going to meet everyone’s financial needs. With decriminalization you create safer working conditions and allow sex workers to access labor laws that protect them.Secondly, the laws we have around sex work originated from the apartheid era. Their purpose was to segregate white and black people, and thus in instances where a white man was caught with a black woman she was assumed to be soliciting. So this law arose out of moral discomfort with mixed-race sexual relationships. Since then, we know that the views of the public have changed. It’s no longer a question of morality. It’s about recognizing that people deserve their human dignity, and women’s bodies no longer need to be policed.Decriminalization would also reduce the likelihood of violence and violations such as arbitrary arrests and violence by police and clients by creating a context where sex workers could report these violations and seek justice for them. Sex workers would have a safer environment to work in and would be able to take ownership of their businesses.Women & Girls Hub: How do you feel about the recent calls from parliament for the decriminalization of sex work?Vidima: The process of reforming the law around sex work began in 2009 with the South African Law Reform Commission discussion paper. The final report from this project, which has the power to initiate a law reform process, has not yet been released despite having been handed to the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in 2014. There is the possibility that the report, when it is finally released, will be outdated.With this in mind, the call from Parliament to decriminalize sex work is definitely a step in the right direction. We would also like to see these issues being raised in the Cabinet so that the ministers of all the departments talk to one another about this issue, instead of working in silos. At the moment, the Department of Health supports the provision of healthcare and contraceptives and the South African National Aids Council has a plan specifically for sex workers, but other departments [justice, the police] continue to arrest sex workers arbitrarily. So there is a need for cohesion in government responses – talking to one department at a time leaves some people behind.Women & Girls Hub: What do you make of suggestions that decriminalization would lead to an increase in child sex work and the trafficking of women and children, or that sex work is inherently a harmful profession for women?Vidima: I disagree with these suggestions. In fact, criminalization makes it more difficult for sex workers to report such abuses when they see them. At SWEAT we have had sex workers come in and say, “We have seen underage children practicing sex work and we can’t report it at the police station,” because they’re afraid of being arrested themselves. Criminalization also makes it more difficult for children who have been forced into sex work to report it.Sex workers in South Africa are particularly vulnerable to violence, and as of August this year we have already had 15 reports of sex worker deaths, 11 of whom were killed by their clients. If the state decriminalized sex work, these sex workers would have been better protected by police.There are sex workers who want to leave or retire from the trade, and so our calls for decriminalization are accompanied by calls to increase economic and business skills development opportunities for women, so that when they leave sex work they are able to start new careers or run viable businesses.This conversation was edited for length and clarity.This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

In addition to the $74 billion, the country demands $819 million in royalties. Quartz pointed out that Chad’s order would be comparable to the United States fining a company more than $100 trillion.In Chad, Exxon operates oilfields and a pipeline system that transports crude oil to Cameroon for export. The country produces around 160,000 barrels of oil per day, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon, said in a statement to The Huffington Post that the company disagrees with the court ruling and is “evaluating next steps.”“This dispute relates to disagreement over commitments made by the government to the consortium, not the government’s ability to impose taxes,” Spitler wrote. “Contract sanctity and respect for the rule of law are core principles used to manage our business over the long term. It is vital for all parties to honor the terms of a contract and abide by applicable law in order to achieve the desired long-term benefits envisioned when projects begin.”Brahim Abbo Abakar, president of the Chadian court, reportedly confirmed the ruling to Bloomberg.The hefty fine from the landlocked African nation comes amid mounting troubles for Exxon in the U.S. The company faces numerous investigations into whether it lied to investors and committed fraud by covering up the risks of climate change for decades. The attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts are probing the company, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an investigation into how Exxon Mobil values future projects amid climate change and plunging oil prices.Last week, the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy group, made good on its threat to sue Exxon Mobil, filing what it says is the first U.S. legal action aimed at holding the companyaccountable for its well-documented climate change cover-up.

But not for reasons you’d assume.The actor was actually eager to yell at Prepon for not telling him about her recent engagement to their mutual friend, Ben Foster.“She just announced this engagement. I had to find out in the news! And she’s my friend, and it’s weird like that!” Kutcher told Ripa. He went on to explain that when he and Mila Kunis got engaged, Prepon thought it was “crazy”; the trio had been friends for 20 years yet she didn’t know they were an item. But, as Kutcher explained, Prepon and Foster have been friends for two decades too, so their engagement is equally as shocking. When Prepon came out for her interview, she hugged Kutcher, who mumbled, “I am so pissed off at you.” “Pre, this is unacceptable. This kind of thing is unacceptable,” he said, calling her by the nickname he’s used for years. “Kutch ... I know,” she told him, “but if anyone understands the private lives, you do.

Prepon, 36, and Foster, 35, made their red carpet debut as a couple on Tuesday night at the “Girl on a Train” premiere in New York. Rumors swirled after she was spotted rocking a diamond ring on her finger, and, soon after, sources confirmed the engagement.

And the strategic denial of truth can be equally so.,2016-10-07,"The real David Irving, holding the Polish-language version of his book ""Hitler's War."" Irving is brilliantly portrayed by actor Timothy Spall in ""Denial.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f574b2170000e00aac9bcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At a recent film screening, I had the uncanny feeling I was watching something with critical relevance to the presidential race ― though it had nothing to do with politics.The film ― aptly titled “Denial” ― explores the repercussions of the Holocaust and specifically, those who deny its historical truth.“Denial” tells the true story of American historian Deborah E. Lipstadt, played by Rachel Weisz, who published a book in 1993 called “Denying the Holocaust.” In the book, Lipstadt made references to British Holocaust denier David Irving ― who later sued Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Books, for libel. Lipstadt decided to fight Irving in court. The trial would be held in England, where the burden of proof rests with the accused. Lipstadt and her lawyers had to prove that Irving was, in fact, a Holocaust denier ― which, in this sad and crazy world of ours, meant they had to essentially prove there was a Holocaust to deny in the first place.There are people alive today who witnessed the horrors of the Holocaust with their own eyes. If that isn’t enough, there’s also ample historical and scientific evidence to prove the massacre occurred.But Irving drew “evidence” to disprove the Holocaust from the Leuchter Report, a pseudoscientific document published in 1988 that claimed the gas chambers were used only for the purposes of disinfection and fumigation.All of this was on the table during the trial with Lipstadt and her lawyers, who were tasked with proving to the judge that Irving was an anti-Semitic pseudo-historian who bent history to suit his own racist beliefs.Much was at stake. As Lipstadt worries in the film, the trial’s outcome could determine whether or not going forward it would be socially acceptable to believe the Holocaust didn’t happen. I won’t spoil the ending for you (though this is a historical film after all, so the trial’s outcome is a Google search away.) But suffice it to say that the Holocaust is rightly accepted as fact by all the characters in the film, except for Irving.And honestly, I’d expect nothing less. Imagine if David Irving were just one of many truthers out there, casually believing Elvis is still alive, the world is flat and, oh yeah, the Holocaust never happened.The scary thing is, that is the world we live in. We live in a time when truth doesn’t hold the kind of weight we’re taught it does as kids. We live in a time when people can fashion their own personal realities out of bias and bigotry, and it’s not only acceptable to do so, but actually celebrated.Case in point, the country is facing a first-rate liar and conspiracy theorist as a presidential candidate. The man who could become the next president of the United States is right at home with half-truths and worse ― and his supporters seem equally so.At a screening of “Denial” in Los Angeles, director Mick Jackson joked that the eerie similarities between Irving’s and Trump’s brands of deceit might make it seem the film was thrown together in the last few months. He has a point.Just last month a poll released by Democratic firm Public Policy Polling found that a majority of Republicans ― 54 percent ― believe President Obama to be Muslim. Forty-four percent don’t think he was born in the U.S.This is a delusion Trump himself espoused for months before finally putting the issue to rest in late September in time for the first presidential debate. President Obama, for what it’s worth, provided a long-form birth certificate in 2011 to placate hateful rhetoric surrounding his citizenship.In a similar vein, David Irving has been known issue public challenges to anyone who could come up with a document proving him wrong. He wouldn’t believe the Holocaust happened unless he could see with his own eyes a paper ordering the execution of millions of Jews, signed by Hitler himself. (Irving later admitted that the Holocaust happened, but maintains that Hitler knew nothing about it.)Evidence is always important when it comes to shaping our understandings of history and truth. But what motivates our pursuit of truth can make all the difference between fanning the flames of conspiracy and helping society evolve with greater wisdom.David Irving ― who, by the way, was sent to jail in 2006 in Austria, where Holocaust denial is illegal ― operates from a foundation of bigotry. In evidence Lipstadt’s lawyers presented during the trial depicted in “Denial,” Irving was shown to have written out a children’s ditty in his journal that went: “I am a Baby Aryan/ Not Jewish or Sectarian/ I have no plans to marry/ an Ape or Rastafarian.”Trump’s entire campaign is equally steeped in bigotry. More broadly, he operates from a place of fear, or as Vice President Joe Biden characterizes it, cynicism. Ultimately Trump believes that all systems are broken (except the ones from which he directly benefits,) and Americans are ready to hand over their power in exchange for some perceived safety.Had Irving won his case against Lipstadt, the world might be all the more accommodating of not only Holocaust denial, but the larger racist re-envisioning of history Irving puts into practice.Likewise, imagine what a Trump presidency would do to legitimize the politics of racism, misogyny and cynicism worldwide?Both Irving and Trump want us to believe we’ve been duped. Not by the white, Christian men who’ve primarily controlled western politics and society for centuries, but by Jews, Muslims, liberals, gays, African Americans, women and a host of other so-called “agendas.”Come November, we will all be on trial to determine where the moral heart of the heart of the country lies. Will we choose denial and elect the Trumps and Irvings of the world to represent us? Or will we learn from history ― real history ― and reject isolationism in favor of promoting our collective strength?I can only hope history will reflect the latter.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

U.S. lawmakers and prosecutors are also investigating what impact Mylan’s EpiPen pricing has had on government-funded health programs.CMS, in response to a request from U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said in a letter that the Medicaid plan for the poor spent $797 million on EpiPen in the five-year period, including rebates provided by Mylan, or $960 million before rebates. Costs for the Medicare Part D program for the elderly was nearly $335 million, a figure that does not reflect rebates.Klobuchar and other lawmakers contend that Mylan underpaid rebates to state Medicaid programs by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic instead of a branded drug. The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum 23.1 percent for a branded drug.CMS said it could not determine how much the government is owed for EpiPens, but reiterated its view that Mylan had misclassified the product.“CMS has, on multiple occasions, provided guidance to the industry and Mylan on the proper classification of drugs and has expressly told Mylan that the product is incorrectly classified,” the agency said.Mylan has said it complied with CMS rules. On Wednesday, it noted that the classification of EpiPen for Medicaid rebates had been made in 1997, a decade before it acquired the product.New CMS rules that took effect this year allow companies to clarify any classification issues for a product like EpiPen, with companies asked to submit their requests by April 1, 2017.“It would be premature to comment further on this issue until the CMS process has concluded,” Mylan said.Klobuchar in a statement called for “clear answers on how deep this misclassification goes, how much it has cost taxpayers across the country, how many other drugs may be misclassified, and how we get that money back.” Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch was blasted by lawmakers during a congressional hearing last month for raising the list price for a pair of EpiPens to more than $600 this year. It cost about $100 in 2007, when Mylan acquired the product.Mylan has said the list price does not reflect its true earnings on EpiPen once its discounts to payers, development costs and other expenses are taken into account.It has sought to address the criticism by offering discounts more widely to consumers and plans to make available a generic version for about $300."

The Massachusetts measure would prohibit all three, and then go further. It would also bar the sale of meat and eggs produced using those methods, even if the animals were farmed outside the state.Two independent polls released in the last month show likely voters supporting the measure by wide margins ― 41 points and 61 points, respectively. And while several agribusiness groups oppose the initiative, they’ve spent little to campaign against it.Roughly 9 billion animals are killed for food in the United States each year, and just one decades-old federal law governs their humane treatment.That law applies exclusively to the moment when livestock are slaughtered; it says nothing about how farm animals should be treated during the rest of their lives, from birth onward. It also completely exempts chickens and other animals that make up over 90 percent of the animals slaughtered.For example, it is perfectly legal for female pigs, among the most cognitively complex and socially sophisticated animals, to be repeatedly impregnated and shut in small crates for most of their lives, unable to exhibit natural social behavior or even to turn around.The past decade has seen a wave of reforms to improve some conditions for these animals. America’s largest veal and pork producers agreed to phase out extreme confinement, and in the last two years every major grocery and fast-food chain in the country has pledged to use only cage-free eggs.But these corporate reforms are entirely voluntary. Measures like the one in Massachusetts are needed to cement those changes, said Paul Shapiro, head of the farm animal welfare campaign at the Humane Society of the United States, which has spearheaded the ballot drive. California is the only state that currently bans the sale of food products over animal cruelty concerns, and its law applies only to eggs from caged hens. The Massachusetts measure, which extends to veal and pork, would be the broadest of its kind in the U.S. and probably the world, Shapiro said.With momentum on their side, advocates are also increasingly focused on campaigns that go beyond combatting extreme confinement of animals in the United States.Two groups have launched campaigns this year aiming to reform how food companies raise the over 8 billion chickens that Americans eat annually.These chickens, called broilers, aren’t kept in cages like the hens that lay eggs, but there are other concerns. They are genetically modified to grow at such an aggressive pace that their bodies often break down, and current slaughter methods lead to hundreds of thousands of birds being boiled alive every year. Also, this week, the Open Philanthropy Project funded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna announced it would spend $3.6 million to support cage-free campaigns outside of the United States."

Sixty-five percent say that her Republican rival Donald Trump is healthy enough, little changed from previous surveys.Opinions of the former secretary of state’s health remained stable throughout the summer months of the campaign. Attempts by some Trump surrogates and supporters to raise questions about her fitness resonated, for the most part, only among voters already disinclined to support her.Confidence in Clinton’s physical health dropped precipitously after she was filmed collapsing at an event commemorating 9/11. A significant percentage of Democrats said they were unsure if she was in good enough shape to serve as president. But in the most recent survey, 80 percent of all Democrats say Clinton is healthy enough.Her campaign later announced that she had pneumonia. They also released more detailed medical information, along with a statement from her physician asserting that the nominee was “healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States.”The first presidential debate didn’t directly touch on the incident. But Trump used the event to argue that she “doesn’t have the stamina” to be president. “Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton shot back, citing her experience as secretary of state.Voters say by a 14-point margin, 50 percent to 36 percent, that Clinton has the stamina to be president, according to the Economist/YouGov poll.

469,469,POLITICS,"With A Trump Presidency Hanging In The Balance, Latino Groups Push For Historic Turnout",Max Greenwood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/latino-voters-donald-trump_us_57f691d3e4b0263f500e4e40,Donald Trump’s comments about immigrants could soon come back to haunt him.,2016-10-06,Latino and pro-immigration civic groups are gearing up for the a final push to register Latino voters ahead of the November election. Donald Trump's remarks about immigrants may explain why only 17 percent of Latinos support him.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f6a44f1a0000f3045b78a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Latino groups across the country are launching into the final stages of an extensive ground campaign to mobilize Latino voters, pushing last-minute registration efforts and early voting in key battleground states.A spike in Latino voter registration in 2016 could deal a decisive blow to Donald Trump’s presidential bid, especially in battleground states with large Latino populations like Florida and Nevada. The GOP presidential nominee has received little support from Latino voters, many of whom despise him for his incendiary positions on Latinos and immigrants.In Florida, a coalition led by the Latino civic group National Council of La Raza says its canvassing efforts have helped register 46,000 voters. Voto Latino, another civic group, reported registering 10,565 in the Sunshine State as part of a larger effort that has registered more than 100,000 voters nationwide since last November.With voter registration deadlines across the country fast approaching, other groups have turned their attention to early voting. Families Fight Back, a $15 million voting campaign directed at pro-immigration and historically unengaged voters, is encouraging people to cast their ballots early in battleground states like Florida, Colorado and Nevada.“The targeting is voters ― infrequent voters, Latino voters, pro-immigrant voters ― who might not otherwise turn out,” said Jeff Parcher, the communications director for the Center for Community Change Action, who is leading the campaign. Now that they’ve identified the voters, he said, “we’re winding up, trying to get people to vote as early as they can.”Information on voters’ racial and ethnic backgrounds won’t become available for review until after the general election on Nov. 8. But Maxwell Wood, a Democratic strategist whose company, Deck Apps, develops voter outreach software for campaigns and other organizations, said available data shows a likely spike in Latino voter registration.“The rate of new registrations among non-Latino voters has been steadily ticking upward,” said Wood, who has analyzed state voter registration and consumer data. “Among Latinos, we see a bigger step each cycle ― and a much bigger step this cycle.”Some of those gains are the result of normal demographic changes. About one-third of Latinos in the U.S. are under the age of 18, and more and more people are expected to register each cycle as they reach voting age. But Wood said a spike this year probably couldn’t be attributed to that alone.“There’s a lot of natural demographic explanations for it,” he said. “But I think we’ve seen an increase that surpasses an ability for it to be explained away by that. There’s something else at play, too.”Trump has struggled with Latino voters since day one of his campaign. When he announced his candidacy in July 2015, he called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and criminals and has since campaigned on the promise of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump also said he would support the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants from the U.S.Still, Trump has insisted that he will win the Latino vote in November ― a goal that does not seem to be grounded in reality. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll out last month put Trump’s support among Latino voters at just 17 percent ― 48 points below Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In Florida, a must-win state for Trump if he hopes to have a plausible path to the presidency, Latinos account for a sizable share of the state’s registered voters. Most of them are Democrats.Trump could face a similar threat in Nevada, where Latinos make up nearly 20 percent of the state’s population.What’s more, many Latino Republican operatives and advisers who once backed Trump have jumped ship, citing his hard line stance on immigration. That image was only reinforced by his fiery immigration policy speech in August, when he said that no undocumented immigrant was safe from being deported.Compounding these challenges, the business mogul will now have to contend with a $3 million Spanish-language anti-Trump TV ad campaign in Florida and Nevada that will debut on Wednesday. The Service Employees International Union, which endorsed Clinton, and the pro-immigration civic group iAmerica Action are behind the campaign.Most of the organizations that are registering Latino voters say they are nonpartisan ― more focused on encouraging Latinos to participate in the political process than on influencing their choice of candidate. Latinos have historically had lower voter turnout rates, and a July Washington Post poll reported that 39 percent of Hispanic voters said there was a less than a 50/50 chance that they’d vote in November.“I don’t believe this election is about any one candidate,” Voto Latino spokesman Mario Carrillo said. “I really do believe that it’s a combination of different elements coming together. One is that you have a record number of Latinos that will be eligible to vote.”But Carrillo also acknowledged that the 2016 election was consequential for Latinos.“You do have an election that a lot of Latinos know is going to mean a lot to them and their communities,” he said. “There’s a lot at stake.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f6957b1a0000de085b7870.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Issa Rae’s highly-anticipated HBO comedy revisits a black narrative she says she hasn’t seen on the small screen in a very long time. While programs have tackled the more serious aspects of black life, Rae’s “Insecure” centers on the experience of a black woman in Los Angeles, dealing with dating, adulting and all the mundane aspects of life in between.“I say that black people don’t really get a chance to just be regular and boring and go through everyday things and this is very much a slice of life show,” Rae said during a live conversation with The Huffington Post on Tuesday. The show, which premieres on Oct. 9, also focuses on the friendship between characters Issa and her best friend Molly. That bond between the program’s principal black female characters ― a nod to Mara Brock Akil’s “Girlfriends” ― came from the real-life relationship between Rae and one of her best friends. The show is clearly influenced by Rae’s witty sense of humor and personal life, but the actor, writer and producer said the script isn’t autobiographical by any means. Instead, she called on a diverse group of writers to draw from their own experiences to craft the show’s narrative. “Every writer has like a piece or a morsel or a chunk of their life in [the script] and we’re all from different backgrounds,” she told HuffPost Black Voices senior editor Lilly Workneh. Rae’s interest in the breadth of the black experience stems from the shows she watched as a kid. She grew up in the 1990s, the unofficial golden era of black TV, when broadcast networks carried quite a few black TV programs and emerging channels like UPN catered to black audiences, too. Groundbreaking shows like “Living Single” opened Rae up to a world she had not yet experienced.  “That was my access [to black culture] because I was watching those shows growing up in Maryland, where I didn’t have a lot of black friends, sometimes where I was the only black girl,” she said. “I was like ‘Oh wow! This is such a diverse array of black people in general and then even being in L.A. and watching those shows.’”Rae dreamed of becoming a writer for those shows as a kid ― but as time went on the shows she loved so much started to disappear. “When I grew up, those shows were gone and black people were gone from scripted television for the most part,” she said. But roughly 20 years later, it seems like black TV is having a renaissance of sorts. Shows like “Atlanta,” “Queen Sugar,” “Black-ish” are showcasing fresh perspectives on the black experience and have black creators at the helm. “I’m proud of it. I’m so happy for it. I’m enriched by it. I’m better for it,” Rae said. “We’re reclaiming our narrative in a way that we haven’t done in a long time collectively and it’s just such an exciting time to be a part of this.” Watch the full conversation with Issa Rae here.

On Thursday, Jack White’s Third Man Records released an “Icky Trump” T-shirt that anyone against the Republican presidential candidate can purchase and wear with pride. All for the low price of $25 ― what a bargain! The front of the shirt is printed with “Icky Trump,” a play on the White Stripes song “Icky Thump.” The back features lyrics from the track, which fittingly touch on immigration.White Americans? What?Nothing better to do?Why don’t you kick yourself out?You’re an immigrant too.Who’s using who?What should we do?Well, you can’t be a pimpAnd a prostitute too.The shirt is being released just two days after the band called out Trump for using their 2003 song “Seven Nation Army” in a campaign ad. A Facebook post shared Tuesday stated the band was “disgusted by this association, and by the illegal use of their song.” We can tell that they are (never) going to be friends.

She was even told she was “really stupid” for thinking a girl could be president.Instead of landing the top role, Clinton wound up doing a ton of work behind the scenes for the guy who did win, the Democratic nominee tells 11-year-old Marley Dias in an adorable interview in Elle.com. It’s Clinton’s latest attempt to get us to relate to her as a human, and yeah, it kind of works.“The boy who won asked me to be the chair of the Organizations Committee,” Clinton tells Dias, who’s known for her book drive #1000BlackGirlBooks. “This meant that he got to be president, but I had to do most of the work.” (Emphasis mine.)Clinton’s high school experience is a scenario that plays out in schools and offices around the country, where men, considered natural leaders, nab the high-profile roles while women stand behind them doing what some experts call “invisible work.” The story also almost eerily echoes a satirical piece by Alexandra Petri in The Washington Post. Written after Clinton nabbed the Democratic nomination for president, Petri’s story imagines the acceptance speech Clinton would really want to give: “I’m the girl who did the whole lab project and organized the whole group presentation and then let Chad give the speech,” Clinton says in the imaginary speech.Doing the work and getting less credit has kind of been Clinton’s jam for a lot of her life. Readers may recall Clinton lost her bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, but was offered the role of secretary of state instead. That is not a cushy job. Also, remember she was first lady? Anyway, none of this should surprise anyone who kind of suffered through being a smart girl in school and was sidelined or made to feel weird and different for daring to be ambitious ― but pushed on!Clinton tells Dias she enjoyed her work chairing that committee back in high school. “[I]t turned out to be a lot of fun,” she says. “I got to plan all the events I would have pushed for as president. ... In the end, I’ve always found credit isn’t just something you take – it’s something people give you when they see how hard you’re working.”Of course, credit doesn’t always come that “easy,” as any woman in the work world can tell you. Women often watch as a guy takes credit for their ideas or their work.And, of course, women often wind up losing top jobs to men, only to find themselves working their ass off at a different job that’s a little less high-profile. We often fool ourselves into thinking this is fine because we’re wielding the real “power.”At Facebook, the chief executive and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, runs the show, but his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is widely considered to be the one that keeps the trains moving on time. At a lot of companies, you’ll see women in the role of chief financial officer (at Google that’s Ruth Porat) or perhaps running human resources (Sheri Bronstein at Bank of America). These are top jobs to be sure, but not the tippy top one.This doesn’t just happen in politics and corporate America. Last year an editor at now-defunct website Gawker described a system where men got plum assignments while women backed them up with skillful editing (and weren’t given the chance to take those great pieces on themselves).An abundance of research shows that leadership is considered a male trait, and top jobs come to them more easily. Women are viewed as “caretakers” not leaders.A cursory glance at the male dominated ranks of Fortune 500 CEOs or United States senators shows how that plays out in real life. Women ― and people of color, too ― have to work harder to prove their value and then, maybe, get a shot at the top spot.You can see this play out now, as Clinton runs for president with an absurdly packed resume against a guy with no political experience whose biggest achievement seems to be a stint on a reality TV show.

In the end, I’ve always found credit isn’t just something you take – it’s something people give you when they see how hard you’re working.”Of course, credit doesn’t always come that “easy,” as any woman in the work world can tell you. Women often watch as a guy takes credit for their ideas or their work.And, of course, women often wind up losing top jobs to men, only to find themselves working their ass off at a different job that’s a little less high-profile. We often fool ourselves into thinking this is fine because we’re wielding the real “power.”At Facebook, the chief executive and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, runs the show, but his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is widely considered to be the one that keeps the trains moving on time. At a lot of companies, you’ll see women in the role of chief financial officer (at Google that’s Ruth Porat) or perhaps running human resources (Sheri Bronstein at Bank of America). These are top jobs to be sure, but not the tippy top one.This doesn’t just happen in politics and corporate America. Last year an editor at now-defunct website Gawker described a system where men got plum assignments while women backed them up with skillful editing (and weren’t given the chance to take those great pieces on themselves).An abundance of research shows that leadership is considered a male trait, and top jobs come to them more easily. Women are viewed as “caretakers” not leaders.A cursory glance at the male dominated ranks of Fortune 500 CEOs or United States senators shows how that plays out in real life. Women ― and people of color, too ― have to work harder to prove their value and then, maybe, get a shot at the top spot.You can see this play out now, as Clinton runs for president with an absurdly packed resume against a guy with no political experience whose biggest achievement seems to be a stint on a reality TV show.

If the justices’ exchanges from the bench are any indication, the court may be willing to make it easier to prosecute this type of white collar-crime, which has gotten harder after a recent shakeup at its epicenter: New York. A major 2014 ruling there rewrote the rules for prosecuting insider trading, holding that tipsters disclosing money-making information must receive some “personal benefit” from divulging it before the person who uses that information can be convicted.The Supreme Court’s job now is to decide the extent of this personal benefit to the tipster. Must it be monetary or otherwise “valuable” ― that is, must the tipster gain something tangible by sharing the information? Or is it just enough for there to be a close personal relationship between the tipster and the tip’s recipient?The questions are fuzzy, in part because the law of insider trading is not so easily understood. The crime is loosely defined as profiting from non-public corporate information obtained from the inside of a company. But Congress has never defined it explicitly, and so it’s been up to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the courts ― including guidance from the Supreme Court more than 30 years ago ― to fill in the gaps. The justices spent the bulk of their time pondering where to draw the line ― wary of giving too much power to prosecutors, but also mindful that Wall Street types are people, too, and need clear rules so that they or their close relatives don’t get in trouble for improper dealmaking.“You could have ... the view that helping a relative is helping yourself,” said Justice Stephen Breyer, who wondered at length whether family closeness might be a way to delineate insider trading.Giving a gift to a close relative “ennobles you, and in a sense it helps you financially because you make them more secure,” said Justice Anthony Kennedy, channeling his most thoughtful self.Hearing this must have been music to the ears of Preet Bharara, the Manhattan federal prosecutor, who was reportedly at the hearing and whose office stands to gain from a looser definition of insider trading. Bharara’s office suffered a major setback when the federal appeals court in New York erected a big barrier for these prosecutions, requiring a “meaningfully close personal relationship” between an insider and her benefactor that brings a financial or otherwise “valuable” benefit to the insider. This new test meant that a number of Bharara’s marquee cases couldn’t stand, dealing a blow to his record as Wall Street’s toughest cop. Justice Elena Kagan, who in recent years has stood up for clarity in criminal law, seemed to empathize with the government’s more relaxed view of insider trading, suggesting that any gift of corporate confidences brings a benefit to the giver and thus justifies prosecuting the recipient.“I’m stealing information to give a gift to somebody I know,” Kagan said. “It might be, as in this case, a family member. It might be a friend. And I benefit from that because ― I mean ... I personally benefit. It’s the exact opposite of using corporate information for corporate purposes.

518,518,BUSINESS,Snapchat Is Reportedly Planning A $25 Billion IPO,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snapchat-ipo_us_57f6999be4b0c1a524cbef85,The company's value has soared in the last five years and it has more users than Twitter.,2016-10-06,"Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel with his fiancée, Australian model Miranda Kerr. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f6ab54170000e00aac9fa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Snapchat’s video messages may be ephemeral, but its staying power as a startup in a hotly competitive field may be anything but.The company last month renamed itself Snap Inc. to mark the launch of a line of sunglasses with built-in cameras, its second product after its popular social network. Now the Los Angeles-based firm is working on an initial public offering that could value the company at $25 billion or more, according to a report on Thursday in The Wall Street Journal.The move, expected by late March, would be the most closely watched stock market debut in years.Snap’s prominence has soared over the last five years, and with it, its value.In May, the company’s worth surged to nearly $18 billion, placing it firmly in the top five most valuable “unicorns,” a term used for privately held startups worth more than $1 billion. By June, Snapchat had surpassed Twitter in users, with 150 million people using its service each day, a 36 percent increase from last December. Ten-year-old Twitter, by contrast, had just 140 million daily active users.Ironically, Snap arguably would be the highest-profile tech IPO since Twitter made its disastrous debut three years ago, which sent its value up to $24 billion. The company, symbolized by its little blue bird, has struggled to attract new users and the advertising dollars that come with them. Twitter reportedly is seeking a buyer before its Oct. 27 earnings call, but the only suitor considering a bid may be cloud-computing giant Salesforce, Recode reported on Thursday. Snap may be better positioned. For starters, the company makes money, even if it has yet to turn a profit.Last year, Snap, tapping its popularity with the coveted teenage demographic, started charging advertisers $750,000 a day for TV-style ads. Earlier this year, the company dropped its ad prices. A “Live Story” ― compilations of users’ videos or photos from a specific event or location ― costs about $250,000, CNBC reported in February. Taking over a “Discover” channel ― branded sections in which publishers such as Mashable, CNN or Comedy Central post daily magazine-like features ― goes for about $50,000.A Snap spokesman declined to comment on ad prices. Snap told investors earlier this year it expected to earn between $250 million and $350 million in revenue this year and as much as $1 billion next year, according to the Wall Street Journal report.Ads aren’t Snap’s only business anymore. The company is selling Spectacles, its first-ever hardware, for $129.99. Given that Snap describes itself as “a camera company” on its website, Spectacles may not be its last foray into selling actual things. That revenue could help stave off intrusive new advertising features that have historically frustrated longtime users of ad-supported social networks.Soon after Facebook went public in 2012 ― the biggest tech IPO in history, at about $104 billion ― users began complaining about ads appearing in their timelines. But Facebook, almost entirely reliant on advertising at that point, needed the money. Last month, CEO Evan Spiegel said changing the firm’s official name to Snap Inc. served as a way of separating the products from the parent company. “Changing our name also has another benefit: when you search for our products it will be easier to find relevant product information rather than boring company information or financial analysis,” he wrote in a blog post. “You can search Snapchat or Spectacles for the fun stuff and leave Snap Inc. for the Wall Street crowd :)”The Snap spokesman declined to comment “on rumors or speculation about any financing plans.” But, given Spiegel’s explicit nod to Wall Street, perhaps he should have ended his paragraph with ;) instead.

Mike Pence (R) criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump over his Muslim ban proposal, but that was before he was chosen as his running mate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f66677170000e00aac9e17.jpeg?cache=AjK3kqgRKm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican vice presidential nominee and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said Thursday that “of course” running mate Donald Trump no longer wants to ban all Muslims from the country ― although he declined to either condemn or give much of a defense for comments he once called “offensive and unconstitutional.”Pence was asked on both CNN’s “New Day” and MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” about Trump’s proposal for a ban on Muslims entering the country, which the governor criticized in sharp terms last year, before he was chosen as the vice presidential pick.Now, of course, he’s on Team Trump, and he declined to either stand by his past indignation or defend Trump’s proposal, other than saying the presidential nominee no longer holds that position and wants only to ban people from certain countries (mostly majority Muslim ones) who hold specific ideologies (again, often focused on Muslims).A back-and-forth between Pence and CNN’s Chris Cuomo was particularly biting, as the journalist repeatedly asked why the governor no longer condemns Trump’s plan to ban Muslims from the country or Trump’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom the presidential nominee accused of being biased against him because he is of Mexican descent. Pence at the time said Trump’s comments on Curiel were “inappropriate.”“Well, because it’s not Donald Trump’s position now,” Pence said, before saying he is “proud to stand with him when he says that we need to suspend immigration from countries and territories that have been compromised by terrorism.”Pence has said this before, and it’s true that Trump now focuses on banning people from certain countries rather than all Muslims. That’s something Pence can get on board with ― he’s been one of the governors most intent on keeping Syrian refugees out of his state. But regardless of whether Trump is still pushing a Muslim ban, he has shown no remorse about the proposal. The press release announcing it is still on his website. Pence accused the media of focusing on “the oldies.” But Cuomo wouldn’t drop it, saying Pence doesn’t “like handling directly these questions of what he said,” but that Trump’s comments on women, Mexicans and Muslims matter. “I know that you have said you don’t share those positions, and now, tacitly, you are accepting those positions because you won’t speak out against them,” he said. “You understand that?”Pence didn’t answer. Instead he accused the Democratic ticket, presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, of making personal insults and the media of “taking these little lines out of context.”“You’re going to be setting the tone as vice president and president of the United States about how we respect each other, about who matters and whether all of us matter the same way,” Cuomo said. “And when somebody says things that exclude people and make them less than, it is the job of leadership to stand up against that and I know you’ve done it in the past. That’s why I’m asking you why you’re not doing it now.”Again, Pence said Trump had made his position “very clear” about suspending immigration from certain countries and had expressed regret for some of his prior statements, in which he “didn’t choose his words well.” The remarks Pence was referring to were devoid of any specifics on what exactly Trump regretted saying. “Look, when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, whether people agree with him or not, he’s going to respect all of the people of this country,” Pence said. Pence received less pushback on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” but also said there that the campaign supports keeping people “from countries that have been compromised by terrorism” out of the country. Host Joe Scarborough asked him to clarify whether he was saying it was not a ban on all Muslims. “Of course not,” Pence said. “We’re talking about areas of the world, territories and specifically countries that have been so compromised by terrorism that we can’t know for certain who those people are.” He made the comments with the usual justifications, which, as The Washington Post laid out in detail, are misleading or straight-out false: The FBI did not say in blanket terms that Syrian refugees could not be vetted, and Syrian refugees did not plan the terrorist attacks in Paris last November. He also noted that Germany arrested three Syrian refugees recently, which belies the fact that the ability of Europe to vet refugees who show up at its borders is far different from the U.S. system, which can screen them before they come to the U.S.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

At the Democratic National Convention, Clinton had former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, once a Republican himself, deliver a high-profile speech. Before and after, she touted the endorsements she’d received from top GOP national security officials and former cabinet members. Her campaign even publicly flirted with trying to get the support of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, despite how despised he remains for much of the Democratic Party base.On Thursday, Clinton’s endeavors got a boost ― though, apparently, through no effort of her own. Thirty Republicans who served in Congress signed a letter saying they couldn’t vote for Trump in the general election. “In nominating Donald Trump, the Republican Party has asked the people of the United States to entrust their future to a man who insults women, mocks the handicapped, urges that dissent be met with violence, seeks to impose religious tests for entry into the United States, and applies a de facto ethnicity test to judges,” the letter reads. “He offends our allies and praises dictators. His public statements are peppered with lies. He belittles our heroes and insults the parents of men who have died serving our country. Every day brings a fresh revelation that highlights the unacceptable danger in electing him to lead our nation.”Among the letter’s signatories are former Reps. Bob Bauman (R-Md.), Steve Bartlett (R-Texas), Tom Coleman (R-Mo.), Bill Clinger (R-Pa.), Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), Tom Petri (R-Wis.), Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.), Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), Vin Weber (R-Minn.), and Dick Zimmer (R-N.J.), and former Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.).The signatories made “no mention of Hillary Clinton,” noted CNN, which first reported their letter. So while some of them may vote for the Democratic nominee, others may vote for former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, a Libertarian.But the power of the former lawmakers’ statement does not lie in the votes they will cast. It lies in the symbolic weight of their decision to reject their party’s nominee. Some of these former lawmakers were self-avowed moderates, and others had already said they weren’t supporting Trump. But many are traditional Republicans whose abandonment of the GOP nominee is noteworthy.And it won’t be a surprise to see the Clinton campaign play this up in the days ahead.Here’s a complete list of the letter’s signatories:Steve Bartlett (R-Texas)Bob Bauman (R-Md.)Sherwood Boehlert (R-N.Y.)Jack Buechner (R-Mo.)Tom Campbell (R-Calif.)Bill Clinger (R-Pa.)Tom Coleman (R-Mo.)Geoff Davis (R-Ky.)Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.)Harris Fawell (R-Ill.)Ed Foreman (R-Texas) (R-N.M.)Amo Houghton, Jr. (R-N.Y.)Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.)Bob Inglis (R-S.C.)Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.)Steve Kuykendall (R-Calif.)Jim Leach (R-Iowa)Pete McCloskey (R-Calif.)Connie Morella (R-Md.)Mike Parker (R-Miss.)Tom Petri (R-Wis.)John Porter (R-Ill.)Claudine Schneider (R-R.I.)John “Joe” Schwarz (R-Mich.)Chris Shays (R-Conn.)Peter Smith (R-Vt.)Edward Weber (R-Ohio)Vin Weber (R-Minn.)G.

532,532,BUSINESS,Here's How Scraps Can Help Grow The Food Of The Future,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-scraps-aquaponics_us_57f4166ce4b015995f2ba397,This mobile aquaponic farm could be a game changer.,2016-10-06, Physics researcher John Katsoudas and chemistry professor Elena Timofeeva of the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago believe their new invention could help feed the world.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f696d0170000f70aac9f23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s tough to think of something more mundane than getting your electric bill in the mail. But that’s what launched two Chicago scientists down a path that just might lead to a farming revolution.About five years ago, chemistry professor Elena Timofeeva and physics researcher John Katsoudas, who both work at the Illinois Institute of Technology, began to dabble in aquaponics, a soil-free method of farming that grows plants and aquatic life through connected systems.The two, who are married, built an aquaponic system in their basement and began growing produce. But the eye-popping electric bill quickly showed them that the cost of powering their fledging farm was far greater than what they could grow. Power costs, it turns out, are a major drawback to the aquaponics industry.“A couple of pounds of tomatoes were not worth the extra $200 on our bill,” Timofeeva told HuffPost.The scientists began wondering what a more cost-effective approach to powering an aquaponic farm might look like ― a challenge they have been chasing ever since then.They believe they’ve found an answer: a stackable, mobile aquaponic growing system that can be operated totally off the grid.The system they invented, housed inside a 45-foot shipping container, generates energy by feeding food waste into a biodigester that works like a mechanical stomach to convert the material into methane. The gas is used as fuel for a generator that powers the aquaponic farm’s pumps and lights. The units, developed in a collaboration with Nullam Consulting, a firm specializing in anaerobic digestion systems, will be sold for $150,000, according to Timofeeva. Aquaponic farmers can recover their investment in two or three years, she and Katsoudas said, with up to $80,000 in annual profit from what they grow with the system.Farmers can harvest 14,500 pounds of fresh produce annually with the system — like leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers and even root vegetables. Additionally, 1,100 pounds of fresh fish could be raised inside the system, and 45 tons of organic fertilizer is a byproduct of the anaerobic digester. Plus, farmers can collect fees from providers of food scraps, like grocery stores and food processing facilities.The aquaponic system uses dramatically less water than traditional farming, and diverts a significant amount of food waste from landfills.“We want to bring all the technology and innovation together in a very compact, mobile, independent system that can be transported while still producing, and can be dropped wherever food is needed,” Timofeeva said.The ambitious concept is still in its early stages. The scientists are raising funds to build a full-scale prototype of their design. They’ve already attracted attention from the likes of Silicon Valley’s Cleantech Open Accelerator, which named the couple’s startup, called AquaGrow, a semi-finalist in its funding competition. Some researchers have been skeptical of aquaponic startups’ claims and question the AquaGrow projections.Stan Cox, a lead scientist at the Land Institute, a nonprofit based in Salina, Kansas, has been a prominent critic of indoor vertical farms, which typically rely on systems like AquaGrow’s. Cox questioned whether such a system could produce enough food to justify the resources needed to power artificial light and climate-control mechanisms to protect the plants.Aquaponics, obviously, is a lot more complex than growing a plant in a traditional way outdoors.“When we’re growing a crop out in the field, the energy situation is pretty simple,” Cox told HuffPost. “When you’re going through a more convoluted process converting biomass [through the digester] and using artificial light, there’s a loss of energy at every step.”Stephen Ventura, a soil science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who also has expressed skepticism of similar operations, said he sees promise in the AquaGrow project, but is concerned with its complexity.“They are talking about moving and containing an immense amount of material,” Ventura wrote in an email to HuffPost. “And they’re talking about doing this with not one but three biological systems that are finicky to manage, let alone keep in mutual balance.” Still, Timofeeva and Katsoudas are confident. They project that their system will require some 900 pounds of food waste per day to operate. Farmers can easily obtain that much material by developing a relationship with a local grocery store or school cafeteria, both of which have a reputation for wasting many tons of food daily, Timofeeva said. As for the tricky logistics of the AquaGrow system, Timofeeva and Katsoudas said they’ve already succeeded in achieving balance within their system and making it easy for an operator to maintain that balance. They still need a prototype to prove it.The scientists said AquaGrow will help feed a growing world population in a more sustainable way, allow under-resourced neighborhoods access to fresh foods, and offer an easily movable source of sustenance for communities hit by a hurricane or other natural disaster.“Nothing prevents these systems from being picked up and dropped off in the event of a FEMA emergency.

533,533,BUSINESS,Here's How Scraps Can Help Grow The Food Of The Future,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-scraps-aquaponics_us_57f4166ce4b015995f2ba397,This mobile aquaponic farm could be a game changer.,2016-10-06,"A provided diagram shows how they have designed the AquaGrow system, combining an aquaponic farm operation and an anaerobic digester in one container unit, to work.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f69711170000f70aac9f28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s tough to think of something more mundane than getting your electric bill in the mail. But that’s what launched two Chicago scientists down a path that just might lead to a farming revolution.About five years ago, chemistry professor Elena Timofeeva and physics researcher John Katsoudas, who both work at the Illinois Institute of Technology, began to dabble in aquaponics, a soil-free method of farming that grows plants and aquatic life through connected systems.The two, who are married, built an aquaponic system in their basement and began growing produce. But the eye-popping electric bill quickly showed them that the cost of powering their fledging farm was far greater than what they could grow. Power costs, it turns out, are a major drawback to the aquaponics industry.“A couple of pounds of tomatoes were not worth the extra $200 on our bill,” Timofeeva told HuffPost.The scientists began wondering what a more cost-effective approach to powering an aquaponic farm might look like ― a challenge they have been chasing ever since then.They believe they’ve found an answer: a stackable, mobile aquaponic growing system that can be operated totally off the grid.The system they invented, housed inside a 45-foot shipping container, generates energy by feeding food waste into a biodigester that works like a mechanical stomach to convert the material into methane. The gas is used as fuel for a generator that powers the aquaponic farm’s pumps and lights. The units, developed in a collaboration with Nullam Consulting, a firm specializing in anaerobic digestion systems, will be sold for $150,000, according to Timofeeva. Aquaponic farmers can recover their investment in two or three years, she and Katsoudas said, with up to $80,000 in annual profit from what they grow with the system.Farmers can harvest 14,500 pounds of fresh produce annually with the system — like leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers and even root vegetables. Additionally, 1,100 pounds of fresh fish could be raised inside the system, and 45 tons of organic fertilizer is a byproduct of the anaerobic digester. Plus, farmers can collect fees from providers of food scraps, like grocery stores and food processing facilities.The aquaponic system uses dramatically less water than traditional farming, and diverts a significant amount of food waste from landfills.“We want to bring all the technology and innovation together in a very compact, mobile, independent system that can be transported while still producing, and can be dropped wherever food is needed,” Timofeeva said.The ambitious concept is still in its early stages. The scientists are raising funds to build a full-scale prototype of their design. They’ve already attracted attention from the likes of Silicon Valley’s Cleantech Open Accelerator, which named the couple’s startup, called AquaGrow, a semi-finalist in its funding competition. Some researchers have been skeptical of aquaponic startups’ claims and question the AquaGrow projections.Stan Cox, a lead scientist at the Land Institute, a nonprofit based in Salina, Kansas, has been a prominent critic of indoor vertical farms, which typically rely on systems like AquaGrow’s. Cox questioned whether such a system could produce enough food to justify the resources needed to power artificial light and climate-control mechanisms to protect the plants.Aquaponics, obviously, is a lot more complex than growing a plant in a traditional way outdoors.“When we’re growing a crop out in the field, the energy situation is pretty simple,” Cox told HuffPost. “When you’re going through a more convoluted process converting biomass [through the digester] and using artificial light, there’s a loss of energy at every step.”Stephen Ventura, a soil science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who also has expressed skepticism of similar operations, said he sees promise in the AquaGrow project, but is concerned with its complexity.“They are talking about moving and containing an immense amount of material,” Ventura wrote in an email to HuffPost. “And they’re talking about doing this with not one but three biological systems that are finicky to manage, let alone keep in mutual balance.” Still, Timofeeva and Katsoudas are confident. They project that their system will require some 900 pounds of food waste per day to operate. Farmers can easily obtain that much material by developing a relationship with a local grocery store or school cafeteria, both of which have a reputation for wasting many tons of food daily, Timofeeva said. As for the tricky logistics of the AquaGrow system, Timofeeva and Katsoudas said they’ve already succeeded in achieving balance within their system and making it easy for an operator to maintain that balance. They still need a prototype to prove it.The scientists said AquaGrow will help feed a growing world population in a more sustainable way, allow under-resourced neighborhoods access to fresh foods, and offer an easily movable source of sustenance for communities hit by a hurricane or other natural disaster.“Nothing prevents these systems from being picked up and dropped off in the event of a FEMA emergency. They’re ready to go,” Katsoudas said. And, with problems like world hunger and climate change, help is urgently needed. “We’re taking what we’ve got in the labs and we know we can do to actually turn it into something that can be utilized right now,” Katsoudas added. “We know the world’s going to need technology like this.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

The latest to speak up about Trump’s campaign is Nick Offerman, who recently spoke to Esquire magazine about the current state of American politics.“You know,” he said, “we have nobody to blame but ourselves for this election, and I think it’s just fascinating. I mean, I’m not a great political brain, but I definitely have a pretty simple take on politics that involves common decency.”In terms of voting, the actor said, “It’s usually easy for me to vote because one party usually offends me by being indecent.” And if we had to take a wild guess at who might be the most offensive candidate this election, we think it’s safe to say Trump, who regularly incites violence and once called for a “complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the United States. “I’m always amazed in elections when the only flaws that can be pointed out about a candidate are that they have been a politician. You know ― ‘Well they said this in ‘93, and then they said this other thing in 2005.’ Yes, that’s called politics,” Offerman added, before alluding to Trump as being a candidate that’s “held such an unsavory job as casino owner. Not only that, but a failed casino.” Come November, the actor is definitely with her. “I think unfortunately, for the democratic process, there’s no logical or sane or moral choice to be made other than voting for Hillary Clinton,” he said, pointing out that “if she were not a woman, we would not be in this boat.” “I am incredibly excited that the glass ceiling will be shattered,” he said. “We’ve had our first black president and we’ll probably have our first woman president. And of course we’re going to go kicking and screaming as a nation into that, we would have it no other way. At the end of the day, we’re all a bunch of big babies. But what an exciting accomplishment.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Choosing to forgo a wordy caption, the reality star kept things simple with the praying hands emoji. “Remember that joy is not dependent on your circumstances. Some of the world’s most miserable people are those whose circumstances seem the most enviable,” the passage reads. “People who reach the top of the ladder career-wise are often surprised to find emptiness awaiting them. True Joy is a by-product of living in My Presence. Therefore you can experience it in palaces, in prisons … anywhere.”The particular page in the book also features two passages from the Bible, one from Habakkuk and the other from 1 Chronicles, which reads, “Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy in his dwelling place.” Kourtney is the second member of the Kardashian-Jenner family to speak out after Kim’s terrifying encounter.Caitlyn Jenner expressed her gratitude for Kim’s safety on Instagram earlier this week, writing, “Love my girl! After hearing the full story, I’m so thankful she’s okay. It’s a reminder for us all to be careful in the uncertainty of this world.” Kim herself has yet to comment on the attack, which happened Monday night at her apartment in Paris. Two “armed, masked men” dressed as police officers made their way into Kim’s apartment, where they bound and gagged her, locked her in the bathroom and proceeded to steal millions of dollars worth of jewelry. The mother of two has since been reunited with her husband, Kanye West, but various stories about the incident continue to float around the internet. "

This has brought challenges, but also successful innovations that must be widely shared – and quickly, says Brookings Institution scholar Bruce Katz.Between January 2015 and July 2016, 1.3 million migrants and refugees fleeing poverty and economic deprivation arrived in Germany. The arrival of so many people, most of them in need of a home, food and healthcare, posed immense humanitarian challenges for the country’s leaders and communities as a whole.A new study by the Brookings Institution found that much of the responsibilities for accommodating refugees in the country fell to those working at a local level. The lessons learned on the front lines of Germany’s response to the crisis could have lasting implications for cities around the world, the study says.The report, called “Cities and Refugees – The German Experience,” was released last week during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. Its authors, Bruce Katz, Luise Noring and Natnke Garrelts, examined how refugees have been distributed in Germany in the past 18 months and how cities across the country responded to that challenge.They concluded that successful handling of the crisis will depend on whether European cities are given a greater voice in international decision making and receive greater financial and political support.Refugees Deeply spoke with Bruce Katz, Centennial Scholar at the Brookings Institution, about the research.Refugees Deeply: Nearly 60 percent of refugees today live in urban areas, placing huge responsibilities on local authorities. Yet these cities don’t always have the funding or authority to respond adequately. How did that disconnect play out in Germany?Bruce Katz: Germany is a federal republic with a federal government, 16 states and hundreds of cities and municipalities. Three of the states – Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin – are city-states and combine the functions of a city and a state. Responsibility for substantial domestic activities in Germany, like housing, schools and many of the labor market efforts are locally and state based.Germany is a highly devolved federal republic and that has meant that cities do have power and agency. Responding to the refugee crisis, Germany’s national government has used its powers to open the border, and to reset the rules around citizenship and integration. However, a lot of the responsibility for the response, not just in the delivery of services but also the actual design and financing of them, has fallen to local and state governments, and to a burgeoning network of nonprofits that has emerged in the aftermath of the crisis.As this crisis goes forward and the focus shifts from short-term response to longer-term integration, there does need to be more of a federal role in investment and finance, and more support so that when one city cracks the code on a particular set of issues or comes up with an innovative response, other cities know about it in rapid fashion.Refugees Deeply: How did the cities you studied handle the influx of refugees? What were the successes and what were the challenges?Katz: The challenges were pretty substantial. The federal government distributed refugees according to a formula that was previously used to distribute research money to different states in the federal republic. That led to higher density in the city-states, particularly in Berlin and Hamburg, and affordability issues with housing.The biggest challenge initially was finding accommodation for refugees that didn’t just provide basic, humane shelter but were a platform for moving forward. We’ve learned, including from the aftermath of natural disasters in the U.S., that it’s really critical to bring normalcy to people’s lives as quickly as you can. That means running facilities for refugees in places with access to services and a guarantee that families have privacy and children can go to school as quickly as possible. That’s what brings back routine to people’s lives.All of these challenges – housing, education, access to services – were magnified in states like Hamburg and Berlin because, as city-states, they have a limited amount of land. To their credit, they moved as quickly as possible to find accommodation and innovative ways to locate facilities. The old American notion that crisis begets innovation is very much apparent when you go to Germany and compare what the crisis looks like today and what it looked like last September.Refugees Deeply: Could you describe one of the innovations that struck you the most?Katz: I was struck by an effort in Hamburg called Finding Places, which is a collaboration betweenMIT, Hamburg City University, the city government and the residents of Hamburg. It’s an open access data system allowing citizens to look at available land and buildings and verify whether they’re really there. Citizens also help think about how their communities can begin to get past nimbyism and how to communally decide how to use assets so refugees aren’t concentrated in particular parts of the city, but instead land and buildings are used smartly to distribute refugees and give them a good start.In Berlin, I saw the use of shipping containers for housing in a very sensitive way. The community was well-landscaped, and it really felt like housing that a family could live in for a substantial amount of time. What we’re always looking for when we’re seeing the response to refugees is whether some of these lessons and innovations could be used for other issues: for example, the big homelessness problem in the U.S.Refugees Deeply: David Miliband, president of the IRC(International Rescue Committee), argued at Brookings last week that it makes economic sense to invest in the resettlement of refugees. Have you found that to be the case in your research in Germany?Katz: Europe definitely faces broader labor market and demographic issues because of the aging of society, but the response to refugees has been for humanitarian reasons first and foremost. I believe Germany really had a moral conviction to open up its borders and help people fleeing conflict. That requires a short-term response and a long-term response, and there are questions about how efficient and effective that response can be when you’re faced with the arrival of tens of thousands of people in a very short period of time.Integrating large numbers of people into your economic system, let alone your social system, requires an intense focus on education and skills. Going forward, the question of schools and skills is both imperative and incredibly challenging. Germany has a highly sophisticated economy with very rigid credentials, and that’s a challenging labor market to integrate refugees in. You need to speak in German and you need to have a serious level of skill to access many of the jobs in the productive sector of the German economy.Refugees Deeply: Many refugees prefer to resettle in areas where fellow nationals have settled. On the other hand, the potential formation of parallel societies with increasingly segregated urban neighborhoods is a major concern for policymakers. What policies could help refugees benefit from the support of a community and network, while at the same time avoiding patterns of segregation?Katz: This is one of the most serious questions countries like Germany, France, Belgium and Sweden face – already from prior waves of immigration. It’s not surprising refugees want to move to an area where there’s more comfort and cultural familiarity when they first arrive in a place, particularly when they don’t speak the language. The U.S., with its different migration waves, has seen this pattern repeat itself again and again.One of the challenges is how this relates to the housing markets. We’ve seen that housing prices in certain parts of Germany are not just forcing people to specific parts of the cities, but are forcing people outside of the city. You’ll find large numbers of migrants and refugees, not only in the core cities but in many small municipalities outside the city. Because housing and labor markets are metropolitan it will require a broader metropolitan response. We’re undertaking research right now to thinking about multi-municipal responses, particularly in places like Germany where so much power is devolved down.Where enclaves do exist, we need to think how we can ensure that they’re as open and networked as they can possibly be. In the U.S., we’ve always talked about building neighborhoods of choice and connection. You want people to choose where they want to live, but those communities need to be connected into the broader city and the broader metropolis through labor markets, housing markets and other kinds of services and activities. I’m not saying the U.S. is a shining example, but once we start talking about city innovations, what happens in Houston matters in Hamburg and vice versa. Going forward, in responding to these kinds of humanitarian crises, we’re going to see a lot more sharing across cities rather than just beyond national borders.This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.“Cities and Refugees – The German Experience” was released at a Brookings Institute event last week.

However, a lot of the responsibility for the response, not just in the delivery of services but also the actual design and financing of them, has fallen to local and state governments, and to a burgeoning network of nonprofits that has emerged in the aftermath of the crisis.As this crisis goes forward and the focus shifts from short-term response to longer-term integration, there does need to be more of a federal role in investment and finance, and more support so that when one city cracks the code on a particular set of issues or comes up with an innovative response, other cities know about it in rapid fashion.Refugees Deeply: How did the cities you studied handle the influx of refugees? What were the successes and what were the challenges?Katz: The challenges were pretty substantial. The federal government distributed refugees according to a formula that was previously used to distribute research money to different states in the federal republic. That led to higher density in the city-states, particularly in Berlin and Hamburg, and affordability issues with housing.The biggest challenge initially was finding accommodation for refugees that didn’t just provide basic, humane shelter but were a platform for moving forward. We’ve learned, including from the aftermath of natural disasters in the U.S., that it’s really critical to bring normalcy to people’s lives as quickly as you can. That means running facilities for refugees in places with access to services and a guarantee that families have privacy and children can go to school as quickly as possible. That’s what brings back routine to people’s lives.All of these challenges – housing, education, access to services – were magnified in states like Hamburg and Berlin because, as city-states, they have a limited amount of land. To their credit, they moved as quickly as possible to find accommodation and innovative ways to locate facilities. The old American notion that crisis begets innovation is very much apparent when you go to Germany and compare what the crisis looks like today and what it looked like last September.Refugees Deeply: Could you describe one of the innovations that struck you the most?Katz: I was struck by an effort in Hamburg called Finding Places, which is a collaboration betweenMIT, Hamburg City University, the city government and the residents of Hamburg. It’s an open access data system allowing citizens to look at available land and buildings and verify whether they’re really there. Citizens also help think about how their communities can begin to get past nimbyism and how to communally decide how to use assets so refugees aren’t concentrated in particular parts of the city, but instead land and buildings are used smartly to distribute refugees and give them a good start.In Berlin, I saw the use of shipping containers for housing in a very sensitive way. The community was well-landscaped, and it really felt like housing that a family could live in for a substantial amount of time. What we’re always looking for when we’re seeing the response to refugees is whether some of these lessons and innovations could be used for other issues: for example, the big homelessness problem in the U.S.Refugees Deeply: David Miliband, president of the IRC(International Rescue Committee), argued at Brookings last week that it makes economic sense to invest in the resettlement of refugees. Have you found that to be the case in your research in Germany?Katz: Europe definitely faces broader labor market and demographic issues because of the aging of society, but the response to refugees has been for humanitarian reasons first and foremost. I believe Germany really had a moral conviction to open up its borders and help people fleeing conflict. That requires a short-term response and a long-term response, and there are questions about how efficient and effective that response can be when you’re faced with the arrival of tens of thousands of people in a very short period of time.Integrating large numbers of people into your economic system, let alone your social system, requires an intense focus on education and skills. Going forward, the question of schools and skills is both imperative and incredibly challenging. Germany has a highly sophisticated economy with very rigid credentials, and that’s a challenging labor market to integrate refugees in. You need to speak in German and you need to have a serious level of skill to access many of the jobs in the productive sector of the German economy.Refugees Deeply: Many refugees prefer to resettle in areas where fellow nationals have settled. On the other hand, the potential formation of parallel societies with increasingly segregated urban neighborhoods is a major concern for policymakers. What policies could help refugees benefit from the support of a community and network, while at the same time avoiding patterns of segregation?Katz: This is one of the most serious questions countries like Germany, France, Belgium and Sweden face – already from prior waves of immigration. It’s not surprising refugees want to move to an area where there’s more comfort and cultural familiarity when they first arrive in a place, particularly when they don’t speak the language. The U.S., with its different migration waves, has seen this pattern repeat itself again and again.One of the challenges is how this relates to the housing markets. We’ve seen that housing prices in certain parts of Germany are not just forcing people to specific parts of the cities, but are forcing people outside of the city. You’ll find large numbers of migrants and refugees, not only in the core cities but in many small municipalities outside the city. Because housing and labor markets are metropolitan it will require a broader metropolitan response. We’re undertaking research right now to thinking about multi-municipal responses, particularly in places like Germany where so much power is devolved down.Where enclaves do exist, we need to think how we can ensure that they’re as open and networked as they can possibly be. In the U.S., we’ve always talked about building neighborhoods of choice and connection. You want people to choose where they want to live, but those communities need to be connected into the broader city and the broader metropolis through labor markets, housing markets and other kinds of services and activities. I’m not saying the U.S. is a shining example, but once we start talking about city innovations, what happens in Houston matters in Hamburg and vice versa. Going forward, in responding to these kinds of humanitarian crises, we’re going to see a lot more sharing across cities rather than just beyond national borders.This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.“Cities and Refugees – The German Experience” was released at a Brookings Institute event last week. Speakers included U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken, President of the IRC David Miliband and former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres.

Television footage showed several damaged vehicles, shattered glass and broken windows. Ambulances and police special forces were deployed to the scene.“Five of our citizens have been wounded, one of them seriously, as a result of a motorbike with a bomb being detonated,” Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin wrote on Twitter.There have been a number of bomb attacks in Turkey in recent months, some blamed on the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and some on Islamic State. There were no immediate claims of responsibility on Thursday.The last blast in Istanbul was in June, a month before an attempted coup to overthrow President Tayyip Erdogan’s government, when 45 people were killed in a triple suicide bombing at the airport. That attack was blamed on Islamic State.There have been other attacks in the east of the country, including the bombing of a wedding party near the city of Gaziantep in August, when more than 50 people were killed."

When the International Olympic Committee chose Rio de Janeiro as the host in 2009, local officials said billions of dollars of investment would be poured into these first games held in South America, transforming Rio into a “vastly better” city.The favelas ― the unofficial, often impoverished communities that line Rio’s iconic hills ― would benefit too, they said. The government would finally deliver some of the basic services that the favelas had long lacked, improving roads and housing, sewage, sanitation, health care and education.By the time the games opened in August, though, those promises had proved hollow. Rio did invest billions in transportation and infrastructure, but most of it focused on the already wealthy areas of town. “They spent 39 billion reals on the Olympics,” said Michel Silva, a community journalist in Rocinha, the largest of the city’s favelas. (That’s roughly $12 billion.) “And the favelas got nothing.”They weren’t just excluded. At times, the favelas were targeted — by bulldozers making way for Olympic venues and by police who promised to make Rio safer for everyone, it seemed, except the favelas. The public services they were promised never came, and existing services, like the bus lines that once connected some favelas to the rest of the city, were altered or cut altogether.But something else happened in the favelas, home to nearly a quarter of Rio’s 6.3 million residents, in the years leading up to the Olympic Games. People in the neighborhoods came together — in anger, frustration and hope — to fight for their way of life. The Rio Olympics and the ills they brought helped the favelas find their political voice.“People in the favelas now more than ever have an identity and understand their value,” said Theresa Williamson, executive director of Catalytic Communities, a neighborhood development organization in Rio. “They didn’t know they could fight for this,” she said. “The world has recognized that the time has come for Brazil,” then-President Luiz Inacio “Lula” da Silva declared, as the news that Rio would host the Olympics sparked celebrations all along Copacabana Beach in October 2009.At least in the beginning, the country’s Olympic ambitions included the favelas. Social welfare programs put in place by Lula’s leftist Workers’ Party had begun to reduce illiteracy, extreme hunger and the worst of the poverty. In 2010, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes announced a new program to “re-urbanize” the neighborhoods. The Morar Carioca initiative would “put on the agenda issues which, in a way, the city abandoned,” Paes vowed. A mass “pacification” effort was already sending in police to drive out the drug gangs that controlled many of the favelas, purportedly making them safer and more open to the delivery of social services.Perhaps officials thought their promises would keep the favelas relatively quiet as Olympic development rode roughshod over them ― as it had over poor residents of so many other host cities. Even among the people who lived there, social and racial stigmatization had fed the belief that the favelas were not worthy of better treatment.“We are born fearing ourselves,” said Thais Cavalcante, a journalist at Jornal O Cidadão, which serves the Maré favela. But not this time. This time, the favelas fought for themselves. It began with local reporters making sure that everybody knew what was going on. In 2009, the community newspaper O Cidadão (The Citizen) ramped up its coverage of human rights abuses against Maré residents ― especially those related to the 2016 Olympics and the 2014 World Cup, for which Rio was also preparing. Maré never received one of the formal Police Pacification Units installed in more than 40 other favelas, but it was the object of a heightened police campaign. O Cidadão worked to document the effects of these “security” programs, asking a critical question: Was the government trying to improve public safety for everyone ― or only to secure the rest of Rio from the favelas?A year later, Williamson and Catalytic Communities launched the news site Rio Olympic Neighborhood Watch, or Rio On Watch. Together with other community papers in the favelas, these publications began to scrutinize the Olympic planning process and its effect on the city’s poorest residents. They were also there to amplify the cries of the people, as those who lived in the favelas started to push back against the broken development promises and blatant abuses.One of the first protests occurred in October 2010, when residents of Favela do Metrô marched from their northern Rio neighborhood to Paes’ home to demonstrate against the construction of a parking lot for Maracanã Stadium, the iconic venue that Metrô overlooks. The project threatened to displace as many as 800 families.Soon after, residents of Vila Autódromo, a small favela on Rio’s west side, began to protest their own planned evictions, which would make way for roads to access the Olympic Park.Over the next six years, favela residents rose in near-constant protests to fight Olympic-related housing destruction and displacement, the failure to extend basic services as part of Olympic-related infrastructure improvements, the crackdowns on those peaceful demonstrations that soon followed, and other police violence to pacify the favelas.The Olympic protests helped unite people around common issues. Groups like the Popular Committee on the World Cup and Olympics, which formed in 2011 to oppose removals and police violence, organized community events. The People’s Cup, for instance, was a soccer tournament in 2013 that brought together teams from various favelas threatened with evictions. The new organizations also built on the journalists’ work to produce reports documenting human rights violations across the favelas. The Popular Committee’s final report, released in December 2015, laid out a list of more than 100 violations. Among its 16 recommendations for addressing those abuses, it called for better public transit that served all Rio residents, more public housing, protection of the rights to assemble and protest, and the promotion of sporting events to enhance “education, health, leisure,” not simply to make profits.The protesters had their successes. Rocinha residents blocked the construction of a cable car that would scale the hill on which the neighborhood sits while doing little to serve the locals’ own transportation needs. The favela argued the money could be better spent ― perhaps to help replace the bundles of a dozen or more water lines hooked up by alley residents, because the water company delivers service only along the main road. Sanitation and sewage could use the funds as well. But nobody in Rocinha really needed that cable car.Rocinha’s residents were also among the first to fight back against police violence. They staged protests over the disappearance of their neighbor Amarildo de Souza, who was taken away for questioning by the favela’s pacifying police in the summer of 2013. “Where is Amarildo?” became a rallying cry against the escalating numbers of police killings that disproportionately targeted poor ― and black ― residents. Eventually, 10 officers were charged with torturing and murdering de Souza.Police violence in the favelas even drew global attention: A coalition of Black Lives Matter activists traveled from the United States to Brazil in July of this year to meet with groups fighting the similar fight.Vila Autódromo’s battle with the city also drew international press coverage. By the spring of 2016, more than 90 percent of the neighborhood’s roughly 600 families had been removed from their homes. But in April, 20 of those who remained struck a deal that allowed them to stay in new government-built homes. It was a small but meaningful victory.“The 20 families that resisted are the symbol of this city,” João Helvécio de Carvalho, a public defender who worked alongside Autódromo residents to challenge the evictions, told HuffPost Brazil before the Olympics. “This symbol means that it’s worth fighting for what you want. They were an example of resistance against removals.”The problems that plagued the favelas during the lead-up to the Olympics didn’t start when the IOC chose Rio. And they didn’t end once the games began.Security operations led by the police and military continued. Officers shot and killed at least nine people in Maré during the first two weeks of the Olympics, according to local activists. Overall, there were 92 shootouts in Rio during the games. They left 31 people dead and 51 injured, according to Crossfire, an online app project of Amnesty International.The Olympics hurt the favelas economically, too ― and not just because money that could have been spent on public services went toward the games instead. Land speculation and increased development led to sharp hikes in housing prices in Rocinha, making it more expensive ― sometimes prohibitively so ― for its own residents. Morar Carioca, the mayor’s ambitious favela improvement plan, largely failed to get off the ground and then was scrapped almost entirely.The larger political front doesn’t look promising for the favelas either. On Aug. 31, just a week and a half after the Olympics ended, Brazil’s Senate voted to oust President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers’ Party. The new president ― Michel Temer, a member of the Brazil Democratic Movement Party ― represents a dramatic swing rightward. Temer has already cut literacy programs and other initiatives that had improved lives, however modestly, in the favelas.“It’s going to get worse” now that the Olympics and Paralympics are over, said Gizele Martins, a Maré resident who previously worked as an editor at O Cidadão. “People who live outside the favelas don’t understand the importance [of these fights] sometimes. They do not live these violations everyday. They say you are all criminals. But we are lives.”So the battle will go on. There’s no other choice.O Cidadão plans to keep training journalists in the neighborhood and to organize workshops and events to help people outside the favelas understand what life is like there. Rio On Watch was supposed to shutter after the Olympics, but the website’s popularity during the games convinced Williamson and Catalytic Communities to keep it going.“There is nothing more promising in terms of citizens’ actions against human rights violations and social inequalities in Brazil than the media activism of low-income, peripheral youth,” observed Dr. Leonardo Custódio, a Brazilian researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland, after the games.In July, Casa Fluminense, a coalition of more than two dozen think tanks, non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups, released a 48-page plan called Agenda 2017, pushing for improved sanitation, transportation, development and human rights conditions in the favelas and across Rio. Unlike so many other well-intentioned policy plans, this one might have legs. At least three candidates in Rio’s mayoral elections actually signed on to Agenda 2017, Williamson said. And one of them ― Marcelo Freixo, who represents a leftist breakaway of the Workers’ Party ― survived the first round of voting on Oct. 2.Looking beyond Rio, some of the organizations working in the favelas seek to organize events with similar groups in Tokyo before the 2020 Olympics, according to Martins. Housing evictions, security crackdowns and broken promises didn’t just happen in Brazil ― they’re hallmarks of the modern Olympics. Tokyo has already begun displacing poor residents. The Rio activists hope their experience can help their Japanese counterparts before it’s too late.Rocinha buzzed on the final Friday afternoon of the Olympics, as the favela prepared for one of its famous funk parties that evening. People would come from across Rio to listen to funk rap, “the blood in the veins of the city.” Artists have long used the music to rage against the drug war, police violence and general neglect of their neighborhoods.City officials cracked down on funk parties in Rocinha and other favelas before the World Cup and the Olympics, contending they were hotbeds of criminal activity, moneymakers for local gangs and drummers-up of anti-government sentiment. But in Rocinha and elsewhere, residents fought back against the prohibition on their parties, too.“Favelas,” said journalist Silva, “are places of resistance.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said that none of the Rio mayoral candidates who signed on to Agenda 2017 survived the first round of voting in that election. In fact, Marcelo Freixo, one of two candidates who cleared the first voting hurdle, was among the Agenda 2017 backers."

When the International Olympic Committee chose Rio de Janeiro as the host in 2009, local officials said billions of dollars of investment would be poured into these first games held in South America, transforming Rio into a “vastly better” city.The favelas ― the unofficial, often impoverished communities that line Rio’s iconic hills ― would benefit too, they said. The government would finally deliver some of the basic services that the favelas had long lacked, improving roads and housing, sewage, sanitation, health care and education.By the time the games opened in August, though, those promises had proved hollow. Rio did invest billions in transportation and infrastructure, but most of it focused on the already wealthy areas of town. “They spent 39 billion reals on the Olympics,” said Michel Silva, a community journalist in Rocinha, the largest of the city’s favelas. (That’s roughly $12 billion.) “And the favelas got nothing.”They weren’t just excluded. At times, the favelas were targeted — by bulldozers making way for Olympic venues and by police who promised to make Rio safer for everyone, it seemed, except the favelas. The public services they were promised never came, and existing services, like the bus lines that once connected some favelas to the rest of the city, were altered or cut altogether.But something else happened in the favelas, home to nearly a quarter of Rio’s 6.3 million residents, in the years leading up to the Olympic Games. People in the neighborhoods came together — in anger, frustration and hope — to fight for their way of life. The Rio Olympics and the ills they brought helped the favelas find their political voice.“People in the favelas now more than ever have an identity and understand their value,” said Theresa Williamson, executive director of Catalytic Communities, a neighborhood development organization in Rio. “They didn’t know they could fight for this,” she said. “The world has recognized that the time has come for Brazil,” then-President Luiz Inacio “Lula” da Silva declared, as the news that Rio would host the Olympics sparked celebrations all along Copacabana Beach in October 2009.At least in the beginning, the country’s Olympic ambitions included the favelas. Social welfare programs put in place by Lula’s leftist Workers’ Party had begun to reduce illiteracy, extreme hunger and the worst of the poverty. In 2010, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes announced a new program to “re-urbanize” the neighborhoods. The Morar Carioca initiative would “put on the agenda issues which, in a way, the city abandoned,” Paes vowed. A mass “pacification” effort was already sending in police to drive out the drug gangs that controlled many of the favelas, purportedly making them safer and more open to the delivery of social services.Perhaps officials thought their promises would keep the favelas relatively quiet as Olympic development rode roughshod over them ― as it had over poor residents of so many other host cities. Even among the people who lived there, social and racial stigmatization had fed the belief that the favelas were not worthy of better treatment.“We are born fearing ourselves,” said Thais Cavalcante, a journalist at Jornal O Cidadão, which serves the Maré favela. But not this time. This time, the favelas fought for themselves. It began with local reporters making sure that everybody knew what was going on. In 2009, the community newspaper O Cidadão (The Citizen) ramped up its coverage of human rights abuses against Maré residents ― especially those related to the 2016 Olympics and the 2014 World Cup, for which Rio was also preparing. Maré never received one of the formal Police Pacification Units installed in more than 40 other favelas, but it was the object of a heightened police campaign. O Cidadão worked to document the effects of these “security” programs, asking a critical question: Was the government trying to improve public safety for everyone ― or only to secure the rest of Rio from the favelas?A year later, Williamson and Catalytic Communities launched the news site Rio Olympic Neighborhood Watch, or Rio On Watch. Together with other community papers in the favelas, these publications began to scrutinize the Olympic planning process and its effect on the city’s poorest residents. They were also there to amplify the cries of the people, as those who lived in the favelas started to push back against the broken development promises and blatant abuses.One of the first protests occurred in October 2010, when residents of Favela do Metrô marched from their northern Rio neighborhood to Paes’ home to demonstrate against the construction of a parking lot for Maracanã Stadium, the iconic venue that Metrô overlooks. The project threatened to displace as many as 800 families.Soon after, residents of Vila Autódromo, a small favela on Rio’s west side, began to protest their own planned evictions, which would make way for roads to access the Olympic Park.Over the next six years, favela residents rose in near-constant protests to fight Olympic-related housing destruction and displacement, the failure to extend basic services as part of Olympic-related infrastructure improvements, the crackdowns on those peaceful demonstrations that soon followed, and other police violence to pacify the favelas.The Olympic protests helped unite people around common issues. Groups like the Popular Committee on the World Cup and Olympics, which formed in 2011 to oppose removals and police violence, organized community events. The People’s Cup, for instance, was a soccer tournament in 2013 that brought together teams from various favelas threatened with evictions. The new organizations also built on the journalists’ work to produce reports documenting human rights violations across the favelas. The Popular Committee’s final report, released in December 2015, laid out a list of more than 100 violations. Among its 16 recommendations for addressing those abuses, it called for better public transit that served all Rio residents, more public housing, protection of the rights to assemble and protest, and the promotion of sporting events to enhance “education, health, leisure,” not simply to make profits.The protesters had their successes. Rocinha residents blocked the construction of a cable car that would scale the hill on which the neighborhood sits while doing little to serve the locals’ own transportation needs. The favela argued the money could be better spent ― perhaps to help replace the bundles of a dozen or more water lines hooked up by alley residents, because the water company delivers service only along the main road. Sanitation and sewage could use the funds as well. But nobody in Rocinha really needed that cable car.Rocinha’s residents were also among the first to fight back against police violence. They staged protests over the disappearance of their neighbor Amarildo de Souza, who was taken away for questioning by the favela’s pacifying police in the summer of 2013. “Where is Amarildo?” became a rallying cry against the escalating numbers of police killings that disproportionately targeted poor ― and black ― residents. Eventually, 10 officers were charged with torturing and murdering de Souza.Police violence in the favelas even drew global attention: A coalition of Black Lives Matter activists traveled from the United States to Brazil in July of this year to meet with groups fighting the similar fight.Vila Autódromo’s battle with the city also drew international press coverage. By the spring of 2016, more than 90 percent of the neighborhood’s roughly 600 families had been removed from their homes. But in April, 20 of those who remained struck a deal that allowed them to stay in new government-built homes. It was a small but meaningful victory.“The 20 families that resisted are the symbol of this city,” João Helvécio de Carvalho, a public defender who worked alongside Autódromo residents to challenge the evictions, told HuffPost Brazil before the Olympics. “This symbol means that it’s worth fighting for what you want. They were an example of resistance against removals.”The problems that plagued the favelas during the lead-up to the Olympics didn’t start when the IOC chose Rio. And they didn’t end once the games began.Security operations led by the police and military continued. Officers shot and killed at least nine people in Maré during the first two weeks of the Olympics, according to local activists. Overall, there were 92 shootouts in Rio during the games. They left 31 people dead and 51 injured, according to Crossfire, an online app project of Amnesty International.The Olympics hurt the favelas economically, too ― and not just because money that could have been spent on public services went toward the games instead. Land speculation and increased development led to sharp hikes in housing prices in Rocinha, making it more expensive ― sometimes prohibitively so ― for its own residents. Morar Carioca, the mayor’s ambitious favela improvement plan, largely failed to get off the ground and then was scrapped almost entirely.The larger political front doesn’t look promising for the favelas either. On Aug. 31, just a week and a half after the Olympics ended, Brazil’s Senate voted to oust President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers’ Party. The new president ― Michel Temer, a member of the Brazil Democratic Movement Party ― represents a dramatic swing rightward. Temer has already cut literacy programs and other initiatives that had improved lives, however modestly, in the favelas.“It’s going to get worse” now that the Olympics and Paralympics are over, said Gizele Martins, a Maré resident who previously worked as an editor at O Cidadão. “People who live outside the favelas don’t understand the importance [of these fights] sometimes. They do not live these violations everyday. They say you are all criminals. But we are lives.”So the battle will go on. There’s no other choice.O Cidadão plans to keep training journalists in the neighborhood and to organize workshops and events to help people outside the favelas understand what life is like there. Rio On Watch was supposed to shutter after the Olympics, but the website’s popularity during the games convinced Williamson and Catalytic Communities to keep it going.“There is nothing more promising in terms of citizens’ actions against human rights violations and social inequalities in Brazil than the media activism of low-income, peripheral youth,” observed Dr. Leonardo Custódio, a Brazilian researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland, after the games.In July, Casa Fluminense, a coalition of more than two dozen think tanks, non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups, released a 48-page plan called Agenda 2017, pushing for improved sanitation, transportation, development and human rights conditions in the favelas and across Rio. Unlike so many other well-intentioned policy plans, this one might have legs. At least three candidates in Rio’s mayoral elections actually signed on to Agenda 2017, Williamson said. And one of them ― Marcelo Freixo, who represents a leftist breakaway of the Workers’ Party ― survived the first round of voting on Oct. 2.Looking beyond Rio, some of the organizations working in the favelas seek to organize events with similar groups in Tokyo before the 2020 Olympics, according to Martins. Housing evictions, security crackdowns and broken promises didn’t just happen in Brazil ― they’re hallmarks of the modern Olympics. Tokyo has already begun displacing poor residents. The Rio activists hope their experience can help their Japanese counterparts before it’s too late.Rocinha buzzed on the final Friday afternoon of the Olympics, as the favela prepared for one of its famous funk parties that evening. People would come from across Rio to listen to funk rap, “the blood in the veins of the city.” Artists have long used the music to rage against the drug war, police violence and general neglect of their neighborhoods.City officials cracked down on funk parties in Rocinha and other favelas before the World Cup and the Olympics, contending they were hotbeds of criminal activity, moneymakers for local gangs and drummers-up of anti-government sentiment. But in Rocinha and elsewhere, residents fought back against the prohibition on their parties, too.“Favelas,” said journalist Silva, “are places of resistance.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said that none of the Rio mayoral candidates who signed on to Agenda 2017 survived the first round of voting in that election. In fact, Marcelo Freixo, one of two candidates who cleared the first voting hurdle, was among the Agenda 2017 backers."

The 2016 version of the New York Giants appeared to be well on their way to just that ― winning at Dallas and at home versus New Orleans, only to falter late at home against Washington.Of course, a 2-1 start in the NFL is admirable. But against Minnesota in primetime Monday night, the Giants lived up to criticisms that they’re soft, slow and undisciplined. Take quarterback Eli Manning, for example. No quarterback, save for Chicago’s Jay Cutler, has more fumbles since 2009. Manning does have two Super Bowl wins during that span as well, so people tend to cut him more slack.Then again, we are talking about a 35-year-old quarterback with zero escape ability in the pocket, prone to throwing untimely interceptions. Manning tossed two picks against Washington, including one with the game hanging in the balance as the Giants marched to kick a game-winning field goal. And his second half pick against the Vikings all but sealed the hopes of a comeback. This is classic Manning and we can’t just blame the porous offensive line or conservative play-calling either. He simply doesn’t throw the ball away and he doesn’t get out of trouble.He’s proven that he doesn’t need elite protection to produce quality numbers and win games. And this year he has the benefit of a shifty rookie wideout in Sterling Shepard (263 yards and 2 touchdowns) and a healthy Victor Cruz. Take into consideration that last year ― Odell Beckham Jr. amassed 1,450 yards, while the rest of Giant receivers totaled just 1,405 yards. Still, this is an offense that too often fails to produce explosive plays, a significant problem that didn’t exist last year.The Giants had 17 scoring plays of 20 or more yards in 2015, the third best in the league. This year, they only have one. And they’re scoring touchdowns in the red-zone a measly 46 percent of the time, per Giants.com.Opposing teams are forcing New York into moving slowly up and down the field. With the Giants scoring touchdowns in the red zone just 46 percent of the time, the lack of big scoring plays has been a killer.Maybe the most troubling aspect for Giants fans isn’t the struggling offense though, but a defense that ― after propelling New York’s opening couple wins ― has reverted back to its normal self. Remember, this was a unit that ranked last in total yardage allowed last season and produced that all-too-familiar Tom Coughlin scowl with its sheer inability to get off the field on 3rd-down.“They’re a championship defense,” Beckham said of this year’s version following the 16-13 Week 2 Big Blue win over New Orleans.Of course, Beckham has his own issues to deal with right now and the championship is a stretch.New York’s most glaring issue isn’t a lack of pass rush ― $85 million man Olivier Vernon and Jason Pierre-Paul rank third and fourth in quarterback hurries ― but rather a woeful linebacking core. When you don’t have backers to tackle in space (see Robinson, Keenan, and Casillas, Jonathan), corners and safeties have to cheat in, and the defense becomes susceptible to deep balls and bubble screens._The result was a remarkable 45.2 percent 3rd-down conversion rate for opposing offenses ― the 28th worst clip in the league. It’s also a key reason why the Giants have a minus-eight turnover margin through four games, the third-worst in the NFL.To be fair, rookie cornerback Eli Apple ― the highly touted top-10 pick out of Ohio State ― missed the Minnesota game, as did rookie safety Darian Thompson, who has played well. Pricey free agent pickup corner Janoris Jenkins has been as advertised, and the secondary is undeniably improved.“We have three starting corners,” first-year head coach Ben McAdoo said recently.McAdoo is also responsible for calling the Giants’ offensive plays. The former OC may be a guru, but his predictable series of screens and draws will not cut it, certainly not with the competition he’s facing in the division.The NFC East may not be the sexiest division in pro football, but rookie quarterback Dak Prescott has been awfully impressive, guiding Dallas to a 3-1 start. Cousins and Washington have quietly rebounded from an 0-2, winning two straight. Meanwhile, first-year triggerman Carson Wentz has sent shockwaves throughout the NFL while racking up several records and getting the Eagles off to a 3-0 start.The Giants are talented enough to stay in football games and be competitive. But being competitive and winning are two very different things. It’s a principal reason why Coughlin, despite winning two Super Bowls, was canned. It’s also the reason why GM Jerry Reese has no business being employed after assembling such a poor roster.The harsh reality for the G-Men is that Manning’s window to win is shutting as those two rings under Coughlin vanish to a very distant memory.

But Khan wasn’t sure if he even wanted to give his speech — until he remembered a conversation he had with a group of Muslim children. Khan said Thursday in a talk at the Georgetown University Law Center that his decision to give his speech — which included his observation that if it were up to Trump, Khan and his family wouldn’t be allowed in the U.S. — was inspired by the fear he saw in the eyes of the children of his family and friends who thought they might be banned from America because of their religion.“Whenever we would go visit family and friends, their children would come to me and say, ‘You’re a lawyer: Can this happen? Can we finish our middle school?’” said Khan. “Parents would say their children can’t sleep or eat well. When they ask them to do their homework, they say, ‘We’ll be thrown out anyway — we’re not doing our homework.’”Khan said he knew he would face extreme backlash for his speech from Trump supporters, and he hesitated before agreeing to speak. Ultimately, he decided it was worth the risk if it meant helping those children feel safer.“Behind all those words, there was only one reason — those little kids that came and told me that,” Khan said. “I could see from their eyes and their faces how scared they were. They have written back to me, some have called, and said they feel so strong after I spoke. They said that they wanted to learn more about the Constitution — these little kids!”Khan, who has been invited to speak across the country since his appearance at the convention, is a Pakistani Muslim who immigrated to the United States in 1980 with his wife, Ghazala, and his children. Their son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, posthumously received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for protecting his fellow soldiers from a bomb blast in Iraq in 2004. Trump quickly lashed out at Khan after the convention, even implying that his Muslim faith was the reason his wife didn’t also speak that night. Ghazala later wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post explaining that the real reason she chose to stay silent is because she still finds it too hard to speak about her son’s death.Khan famously waved his pocket-sized copy of the Constitution at Trump during his convention speech, and on Thursday, he urged people to keep the document’s principles in mind when heading to the polls. “We must always remain cognizant of our rights, of our Constitution, and of our democracy,” Khan said. “If we select the right leaders, we will make our institutions better, our nation better, and our legal system better, and we won’t have the type of adversity we would have if the other side wins.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
628,628,POLITICS,Ralph Nader Supporters Warn Third-Party Voters: Don't Make The Same Mistake!,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ralph-nader-voters_us_57f55aa4e4b0b7aafe0ba7f1,Some of these Nader voters now work for the Democratic Party -- and deeply regret their 2000 vote.,2016-10-06,"In 2000, Ralph Nader was the hope for many liberals unhappy with the Clinton administration and everyone associated with it.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f55b0e1a0000f3045b74bb.jpeg?cache=Bbmyo9M3W5&ops=crop_8_125_2040_1119%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Chris Savage had had enough of Bill Clinton and his shenanigans by the time the 2000 election rolled around, and he wasn’t thrilled about putting his vice president, Al Gore, back in the White House for another four years. But as a Democrat, there was no way the 36-year-old Michigan resident was going to vote for George W. Bush either. Then, he found Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.“He was pretty convincing in terms of the things he was advocating for. And he did have some very progressive positions and ideas, so those appealed to me,” Savage recounted. He soon put a Nader sign in his yard, became politically active and was all in to send a message to the establishment. But this cycle, Savage isn’t even considering voting third party. He’s now an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter and literally works for the establishment as Democratic Party chair of Washtenaw County in Michigan. And he wants to make sure that disaffected voters know exactly what they’re doing in this election before they go pull the lever for a third-party candidate like Jill Stein of the Green Party or Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.“I was somewhat uninformed and felt like there wasn’t that big a difference between Gore and Bush, believe it or not,” he said. “Obviously, in retrospect, it was a moronic way to look at things.”The Huffington Post spoke with Nader voters who have since figured out that the best way to fix the two-party system is to join it. They’ve worked in Democratic politics for years ― some as penance for what they did in 2000 ― and they worry that Stein voters are going to be making the same mistake they did with Nader. “If you think there’s no difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, then you’re not paying attention,” said Joe Rospars, who was the chief digital strategist for both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns and voted for Nader in Virginia when he was 19. “I don’t think that I’m just an old person now saying what an old person would have said to me 16 years ago. ... Voting for Jill Stein in a battleground state or Gary Johnson for any reason is just not a useful way to operate the electoral system.”Nader took 2.7 percent of the vote in 2000, and there’s been a national argument ever since over whether he cost Gore the election. He received nearly 100,000 votes in Florida, a state in which Bush beat Gore by only 537 votes. People who went for Nader in 2000 have done their own soul-searching over the years, with plenty of accusations from friends that they led to things like the Iraq War. “Those of us who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, most of us, if we had to do it over again, would not do it,” said Kurt Ehrenberg, 58, who served as Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) New Hampshire political director but now solidly backs Clinton. “You feel, in some small way, responsible for all this stuff that George W. Bush was able to do because he was elected president ― even though it was the closest race in my lifetime and there’s still some question as to whether, if all the votes had been counted, Bush would’ve won.” Jesse Berney was 25 when he voted for Nader and has since worked at the Democratic National Committee and for Clinton’s 2008 campaign. When asked if he regretted his vote, he replied, “Of course! John Roberts and Samuel Alito, the Iraq war, the huge irresponsible tax breaks, the pushing of abstinence-only education. The list goes on and on.”Berney eventually ended up creating a list that he called Bush’s “Scorecard of Evil,” summing up all the president’s objectionable actions. Many of Stein’s supporters were one-time Sanders supporters. But even though the senator himself is now out there campaigning for Clinton, not all of them are on board. Sanders’ supporters booed the senator himself at the Democratic National Convention in July when he said it was time to vote for Clinton.“It’s frustrating,” Ehrenberg said. “I try to talk to these folks about my vote for Ralph Nader and how much I regret that.”Ehrenberg and others worry that many of the younger Stein supporters have never really known a president besides Obama ― and they don’t realize how much worse it could be under a Republican president.“Part of what is going on with these voters is they’re mostly younger people who had very little experience with electoral politics before the Bernie campaign,” he said. “And their main opponent all through the primaries is Hillary Clinton. So they really continue to view Hillary Clinton as sort of the enemy when clearly, to me, and clearly if you listen to Bernie Sanders, she’s not the enemy.”“A lot of them have the luxury of having Obama for eight years,” added Irene Lin, who was 24 and living in California when she voted for Nader and has since worked on Democratic campaigns. “I think they take for granted how bad it was before. Especially when I worked on the Hill in 2005, and it was Bush and then Republicans had control of the Senate and the House and it was just miserable.”Some of these Nader-voters-turned-Democratic-operatives also said they underestimated just how bad Bush would be. They were, after all, primarily focused on the Clinton administration and devoting energy to criticizing the Democratic Party. “I think at the time, a lot of people were under the illusion he wasn’t as bad as he turned out to be,” Rospars said. “Not that I would have ever voted for him, but ...you wouldn’t have imagined that even from just a policy perspective, that it was as bad as it wound up being based on the campaign and the broader media environment during the election.” “But also as a kid, I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” he added.Some Nader supporters have officially joined the Democratic Party as elected leaders. Kyrsten Sinema, for example, worked on Nader’s presidential campaign in 2000 and is now a Democratic member of the House from Arizona. James Wolf was in college at the University of Cincinnati when he backed Nader, unhappy with NAFTA and some of Clinton’s welfare-to-work policies. “Nader really spoke to me at the time,” he said. Since his college days, he’s joined the city council in Mount Healthy, Ohio, and now serves as the Democratic mayor there. He still considers himself more liberal than both Clinton and Obama, but he said his experience has helped him better understand why it’s useful to support the top of the ticket even if the candidate isn’t perfect. “The work that [major party presidential candidates] do when they run for office helps build the voter file and helps build the party so that when I run for election, it helps people like me get elected,” he said. “And when people like me get elected at the lower level, we help grow the party from the grassroots and push it into the direction I would like to see. ... So now I really believe in changing things through the party.”“To be honest, these third-party candidates are kind of selfish,” Wolf added in a statement that probably would have shocked his college self. “Their campaigns are selfish. Because when you support Jill Stein, the money goes toward Jill Stein, and there’s no Green Party candidate in Mount Healthy, for example. ... So you’re not building any long-term momentum or movement. You’re just helping one person.”Right now, many of these Nader voters say they’re not too worried about disaffected Democrats going third party and tipping the election to Trump. But then again, most of them thought that Gore would easily win in 2000 as well. And there are indications that third-party votes will hurt Clinton more than Trump. That’s why they’re still a bit concerned. “If there are progressive or otherwise just public service-oriented people who are somehow figuring out a way to rationalize voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson,” Rospars said, “they should seek out me and the other people who you’re talking to for this piece for a conversation because I really can’t imagine how one could come to that conclusion.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

629,629,POLITICS,Ralph Nader Supporters Warn Third-Party Voters: Don't Make The Same Mistake!,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ralph-nader-voters_us_57f55aa4e4b0b7aafe0ba7f1,Some of these Nader voters now work for the Democratic Party -- and deeply regret their 2000 vote.,2016-10-06,"Ralph Nader supporters protested outside Al Gore's headquarters in Portland, Oregon on Oct. 3, 2000, upset that their candidate was shut out of the upcoming presidential debate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_4_39_1850_1109%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Chris Savage had had enough of Bill Clinton and his shenanigans by the time the 2000 election rolled around, and he wasn’t thrilled about putting his vice president, Al Gore, back in the White House for another four years. But as a Democrat, there was no way the 36-year-old Michigan resident was going to vote for George W. Bush either. Then, he found Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.“He was pretty convincing in terms of the things he was advocating for. And he did have some very progressive positions and ideas, so those appealed to me,” Savage recounted. He soon put a Nader sign in his yard, became politically active and was all in to send a message to the establishment. But this cycle, Savage isn’t even considering voting third party. He’s now an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter and literally works for the establishment as Democratic Party chair of Washtenaw County in Michigan. And he wants to make sure that disaffected voters know exactly what they’re doing in this election before they go pull the lever for a third-party candidate like Jill Stein of the Green Party or Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.“I was somewhat uninformed and felt like there wasn’t that big a difference between Gore and Bush, believe it or not,” he said. “Obviously, in retrospect, it was a moronic way to look at things.”The Huffington Post spoke with Nader voters who have since figured out that the best way to fix the two-party system is to join it. They’ve worked in Democratic politics for years ― some as penance for what they did in 2000 ― and they worry that Stein voters are going to be making the same mistake they did with Nader. “If you think there’s no difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, then you’re not paying attention,” said Joe Rospars, who was the chief digital strategist for both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns and voted for Nader in Virginia when he was 19. “I don’t think that I’m just an old person now saying what an old person would have said to me 16 years ago. ...

632,632,POLITICS,Ammon Bundy Says Armed Takeover Of Wildlife Refuge Was Totally Legal,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ammon-bundy-testimony-wildlife-refuge_us_57f58ab1e4b05f39c51e2ef4,"Guns brought by followers helped spread the anti-government message, he testified.",2016-10-06,Ammon Bundy sits at a desk he is using at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PORTLAND, Ore. — Ammon Bundy walked a fine line Wednesday describing the armed takeover he led of a wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon, yet denying that he and his six co-defendants broke any laws.In his second day testifying in his own defense, Bundy, 41, a self-proclaimed reluctant activist, rejected the prosecution allegation that he conspired with other defendants to occupy the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in January. But he admitted planning to make a “hard stand” against the federal government over two local ranchers who’d been sentenced to prison for arson.“We were following the law constitutionally,” Bundy testified. He also said wildlife refuge workers were “absolutely not” threatened by him. The central charge against Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy, 43, and five others is that they conspired to impede federal employees who work at the bird refuge. Federal prosecutors contend Bundy and two others also illegally possessed firearms at the refuge. Ryan Bundy and another man were charged with theft of government property. The minimum sentence for each, if they are convicted, is six years. Bundy denied possessing a firearm at the refuge, yet admitted encouraging others to arm themselves. Guns made authorities take the occupiers seriously and brought media coverage, he said. “I began to believe that the only way for us to get our message out is if they respected us a little bit,” Bundy told jurors.Bundy said he originally only sought to protest the case of Dwight and Steve Hammond, the ranchers convicted of setting fires on federal land. But the occupation’s goal widened as elected officials ignored letters pleading for a reinvestigation into the father and son’s case, Bundy said. The new objective, he said, was taking possession of the refuge to turn into an engine for economic growth by allowing cattle grazing and other commercial activity.Jurors saw a video message Bundy posted days before the occupation began in which he asked followers to join him in Oregon. “I ask you to come to Harney County to participate in this wonderful thing that the Lord is about to accomplish,” Bundy said.He said he was guided by the words of the Founding Fathers and his Mormon faith. He tried to read aloud from the Declaration of Independence and Mormon scripture that he carried in the breast pocket of his blue jail uniform, but U.S. District Judge Anna Brown stopped him, saying it was irrelevant. Bundy said he interprets the Constitution as allowing individuals to seize land if they occupy and improve it. “This is the reason why we went into the refuge and did what we did,” Bundy explained.Melodi Molt, who testified for the defense earlier, told HuffPost that Bundy’s message resonated with many people in her corner of Oregon.“He woke up a bunch of sleeping people,” Molt said, though she acknowledged that Bundy’s rhetoric polarized neighbors. A large percentage of residents work for government agencies, so they felt threatened by Bundy, Molt said.Bundy and his supporters have testified about the welcoming atmosphere they created during their control of the refuge. They said it was easy for visitors to enter the grounds. Occupiers talked about families bringing their children.University of Oregon geography professor Peter Walker, who’s writing a book about the occupation, told HuffPost he found the protesters intimidating when he visited. “They had every reason to be friendly to local families who came to the refuge, and they were,” Walker said in an email. “But if they considered you an opponent, it was a completely different story. I personally witnessed the occupiers verbally and physically assault and threaten environmentalist counter-protestors who came into the refuge.” For a second day, Bundy’s testimony was cut short to accommodate a witness who needed to travel. Bundy is expected to resume testifying on Thursday, before the prosecution cross-examines him. "
637,637,POLITICS,"Mike Pence, Tim Kaine Attempt To Prove They Exist",Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kaine-pence-debate-wrap_us_57f475d0e4b015995f2bffb1,C'mon. You know you weren't paying attention to them before the debate either.,2016-10-05,Mike Pence doesn't know what Donald Trump quote you're talking about. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FARMVILLE, Va. ― The best joke about the 2016 vice presidential debate had already been told long before a nation of wags took to Twitter Tuesday morning in advance of the only vice presidential debate. Credit for the top jape goes to “The Young Turks’” Cenk Uygur, who told Seth Meyers on the Sept. 8 edition of “Late Night”: “I think there’s some chance that the V.P. debate already happened.”And who could say otherwise until Tuesday night, when, at long last, America received reassurance that two vice presidential candidates existed, and that a debate between the two of them would air on television.It may be worth a brief recap of who our would-be future vice presidents actually are. Tim Kaine is the former governor of Virginia, selected by Hillary Clinton to be a safe ― so very very safe! ― choice as running mate (and perhaps help lock down his home state), over the muted objections of the more liberal portion of the Democratic base, who might have preferred a candidate of a more populist flavor.Mike Pence, by contrast, is the current governor of Indiana, selected by Donald Trump to absorb as little of the spotlight as possible (and maybe help keep the evangelical base at home). According to reports, the most notable objector to Trump’s choice was, puzzlingly, Trump himself ― who in one of his patented late-night crises briefly attempted to call backsies on his pick after it became common knowledge.Presumably, Pence and Kaine have been out on the campaign trail, working hard for the names above theirs on the ticket. Thus far, they have successfully made themselves total non-factors, as far as the media lens is concerned.Tuesday night, however, brought a brief interruption in their irrelevance, as both men were forced to spend their first extended stay in the spotlight since their parties’ respective conventions. For Pence and Kaine, it was a new chance to make a first impression. It was a real pity that they were doing so in the midst of a campaign that’s already proven to be the ne plus ultra of gaudy, angry, multicolored clusterfucks.And it’s safe to say that the impression left by our would-be future vice presidents was that they really, really prefer that everyone focus on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Which may not be a bad thing, who knows? But it was hard to get to know these two men, and their own political beliefs.Efforts were occasionally made. Right at the outset, the evening’s moderator ― CBS News’ Eliane Quijano ― put the spotlight squarely on the two vice presidential nominees, asking each if they had the character and the skills to step in at a moment’s notice to take over the presidency, should tragedy occur. Kaine was quick to cite his “experience at all levels of government,” but before we had the chance to hear specifics, he shrugged off the attention and presented himself as Hillary Clinton’s “right hand.” He then roughly threw the attention back on the man at the top of the GOP ticket. Citing his son, currently on deployment in the U.S. Marines, Kaine said the thought of Trump becoming commander in chief “scared him to death.”Kaine was clearly spoiling for a fight, but Pence deferred at first, speaking humbly, describing himself as a “small town boy” who was simply thankful to Donald Trump for extending him the opportunity to serve on the ticket. “I would hope, and even pray,” he said, to meet that challenge “with a lifetime of experience.” Perhaps everyone who goes to work for Trump has to do the same thing.At that point, the focus of the debate immediately swung back to the absent stars atop the ticket, with Pence and Kaine being forced by Quijano to account for and defend their masters’ sins. “Why do so many people distrust [Clinton]?” Quijano asked Kaine. “Why do so many Americans think Trump is simply to erratic?” she inquired of Pence. The questions almost instantly brought the two men into combat and constant interruption. It made for a wild argument, but whatever the two men were bringing to the ticket themselves was soon left far behind as each rattled their blades at the other’s better half, like matadors stalking absent bulls.It wasn’t long before this ostensible debate became something more like a cheerleading contest.Kaine effortlessly deployed his first “dad joke” of the night on Clinton’s behalf: “There is a choice for the American electorate: Do you want a ‘you are hired’ president ― or a ‘you are fired’ president.” Pence, stuck mopping up the mess of Trump’s billion-dollar debt write-off from two decades ago, towed the Trump company line like a lifer: “He went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it was supposed to be used.” “Brilliantly,” in fact. Between the attacks and defenses of their running mates, and the bland recitation of party dogma, there were occasional moments when the two men managed to insist that they were alive and in this world, with their own experiences and ideas. Kaine referenced the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech as a particularly trying time in his political life. Pence spoke feelingly about the pride he felt visiting his uncle, a beat cop on the streets of Chicago. In these too-brief moments, actual identities threatened to emerge. And on occasion, the actual decisions that the two men have made in their own political careers briefly flickered with relevance.One such moment came during the discussion of Syrian refugee resettlement ― as it happens, a concern in the current news cycle. As governor, Pence accepted federal money for refugee resettlement and then refused to give it to organizations if they used it to resettle Syrians in Indiana. But this week, in a blow to Pence, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit “ruled unanimously ... that the governor has no authority to withhold funding from refugee resettlement organizations that are guaranteed aid under federal law,” HuffPost’s Elise Foley and Cristian Farias wrote. Judge Richard Posner was especially critical of Pence, saying that his discrimination against Syrians was based on unfounded “nightmare speculation.”Kaine happily put Pence on the defensive for a policy that the former Virginia governor decried as anti-Muslim and “discriminatory.” Pence, citing the Paris attacks, proudly declaimed that he stood by his original decision. For a minute, the audience was reminded that that these two men actually did things, in their own political careers.But the gravitational pull of Trump and Clinton was too strong. Just as the audience was starting to get within peering distance of the two debaters, they were locking horns anew ― this time over which presidential candidate had been the most insulting on the campaign trail. It was pretty clear that there might not be any debt in Clinton’s ledger to lay alongside Trump’s litany of broadsides if she’d never uttered the phrase “basket of deplorables.” Pence might have deploring that statement, but not the opportunity to cite it. He reminded the audience of Clinton’s controversial utterance with obvious relief. He’d have had nothing to work with, otherwise.Over the larger course of the debate, Quijano’s attempts to sound out the vice presidential nominees on their own policy preferences and political opinions were met with responses that threw the attention back on Clinton and Trump. Has the threat of terrorism diminished? “In some ways” yes, Kaine said, but more importantly, Clinton has had the lessons of Sept. 11 “seared onto her.” By what means would millions of undocumented immigrants be expelled from the United States? “Donald Trump said we are going to move those people out,” declared Pence, without much elaboration. What will the Clinton campaign do about Russia? According to Kaine, they’ll “start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.”At one point, Kaine was debating whether Pence was even adequately defending his partner. “Six times tonight,” Kaine said, “I have said to Governor Pence, I can’t imagine how you would defend your running mate’s position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he’s refused to defend his running mate.” That wasn’t, strictly speaking, true ― it’s just that Pence’s main defense of Trump’s many coarse statements was to simply insist that he’d never said them in the first place.Finally, there came a moment when these two career politicians seemed to snap to life ― when Quijano asked them to personally account for the role of faith in their personal and public life. For Kaine, it was an opportunity to speak of the influence that the Jesuits had on his life, and how he’d tried to balance the practices of his faith with public service. Pence rose to the question himself, laying out big areas of disagreement with Kaine, but not doing so in an unkind manner. It was a moment when their own identities seemed to matter, when the line between faith and the state gets discussed and drawn, and where real differences between these two men and their running mates might lie.Alas, all of this happened in the closing moments of the evening. Quijano asked her final question and all that was left to do was for each man to refer to his campaign’s branding. “Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together,” said Kaine. “When you hear [Trump] say he wants to make America great again, I believe it,” offered Pence.Vice presidential debates aren’t often high-stakes affairs ― they are basically as perfunctory as the role of vice president itself. But four years ago, America got to watch a tangle between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan ― two men with undiminishable places in the firmament of American politics. On this Tuesday night in Farmville, Virginia, Tim Kaine and Mike Pence made little effort to attest to their own identities. The only really remarkable thing about them was that they’d been chosen by other people who weren’t in the room.Essentially, the only “vice presidential debate” that really mattered happened a long time ago, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump picked them to appear on their campaign logos. And now, Mike Pence and Tim Kaine can re-submerge themselves in the background of their running mates’ wild hurly-burly."

And on occasion, the actual decisions that the two men have made in their own political careers briefly flickered with relevance.One such moment came during the discussion of Syrian refugee resettlement ― as it happens, a concern in the current news cycle. As governor, Pence accepted federal money for refugee resettlement and then refused to give it to organizations if they used it to resettle Syrians in Indiana. But this week, in a blow to Pence, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit “ruled unanimously ... that the governor has no authority to withhold funding from refugee resettlement organizations that are guaranteed aid under federal law,” HuffPost’s Elise Foley and Cristian Farias wrote. Judge Richard Posner was especially critical of Pence, saying that his discrimination against Syrians was based on unfounded “nightmare speculation.”Kaine happily put Pence on the defensive for a policy that the former Virginia governor decried as anti-Muslim and “discriminatory.” Pence, citing the Paris attacks, proudly declaimed that he stood by his original decision. For a minute, the audience was reminded that that these two men actually did things, in their own political careers.But the gravitational pull of Trump and Clinton was too strong. Just as the audience was starting to get within peering distance of the two debaters, they were locking horns anew ― this time over which presidential candidate had been the most insulting on the campaign trail. It was pretty clear that there might not be any debt in Clinton’s ledger to lay alongside Trump’s litany of broadsides if she’d never uttered the phrase “basket of deplorables.” Pence might have deploring that statement, but not the opportunity to cite it. He reminded the audience of Clinton’s controversial utterance with obvious relief. He’d have had nothing to work with, otherwise.Over the larger course of the debate, Quijano’s attempts to sound out the vice presidential nominees on their own policy preferences and political opinions were met with responses that threw the attention back on Clinton and Trump. Has the threat of terrorism diminished? “In some ways” yes, Kaine said, but more importantly, Clinton has had the lessons of Sept. 11 “seared onto her.” By what means would millions of undocumented immigrants be expelled from the United States? “Donald Trump said we are going to move those people out,” declared Pence, without much elaboration. What will the Clinton campaign do about Russia? According to Kaine, they’ll “start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.”At one point, Kaine was debating whether Pence was even adequately defending his partner. “Six times tonight,” Kaine said, “I have said to Governor Pence, I can’t imagine how you would defend your running mate’s position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he’s refused to defend his running mate.” That wasn’t, strictly speaking, true ― it’s just that Pence’s main defense of Trump’s many coarse statements was to simply insist that he’d never said them in the first place.Finally, there came a moment when these two career politicians seemed to snap to life ― when Quijano asked them to personally account for the role of faith in their personal and public life. For Kaine, it was an opportunity to speak of the influence that the Jesuits had on his life, and how he’d tried to balance the practices of his faith with public service. Pence rose to the question himself, laying out big areas of disagreement with Kaine, but not doing so in an unkind manner. It was a moment when their own identities seemed to matter, when the line between faith and the state gets discussed and drawn, and where real differences between these two men and their running mates might lie.Alas, all of this happened in the closing moments of the evening. Quijano asked her final question and all that was left to do was for each man to refer to his campaign’s branding. “Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together,” said Kaine. “When you hear [Trump] say he wants to make America great again, I believe it,” offered Pence.Vice presidential debates aren’t often high-stakes affairs ― they are basically as perfunctory as the role of vice president itself. But four years ago, America got to watch a tangle between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan ― two men with undiminishable places in the firmament of American politics. On this Tuesday night in Farmville, Virginia, Tim Kaine and Mike Pence made little effort to attest to their own identities. The only really remarkable thing about them was that they’d been chosen by other people who weren’t in the room.Essentially, the only “vice presidential debate” that really mattered happened a long time ago, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump picked them to appear on their campaign logos. And now, Mike Pence and Tim Kaine can re-submerge themselves in the background of their running mates’ wild hurly-burly."

Mike Pence (R) made a series of insulting and manipulative remarks during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday night ― considering he’s Donald Trump’s running mate, that should come as no surprise. However, during the debate portion on policing in America, the GOP vice presidential candidate made one particularly absurd and dangerously misguided claim around the September fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina: That a black cop killing a black man invalidates any claim that law enforcement is racist. Pence presented a flawed premise around why it is unfair to broadly accuse law enforcement of practicing implicit bias, despite facts that prove racism is deeply embedded within the criminal justice system. He then mentioned Brentley Vinson, the black police officer who fatally shot 43-year-old Scott, a black man, as a way to defend his baseless argument that implicit bias doesn’t exist among cases where both the cop and the victim are African-American.“When an African-American police officer in Charlotte, and all-star football player who went to Liberty University, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police-action shooting that claimed the life of Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy,” Pence said, while attempting to show a smidgen more empathy over Scott’s slaying than Trump did during the first presidential debate. Pence then brought up comments that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton made during the presidential debate on the need to reduce implicit bias among law enforcement. He clearly missed her point as he tried to dismiss her takedown of racist policing, claiming it is unfair to “seize upon tragedy as a reason to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of implicit bias or institutional racism.” In an even more striking moment, Pence expressed confusion over why Clinton would claim that implicit bias played a role in Scott’s killing “when African-American police officers [are] involved in a police-action shooting involving an African-American.” Let’s be clear here: A black cop fatally shooting a black civilian does not prove that the criminal justice system isn’t racist or does not practice implicit bias. To think it does is to dismiss the notion that anti-black bias can exist among black officers while also ignoring the underlying structural issues within policing that promote racism and the media-fed stereotypes of African-American men as criminals that influences all people, even black men themselves.The truth is that the criminal justice system thrives off and profits from racially targeted police practices that black and white officers enforce. In fact, it can be argued that the system was, in many ways, designed to operate in this way and law enforcement departments cannot expect to eliminate racism from the system simply by hiring more officers of color to work within it.In fact, black cops are not exempt from discriminating just because they look like those they police ― and data proves it. A 2014 report from The Associated Press finds that police can’t just “hire their way out of their problems” and “that even in cities where police departments reflect the communities they protect, there still are issues with racial discrimination.” The report looked at New Orleans, Louisiana, in particular and highlighted how despite having one of the most racially diverse police forces, the Justice Department confirmed that it still discriminated against African-Americans.That’s not to say that having more officers of color is unwarranted. (Around 60 percent of America’s police officers are white.) But it highlights why Pence putting emphasis on the race of the officer, rather than the racist practices cops collectively carry out, is a sad scapegoat that entirely misplaces the blame around a serious issue. Instead, Pence, who claimed that “law enforcement in this country is a force for good,” continued to praise police and doubled down on Trump’s pitch for more “law and order” ― all while willfully ignoring the racial problems that plague them. This stands in strong contrast to the proposal of Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), to bring about law enforcement reform through community-oriented policing. Kaine suggested to Pence that he “cannot believe you’re defending the position there is no bias” by using Vinson’s case as a vessel during their debate. The Democratic VP also discussed actionable measures that should be taken to reform the criminal justice system. “The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing,” Pence said. “You build the bonds between community and the police force, bonds of understanding. When that gap narrows, it is safer for communities, and for the police. That model works across our country.” Restoring trust among cops and communities they serve is crucial. While it won’t solve all the deep, racial divides within the criminal justice system, rebuilding this relationship is worth investing in and proven to be beneficial. Policing is a complex issue, but it’s important to understand that racism plays a role in almost every step of the criminal justice system. Because of this, more Americans must be unafraid to call out the implicit bias all cops practice. One key way to address the reality of policing in America, particularly against black lives, is through thoughtful and meaningful dialogue.Sadly, this was not the case Tuesday night as Pence blundered his way through the debate, making no mention of the systemic racial issues that plague policing nor any real solutions to alleviate them. But let’s leave it to Kaine to call out Pence and Trump for the ignorance they’ve displayed over this issue.“People should not be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement,” Kaine said. “If you are afraid to have the discussion, you will never solve it.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Mike Pence (R) and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) were asked about law enforcement and race relations during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Kaine, who is sharing a ticket with Hillary Clinton, said the way to create better relationships between cops and communities is through community policing. “The way you make police safer is through community policing,” he said, emphasizing that a stronger bond needs to be built between communities and law enforcement. “When that gap narrows, it is safer for communities and for the police. That model works across our country.”He then turned his attention to the “tough-on-crime,” “law and order” policies of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. “Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop and frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community,” Kaine said. Trump claimed during the first presidential debate that stop and frisk “brought crime way down” in New York, which isn’t true. Stop and frisk was struck down in 2013 by a federal judge who called the policy a “demeaning and humiliating experience” for people of color and a “policy of indirect racial profiling.Pence claimed he and Trump want to “make sure law enforcement has the resources and tools to be able to really restore law and order, and for the cities and communities in this nation.”Trump has repeatedly praised law enforcement while criticizing protesters who are calling attention to police brutality. Pence took this a step further, saying that the national Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Trump because of “people that seize upon tragedy as a reason to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of implicit bias or institutional racism.” Pence then pointed to Brentley Vinson, the black police officer in Charlotte, North Carolina, who shot and killed 43-year-old Keith Scott on Sept. 20. To Pence, that incident is an example of why implicit bias shouldn’t be discussed since, apparently, black cops can’t be anti-black (which isn’t true). “We mourn with those who mourn, we grieve with those who grieve and we are saddened at the loss of life,” Pence said. “Hillary Clinton referred to that moment as an actual example of implicit bias in the police force.” During the first presidential debate, Clinton said that everyone suffers from implicit bias. But Pence didn’t get it. “Enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement probably by making accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs,” he said. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Mike Pence, when confronted in Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate with statements the Republican presidential nominee has made over the course of the campaign.“You know, the words don’t always come out exactly the way he means them,” Pence said. “But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be.”That particular exchange with Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine came after Pence claimed, incorrectly, that Trump had never said that women should be punished for having an abortion. Pence also denied Trump had made statements in support of letting other countries acquire nuclear weapons, creating a “deportation force,” and expressing admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump, in reality, made all of those statements, but, according to Pence’s theory, presumably did not mean them.John Weaver, a top adviser to 2008 GOP nominee John McCain and then to Ohio Gov. John Kasich in his unsuccessful run this year, said the party’s cavalier attitude toward its presidential nominee’s statements is unprecedented.“We’ve never had anything like this before, frankly. Words matter,” Weaver said. “For the running mate to say, ‘Well it doesn’t matter, because everyone, including our adversaries, will know he doesn’t mean it’ is extraordinary.”Trying to explain away Trump’s statements is nothing new for Republicans, particular since May 3 when he handily won the Indiana primary and for all intents and purposes became the presidential nominee. This is the first time Trump’s ever run for office, they argue, so people shouldn’t take his words as literally as they might an experienced politician’s.“He’s been trying very hard to be presidential and gracious and I think he’s actually done a nice job of that lately,” Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told the Associated Press on May 13, referring both to the content of Trump’s remarks as well as his tone. “I expect him to continue working at it and getting the job done.”As the months have passed, though, Trump’s care with words has not necessarily improved, except at those times when he is reading off prepared notes or a script written for him on his teleprompter.At a news conference the day after his nomination in July, Trump repeated his earlier accusation that the father of vanquished GOP rival Ted Cruz may have been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.A few days later, at a news conference the RNC staged in Philadelphia to criticize Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at her convention, Priebus first had to explain Trump’s assassination theory.“He’s got a right to talk about whatever he wants to talk about. However, I don’t think he was ever saying this was some sort of factual information,” Priebus said. “It was something he referred to. He’s talked about it. He’s gotten off from it. As far as I’m concerned, we can move on from it.”California Rep. Duncan Hunter gave perhaps the most explicit explanation from a Republican why Trump should not be taken literally. “You’re treating Donald Trump’s words like he is the most articulate person who’s ever graced our ears,” Hunter told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Aug. 9. “He is not a politician. He is not a person like you who’s very articulate.”CORRECTION: Due to an editorial error, an earlier version of this story reported the wrong day of the vice presidential debate. The debate was Tuesday.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Kaine kicked off the answers, mentioning community policing as a way to make both citizens and police safer.Pence agreed ― but not willingly.“Let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea,” Pence said. “It has worked in the Hoosier State. We fully support that.”Bipartisanship has become increasingly rare in U.S. national politics, as shown by Pence’s observation that it may be a “risk” that he agree with his opponent.Politicians from both sides of the aisle have come together, though, to condemn comments made by Trump throughout his presidential campaign."

Thus far, Mother Jones reports, none of the nation’s 100 highest-circulation newspapers have come out in favor of her GOP rival, Donald Trump, including a number of staunchly Republican editorial boards with long-running streaks of supporting GOP candidates.“Clinton has the temperament and experience to be president,” the editorial board of the Arizona Republic wrote last month, explaining its decision to back a Democrat for the first time in the paper’s 126-year history. “Donald Trump does not.” USA Today, which has never before taken a side in a presidential election, wrote that Trump “lacks the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents.” But according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, most Americans either aren’t aware who their paper is endorsing, or don’t care ― and neither do they think that papers should be issuing such endorsements in the first place.A 51 percent majority of Americans polled say that newspapers should not endorse political candidates. Just 24 percent believe that they should, while the rest are unsure.Perhaps unsurprisingly, since this year’s endorsements have favored their candidate, Democrats are more likely to support the practice. By a 9-point margin, 40 percent to 31 percent, they say that newspapers should weigh in on the election. Republicans say by a 46-point margin, 64 percent to 17 percent, that they should not.Americans’ reluctance to take guidance from editorial endorsements may have something to do with their lack of faith in the papers that issue them. Trust in the media, which has fallen steadily in the past decade, reached a new nadir this year, according to Gallup.In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, just 13 percent of Americans say they trust their local newspaper “a lot,” while 43 percent trust it “somewhat” and 25 percent trust it “not very much” or “not at all.” Another 18 percent say they don’t even read a local newspaper. Democrats are 13 points more likely than Republicans to evince at least some trust in their local paper.There’s also relatively little public awareness about whom, if anyone, newspapers are backing. Just 19 percent of Americans who read a local paper say they know whether it endorsed someone, with 15 percent saying their paper came out in favor of Clinton, and 4 percent saying it was in favor of Trump.  Of those readers who do report knowing about an endorsement, a 53 percent majority say that it won’t affect their vote. Just 13 percent say it makes them more likely to support the candidate backed by their paper. (A Pew survey conducted in 2012, which asked about the effects of endorsements by various people and groups, found even less of a perceived impact, with 74 percent of voters polled saying a newspaper endorsement would make no difference to them.)Questions about how various factors are likely to affect someone’s votes are, of course, tricky ― people aren’t especially good at laying out their own decision-making processes. In this case, some might not even be accurately reporting their newspaper’s position. And the people most susceptible to any endorsement may be those who are already inclined to support the candidate in question. While the samples are too small to look at exact numbers by party, literally none of the Republicans and fewer than one-tenth of the independents polled whose papers endorsed Clinton say it makes them more likely to vote for her.Some research suggests that the fact that many usually-conservative papers are breaking from tradition could make their endorsements more effective than usual. One recently released study of the last two elections found some evidence that endorsements could improve a candidate’s chances of winning in close races, especially those that “come as a surprise compared to the newspaper’s endorsement history.” Earlier research found that such “crossover” endorsements could convince 1 or 2 percent of readers to change their minds.With voters in both parties overwhelmingly supporting their nominee and only a sliver of the electorate still undecided, however, relatively few people are likely to be turning to the editorial page to make their decision.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 29-30 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) criticized Donald Trump for avoiding paying federal income taxes for many years.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f45af21a0000de085b717b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) slammed Donald Trump during the vice presidential debate Tuesday for not paying federal income taxes.Seizing on the New York Times’ bombshell story that the Republican presidential nominee took a $916 million personal deduction in 1995, Kaine said that by not voluntarily releasing his tax returns “he has broken his first promise.” Trump initially said he would release his tax returns, before backtracking and citing a series of shifting explanations for why he would not release his returns. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has released her tax returns, as have Kaine and Trump’s vice presidential running mate Mike Pence; it is the standard practice for modern presidential candidates. The Times story was based on three previously unreported pages from Trump’s 1995 tax returns that were anonymously mailed to reporter Susanne Craig in September. Tax experts who analyzed the documents said they could have allowed Trump to pay no federal income taxes for 18 years.Even before his partial tax return was published, the Republican nominee all but invited that line of attack. At last week’s debate, Clinton suggested Trump hadn’t released his tax returns because they would show how little he paid. “That makes me smart,” Trump quickly retorted.At the vice presidential debate Tuesday, Kaine asked whether Trump meant it’s smart not to pay for the military and teachers. “I guess that makes the rest of us stupid,” Kaine said.After initially dodging the question of why Trump won’t release his tax returns, Pence said the Times story showed Trump was a businessman who “faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.” He seemed to be referring to the period in the early 1990s when Trump’s casino business sank into bankruptcy. As part of an agreement with the banks that held his debt, Trump was put on a $450,000 monthly allowance. The release of the partial returns have put Trump on the defensive after a week that began with Clinton scoring a victory in the first presidential debate and ended with Trump ranting in early morning tweets about Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe he called fat more than a decade ago. Clinton has been quick to say that Trump’s taxes are further proof that “he abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country’s ... It’s always Trump first, and everyone else last.”Trump’s campaign has neither confirmed nor contested the veracity of the documents published by the Times. Instead, the Trump campaign offered the mutually exclusive claims that the “alleged tax document” had been “illegally obtained” because Trump had not authorized its release. The campaign also said Trump was a successful businessman who would know how to fix U.S. tax laws.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Longwood University, a liberal arts school of roughly 5,000 students, scored the coveted role of veep debate host, bringing a swarm of politicos and journalists to the college town, population 8,000.Everyone has an opinion on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most polarizing political figures of their time. Opinions on their running mates, not so much. These two safe bets are grossly overshadowed by the tops of their respective tickets. But even if the undercard candidates are as vanilla as can be, that’s OK with the residents of Farmville.“It’s hard to be excited, but [Trump and Clinton] do need somebody to level them out,” said Alex, a 39-year-old local. “We’re not super excited. We’re mostly just happy this is in Farmville.”Linda Farmer, 73, of nearby Cumberland, said she’ll be voting for the Trump ticket next month. She admitted she had never heard of Pence until the real estate mogul plucked his name from the veep short list. But what she’s seen of Pence so far, she likes ― particularly that he doesn’t set off fireworks the way his running mate does.“He has a professionalism to him. I think they’ll be a good balance,” Farmer said. “I love his honesty. I love his compassionate voice for the people of the United States.”Dorothy, a retiree from Farmville, said she’s supporting Trump, too, and thinks Pence seems like “an all-around nice guy.” She sees him as just the kind of person Trump needs by his side: a dry, policy-focused conservative.“I’m hoping with Pence, he will make Trump look a little more, what can I say… serious?” she said with a laugh. “Maybe?”For Hazel Burley, another local who says she’s “with him,” the reserved Pence has served as a necessary tranquilizer for the top of the ticket. Burley and her friend, Jeanette Johnstone, cut out of work early to see the hoopla surrounding the debate.“I think maybe he’ll calm Trump down,” Burley, wearing a red-white-and-blue scarf, said hopefully.“Seems like a good family man,” Johnstone agreed.Burley and Johnstone didn’t know much about Pence either before his name was paired with Trump’s on campaign signs; Burley wondered if perhaps the governor hailed from Colorado. But so far, Pence seemed to them like the appropriate antidote to a flamethrower like Trump.Besides, Burley didn’t think much of Kaine.“He closed the rest stops,” she said with a shake of the head. (As Virginia’s governor, Kaine shuttered interstate rest stops to save money during a budget crunch; nineteen of them were later reopened under Gov. Bob McDonnell.)L.D. Phaup, a retiree from Farmville who declined to say how he plans to vote, said he views Pence as the “Cool Hand Luke” of the GOP ticket. The husband of a debate coach, Phaup described Trump’s debate performance last month as more or less inept, rife with missed opportunities to attack Clinton. He said he wished his wife could spend a weekend coaching the Republican nominee.“Mr. Pence has a character that Mr. Trump does not have,” Phaup said. “He brings something to the equation that Mr. Trump needs badly.”Some locals were far more interested in the buzz surrounding the debate than the debate itself. Sally Kitterman, a retiree from the nearby town of Dillwyn, stopped by just to take pictures of the scene. That’s when she bumped into a dreamboat: conservative columnist Stephen Hayes.“I’ve died and gone to heaven,” Kitterman gushed as she sat with her camera near a stage set up for TV interviews. “I’m waiting on [Fox News interviewer] Jesse Watters. And then I’ll probably leave.”Others seemed downright depressed about the candidates and the elections.“I’m not excited about anything,” Diane Gunter, 40, said before letting out a slightly maniacal laugh. “Nobody cares. It’s a puppet show. It’s all rigged.”Gunter said she’ll probably vote for Clinton in November, but she doesn’t think it will change much because the government is fundamentally corrupt.“I think we’re going to hell in a handbasket,” she said."

Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, told Stumpf at a hearing Thursday. “I wish I didn’t. I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions and it’s going to take a long time to earn it back.”Regulators and law enforcement around the country are plugging away on the Wells case to determine exactly how long the fraudulent practices went on, and whether the bank violated labor laws by firing whistleblowers and people who failed to meet unrealistic targets without committing fraud. Last week, lawmakers also began to focus on whether there could be misconduct related to Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, or whether previous settlements over mortgages were a leading indicator of trouble elsewhere.At a political level, the Wells Fargo case is undermining the case bigger banks are making in Washington as they seek to influence the course of the next administration. “The headlines surrounding the news will hang around for a long time,” said Brian Gardner, an analyst with investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Stumpf Survival at StakePerhaps most ominously for the CEO who is in the eye of the storm, bank lobbyists are privately speculating whether Stumpf becomes the first big casualty of public outrage at big banks ― Wall Street, broadly speaking ― since the 2008 financial crisis.Mike Mayo, a prominent banking analyst with CLSA, a unit of the French bank Credit Agricole, wrote a scathing note to investors of Stumpf’s performance so far, calling it “reactionary versus leading.” He hinted that the CEO’s exit may come as a consequence of the scandal.“We believe Wells Fargo is bigger than the CEO, notwithstanding a good financial track record during his tenure, and there should be no more excuses for the lack of answers to key questions,” Mayo wrote.Earlier this month, Wells agreed to pay $185 million in fines and restitution to federal regulators after employees opened about 1.5 million accounts customers didn’t want, and perhaps 500,000 undesired credit cards. Wells fired over 5,000 people over the practices.For Wells, the consequences are only beginning to unfold.Damaged Credit ReportsThe bank may have created black marks on its customers’ credit reports by saddling them with card or checking accounts of which they were unaware, creating a fertile ground for class-action lawsuits. It may have driven up customers’ interest rates on mortgages, or other loans, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.“Theoretically all those fake accounts could and should be deleted from people’s credit reports and that would solve the problem moving forward,” Rheingold said. “Of course, it may not be simple, and more likely will only be done on an individual basis when a consumer discovers” what Wells did.From a policy standpoint, the Wells Fargo case is playing directly into the hands of Wall Street critics, notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who accused Stumpf of “gutless leadership” at a recent Senate hearing last week, and called for his resignation.If Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, captures the White House in November, the Wells Fargo scandal will have put wind in Warren’s sails at precisely the moment when a new president will be making decisions about her top economic policy personnel.Lawmakers Ask About Mortgages“Warren is succeeding in establishing herself as the chief financial policymaker in a potential Clinton White House,” said Jaret Seiberg, managing director with the Cowen Group, a research firm. “She is using the bully pulpit to shape the debate over the Wells Fargo cross-selling controversy. To us, this spells trouble on the policy front for big banks next year.”At the House hearing, some lawmakers honed in on prior legal settlements Wells had over mortgage fraud. In 2011, around the time regulators believe the bulk of the checking-account fraud began, Wells paid $85 million to settle claims by the Federal Reserve that its employees falsified loan documents and steered customers into more expensive loans.Wells is the 800-pound gorilla of the U.S. mortgage market. It controlled 12.7 percent of the market in 2015, about twice its nearest rival, JPMorgan Chase, according to the industry publication mortgage daily.At the hearing last week, Hensarling said the problems back in 2011 seemed “eerily like the retail banking division” where the checking account problems occurred. “If you saw the problem in one area of the business why didn’t you investigate in another area?” Hensarling said.“You got caught doing it five years ago,” he added. “You got caught doing it again.”Rep. John Carney, a Delaware Democrat, asked how Wells ensures that fraudulent practices don’t occur in the mortgage business.“We have a terrific team on the mortgage side,” Stumpf responded. “We are trying every day to get better.”Wells also paid $335 million in 2013 to settle allegations of misleading disclosures on mortgage bonds it sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Senate Democrats, having grilled Stumpf in a hearing recently recently, put new questions to him in writing that ask, among other things, how confident he is that misconduct isn’t taking place in the mortgage business.Future of Fannie and FreddieOne area of concern for Wells will have to be the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage-guarantee giants that the federal government seized in 2008. Congress has deadlocked over the details of reforming Fannie and Freddie even as a very vague consensus has formed around creating a system that keeps private capital in the mortgage market while having the federal government provide a backstop in case of catastrophic losses.Smaller banks have stayed alert to the possibility that a system might privilege bigger banks ― notably Wells ― that aggregate huge numbers of mortgages, said Ron Haynie, senior vice president for mortgage finance policy at the Independent Community Bankers of America. “If you’re a big guy, you don’t need aggregators,” Haynie said.Housing finance policy has been a particular focus of Wells Fargo’s lobbying efforts in Washington. According to disclosure forms, it has lobbied on approximately a dozen bills related to housing finance since 2013, to include efforts that would give large banks a bigger role in the mortgage market. From 2008 to 2011, Wells more than doubled its outlays for lobbying to $7.8 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and since then it has spent about $6 million each year.With this case, Wells has handed its opponents in Washington some valuable ammunition, said Rob Zimmer, principal at TVDC, a public affairs firm that has small lenders as clients. He said that if big banks try, in the next administration, to claim the role of Fannie and Freddie for themselves, anything small lenders don’t like will get called “the Wells Fargo provision.”“Are they in the penalty box? Yes,” Zimmer said. “Is that the end of the world for their lobbying? Certainly not.”Arbitration ClausesIn this Congress, lawmakers in the Senate have considered some minor changes to Fannie and Freddie, issues on which Wells has lobbied. But so far, the provisions have been part of a broader regulatory relief bill sponsored by Sen. Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who chairs the Senate Banking Committee.The case may undermine the banking lobby’s effort to fight plans by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one of Wells Fargo’s auditors, to restrict the use of arbitration clauses in financial contracts. These clauses require consumers to submit disputes to arbitration, and forestall class-action lawsuits.The Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, a part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has promised to fight the plan to ban arbitration clauses.However, information is now trickling out that Wells used the clauses to force customers who sought redress from the fake accounts out of court and into arbitration, which is also confidential. In the recent hearing, Senators pressed Stumpf to stop enforcing arbitration rules, a request that he brushed off.Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee and Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat with the Judiciary Committee, subsequently called on Wells to formally abandon the practice.“The ability to force customers into secret arbitration proceedings allowed Wells Fargo to continue its outrageous practices with impunity for far too long,” they wrote Stumpf."

I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions and it’s going to take a long time to earn it back.”Regulators and law enforcement around the country are plugging away on the Wells case to determine exactly how long the fraudulent practices went on, and whether the bank violated labor laws by firing whistleblowers and people who failed to meet unrealistic targets without committing fraud. Last week, lawmakers also began to focus on whether there could be misconduct related to Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, or whether previous settlements over mortgages were a leading indicator of trouble elsewhere.At a political level, the Wells Fargo case is undermining the case bigger banks are making in Washington as they seek to influence the course of the next administration. “The headlines surrounding the news will hang around for a long time,” said Brian Gardner, an analyst with investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Stumpf Survival at StakePerhaps most ominously for the CEO who is in the eye of the storm, bank lobbyists are privately speculating whether Stumpf becomes the first big casualty of public outrage at big banks ― Wall Street, broadly speaking ― since the 2008 financial crisis.Mike Mayo, a prominent banking analyst with CLSA, a unit of the French bank Credit Agricole, wrote a scathing note to investors of Stumpf’s performance so far, calling it “reactionary versus leading.” He hinted that the CEO’s exit may come as a consequence of the scandal.“We believe Wells Fargo is bigger than the CEO, notwithstanding a good financial track record during his tenure, and there should be no more excuses for the lack of answers to key questions,” Mayo wrote.Earlier this month, Wells agreed to pay $185 million in fines and restitution to federal regulators after employees opened about 1.5 million accounts customers didn’t want, and perhaps 500,000 undesired credit cards. Wells fired over 5,000 people over the practices.For Wells, the consequences are only beginning to unfold.Damaged Credit ReportsThe bank may have created black marks on its customers’ credit reports by saddling them with card or checking accounts of which they were unaware, creating a fertile ground for class-action lawsuits. It may have driven up customers’ interest rates on mortgages, or other loans, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.“Theoretically all those fake accounts could and should be deleted from people’s credit reports and that would solve the problem moving forward,” Rheingold said. “Of course, it may not be simple, and more likely will only be done on an individual basis when a consumer discovers” what Wells did.From a policy standpoint, the Wells Fargo case is playing directly into the hands of Wall Street critics, notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who accused Stumpf of “gutless leadership” at a recent Senate hearing last week, and called for his resignation.If Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, captures the White House in November, the Wells Fargo scandal will have put wind in Warren’s sails at precisely the moment when a new president will be making decisions about her top economic policy personnel.Lawmakers Ask About Mortgages“Warren is succeeding in establishing herself as the chief financial policymaker in a potential Clinton White House,” said Jaret Seiberg, managing director with the Cowen Group, a research firm. “She is using the bully pulpit to shape the debate over the Wells Fargo cross-selling controversy. To us, this spells trouble on the policy front for big banks next year.”At the House hearing, some lawmakers honed in on prior legal settlements Wells had over mortgage fraud. In 2011, around the time regulators believe the bulk of the checking-account fraud began, Wells paid $85 million to settle claims by the Federal Reserve that its employees falsified loan documents and steered customers into more expensive loans.Wells is the 800-pound gorilla of the U.S. mortgage market. It controlled 12.7 percent of the market in 2015, about twice its nearest rival, JPMorgan Chase, according to the industry publication mortgage daily.At the hearing last week, Hensarling said the problems back in 2011 seemed “eerily like the retail banking division” where the checking account problems occurred. “If you saw the problem in one area of the business why didn’t you investigate in another area?” Hensarling said.“You got caught doing it five years ago,” he added. “You got caught doing it again.”Rep. John Carney, a Delaware Democrat, asked how Wells ensures that fraudulent practices don’t occur in the mortgage business.“We have a terrific team on the mortgage side,” Stumpf responded. “We are trying every day to get better.”Wells also paid $335 million in 2013 to settle allegations of misleading disclosures on mortgage bonds it sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Senate Democrats, having grilled Stumpf in a hearing recently recently, put new questions to him in writing that ask, among other things, how confident he is that misconduct isn’t taking place in the mortgage business.Future of Fannie and FreddieOne area of concern for Wells will have to be the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage-guarantee giants that the federal government seized in 2008. Congress has deadlocked over the details of reforming Fannie and Freddie even as a very vague consensus has formed around creating a system that keeps private capital in the mortgage market while having the federal government provide a backstop in case of catastrophic losses.Smaller banks have stayed alert to the possibility that a system might privilege bigger banks ― notably Wells ― that aggregate huge numbers of mortgages, said Ron Haynie, senior vice president for mortgage finance policy at the Independent Community Bankers of America. “If you’re a big guy, you don’t need aggregators,” Haynie said.Housing finance policy has been a particular focus of Wells Fargo’s lobbying efforts in Washington. According to disclosure forms, it has lobbied on approximately a dozen bills related to housing finance since 2013, to include efforts that would give large banks a bigger role in the mortgage market. From 2008 to 2011, Wells more than doubled its outlays for lobbying to $7.8 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and since then it has spent about $6 million each year.With this case, Wells has handed its opponents in Washington some valuable ammunition, said Rob Zimmer, principal at TVDC, a public affairs firm that has small lenders as clients. He said that if big banks try, in the next administration, to claim the role of Fannie and Freddie for themselves, anything small lenders don’t like will get called “the Wells Fargo provision.”“Are they in the penalty box? Yes,” Zimmer said. “Is that the end of the world for their lobbying? Certainly not.”Arbitration ClausesIn this Congress, lawmakers in the Senate have considered some minor changes to Fannie and Freddie, issues on which Wells has lobbied. But so far, the provisions have been part of a broader regulatory relief bill sponsored by Sen. Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who chairs the Senate Banking Committee.The case may undermine the banking lobby’s effort to fight plans by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one of Wells Fargo’s auditors, to restrict the use of arbitration clauses in financial contracts. These clauses require consumers to submit disputes to arbitration, and forestall class-action lawsuits.The Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, a part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has promised to fight the plan to ban arbitration clauses.However, information is now trickling out that Wells used the clauses to force customers who sought redress from the fake accounts out of court and into arbitration, which is also confidential. In the recent hearing, Senators pressed Stumpf to stop enforcing arbitration rules, a request that he brushed off.Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee and Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat with the Judiciary Committee, subsequently called on Wells to formally abandon the practice.“The ability to force customers into secret arbitration proceedings allowed Wells Fargo to continue its outrageous practices with impunity for far too long,” they wrote Stumpf."
718,718,GREEN,Hurricane Matthew's Strength Is Yet Another Climate Change Indicator,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-matthew-october-record_us_57f53c51e4b05f39c51d94f7,It's unusual for a storm like this to hit in October.,2016-10-05,"People try to cross the overflowing La Rouyonne river in the commune of Leogane, south of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Oct. 5.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f57341170000f70aac9bc5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hurricane Matthew, a record-shattering storm that is unusual for October, is a reminder of climate change’s potential to turn seasonal weather events into extreme, year-round threats. Matthew, which meteorologists downgraded from a rare Category 5 to a Katrina-magnitude Category 3 on Wednesday, could make landfall in southeast Florida as early as Thursday, and threatens northeast Florida and the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina through Saturday. The storm has already claimed at least 11 lives in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.The storm has surpassed several milestones as one of the strongest, longest-lasting hurricanes of its kind on record. But on top of that, scientists note, it’s atypical for this time of year. Matthew is the only hurricane of this strength to persist this many October days since 1963, noted Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klotzbach, an expert in Atlantic hurricane forecasts. If it makes landfall on Florida’s east coast as expected, he also noted, it will be the first major hurricane to do so in October since 1950. Matthew also remained a Category 4-5 hurricane for 102 hours, The Washington Post noted, which is the longest amount of time on record that a hurricane of that strength has persisted in the Atlantic basin during the month of October. While the Atlantic’s hurricane season officially runs June 1 to Nov. 30, the statistical peak is Sept.10, when ocean temperatures are high and wind shear ― a storm-mitigating factor ― is low. But as climate change increases the temperature during months that aren’t typically warm enough to support storms as strong as Matthew, hurricane season is beginning to last longer.“The nearly unprecedented rapid intensification we saw with this storm is favored by warmer oceans and greater ocean heat content,” Michael E. Mann, a leading climate scientist and professor of meteorology at Penn State University, told The Huffington Post. As the “seasonal window during which sea surface temperatures are warm enough” to support storms increases, he said, “we can expect to see the season broaden.”It’s important to note, Mann added, that scientists are still figuring out how wind shear factors into this. “There is quite a bit of uncertainty as to how wind shear in the Caribbean will change in the future as a result of climate change, therein lies a key uncertainty in future projections,” he wrote. “But we’re fairly certain that, whether we see more or fewer tropical cyclones, we will see more intense hurricanes and super-typhoons, like Katrina, and Sandy and Haiyan and Patricia and now Matthew.”Clarification: A previous version of this article, in paraphrasing Klotzbach’s tweet embedded above, failed to include that he specified a landfall on Florida’s east coast."
724,724,POLITICS,Here’s How Tim Kaine And Mike Pence Measure Up On Criminal Justice,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-kaine-mike-pence-criminal-justice_us_57f48228e4b015995f2c0ce2,The two vice presidential candidates have pushed for similar criminal justice policies at times.,2016-10-05,Kaine said communities have to be encouraged “to embrace what I call a community policing model where they try to deal with crime by building stronger ties.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f4829a1a0000de085b71c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) faced off during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday, and things got particularly interesting during a spat about how a president should improve the relationship between police and communities of color. Kaine, like his running mate Hillary Clinton, said the solution is community policing. And Pence leaned more toward “law and order,” a cornerstone of the campaign of his running mate Donald Trump.Though Kaine and Pence have pushed for different criminal justice policies throughout their careers, they have at times advocated for similar measures ― especially during the 1990s, when most public officials were “tough on crime.” Here’s a brief rundown of where Kaine and Pence have stood on sentencing, policing and other criminal justice issues. Kaine has spoken during the 2016 campaign about the need for “very significant criminal justice reform” and finding a new way to handle nonviolent offenders. In an appearance on CBS in September, Kaine discussed problems with the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The measure, signed into law by former President Bill Clinton, instituted mandatory sentencing minimums and other measures that increased the prison population throughout the 1990s. Hillary Clinton’s support of the bill ― and her use of the racially coded term “super-predators” when discussing youth violence at the time ― has been a primary criticism of her current push for criminal justice reform. “We have learned from painful experience that, as a nation, we are so far out of whack with the rest of the [world] in the way we use incarceration,” Kaine said. “We have to dramatically change that, and so Hillary and I both strongly support criminal justice reform, which isn’t just about sentencing … The crime bill in ’94, it had consequences that went farther than we wanted. We’ve got to roll that back, and I think there is some bipartisan interest in doing this now.” Kaine also said communities have to be encouraged “to embrace what I call a community policing model, where they try to deal with crime by building stronger ties.” During his CBS appearance last month, he advocated for better mental health services for law enforcement. Before joining the Clinton campaign, Kaine pushed for tougher restrictions on gun purchases following the 2007 Virginia Tech Massacre. He also supported reducing mandatory minimums and vetoed a bill that would have increased executions in Virginia while he was governor. But executions did take place while Kaine was governor; he upheld the state law even though he is personally against the death penalty. One blip on Kaine’s record, however, is his backing of Project Exile, which made illegal gun possession a federal crime. The program was heavily criticized as being racially discriminatory against black men in prison sentencing. Pence’s record on criminal justice is all over the place. In September, the governor was heavily scrutinized for refusing to remove a felony conviction from the criminal record of a man found innocent. But in 2014, Pence signed a bill into law giving former felons an opportunity to expunge their records if they’ve stayed out of the criminal justice system for a set period of time. Pence also signed a bill in 2013 requiring inmates to serve longer sentences and increasing sentences for certain crimes. In March, he restored a 10-year mandatory minimum for people convicted of dealing meth or heroine if they have previously been arrested for selling those two drugs or cocaine.Pence has opposed a federal measure fighting prison rape, says racial bias should not be discussed in police shootings and supported “tough-on-crime” laws in the 1990s.But the governor has also taken steps to increase rehabilitation programs. He voted in favor of expanding services that help ex-offenders re-enter society in 2007. And in 2014, Pence announced the First Time Offender Program. As part of the program, low-risk male criminals who have never been incarcerated in a state prison are housed in dorm-like buildings at a correctional facility that mimics a school campus and provides inmates with courses on anger management and building life skills.

Booze Allen is the consulting firm that employed Edward Snowden when he revealed the collection of metadata by the NSA in 2013.Booz Allen said in a statement that when the company “learned of the arrest of one of its employees by the FBI,” they immediately fired the employee and offered full cooperation to the FBI.The same month Martin was arrested, some of the NSA’s most sophisticated hacking tools were dumped onto public websites by a group calling itself Shadow Brokers.The company’s stock was down 3.7 percent to $30.33 a share, following the report.The U.S. Justice Department charged Martin, who had top secret national security clearance, with theft of classified government material, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Wednesday.Word of the arrest followed a New York Times report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating whether he stole and disclosed highly classified computer “source code” developed to hack into the networks of Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and other countries.It was the latest disclosure of details of cyber spying by the U.S. government since Snowden stole and released a vast trove of documents that exposed the reach of the NSA’s surveillance programs at home and abroad. It comes at a time of growing concern over the cyberhacking of federal agencies and American political parties.According to the complaint, documents found in Martin’s possession contained sensitive intelligence.“These six documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods, and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues,” the complaint said. It said Martin had the ability to access U.S. government property that was not permitted to leave its authorized location.Martin’s lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.The Justice Department’s chief national security prosecutor, John Carlin, declined to comment on the specifics of the case.He said, however, that insider threats have long posed a challenge to the government.“I’m sure the trusted professionals I work with across the community will take a hard look at anything they can learn from this case, whether it’s about contractors or other issues to see whether they can better defend our systems from others who might try to steal from them,” Carlin said in an interview on CSPAN.Martin faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charges.The leak of the NSA hacking tools coincided with U.S. officials saying they had concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible for hacking political party organizations in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election. The Russian government has denied involvement."

First, though, it wants to build up more support among staff.Peterson estimates that the bargaining unit would consist of 80 staff members, including people who produce content for Fusion’s website, television channel and other platforms.“This is of a piece with the organizing that’s been going on in digital media for some time,” Peterson told The Huffington Post. “It reflects a certain level of confidence on the part of digital media editorial side folks that this is a meaningful way to make a career and a recognition that collective bargaining is a way to make that happen.”Univision and ABC News started Fusion ― originally conceived as an outlet for young Latinos ― in October 2013, but ABC News sold its 50 percent share to Univision in April amid disappointing numbers. Fusion’s cable channel, in particular, has faced challenges, with two major cable carriers declining to offer the channel in their packages. Peterson said he wasn’t aware of any concerns regarding Fusion’s financial viability. “They are certainly expanding their presence,” he said.If Fusion’s effort succeeds, the outlet will join several digital outlets that have organized in recent months. HuffPost, Vice Media, Salon and ThinkProgress have all unionized with WGA-E, which had previously mostly represented television and film writers. Gawker Media, which is now owned by Univision, kicked off the wave when editorial staff officially voted to form a union in June 2015.The Guardian U.S. and Law 360 have both unionized with the NewsGuild, which represents workers at many iconic legacy news organizations like The New York Times and The Washington Post.“People have been inspired to see that collective bargaining is actually possible,” Peterson said of the timing of the Fusion organizing drive.UPDATE: 9:14 p.m. ― Fusion management will try to convince employees not to unionize, according to an email to the staff obtained by BuzzFeed.“We’ll be sharing information directly with you and encouraging you to investigate and ask questions so that you have a complete picture on what Guild representation would mean,” Fusion executives Boris Gartner and Danny Eilemberg wrote in the Wednesday night message. “At the end of that process, we think you will agree that Guild representation would not be beneficial for you or FUSION.”Disclosure: The author is a member of the bargaining committee with the WGA-E currently in negotiation with The Huffington Post.

766,766,POLITICS,The VP Debate Questions On Debt And Social Security Were Really Bad,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/debate-social-security-questions_us_57f4692de4b04c71d6f0e29e,Elaine Quijano parroted flawed conventional wisdom.,2016-10-05,"Debate moderator Elaine Quijano speaks during the debate between the vice presidential nominees, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) and Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f479531a0000f3045b71ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Everybody knows that the U.S. government’s debt is a horrible, unsustainable dangerous thing and that Social Security is heading straight for fiscal collapse, right? Those were certainly the underlying assumptions of two domestic policy questions that moderator Elaine Quijano asked Tuesday night at the vice presidential debate.They’re not objective facts, however: They are talking points that have been drilled into the American public’s consciousness by a well-funded, decades-long campaign promoting “fiscal responsibility.” It’s been wildly successful at turning a questionable assertion into conventional wisdom. For instance, here’s what Quijano asked the vice presidential candidates about America’s debt: “There are a lot of people wondering about the economy. According to the nonpartisan committee, neither of your economic plans would reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it. Both of you were governors who balanced the state budget. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country?”In fact, if you are worried about the economy, you should be worried that there is too little government debt, not too much. Just ask Ben Bernanke, the former head of the Federal Reserve, who consistently told Congress during his tenure that a lack of government spending was holding back the U.S. economy. Instead of spending more, Congress implemented spending cuts in the wake of the 2009 stimulus bill. Those cuts are a prime reason why the recovery after the financial crisis hasn’t been as strong as it could have been. More spending would mean more debt, yes, but there is a very easy, continually updated gauge of how close dangerous more government borrowing would be ― U.S. Treasury rates ― and it continues to hover near record lows. That notion that debt is unquestionably bad and must be reduced is directly connected to the problem with Quijano’s question on Social Security, which cited as an immutable fact that the program is off the fiscal rails and faces certain benefit cuts. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) picked up that loaded question and said that a Hillary Clinton administration would raise the wage cap (currently only income up to $118,500 is subject to Social Security taxes).It’s not crazy to worry about future obligations through programs like Social Security ― and whether the federal government has lined up enough resources to pay for them. Raising taxes on high-income Americans is one way to ensure that the government has more money available to help seniors retire and stay out of poverty.But Social Security is not in crisis, as commonly assumed and Quijano implied. The program is pretty close to fiscally sound now, and modest tweaks ― like lifting a cap on the Social Security payroll tax ― would be enough to take care of shortfalls.Whether raising taxes on high-income Americans is politically feasible is another question entirely. But the fact that Social Security might be one politically difficult tax law change away from soundness shows just how warped Quijano’s assumptions were. Social Security is not on some inexorable downward spiral, and American debt is not an out-of-control fiscal monster. Americans deserved to hear economic policy questions grounded in reality, not think-tank-gestated talking points, and they didn’t get that."

In fact, in his announcement last week he said his main motivation for accumulating assets is to make the biggest contribution possible toward becoming interplanetary. As for timelines, however, Musk admitted he’s “not the best at this sort of thing.” Boeing is working with NASA to build a new, powerful rocket. Known as the Space Launch System, or SLS, it is designed for deep space missions, including Mars and beyond. According to goals outlined in the U.S. National Space Policy, NASA hopes to send astronauts to Mars at some point in the 2030s. In addition to Boeing’s planned victory in the Mars race, Muilenburg said Tuesday that he envisions the company making incredible technological advances over the coming decades, including supersonic and hypersonic travel and commercial low-Earth orbit space travel.“Over the last 100 years, it’s remarkable to think about, men and women went from walking on the Earth to walking on the moon. We went from riding horses to flying airplanes,” he said. “When I look ahead to the next century, I think the opportunity for innovation and big change is even greater, even bolder.”If Boeing’s success in helping the U.S. be the first to put men on the moon is any indication, the company may just beat Musk after all."

On Wednesday, however, one of the supposedly safe new phones also caught fire, forcing the evacuation of a Southwest Airlines flight in Louisville.Passenger Brian Green provided a photo of the burned Note 7 to The Verge, explaining that he recently had it replaced; the outlet established that the phone did in fact appear to be a replacement model.“He said he had just powered it down, when it made a popping noise and started smoking,” Green’s wife, Sarah, told the Louisville Courier-Journal. “He took it out of his pocket and threw it on the ground.”“I would love to know why the replacement phone is doing what the other one was doing,” she added.Brian Green told The Verge the phone burned through the carpet of the plane and scorched the subfloor before it came to rest.No one was injured in the incident and all customers and crew safely deplaned the flight, a Southwest spokesperson told The Huffington Post, adding, “We encourage our customers to comply with the FAA Pack Safe guidelines.” The FAA “strongly advises” passengers traveling with pre-recall Note 7s not to turn them on or charge them while on board or to pack them in checked baggage. (Of course, assuming Green had a replacement model, he should have been in the clear.)The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is reportedly investigating the incident.Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence are two religious men who care strongly about protecting life. But how this affects their politics differs greatly.In a surprisingly sincere and personal moment in Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate, the politicians discussed their religious backgrounds and how their faith impacts their views on the sanctity of life.In their responses, the men epitomized a divide that has historically separated Democrats and Republicans. Kaine discussed his moral opposition to the death penalty, while Pence decried abortion as “anathema” to him.A majority of Republicans would agree with Pence, but not all Christians are satisfied with the Republican ticket’s promise on this issue. People frequently use the term “pro-life” to reflect a stance that favors strict abortion legislation and seeks to protect the rights of individuals starting in the womb. But as many have noted, this stance is more aptly described as “anti-abortion” to reflect the efforts on both sides of the aisle to promote life. For some Christians, the more “pro-life” stance in this election is actually one championed by Kaine and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.In an op-ed published Monday on Christian Post, titled “Hillary Clinton Is the Best Choice for Voters Against Abortion,” Christian political consultant Eric Sapp argued that being “pro-life” should entail more than opposing abortion.“Here’s the question pro-life Christians must ask,” Sapp wrote. “Do we care more about talking about the unborn, or do we actually want to do something to prevent abortions?”Preventing abortions means supporting the women and families who are most likely to have them, Sapp continued, including those who are poor and facing an unexpected pregnancy. And when it comes to supporting women and low-income families, Hillary Clinton is the obvious choice. “Want to guess which political party is more effective at reducing poverty and unwanted pregnancies?” Sapp wrote. “I’ll give you a hint. It’s not the ‘pro-life’ Party that in this last Congressional session alone fought to cut medical care for poor mothers and children, food programs for kids, and contraception coverage and access for women.”Sapp isn’t alone among Christians in holding these views. Anti-abortion Christian blogger Shannon Dingle discussed her reasons for voting for Hillary Clinton in a article over the summer.Reducing the rate of abortions, she wrote, starts with addressing the “underlying causes” that lead women to choose the procedure, including poverty and lack of access to healthcare.Beyond abortion, she said, upholding the sanctity of life should include standing up for the lives of all those marginalized in our society ― including women, immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, and religious and racial minorities.“To me,” Dingle wrote, “being pro-life can’t just be about ensuring that babies are born without also affirming their value after birth through our words, actions, and policies.”Prominent Christian writer Rachel Held Evans published a blog shortly after Dingle’s expressing similar views and outlining her reasons for choosing the Clinton-Kaine ticket.“I believe the sacred personhood of an individual begins before birth and continues throughout life,” she wrote. “And I believe that sacred personhood is worth protecting, whether it’s tucked inside a womb, waiting on death row, fleeing Syria in search of a home, or playing beneath the shadow of an American drone.”For these Christians, choosing a pro-abortion rights ticket doesn’t represent a rejection of their religious convictions. On the contrary, they see Clinton and Kaine’s commitment to social justice and to upholding the lives of marginalized communities as precisely what it means to be “pro-life.”"

They came two days after Washington said it was suspending talks with Russia on trying to end the violence in Syria.The agreement on co-operation in nuclear and energy-related scientific research, signed in 2013, provided the legal framework necessary to expand work between U.S. and Russian nuclear research laboratories and institutes in nuclear technology and nonproliferation, among others.The uranium agreement, signed in 2010, provided for feasibility studies into the conversion of six Russian research reactors from dangerous highly enriched uranium to more secure low enriched uranium.“We can no longer trust Washington in such a sensitive area as the modernization and security of Russian nuclear facilities,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said.It said that should Russia decide on the feasibility of the conversion of any research reactors to low-enriched uranium, it will carry the work itself. But it warned the conversion may not be “an end in itself.”“In some cases, including in the production of medical isotopes, highly enriched uranium is the most effective and renouncing its would be technically and economically inexpedient,” the ministry said.The West imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014, followed by a pro-Russian insurrection in the east of the country. The breakdown of a ceasefire in Syria, where Russia backs government forces and the West supports rebel groups, has added to tensions.

One officer had mentioned a “blacklist”, he said.“As a Hong Kong person, I did not expect that even if I do not enter mainland China, I would be inside a foreign detention center, detained by other police. This is unbelievable,” he said.The protests that Wong helped lead in Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, presented Communist Party rulers in Beijing with one of their biggest political headaches in decades.Wong was given 80 hours of community service by a Hong Kong court in August on a charge of unlawful assembly for taking part in a sit-in at the height of the protests in the Asian financial hub.Thailand has been ruled by a junta since a 2014 coup which was widely condemned by the West. Since then, the generals running Thailand have forged closer ties with China.Thailand’s Nation newspaper quoted a deputy commander of airport immigration police, Colonel Pruthipong Prayoonsiri, as saying China had sent a request “to seek cooperation to deny” Wong entry.“As a result, the Immigration Bureau blacklisted him and held him for deportation,” Pruthipong was quoted as saying.But Pruthipong later told Reuters he had not spoken to the newspaper, did not know if Wong had been blacklisted and declined further comment.The Thai Foreign Ministry said in a statement permission for Wong to enter Thailand “involves various factors”.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Wong’s expulsion was a matter for China, not Thailand.“Why he was sent back is China’s issue,” Prayuth said.China’s Foreign Ministry, when asked about Wong’s detention, said it had “noticed the relevant reports”.“China respects Thailand’s exercise of immigration control according to the law,” it said in an email.‘LUCKY’Wong flew in to Bangkok just before midnight on Tuesday and arrived back in Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon.Suspicion of China’s involvement in his expulsion would add to concern in Hong Kong that mainland authorities are clamping down on dissent despite a “one country, two systems” formula, meant to preserve the city’s freedoms.Wong referred to the case of five Hong Kong booksellers, specializing in works critical of Chinese leaders, who disappeared only to emerge in custody in mainland China. One of them disappeared while in Thailand and is the only one still in detention.“I’m lucky I did not become the next person to disappear,” Wong said.Wong was denied entry by Malaysia in May 2015 when he was due to give talks on democracy in China.Wong was invited by the politics faculty at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University to speak on the 40th anniversary of a bloody crackdown by the Thai army on student protests.Human Rights Watch condemned Wong’s detention.“Thailand’s arrest of Joshua Wong ... sadly suggests that Bangkok is willing to do Beijing’s bidding,” its China director, Sophie Richardson, said in an email.A spokesman for the U.N. Human Rights Office in Asia said the prevention of Wong from attending the university talks “raises further concerns about restrictions on peaceful freedom of expression and assembly in Thailand”.Since Thailand’s 2014 coup, the military has clamped down on dissent and banned political protests. The Thursday anniversary of the 1976 crackdown on Bangkok student protests has stirred sensitive memories."

But Israel has a declared policy of responding militarily to any attack from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.Three Hamas training camps and a security complex were targeted in the air strikes and a passerby was hurt, witnesses said. The Israeli military blamed Hamas for the rocket.“Today’s (rocket) attack ... is the direct result of Hamas’s terror agenda in the Gaza Strip that encourages deliberate attacks against Israeli civilians,” spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner said in a statement.Hamas has observed a de facto ceasefire with Israel since 2014, when 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis were killed in a war over the territory. But small jihadist cells in the Gaza Strip occasionally fire rockets across the border.The Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the occupied West Bank along with the Gaza Strip. But U.S.-sponsored talks on a final peace agreement between the two sides have been frozen since 2014.Israel has also continued building settlements in the West Bank, in moves opposed by the United States, which says such moves damage prospects for a two-state solution.A previously unknown group in Gaza, “The Grandchildren of the Followers of the Prophet” said in a statement posted on several websites that it carried out the Sderot attack in the name of “oppressed brothers and sisters” under Israeli occupation.In Sderot, metal fragments and a small crater in a street marked the spot where the rocket exploded. The blast shattered windows in a nearby home and damaged a car.Shortly after the attack, Israeli tank shells struck a Hamas observation post near the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun. Local residents said there were no casualties.Several hours later, Israeli aircraft hit the training camps, in the southern and central parts of the Gaza Strip, as well as a security complex in the north, witnesses said.Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri issued a statement warning Israel against continuing what he termed its aggression. “Hamas stresses it can not keep silent if the escalation continues,” he said.Militants in the Gaza Strip last fired a rocket into Israel on Aug. 21, in an incident that also caused no casualties, and drew an Israeli air strike and tank shelling.Separately on Wednesday, the Israeli navy, which maintains a maritime blockade in the Mediterranean off the Gaza Strip to prevent munitions being smuggled in, stopped a yacht sailed by a dozen women hoping to reach Gaza and was towing it to the Israeli port of Ashdod, the military said.Male and female forces boarded the “Zaytouna-Olivia,” a small yacht which set sail from Barcelona last month. A military spokeswoman said no force was required to stop the vessel.Israel has stopped previous attempts to sail to Gaza and most people on board boats were deported after brief questioning.“In accordance with international law, the Israeli navy advised the vessel numerous times to change course prior to the action. Following their refusal, the navy visited and searched the vessel in international waters in order to prevent their intended breach of the lawful maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip,” a military statement said."

Mike Pence was skeptical of non-coercive torture methods during a 2008 Congressional hearing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f51d05170000e00aac99fe.jpeg?cache=nwiZmz9sUU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump horrified human rights defenders and the military’s top brass when he claimed during the primary that “torture works” and promised to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding” if he becomes commander in chief.Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) was brought on as Trump’s running mate in an effort to make the ticket more palatable to conservative voters who are repulsed by Trump’s extreme positions. But Pence’s past public comments leave little room for optimism. Statements he’s made about using torture against prisoners picked up on the battlefield suggest he would be unlikely to try to stop a President Trump from reinstating interrogation tactics that are now explicitly banned in the U.S.During a May 2008 congressional hearing on the use of torture ― in the second term of George W. Bush’s presidency ― Pence, then an Indiana congressman, dismissed the idea that non-coercive interrogation methods could be effective against suspected terrorists. He referred to the well-established practice of building relationships with suspects in order to extract information from them as “Oprah Winfrey methods” and suggested that, in some cases, the U.S. would justified in using harsher tactics, ThinkProgress reported at the time:“Some have said relationship-building interrogation techniques are preferable and even more reliable in the long run than stress methods. They raise the question though, what about the hard cases? Like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was a mastermind of this a September 11 attacks in this country. How would you respond to the observation that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed probably is not susceptible to relationship-building methods? I can tell by your grin that you acknowledge the somewhat absurd thought that you could move people who have masterminded the death of 3,000 Americans by Oprah Winfrey methods. How would you have sought, how do you think the United States should seek to gain information from a mastermind like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed if he refuses to answer questions voluntarily, when additional American lives could be on the line with information that he is refusing to provide?”In a later hearing in July, Pence said he understood that “torture is illegal, torture is banned by various provisions of the law.” But he also argued that had the U.S. granted Mohammed prisoner of war status ― which would have provided him with extra protections under the Geneva Conventions ― he “could not have been interrogated beyond his name, rank and serial number.”The argument over whether Mohammed and other detainees captured during the post-Sept. 11 “war on terror” should have been classified as prisoners of war or “unlawful enemy combatants” ― as the Bush administration ultimately decided ― is worth having. But it is separate from the question of whether or not it is ever acceptable to torture detainees, regardless of their legal status.In the years since the revelations about U.S.-government sanctioned torture in secret prisons, veteran interrogators have written extensively on their experiences, concluding that torturing prisoners doesn’t provide useful intelligence. It might get them to talk, but the information they provide will not necessarily be true. That makes sense: if a person is being tortured, it is only natural that they will say anything to make the pain stop.Pence’s 2008 comments predate much of the public discourse about the immorality and inefficacy of torture as an interrogation method ― but high-ranking military officials had already rejected the use of torture by that time.“Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy,” Gen. David Petraeus said in a 2007 memo to troops in Iraq. “That would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. Certainly, extreme physical action can make someone ‘talk;’ however, what the individual says may be of questionable value.”The U.S. has taken considerable measures to prevent the military or intelligence agencies from torturing prisoners again. President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning torture in 2009. And Congress, led by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), last year codified the Army Field Manual as the standard for interrogations, ostensibly providing more oversight over the methods used. Former CIA director Michael Hayden, who has defended coercive interrogation methods, said the agency would reject orders from Trump to waterboard prisoners. Despite Hayden’s prediction, it’s possible that a future president could wind back the progress the U.S. has made in rejecting torture ― which makes Pence’s past comments all the more disturbing.Torture was very much illegal when the Bush administration instituted it as policy. The Obama administration has opted against holding anyone accountable for the torture program, which human rights advocates say limits deterrence for future officials to take similar actions. Twenty-one of the 54 Republicans in the Senate voted against last year’s congressional effort to further outlaw the practice. And while adhering to the Army Field Manual for interrogation practices is a step in the right direction, there is still room for abuse within the techniques allowed by that guide.Perhaps most importantly, a March Reuters poll found that two-thirds of Americans still believe torture is justified as a way to get information from suspected terrorists.

One of the main problems faced by children is poverty. Chad, a crossing point between sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, is one of the poorest countries in the world.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f54d061b00000d0cef4c95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The world is failing impoverished kids. Although the rate of extreme poverty is declining worldwide, children are disproportionately impacted, according to two new reports.The number of people living in extreme poverty ― or on less than $1.90 a day ― has declined, per a report the World Bank released Sunday. In 2013, the year with the latest comprehensive data, 767 million people worldwide were living in extreme poverty, down from 881 million the previous year.However, among the world’s poorest, children are by far the worst-hit: Kids are more than twice as likely as adults to live in extreme poverty, according to a joint World Bank and UNICEF report released Tuesday. This report is based on data from 89 countries, representing 83 percent of the developing world. Although children make up one third of the population studied, they represent half of the extreme poor ― or almost 385 million kids worldwide. “Children are not only more likely to be living in extreme poverty; the effects of poverty are most damaging to children. They are the worst off of the worst off,” UNICEF executive director Anthony Lake said in a release. “This not only limits their futures, it drags down their societies.”The situation is most severe in sub-Saharan Africa, where almost half of children are surviving on less than $1.90 a day.And it may only get worse in the future: In 2013, sub-Saharan Africa was home to more than 50 percent of children worldwide living in extreme poverty, per the World Bank. By 2030, the year by which the United Nations has committed to eradicate extreme poverty worldwide, sub-Saharan Africa may account for almost 90 percent of extremely poor children, according to a report released in September by United Kingdom-based think tank the Overseas Development Institute.The World Bank-UNICEF report makes several recommendations to countries to help end extreme poverty among children. It suggests investing in social programs that target the poorest, including cash transfer programs that give money directly to families to help pay for food, healthcare and other necessities, and proposes prioritizing funding for education, clean water, health and other sectors that benefit poor children. “The sheer number of children in extreme poverty points to a real need to invest specifically in the early years—in services such as prenatal care, early childhood development programs, quality schooling,” the World Bank’s Ana Revenga said in a release. “Improving these services is the only way to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.”H/T The Guardian."

About 35 percent of kids who went to practitioners of what’s known as manipulative and body-based therapies such as chiropractic care or massage got flu vaccinations.In comparison, 43 percent of children who didn’t see these types of alternative medicine providers got vaccinated, researchers report in the journal Pediatrics.“Some complementary and alternative medicine practitioners have anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant viewpoints,” said lead study author William Bleser of Pennsylvania State University in State College.While the findings don’t prove alternative medicine providers discourage vaccination, these results suggest that it makes sense for pediatricians to ask parents whether their kids use these services to help shape discussions about vaccinations, Bleser added by email. “More and more patients are using complementary and alternative medicine and may be expecting their health professionals to guide them in making decisions about whether complementary and/or conventional approaches work better for disease treatment or prevention,” Bleser said, “yet most complementary and alternative medicine users do not disclose to their physicians that they use (these services).”To assess how use of different types of complementary and alternative medicine may influence the odds of vaccination, Bleser and colleagues examined data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey.Overall, about two-thirds of children in the study used at least one form of complementary or alternative medicine, including everything from yoga practice to taking daily multivitamins or following various popular diets, the study found.Excluding multivitamins or mineral supplements, however, only 17 percent of kids used complementary medicine. When kids did take multivitamins, they were more likely to get the flu vaccine than their peers that didn’t, the study found. About 45 percent of children using multivitamins got vaccinated, compared with 39 percent of other kids.One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on how recently or how often children visited alternative medicine providers, the authors note. They also lacked data on kids under age 4, a group that is at high risk for complications from influenza.Still, the results highlight the need for pediatricians to understand how parents view alternative medicine, said Linda Greene, a researcher at the University of Rochester Highland Hospital in New York and president-elect of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.“Most likely parents may have been influenced by the beliefs often consistent with alternate medicine,” Greene, who wasn’t involved with the study, said by email. “These beliefs may center on personal control of one’s health through healthy lifestyles rather than traditional medicine.”It’s also possible that parents who are more worried about the risks of vaccination may be more likely to seek out alternative medicine providers for their kids, noted Dr. Matthew Davis, a pediatrics researcher at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.“Respectful discussions with parents can sometimes lead to a change in their decision-making about vaccinations,” Davis, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.SOURCE: bit.ly/2cO1Iip Pediatrics, online October 3, 2016."

The fashion designer spoke to the Associated Press about the robbery that occurred at the Parisian hotel where Kardashian was staying for Paris Fashion Week.“[She is] too public, too public — we have to see in what time we live. You cannot display your wealth then be surprised that some people want to share it,” Lagerfeld said following his Chanel Paris Fashion Week showing. “I don’t understand why [Kardashian] was in a hotel with no security and things like this. If you are that famous and you put all your jewelry on the net, you go to hotels where nobody can come near to the room.” While Lagerfeld might be offering a warning now, he also shared words of love for Kardashian. Other celebrities offered their words of support, notably after social media users began joking about the incident. Kardashian was held at gunpoint by two “armed and masked” men who entered the residence and stole millions of dollars worth of jewelry from her. The reality star and mother of two feared for her life during the attack. “She begged for them to let her live and [said] she has babies at home,” a source told E! News. “Then they wrapped her mouth in tape and put her in the bathtub. She thought they were for sure going to kill her.”The 36-year-old was in the unit with her friend and stylist Simone Harouche at the time of the robbery. According to E!, Harouche was able to text Kardashian’s bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, for help. "

Please give me your jewelry.’ She does. And that’s not fraud. He wanted to get the jewelry ... He also believes that [her] friend had just loaned it for the evening, that she’s triple insured, that she won’t even lose any money because the publicity will be worth it. OK?”To be clear, Breyer is describing a scenario that didn’t happen. Nobody tried to pose as a jewelry cleaner during the actual Kardashian robbery, which all accounts suggest was a pretty traumatic experience. (Prior to Breyer’s comments Tuesday, some gross conspiracy theorists were already speculating that the whole thing was a hoax, even though there’s no reason to believe Kardashian’s account is false.)But Breyer is known for spinning lengthy hypothetical scenarios from the bench, and here he was clearly speaking in the realm of the theoretical ― all with an eye toward solving a textual legal question. (For context, here’s the hearing transcript.)The Supreme Court got off to a slow start on Tuesday in an unprecedented term that finds them one justice short ahead of the November election ― the first time that’s happened in nearly 150 years, according to one legal historian. So far, no major blockbuster cases have been added to the court’s docket, presumably due to the vacancy.Breyer, for his part, seemed honestly curious as to the proper reading of the federal bank fraud statute, which courts across the country have applied unevenly, requiring different kinds of proof from prosecutors in different circumstances.“What did this defendant have to know about this bank, if anything?” asked a puzzled Justice Anthony Kennedy, who alongside the rest of his colleagues spent nearly an hour trying to determine to what extent a financial institution has to suffer an actual loss before prosecutors can charge a scheming fraudster.Lawrence Shaw, the petitioner in the case, was convicted for defrauding not a bank, but an innocent victim from whose bank account Shaw illicitly transferred about $307,000. The bank itself never actually lost any money, but prosecutors nailed Shaw anyway under a broad reading of what it means to “defraud” a bank.For the Supreme Court, which has lately taken to reading some criminal statutes as narrowly as possible, the question could lead to a favorable ruling for Shaw, since he is more or less arguing that he never intended to defraud the bank itself ― even though there’s no question he took steps to steal from the actual victim.He’s urging the court to adopt a “defendant-friendly” definition that may rein in prosecutorial overreach ― a view that is supported by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, which filed a brief supporting Shaw’s position.The government, on the other hand, says it doesn’t have to prove that Shaw intended to cheat the bank of actual funds ― only that he intended to deprive it of something of value by using deceit.Which side has the better argument will be settled in the coming months, when the high court is expected to decide the case."

948,948,POLITICS,Female Trump Supporters Don't Really Care About His Sexism,Laura Bassett and Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-trump-supporter-trump_us_57f3fc10e4b04c71d6f06b7a,"“I don’t know that these comments preclude him running the country.""",2016-10-04," People jeer Hillary Clinton as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a rally at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi, Mich., on Sept. 30.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f41cdb1a0000de085b70d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NOVI, Mich. ― Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has done just about everything he can to alienate female voters: fat-shamed women, booted a mom with a crying baby out of his rally, made sexually suggestive comments about his own daughter and reportedly referred to a Latina Miss Universe as “Miss Housekeeping.” For the most part, it’s working. Hillary Clinton is walloping Trump among female voters, and Republican women with college degrees are defecting from the GOP in droves. But the women we spoke to at Trump’s rally outside Detroit last week ― a sampling of the 34 percent of female voters who still support him ― said his sexist comments don’t really bother them at all. “I like the fact he doesn’t appear to be partisan,” Karen Lane of Plymouth, Mich., told The Huffington Post. “He’s all-inclusive. He will offend everybody equally. He just seems genuine.”“I think people make mountains out of molehills,” Cindy Korol of Livonia, Mich., told HuffPost at the rally. “He may have said some things, but look at what [Clinton’s] done. She’s a liar. ... For him to call somebody ‘fat,’ big deal.”Trump has a long, storied history of body-shaming women. In 1996, when he owned the Miss Universe pageant, he reportedly called Venezuelan contestant Alicia Machado “Miss Piggy” because he thought she’d gained too much weight after winning the crown. He said in 2013 that celebrity Kim Kardashian had gotten “a little bit large” and shouldn’t dress like she’s 120 pounds. He speculated that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had “blood coming out of her wherever” when she was tough on him during a primary debate. And during last month’s presidential debate, he defended having called comedian Rosie O’Donnell “fat” and a “slob.” “Somebody who has been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell ― I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,” Trump said. Trump is now trailing Clinton in the polls among just about every demographic of women: women of color, unmarried women, married women and white women with college degrees. The only group of female voters leaning toward Trump is white women without college degrees, who favor Trump over Clinton by a comfortable margin of 52 percent to 40 percent. This group is apparently unmoved by Trump’s sexism. The women at his Detroit rally, for the most part, either assumed the media has taken Trump’s comments out of context or applauded him for being willing to speak his mind rather than rehearse every statement. “He’s upfront, he says it ― doesn’t need anybody prepping him,” said Cathleen Rondo of Whitmore Lake, Mich. “And I think he’s very transparent. He isn’t a phony. I think they take a lot of stuff out of context.”“You’re supposed to be skinny for a competition,” Christina Papahatzis, from Detroit, said of the Machado controversy. “I don’t care. I like his honesty.”Krista Alexander, of South Lyon, Mich., also applauded Trump’s candor. “They’re just words, and sometimes they get thrown out of context,” she said. “I think he’d be fair to women, pretty much.”Only one woman we spoke to at the rally, Marylynne Tice of White Lake, Mich., said Trump’s sexist rhetoric makes her “concerned with how he will be seen by the rest of the world.” But she’s still inclined to vote for him because “he’s a good businessman.” “I don’t know that these comments preclude him running the country,” she said.  Laura Bassett reported from Washington. Jonathan Cohn reported from Novi."

Good players ― great ones, even ― see their will tested every Sunday. Mental toughness is often more important than physical ability. And in the case of Odell Beckham Jr., we are finding out exactly why.In Beckham’s first two professional seasons with the New York Giants, it all came too easily. He burst onto the scene with that gravity-defying catch against archrival Dallas on “Sunday Night Football,” and went on to become a weekly one-man highlight reel for an otherwise hapless Giants team.In just 12 games as a rookie, the first-round pick from LSU amassed over 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns while earning Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. Then, last season, Beckham’s numbers improved across the board and he was recognized as a second-team All-Pro. In fact, no receiver in league history ― not even the spectacular Jerry Rice ― totaled more receiving yards through his first two seasons. Just last year, Beckham had 1,450 yards, while the rest of the Giant receivers had 1,405 combined.Naturally, 2016 was supposed to be yet another one for the record books for Beckham, with the Giants drafting Sterling Shepard to help No. 13 shoulder the load.At the quarter pole of the 2016 season, however, the 2-2 Giants have looked mostly anemic offensively, and Beckham has had a measly 22 catches for 303 yards and zero touchdowns ― the worst four-game stretch of his young career. He hasn’t found the end zone since Dec. 20, 2015. That’s five straight games played for Beckham without a touchdown, the longest streak of his career. In fact, prior to this stretch he had gone two games without a touchdown only once.But arguably more concerning is his behavior on the field and the sidelines. Long praised for his fiery personality, the mercurial Beckham has become a distraction.During a 24-10 Monday night loss to the Vikings ― a game in which he had a career-low 23 yards receiving ― he once again let his emotions get the best of him. Going back and forth with cornerback Xavier Rhodes, Beckham was hit with yet another unsportsmanlike penalty, an all too familiar pattern.“Nobody on another team bothers, upsets me,” he told reporters after the game.Of course, when we watch Beckham play, that hardly seems to be the case. Perhaps it all started during last year’s on-field debacle with then-Carolina Panthers All-Pro cornerback Josh Norman. Beckham was suspended for one game (thus ending the Giants’ playoff hopes) and the controversy spilled over into the offseason.“He has got to be aware,” quarterback Eli Manning said. “They’re looking for him, and he has got to play smart. We can’t afford to do anything. They’re going to call him, and he brought that on himself.”The hardest part when evaluating the 23-year-old Beckham is that he’s just so damn talented and passionate. You throw in his admirable work ethic, and there is no question that he can ― that he should ― go down as one of the all-time greats. While we can certainly make the argument that referees aren’t treating him fairly, we must also note that he isn’t exactly giving them a choice, either.There is a fine line between passion and overzealousness and Beckham has been toeing it all year. He talked incessantly about how “it is what it is” following Monday’s game. The harsh reality, though, is that “it is what it is” only because of Beckham’s petulant actions.“I just have to understand if I sneeze the wrong way, it’ll be a flag, it’ll be a fine,” Beckham said. “If I tie my shoe the wrong way, it might be a fine or a flag.”At their core, these statements sound like denial and stupidity from a player widely recognized as a thoughtful and brilliant young man. Surely, Monday night will not be the last time players attempt to throw Beckham off by baiting him and trying to get him thinking about anything but football. And surely the referees will keep an eye out for any little misstep he might make. Beckham needs to understand that he’s too talented and too valuable to continually fall into this trap: Causing brawls, as he did against the Rams in 2014. Fighting kicking nets, as he did last week. Getting suspended with the season hanging in the balance.Go back and look at the recent history of the truly great wide receivers in this league. Plenty of them were known hotheads with questionable on-field antics ― think Randy Moss, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens ― and yet for the most part they were able to put aside the emotional outbursts and play great football.

Plenty of them were known hotheads with questionable on-field antics ― think Randy Moss, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens ― and yet for the most part they were able to put aside the emotional outbursts and play great football. It’s time for Beckham to take accountability and turn this thing around before it spirals completely out of control.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

But as her days in jail drag on, national support for her continues to grow. Vigils, sit-ins, rallies and performances are being held across the country in Meadows’ name, calling for her to be released from the Trumbull County Juvenile Detention Center. Meadows was charged with aggravated murder in late July for shooting and killing her father, who had a long history of domestic violence, according to her and her family. A petition calling for her release had reached almost 13,000 signatures by Tuesday evening.Over 16 cities will be hosting events in solidarity with Meadows, according to the Free Bresha Meadows Campaign. The widespread support has helped Meadows, said her aunt Martina Latessa, who is a Cleveland police officer, but Meadows continues to have a difficult time keeping her spirits high in jail. The teen has been on and off of suicide watch, her aunt said. “She knows she has a lot of supporters because we tell her every time we see her,” Latessa said in an interview with The Huffington Post. “Usually when her court dates come up she gets all freaked out. She’s just really scared she’s going to spend the rest of her life in prison.”Much of the advocacy around freeing Meadows is rooted in efforts to end mass incarceration, especially of young black people, and in efforts to provide justice for victims of domestic abuse. Meadows is among the up to 10 million children in the United States who are exposed to domestic violence annually, and among the black children who are detained at a rate 4.5 times higher than white children.“Criminalizing Bresha in this context sends a harmful message to survivors and their children — that even in the most desperate of situations, they will be punished instead of helped,” the OrganizeFor petition reads.Experts say that children who experience domestic violence are more likely to have depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Meadows’ incarceration only adds to that emotional toll.Prior to shooting her father, Meadows had run away from home at least twice, and even reported the domestic abuse to the police. She told authorities that her father, 41-year-old Jonathan Meadows, threatened to kill her family and constantly beat her mother, Brandi Meadows, who filed a protective order against him in 2011. She later withdrew the order, as is common with domestic violence cases.“The United States incarcerates more children than any other country,” Nnennaya Amuchie, law fellow at Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, wrote in an open letter to prosecutors Tuesday. “Is this what justice looks like? Bresha should not be punished for surviving abuse. Bresha should not be punished for protecting herself and her family.”Meadows’ next hearing is scheduled for Thursday.Melissa Jeltsen contributed to this report."

History suggests that the Republican nominee will not be able to recover.The first presidential debate usually benefits the candidate who is running against the incumbent president’s party. In the 10 elections from 1976 through 2012, the challenger has risen in the national polls eight times, according to data compiled by FiveThirtyEight and HuffPost Pollster.That calculation is based on the straight average of polls conducted one week before the debate and one week after the debate.The two exceptions were Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992. Dukakis dropped by only 0.4 percentage points (and still lost the election).Clinton fell by 2.4 points, but his opponent, George H.W. Bush, dropped by 3, which gave the Democratic challenger a net gain. In addition, Clinton went into the debate with a nearly 13 point edge. Neither Dukakis nor Bill Clinton did as badly as Trump.Heading into their first meeting, Hillary Clinton led Trump by just 1.6 points. That narrow margin meant Trump had a chance to shift the race in his favor. Instead, he slumped by a significant 3 points. That tumble in the polls put Trump in an especially bad spot: History suggests that the candidate who is ahead in the polls after the first debate will end up winning the election. A week after their meeting, Clinton was ahead by nearly 5 points.The only recent exception to this trend occurred in 2012 when Mitt Romney gained a boost from the first debate and jumped into the lead. But his lead was just 1.5 points. All of this could overstate the effect of debates, period. They don’t usually shift the race by much. But when the race is close, as it was 1980 when Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by just 1.4 points, the first debate offers an opportunity to move voters. Reagan earned himself a 5-point boost ― and won that November.For Trump, that ship may have sailed. The HuffPost Pollster national chart, which aggregates public polls, finds him now trailing Clinton by 6 points ― 41 percent to 47 percent. And the HuffPost Pollster forecast model places Clinton’s odds of winning the presidency at 81.9 percent and Trump’s at 17.8 percent. Of course, something dramatic could still happen. But right now, Clinton looks to be on the path to victory. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

This summer alone, arguments broke out in the Senate over whether lawmakers should explicitly bar the indefinite detention of American citizens, provide additional protections for Afghan interpreters and require women to register for the draft.It was a lot of activity for a body that doesn’t get much done anymore. While they were at it, lawmakers also voted to authorize free rent for banks on American military bases. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act authored by Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) would exempt any commercial bank operating a branch at a U.S. military installation from the nuisance of having to pay for the real estate. Inhofe describes the legislation as an issue of fairness. Credit unions already get free rent on military bases ― why not banks?“This provision levels the playing field to give banks the same rent-free advantage as credit unions for being on a military base,” Inhofe spokeswoman Donelle Harder told The Huffington Post. “Ultimately, the Department of Defense in conjunction with the Services create the rules and regulations for what institutions can exist on military bases.”Lawmakers and regulators have been concerned about predatory financial activity targeting service members for years. The most persistent problems have come from payday lenders and shady title loan operators, but big banks often aren’t much better.Last week, regulators cracked down on Wells Fargo, which operates branches on eight different military bases, for allegedly illegally evicting active-duty service members and repossessing their cars without a court order. It came just after the bank caused a national outcry for creating roughly 2 million bogus banking accounts without permission from its customers. The bank has agreed to pay almost $210 million in combined penalties to settle the cases.In February 2015, Wells Fargo was one of five banks ― along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Ally Bank and Citibank ― that paid a combined $123 million for illegal foreclosures that violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. JPMorgan had already apologized for illegally overcharging 4,500 military families in 2011.The NDAA isn’t the government’s final say on the military budget. It merely authorizes spending, which has to be appropriated by another process in order for the money to actually go out the door. The real estate handout to banks could be blocked when lawmakers assemble an omnibus spending bill to avert a government shutdown in December. This story has been updated with comment from Inhofe spokeswoman Donelle Harder."
991,991,POLITICS,Here's What Polls Say About The VP Candidates,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-tim-kaine-vp-debate-polls_us_57f39a63e4b0703f7590c821,Mike Pence and Tim Kaine are even at the start line heading into Tuesday's VP debate.,2016-10-04,Voters are fairly undecided on both candidates as they set to debate on Tuesday night. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f39aad1a0000f3045b6d8b.jpeg?cache=pDl0VIeA9f&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) head into the vice presidential debate on Tuesday night, polls reveal that voters don’t know enough to have much of an opinion of either candidate. According to the HuffPost Pollster favorable rating chart, Pence has a net positive rating of 6 percent, with a 37/31 percent favorable/unfavorable score. A significant number of voters ― 32 percent― are undecided on how they feel about him.Clinton’s running mate is in a similar position. Polls show Kaine with a net favorable rating of just over 1 percent. His favorable/unfavorable rating sits at about 32/30 percent.Kaine is far more popular among constituents in his home state compared to Pence, however. A Morning Consult poll of Senatorial approval ratings conducted in September found 54 percent of Virginians approve of Kaine and about a quarter disapprove.Comparatively, a September Morning Consult poll of Gubernatorial approval ratings finds Pence with a 45/45 percent approval/disapproval rating among Indiana constituents. But heading into Tuesday night’s debate, a CNN poll released Tuesday morning shows both candidates are even at the start line: 39 percent of likely voters say Pence would do a better job and 39 percent believe Kaine would be better. Voter support is divided along party lines. This all begs the question if VP debates even matter. Vice presidential debates rarely attract high viewership, with the exception of the Joe Biden and Sarah Palin one in 2008. It’s likely that more people will form an opinion of both candidates after the debate, but studies show that VP debates rarely move the needle of an election. "

Dan Brady told The Orlando Sentinel. “It wasn’t a big explosion but was definitely enough to scare everyone who was in that cab of the train.”She sustained moderate burns to the right side of her face and was taken to Arnold Palmer Children’s Hospital for treatment, police said in a statement.Authorities believe the e-cigarette’s owner was also injured in the explosion but fled the scene with the other teens before they were notified of the incident at 3:30 p.m.Police said the device believed to be responsible for the explosion was stored in the rider’s pocket at the time.The train, which connects Universal Orlando park goers to Universal’s Island of Adventure theme park, was temporarily shut down, the Sentinel reported.Explosions caused by e-cigarettes are rare but the consequences can be severe.The reason behind this is the devices’ lithium-ion batteries, which can occasionally overheat, causing it to short circuit and catch fire, according to a Live Science report. Various online videos show users or their property being set on fire from their use. In some cases, the device has exploded in people’s mouths.Cellphone devices that use the same batteries have also been known to explode. In September, Samsung ordered a recall of their Galaxy Note 7 smartphones for this very reason. There have also been reports of iPhones catching fire and burning users."
1006,1006,POLITICS,Trump Gave 10 Times The Personal Max To Florida Attorney General,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-donations-charlie-crist_us_57f2e982e4b0703f75909bb3,"Trump's donations are part of what one expert called “secretly buying influence.""",2016-10-04,Donald Trump's campaign donations to Charlie Crist all appeared to come from separate companies. This list represents a number of them as they appeared in Florida state campaign finance databases.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f2f9171a0000de085b6c37.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect Florida’s expansive definition of an individual campaign donor, which can include an individual and that person’s businesses, so Trump’s contributions may have conformed to the law. An earlier version suggested the contributions may have exceeded the legal limit.Donald Trump used his various companies to donate 10 times the individual limit to Charlie Crist’s 2006 gubernatorial campaign, a Huffington Post review of state campaign finance records shows.The donations were all made on the same day through companies Trump owns. All told, Trump made nine contributions of $500 to Crist’s campaign on Aug. 25, 2005, for a total of $4,500. At the time, the maximum allowable donation in Florida from an individual or corporation was $500, a sum that Trump had already given Crist’s campaign as a personal donation in June of that year. Crist was attorney general of Florida at the time.HuffPost first reported on three of the nine companies last month, and has since identified an additional six Trump companies that made contributions that appeared to exceed the individual limit. While Trump’s donations to Crist were legal under Florida law, it still raised eyebrows among good government groups.“It’s pretty clear in this case that Trump was secretly buying influence without regard to the rules,” said Brendan Fischer, associate counsel at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center.Florida law defines “person” to include an individual, corporation, association, joint venture or company, so a person and that person’s entities each can contribute $500. Trump’s contributions masked his total giving, but don’t appear to violate state campaign finance laws in effect at the time.The donations reveal the previously unknown scale of Trump’s giving to attorneys general in Florida, a state where Trump has a variety of business interests and a long record of legal problems. They also show that Trump’s apparent disregard for the spirit of campaign finance disclosure extends to long before 2013, when his charitable foundation made a now-infamous $25,000 donation to the campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.According to Fischer, Trump may have violated disclosure requirements, “which exist so that voters can see who is supporting a candidate.”The newly discovered companies include Indian Hills Development; the Mar-A-Lago Club, Trump’s private club in Palm Beach; TIHT Commercial LLC, a holding company Trump registered at a non-existent office on Eighth Avenue in New York; 845 UN Limited Partnership, a company Trump used to develop a building in Manhattan in the 1990s; 220 Management Company, a holding company Trump operated for a building his father, Fred Trump, owned; and Trump International Golf Club LLC, a Trump golf course in West Palm Beach, 15 minutes from Mar-A-Lago. All but one of the companies appear on Trump’s financial disclosure form, an accounting of a candidate’s financial interests that is mandated by the Office of Government Ethics. At the time Trump made the donations, he had a number of major projects underway in Florida whose success or failure relied on a friendly state government.In 2004, a year before the donations, Trump had signed a secret deal with developers to license his name to the Trump Tower Tampa, a luxury high-rise. Three years after the deal, in 2007, the developers abandoned the plans and declared bankruptcy — but not before Trump and his partners had collected millions of dollars in down payments from people who thought they were buying a dream home in Florida. The tower was never built.As Trump was busy promoting the Tampa tower as “so spectacular that it will redefine both Tampa’s skyline and the market’s expectations of luxury,” he was also starting a new business venture, the Trump Institute, with Mike and Irene Milin. At the time, the Milins were already well known to state attorneys general for operating a series of get-rich-quick seminars across the country, and in 2001, Florida’s then-Attorney General Bob Butterworth forced the Milins and their company, National Grants Conferences, to sign an “Assurance of Voluntary Compliance,” a legal document assuring the state they would end their illegal marketing practices.In 2005, the Milins and Donald Trump teamed up to create the Trump Institute, a live version of the online real estate classes that Trump and his team had been offering for a few months. Trump was optimistic that the new live-action seminars could sell a lot more of Trump’s brand to people through his licensing agreement with the Milins.Eventually, the Trump Institute declared bankruptcy, and Trump’s own spin-off, Trump University, folded and was later sued by thousands of former students who allege fraudulent marketing.A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign declined to respond to questions from HuffPost Monday about the donations. Crist, a former Republican, has since become a Democrat and backed Trump’s rival, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. According to Fischer at the Campaign Legal Center, the fact that Trump gave so much money so far ahead of Crist’s actual 2006 election “suggests that Trump wanted something more immediate from Crist as attorney general, rather than necessarily backing Crist’s gubernatorial run.” Moreover, it does not appear that Trump was nearly as interested in the election of Crist’s successors in 2006 as he had been in supporting Crist’s burgeoning campaign for governor in 2005. According to campaign finance records, Trump donated an equal amount to each of the two candidates vying to succeed Crist in 2006, Bill McCollum and Skip Campbell, effectively hedging his bets on the outcome of the race. Trump has never made a secret of his willingness to leverage donations to political campaigns in order to further his business interests. During the Republican presidential primary, he bragged about how he used campaign contributions to sway politicians to back his interests. “When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,” Trump said.According to Fischer, “the reasons for buying influence in Florida are pretty clear in this instance. It’s clear that Trump had plenty of reasons to try to evade campaign regulations.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The two suspects, Scott Smith, 30, of Mount Vernon, New York, and Andrew Nappi, 31, of Eastchester, New York, were charged with first- and second-degree assault and released on bond.Bauer, a former Marine from the Baltimore suburb of Jessup, has been unconscious since the incident during the Ravens-Raiders game at M&T Bank Stadium.“We’re clinging to hope,” Susan Bauer, his sister, told the Baltimore Sun. “He’s still not responsive and not awake, and we don’t know the extent of his brain damage. The doctors said it was consistent with a major stroke.”According to a police report cited by the Sun, Nappi said an argument started, then Bauer threw a bottle at Smith’s head and Nappi punched Bauer in the face. Bauer’s wife, Sharon, said Smith pushed her husband to the ground where he hit his head. “Two individuals had become involved in a verbal altercation with our victim,” Lt. Jarron Jackson of Baltimore Police Department said in a CBS Baltimore news segment. “That verbal altercation became physical. And at some point, the victim was pushed on the ground where he struck his head.” CBS reported that the encounter may have been the result of a good deed by Bauer. His sister told the station that he let someone cut in line at a concession stand, which sparked an argument with the two suspects.“Here’s a man and a family that have been longtime season ticket holders, that know the people here that work in the building, that love the Ravens and have been to countless numbers of games at M&T Bank Stadium without incident,” Harbaugh said. “Then all of a sudden, there’s an incident where a gentleman is assaulted by somebody. That’s just not what we’re about. We’re a family. It’s a family atmosphere.”"

I will be in the Capitol in January as the Representative of the 74th District. Earlier this week, I reported a sexual assault to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department,” Walker wrote in a letter on Sept. 30. “I named my rapist as Steven Roberts Jr., who hopes to be in the Capitol in January as the Representative of the 77th District.”According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Walker, a 31-year-old Ferguson lawyer, wrote the letter to Republican Speaker of the House Todd Richardson, Minority Floor Leader Jake Hummel and Assistant Minority Floor Leader Gail McCann-Beatty. Walker asked the three not to swear Roberts in until the investigation into his alleged crimes is over. While Roberts has not been arrested or charged with a crime, the Post-Dispatch confirmed with two “highly placed law enforcement sources” that Roberts is being investigated.Both Walker and Roberts are black Democratic candidates who are running unopposed for seats in the Missouri legislature this November. Once sworn in, the two will be the only black lawyers in the overwhelmingly white and Republican legislature, according to CBS News. Walker told the Post-Dispatch’s Tony Messenger that she went over to Roberts apartment on Aug. 26 to discuss how they could work together in their new roles. She said she arrived at Roberts’ apartment around 9:30 pm and had two glasses of wine. Walker told the Post-Dispatch that she woke up the next morning in Roberts’ bed and remembers nothing after her second glass of wine.“I had no recollection of why I was still there,” she said.Although Walker has chosen to keep the details of the alleged assault private until the police report is made publicly available, she believes that Roberts assaulted her while she was asleep either on the night of Aug. 26 or the morning of Aug. 27. Read Walker’s letter, which the Post-Dispatch reprinted in full, to Richardson, Hummel and McCann-Beatty below. Walker told her husband what had happened the next morning, and filed a report with the police a few weeks later. “I felt a moral responsibility to speak out,” Walker told the Post-Dispatch. “The idea or the thought of me trying to just bury it is one I could not live with.”On Monday evening, Roberts released a full statement through his lawyer Scott Rosenblum. Roberts claims that Walker’s accusations are “completely and unequivocally false,” citing that the two had been “intimate” before that night in August. (Though to be clear, it is still possible to rape a person one has been “intimate” with beforehand.)Read his full statement below:Cora Faith Walker’s accusation is completely and unequivocally false.Walker denied Roberts claims, and responded with her own statement later Monday night. She told CBS’ St. Louis KMOX public radio that Roberts’ words are an example of “exactly why victims and survivors of sexual assault don’t come forward.” In her original letter to Richardson, Hummel and McCann-Beatty, Walker noted that she is “not the first woman to accuse Mr. Roberts of sexual assault.” In April 2015, a female college student accused Roberts of sexual assault and he was arrested on suspicion of second-degree sodomy. The then-27-year-old Roberts was not charged by prosecutors and was later released. Roberts attorneys at the time claimed the allegations were “unfounded.”In October 2015, Roberts was fired from his job as a St. Louis assistant circuit attorney. The office made a statement that Roberts was fired due to “poor performance.” On Saturday, Speaker of the House Todd Richardson released a statement in response to the claims made in Walker’s letter to CBS’ St. Louis KMOX public radio, writing that there will be a “zero tolerance policy for sexual assault.” “… The kind of conduct alleged cannot be tolerated in our state and will not be tolerated in the House of Representatives,” Richardson wrote. He added that while the House has no jurisdiction over non-members such as Roberts and Walker because they have not taken office yet, the House will “monitor” the investigation closely and “continue to have a zero tolerance policy for sexual assault, misconduct and harassment.”Missouri House Leaders Hummel and McCann-Beatty also released a joint statement, hinting that it might be better for Roberts to step down from his seat in the House of Representatives. “Cora Faith Walker has shown great courage in publicly seeking justice for the assault against her. It is vitally important for the legal system to diligently pursue this matter to an appropriate resolution,” the statement reads. “As the situation develops in the coming weeks, the accused must determine whether attempting to serve in the Missouri House of Representatives under these circumstances is in the best interests of himself, his family and his constituents.”As the Post-Dispatch’s Messenger described in a recent article, Walker’s accusations are just one part of a larger trend of inappropriate sexual conduct in Missouri politics.Messenger writes:The investigation, and the letter from Walker to Richardson, comes during a precarious time in Missouri’s capital city. Richardson took over leadership in the House after the former speaker, Rep. John Diehl, R-Town and Country, resigned in disgrace after sending salacious text messages to an intern. Sen. Paul LeVota, D-Independence, also resigned in 2015 after being accused of sexual harassment by interns. In 2016, after Richardson vowed to clean up the sexist culture of the Capitol, Rep. Don Gosen, R-Wildwood, resigned his position after admitting to an affair.Walker told the Post-Dispatch that she came forward with the hope of helping other victims of sexual assault. “The odds are against me. But I know what happened to me,” she said. “And I know I don’t want it to happen to anybody else. I don’t know what’s going to happen. But it’s OK to speak up. It’s OK to be afraid.”Need help?

In addition to the unique lights, one of his photos managed to capture gravity waves ― not to be confused with gravitational waves ― directly above the flashes as well. Steven Miller, an atmospheric researcher at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, confirmed the extremely faint lines ― which resemble ripples ― after looking at satellite images.Sprites, as magical as they may sound, are rare, massive but weak luminous flashes associated with thunderstorms, according to researchers at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Powerful lightning flashes trigger the sprites. The first photo evidence of sprites was snapped by accident in 1989, according to the Geophysical Institute’s website. The reason it took so long for them to be documented likely rests with how infrequently they show up and how difficult it is to capture them on film.Though it’s not impossible to see sprites with the naked eye, their flashes, which last for as long as just 10 milliseconds, appear at random and in only about 1 percent of lightning strikes. They also only appear above active thunderstorms, meaning the viewer must be at some kind of elevation or angle that allows them to see over the clouds, according to the Geophysical Institute. Lucena said it’s also possible to capture them if you’re far enough away from the storm, like he was.“Capturing sprites isn’t easy,” Lucena told HuffPost via email Monday. “You might go through your entire memory card and have nothing but stars, so it helps to have a little luck on your side also.”Lucena, however, apparently got extra lucky with his photo as it also shows gravity waves above the sprites.“You can see the ripples going through the sky that are caused by the gravity waves passing through,” Miller, the atmospheric scientist, told HuffPost Tuesday of Lucena’s photo. “They’re very faint. They almost look like stripes.”As Miller explained, gravity waves are the result of energy moving between the various layers of the Earth’s atmosphere. He said Lucena’s photo captures them above the mesosphere, which is the third highest layer of the Earth’s atmosphere. To put that into perspective, it’s directly above the troposphere (where humans live and most weather formation occur) and the stratosphere (where commercial jets fly).“At the top of the mesosphere, about 50-60 miles up, is this level of the atmosphere that’s glowing,” he said of the unique photograph.“A lot of energy gets released and it releases these gravity waves that propagate up and away from the storm,” he continued. “There’s actually a lot of heat being released by this hurricane. It’s like a big heat engine. ...It’s just an indicator of the power of this storm.”Though gravity waves “happen all the time,” Miller said, they’re not often photographed.“I haven’t seen many examples where somebody has been able to see them above a cyclone like this hurricane,” he said.Lucena shared some of his tips on how to photograph sprites. “You have to know where to aim the camera and you do that by either looking for the flashes of lightning in the distance or by checking the lightning maps [online],” he said.The skilled photographer, who said he’s been capturing the marvelous spectacles since 2010, said he sets his camera to continuous shooting so he’s able to capture the sprites just as they flash. In a YouTube video posted on Sept. 21 of another sprite sighting, Lucena shows what a difference speed makes while photographing a “jellyfish sprite” that appears at a regular speed and then slowed down.“You have to do test shots first using different settings to make sure you don’t over or under expose the night sky,” he said. “The lens is also important because you need a wide aperture to help capture the red.” In another video Lucena posted to YouTube in late August, he captures the illuminating effect of the bright red sprites’ light on the night sky.“I used a photo taken just 2 seconds before the sprite appeared to [create] this animation,” he said."

They desperately need help, Amnesty said. Out of the top 10 host countries, four are middle-income and six are low-income. In Lebanon, 70 percent of refugees live below the poverty line, according to the report.“By not doing their fair share, the wealthier countries in the world are further creating a problem,” Tarah Demant, a senior director at Amnesty USA, told The Huffington Post.Refugee resettlement needs to be more evenly spread out across the world, Amnesty said. This could be achieved by implementing a system that weighs criteria like wealth, population and unemployment to determine a host country’s resettlement quota.Using this mechanism, a country like New Zealand would be asked to take in 3,466 people ― by no means an exorbitant number.The European Union did attempt to introduce a similar system on a small scale last year. Several countries, like Slovenia and France, are making good on their commitments and resettling a number of refugees who’d arrived in Greece and Italy. Others are pushing back.“Ultimately, any initiative that looks towards more responsibility sharing is a step in the right direction, but they’re absolutely not enough,” Demant said. “The refugee crisis is not inevitable. We don’t have to have millions of people forced to survive. It is not an inevitable consequence of human history, but we won’t be able to do it without wealthier countries doing their fair share.”There’s a wide range of reasons for countries to resist taking in more refugees. Some, like the United States, employ stringent vetting processes. It takes 18 to 24 months to perform security checks on refugees who have been cleared for resettlement in America. Increasing the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. ― which happened this year ― requires major additional funding.And then there are countries like Serbia or Hungary, where ultra-conservative nationalist movements are gaining ground. In a referendum on Sunday, 90 percent of Hungarian voters sided with the government and overwhelmingly rejected the EU’s proposed refugee resettlement plan for the country. (Turnout was too low for the vote to count, however.) Meanwhile, Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić hinted that the country would close its borders if people continued coming in.None of this seems to be deterring people who are fleeing violence and war. In 2015, more than 1 million refugees made the precarious sea voyage to Europe, Amnesty said. And NGOs and coast guard ships continue to rescue thousands of people on a daily basis. More than 5,600 people fled the coast of Libya on Monday alone, according to Doctors Without Borders.Read Amnesty International’s full report here."

The aim is to pack a ship with experiments from nations that can’t afford their own space programs.The idea is to enlist minds all over the world to help solve critical global problems.For instance, UNOOSA is looking for proposals on anything from studying climate change and food security to inventing materials that won’t build up corrosion in space, Simonetta Di Pippo, the director of UNOOSA, told the tech blog Motherboard.“We have the vision of bringing the benefits of space to humankind, and that means helping developing countries access space technologies and their benefits,” Di Pippo told the outlet.The vessel the UN will launch into low-Earth orbit, which is about 90 to 600 miles above the earth, for a 14-day flight is appropriately named “Dream Chaser.” It’s a reusable spacecraft created by the Sierra Nevada Corporation, a technology company that specializes in aerospace and aviation, that can enter orbit and land at an ordinary airport, according to a release by the UN.This is because the Dream Chaser is “about the size of a regional jet,” Mark Sirangelo, the head of SNC’s space division, told NPR’s “The Two-Way.” He also said that it could fit about 20 to 25 laboratory stations.“Instead of countries having to purchase a single mission, they could be a part of a collaboration with many countries on board,” Sirangelo told the radio show.UNOOSA will look at proposals over the next year and participants will be selected in 2018. The program is open to all UN member states, but priority will be given to nations that lack the financial resources to develop space programs on their own.Sirangelo told NPR that he hopes that experiments and studies conducted on Dream Chaser will also help unite nations.“One of the really interesting things about space is that despite all the turmoil that we see on Earth, and the geopolitical issues that go between all our countries, space is a place where we have collaborated and cooperated on the International Space Station,” he said, noting the station is only available to the nations that helped build it.“We think this might be an extension of that.”"

It is a way to showcase commonalities between the Muslim communities that exist in all regions of the world,” said Mohammed Al Asad, a member of the Award’s steering committee. “Of course there are tensions in Europe between the immigrant and host populations. This project is unique because it brings together all the different ... communities,” he said.The six winners were chosen from 348 projects in 69 countries nominated for the award, and were announced in a ceremony in the renovated 19th century Jahili fort in the United Arab Emirates.The winners were chosen by an independent jury of architectural experts appointed by the Aga Khan Foundation, named after the wealthy leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi’ite Islam.The award money will be split between the architecture firms and clients involved in the winning projects and will partly go toward outreach activities to spread design and building knowledge. The mosque in a poor and flood-prone area of Bangladesh won recognition for pushing the boundaries of what a traditional religious space should look like, Award Director Farrokh Derakhshani said.Local children are encouraged to play on the building’s bare modernist space, unusual for a mosque, as shifting sunlight splashes patterns onto the dark interior floor.The 2016 Aga Khan Award for Architecture winners:BANGLADESH - Bait Ur Rouf Mosque, Friendship CentreCHINA - Hutong Children’s Library & Art CentreDENMARK - SuperkilenIRAN - Tabiat Pedestrian BridgeLEBANON - Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs(Editing by William Maclean and Susan Fenton)"

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that the Russian air force would continue to support Syrian government troops and that what he called the “war on terror” would continue.Zeid, a former Security Council president, was not advocating abolishing the veto, but lifting it for very serious cases of international crimes, his spokesman Rupert Colville said.“Look at Aleppo, look what’s happening. I think you will never have a more compelling case for something serious, action to be taken,” Colville told a U.N. briefing.Russia is highly unlikely to accept any constraint on its U.N. veto power, which together with its military involvement on the side of President Bashar al-Assad has given it formidable leverage in the Syria crisis, frustrating the United States.BANNED BY TREATYZeid said that dropping indiscriminate incendiary weapons in heavily populated areas was particularly concerning, as well as being banned by a treaty that Russia is bound by.He compared Aleppo to the World War Two battles of Warsaw, Stalingrad and Dresden, and said calling the enemy a “terrorist organization” was not an excuse to ignore the laws of war.The rebels’ use of inaccurate “hell-fire cannons,” homemade mortars that fire gas cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel, was also totally unacceptable, he said.World Health Organization spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said that between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2, 342 people had been killed in eastern Aleppo, including 106 children, and 1,129 had been wounded, including 261 children.Those figures were based on reports from functioning health centers and the true figures were probably much higher, she said.“As of yesterday, we have now only six partially functional hospitals that are in service, only one hospital that offers trauma care services,” Chaib told the briefing.WHO still hopes to be able to evacuate dozens of wounded and chronically ill from Aleppo, she said. “We are preparing plans, we are in contact with several hospitals inside and outside the country, but unless there is security and access we cannot move.”The Syrian government has yet to respond to a U.N. plan for aid convoys in Syria during the month of October, U.N. spokesman Jens Laerke said, noting that the last “cross line” convoy was on Sept. 25."

For example, they might know which presidential candidate wants us to increase refugee intake and which vehemently opposes welcoming more into the country. They’re also probably aware of the current Syrian refugee crisis, that a team of refugees competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and they have probably formed an opinion on what the United States should or shouldn’t do to help.Seldom heard in the conversation surrounding refugee issues, however, are intimate descriptions of what life is like for a single person displaced from their home country due to persecution or conflict. It’s far too easy to think of “refugees” as a mass, as a series of numbers, statistics or policies.How does a journalist find these personal stories? And how do the stories reach an audience? Sarah Glidden tackles these questions in a book of comics journalism that chronicles her 2010 trip to Turkey, Iraq and Syria, Rolling Blackouts. In it, she travels alongside a group of journalists and an Iraq War veteran to see how reporting works firsthand ― how sources are located, how stories unfold.Along the way, Glidden meets with people who have had to leave their homes for various reasons. One couple left to avoid prison time for publishing things not approved by the Iranian government. Another girl, who left Iraq with her family after violence against Christians rose in her region, is shown waiting for hours for bimonthly food rations in Syria, at the time a place of refuge for Iraqis. The phrase “comics journalism” may baffle some. How do narrative drawings and reporting intersect? Can the time-consuming process of formatting, drawing, inking and coloring match the quick pace of news? Rolling Blackouts shows just how the genre can work. Because the refugee crisis is ongoing, hardly tied to one particular era in time, a slow and steady approach to understanding the fallout seems apt. A book-length work allows the nuances of a long-simmering issue to come through. “For my kind of comics journalism, I think that it’s good for kind of slowing stories down and really letting readers form a connection with the person who I’m talking to. Or, in the case of this book, who the reporters are talking to,” Glidden said in a phone conversation with The Huffington Post. And literally painting a picture for readers allows for immersion in the story. Geometric cityscapes and rolling landscapes are aspects lost when an experience is only conveyed in words. Glidden’s tableaux pack in the kind of intimacy and sensory information that is missing from more traditional forms of information sharing. “Maybe some people ― who might look over, or pass over, a book on meta-journalism and on refugee issues ― might take a second look at something that’s in comic form,” Glidden added.An Iraqi Kurdish man named Sam Malkandi is a standout “character” in Glidden’s narrative. Malkandi had immigrated to the United States and established a comfortable life in Seattle, until a chance encounter at a mall inadvertently led to his deportation back to Iraq. The father had to leave his wife and children behind — he mentions that his daughter is graduating from the University of Washington — and now lives with his own elderly father. Despite those hardships, he shows up in Glidden’s work as affable and welcoming.“I hope that someone learning about him through this comic will maybe not only get interested in his story and want to find out more, but also feel like they know someone from Iraqi Kurdistan now,” Glidden said, “that when they hear ‘Kurds’ or ‘Iraqi Kurdistan’ or ‘KRG’ in the news, they’ll connect it back to this man that they got to know.” Glidden makes sure to distinguish this work from her previous one, How to Understand Israel in 60 Days Or Less, a memoir. She began as a comics artist in this vein, she said, after being exposed to works like Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, Art Spiegelman’s Maus and Joe Sacco’s Palestine. Glidden was also inspired after seeing James Kochalka’s American Elf series, which was “just about the quotidian details of his life, and that was something that seemed accessible.”Following a trip to Israel for her first book, Glidden found herself thinking about a potential reported project. “I started really getting into the research aspects of it and trying to look at different sides of a political issue, and that’s when I started thinking like, OK, maybe I can do work that moves in that direction.” She was working on that book when she met the journalists featured in Rolling Blackouts. “I was working in comics, and at the same time talking to them about their experiences as journalists and getting more interested in finding out about how they work.” She’s still present in this second book, but more in a minor way. “I guess I’m coming from the school of journalism where you don’t really believe in objectivity,” Glidden said. “Part of the reason I like comics journalism is that, by drawing, you’re kind of showing with every single panel that it is subjective. Somebody not only witnessed all of this stuff, but somebody drew it. I hope that the medium of comics itself reinforces that idea, that, hey, remember, somebody is telling you this story. Somebody is choosing what’s important.”When it’s put this way, the line between memoir and journalism becomes blurrier; it’s all about storytelling, in the end. The fact that Glidden’s book tells not only the story of this trip but also the nuts and bolts of how a story comes into being heightens its longevity and relevance. “Our lives aren’t narrative. Our lives are these very complex collections of moments, but when we’re remembering something or telling a story to someone else, we’re constructing a narrative out of our lives,” she said. “As a journalist, you’re listening to someone’s narrative and then constructing a new, different narrative out of that narrative.”The group in Rolling Blackouts travels through the Middle East, eventually ending up in Damascus, Syria. There, the complications and lasting effects of the war are laid bare. In one scene, a contact tells the war veteran, Dan, “It’s a crime! You’ve done the biggest crime in the world.” A page later, the same man pats Dan’s back, reassuring him that it’s OK, that he understands what it’s like to be a soldier. There are tense, unflinching moments like these, and also lighthearted ones, when Sarah joins the other journalists at an impromptu dance party at an Iraqi artist couple’s house. As Glidden said, lives aren’t narrative. Instead of telling a single story with rising and falling action, Rolling Blackouts offers a glimpse into many lives affected by a major war, with highs and lows throughout. The book tackles heavy subjects: the U.S. invasion of Iraq and how we should help refugees from a conflict we’ve created. There are big questions at the heart of it ― questions asked by some of the individuals they meet that the journalists cannot answer. “I think we can focus now on, ‘This happened. And what are we going to do about it?’” Glidden said. “As Sarah [the journalist] says in the book, our generation is inheriting this tragic war that happened, and that is still ongoing. The fallout from that extends to not just Iraq but to Syria, and to Libya, and to all these other places.”“Right now, we hear about Syrian refugees a lot, and we hear politicians saying ridiculous things like, ‘We don’t know who these people are,’ ‘They’re not vetted,’” said Glidden. “I know now, from talking to refugees themselves, or people who are working with refugees and NGOs and from the United Nations, that this is a huge distortion of the truth ... I think it’s important to know just how complicated it is to be a refugee and how rare resettlement is.”Glidden’s final section, “Home,” offers an epilogue of sorts, showing what became of the articles researched while abroad, the cover story about Dan’s return to Iraq as a civilian, her own first forays into comics journalism. It’s a stark reminder that the problems presented in the bulk of the book haven’t ended with the last page; in some ways, they have grown and evolved. Even though she chronicles a trip taken nearly six years ago, Glidden’s work feels as it could fit in among 2016’s headlines, urgent and compelling.Sarah Glidden will be on tour in the United States and Canada this fall. Rolling Blackouts is out now."

Women were forced to hide themselves from the world: Their bodies, cloaked in billowing black fabric. Their hands, encased in gloves. Their eyes, lowered, or hidden entirely under a black face veil. Their voices, muted. School was out of the question for girls. And no woman was to leave the house without a male guardian. That all changed just over a month ago, when Iraqi forces successfully drove the extremist fighters out of Qayyarah.“We had no freedom,” recalled Umm Tarek, an outspoken middle-aged mother of 10, as she stood outside a small, bustling medical center. “We didn’t want ISIS, but what could we do?”The hardliners are still nearby, just one town over ― but the men, and perhaps most dramatically, women, here are reclaiming their lives just the same. At least some of these women now seem to speak freely and from the heart about their lives under ISIS. When interacting with a reporter inside the town’s medical center, one group of women loudly shared a flurry of damning testimony, erupting into laughter at the commotion they caused. There was no holding back.“ISIS brought us back to the olden days,” said Hind, a 22-year-old nurse wearing a bright pink headscarf. “Now, you’ll find a generation without education.”Her energy filled up a tiny room packed with female nurses, patients and an Iraqi official who kept urging The WorldPost to leave, later citing security reasons. The women ignored him and only talked louder and over one another, eager to tell their stories.Some schools here ― previously replaced by so-called Islamic educational courses, which were filled with violent ISIS propaganda ― will soon be reopened, at least the ones that weren’t destroyed in airstrikes. That can’t come soon enough.But the schools still need books, salaries for teachers and backing from organizations who can help them rebuild their curriculum, says Hussain Ali Hachim, the mayor of Mosul, the district in which Qayyarah is located. Some youngsters who haven’t been to school in over two years almost inevitably don’t know how to read or write, let alone do math or science.One shy 6-year-old girl beamed when asked what she loved most about school. “Studying!” she answered, her unabashed joy shining bright even as thick black smoke clogged the air around her. Oil wells lit ablaze by ISIS in their retreat still burn ferociously, months later. But this smoke ― an ever-present reminder of ISIS’s scorched earth tactics ― doesn’t keep young boys and girls from walking the streets, hand in hand, giggling and goofing off. For years, children were cooped up inside while others trained to be child soldiers. Not anymore.Their mothers, too, are celebrating newfound freedom. Getting dressed in the morning is no longer a dreaded act. It’s a chance to express themselves, to take back control of their own bodies. “If Daesh saw my eyes, they would force my family to pay 100,000 Iraqi dinar,” boomed Hind, using the local name for ISIS. The amount is equal to about $86. Hind went on to say the militants fired her as a nurse after she challenged them. “How could I work with my eyes covered? We cannot see!”Inside the town’s health center, none of the women interviewed by The WorldPost donned the stereotypical garb seen in ISIS-controlled areas. Instead, there were leopard-print headscarves, bedazzled dresses and white lab coats worn by confident medical professionals tending to those in need.Under ISIS, women were often forced to give birth at home, according to locals, for lack of ISIS-approved female nurses to tend to them. Male doctors were not allowed to treat women, no matter the severity of their condition. In camps for internally displaced people, too, women who fled places like Qayyarah and neighboring towns rejoice in wearing colors again. Reds, oranges, yellows, greens ― all banned under ISIS for being too provocative.“If they saw those colors, they might kill you,” said Marwa, magenta and blue-colored bejeweled bracelets jingling on her wrists. She would have been in tenth grade if ISIS hadn’t forced her out of school. Gone are the days when wearing the wrong outfit could mean a hefty fine ― impossible to pay for many cash-strapped families ― or worse. Jail time and lashings are commonplace in ISIS-held territory for transgressions as minor as smoking cigarettes, watching television, playing soccer or ― for men ― sporting a close-shaven face instead of a beard.For crimes ISIS deemed most egregious, grisly executions are filmed and edited into widely disseminated propaganda videos.The hardline fighters turned one Qayyarah home into a prison, its second story transformed into a nightmarish space filled with cramped, filthy, windowless cells. Taped onto one cell door was a list of names ― the unfortunate souls previously locked inside.Another woman, Amal, shook her head angrily, recalling the group’s twisted, violent version of Islam that emboldened ISIS to enforce a strict lifestyle largely foreign to this town’s mainly Sunni Muslim residents.“It’s not right,” she said. “This is not in Islam.”While local women say life was hellish under ISIS, it was the Yazidi women and girls who suffered the unimaginable. Fighters kept members of the religious minority, whom they deem heretical, as sex slaves in Qayyarah, as they do across other parts of Iraq and Syria. The militant group overran Mount Sinjar in August 2014, massacring thousands and taking thousands more hostage as slaves, child soldiers and human shields.Hind says she recalls seeing a pregnant Yazidi woman bleeding badly between her legs. She managed to help her get medical attention, at least temporarily saving her life. But Hind never saw her again.She was likely among the other Yazidi women dragged off by ISIS when the group retreated. As far as the locals can tell, no Yazidis were left behind. They’re far too valuable, sometimes earning thousands of dollars each when sold off to other men, or released back to their families for steep ransom payments. Control of Qayyarah was tight ― the extremists fearing losing citizens of its “caliphate.” Yet some Qayyarah residents who were bold, desperate or wealthy enough paid smugglers $200-500 per person to escape and made their way to already-packed refugee camps in Iraqi Kurdistan.More than 3.3 million Iraqis have been displaced since ISIS took control of large swaths of Iraq in 2014. Experts believe that number will likely swell, potentially driving at least another 1.5 million men, women and children to flee once the U.S.-backed battle for Mosul begins. That massively coordinated, complicated and likely messy operation,― complete with Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga, Shiite militias and other groups taking part ― could begin as soon as this month. The World Food Programme distributed a month’s worth of emergency food aid in early September to some 30,000 people in the Qayyarah area, who, according to WFP Country Director Sally Haydock, were suffering “extreme hunger with scarce access to food supplies.” It was the first time aid groups could reach civilians there since June 2014.ISIS gained momentum in 2014 largely due to Sunni grievances against then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s Shiite-led government, slammed as authoritarian and brutally sectarian by many Sunnis.But that support waned as the months dragged on and the group’s brutality outweighed hope that ISIS could offer locals a better future.Tensions are still high Qayyarah, where Iraqi security forces are rounding up those who they say are suspected ISIS supporters.Security forces recently detained 65 Qayyarah residents, including several women and young boys, on suspicion of supporting ISIS, according to one Iraqi official who asked not to be named. Human rights groups have raised the alarm over Iraqi forces detaining and reportedly killing Sunni Arab locals and barring others from returning home.Much of the town remains damaged or looted, and residents still cannot easily leave in search of supplies. Some neighboring villages are entirely abandoned, with front doors left eerily ajar. ISIS-dug trenches and burnt out cars line the road leading into Qayyarah, where, up until recently, improvised explosive devices dotted the earth. But the dire situation doesn’t stop Umm Tarek from embracing her newfound sense of agency. “Now, we are free,” she said, grinning widely. And with that, she lifted her arms to show off her dress, the colorful beads twinkling in the afternoon light. Kamiran Sadoun contributed reporting from Qayyarah."

Last week, the University of North Texas presented a scholarship to 8-year-old Jordin Phipps after an adorable video featuring the girl went viral. In the footage, the girl wears a UNT shirt and recites a motivational mantra she learned at her elementary school. “I will start my day in a positive way! I will be respectful with the words that I say,” Phipps, a third-grader at Watson Technology Center in Garland, Texas, proudly exclaims. “I will pay attention and I will do my best and I will study hard for every test!” See the rest of her mantra below:The clip, which Phipps’ mother, Nichole Smith, shared with the university on Facebook earlier in September, attracted the attention of UNT President Neal Smatresk, reported local news outlet the Denton Record-Chronicle. UNT ended up giving Phipps the President’s Award for Excellence in Leadership, which came with a $10,000 scholarship, and guaranteed her admission to the college’s class of 2030. The admission makes Phipps the youngest person to ever be accepted to the university, ABC News noted.“To have a student like Jordin who is already dedicated to her education — she talks about being a good citizen and having the spirit of a North Texas Eagle — she’s a student you want to meet,” Rebecca Lothringer, executive director of UNT’s undergraduate admissions, told the Denton Record-Chronicle. Representatives from the university surprised Phipps, whose mother is a UNT alumna, during an assembly at her elementary school on Sept. 29. During the event, cheerleaders from the college performed and took pictures with Phipps. She also received a giant check. “Jordin was completely stunned and seemed to be in shock,” Tanya O’Neil, communication specialist at UNT, told The Huffington Post of the girl’s reaction to the big reveal. “You could tell she was just a happy kid and loved it all, but was absolutely overwhelmed. It was a blast!”Smith said she’s ecstatic over her daughter’s acceptance to her alma mater. Phipps, who looks up to her mother, is excited about the news, too. “She said, ‘My mommy went there and I’m going to go,’” Smith told ABC News of her daughter’s wish to attend UNT. "

Organizers selected 45 artists ― half local, half not ― to paint business owners’ walls, and invited the public to come out and watch. “People are just enamored with what we’re doing, it’s not real to them,” painter Sydney G. James said about the spectators. “Even though it’s outdoors and it’s a public space, we’re inviting them into our world by letting them watch us work, so it’s an intimate public situation.”The completed murals are eclectic, ranging from bright, abstract designs to politically-charged paintings, like James’ piece “Appropriated Not Appreciated.” A condemnation of police shootings of African-Americans, she hopes it startles people who pass it.“When you look at the mural, I want you to be bothered,” she said. “I want you to be shocked, because I think it is shocking, but I want you to be educated at the same time.”Other muralists made mixed-media collages or painted upbeat slogans. Some drew on Detroit’s rich cultural history, paying homage to musicians like J Dilla and John Lee Hooker. Nicole Macdonald’s series of portraits of local legends celebrate Black Bottom, a historic African-American neighborhood and arts district in the city that was paved over in the 1960s.You can’t go far in any major city without stumbling over some street art, and Detroit is far from the first place to hold a mural festival. Festival director Roula David, who lives in Eastern Market, believes their project stands apart because of its investment and roots in the community.That’s an important distinction in Detroit as more and more money pours into neighborhoods like Eastern Market, and artists worry about displacement and turn a critical eye to outsiders.“Public art can be a gentrifying force,” David said. “So we’re really sensitive, we’re really careful in how we’re approaching public art in the market … doing it in a way that’s significant for the community as opposed to just putting pretty things on pretty buildings.”See more of the work created for Murals in the Market below._____Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.

In reality, he took over his father's $200 million empire in 1974.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f2ee6f170000f70aac92fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As he loves to do whenever he talks about himself, Donald Trump on Monday told a Colorado audience that all his business success stemmed from “a small loan” from his father ― a virtual Horatio Alger story.Which would be true ― if, instead of rags-to-riches tales, Alger had written about people who start with massive fortunes and then whittle them away.Because as rich as the Republican presidential nominee is, his stewardship of the $200 million real estate empire he took control of four decades ago has failed to keep pace with either the general real estate market or the economy as a whole.Trump has frequently put a dollar amount on the “small loan” he mentioned Monday: $1 million. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton got under his skin at the first presidential debate last week by using the figure $14 million.Either number misses a key point. The loan had little to do with the main source of Trump’s wealth, which was the real estate and construction company his father had built over a number of decades.Trump took over running that company in 1974, at age 28, when it was worth approximately $200 million, according to a contemporaneous New York Times article. The vast majority of Trump’s wealth today flows from that initial nest egg, which he and his four siblings eventually inherited when their father died in 1999.What’s more, given the size of that original fortune, Trump has actually underperformed both the stock market as well as the real estate market.Had Trump taken his share of what would become his father’s inheritance and put it into an index fund matching the S&P 500 back in 1974, it would have been worth $3 billion today. Had he put the $200 million that Fortune magazine determined he was worth in 1982 into that same index fund, he would be worth more than $8 billion today.And had that $200 million gone into the broad real estate market, it would be worth more than $20 billion today.Trump claims he is worth more than $10 billion, but independent analyses have put the figure at less than half that. Two banks that appraised his net worth a decade ago came up with values of $788 million and $1.2 billion. And journalist Timothy L. O’Brien, author of TrumpNation, said sources within Trump’s company a dozen years ago told him Trump was worth between $150 million and $250 million ― at a time Trump was claiming a net worth of $6 billion. (Trump sued O’Brien over the book for defamation and lost.)Whatever the precise number, the source of Trump’s wealth, the uncertainty of his current net worth, the recent revelation that he declared $916 million in tax losses in 1995, and his refusal to release his tax returns could eat away at the image he has peddled of himself as a successful multi-billionaire.Of course, if Americans are looking for an actual self-made multi-billionaire, there is one. Warren Buffett was worth about $40 million in 1974. He’s worth about $70 billion today ― at least 14 times Trump’s net worth.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

A grim headline conveying an all too familiar injustice, an accompanying image that’s evocative or exploitative or both. Facts fade into the background as a single, haunting particular ― a garment of clothing, a final plea for life, a bag of candy ― becomes more in itself than a single brain can digest. The experience of looking at artist Lorna Simpson’s most recent multimedia series, made from India ink and screen print on claybord, echoes the experience of encountering current events in print. Found images are deconstructed and fragmented to isolate a single detail ― a polka-dotted dress or a pair of clasped hands ― their symbolism ambiguous and significance palpable. Text is scrapped in favor of haunting washes of black ink, impeding like a dark, clawing shadow. In Simpson’s “Polka Dot & Bullet Holes #2, 2016,” a bifurcated image juxtaposes a woman’s polka-dot dress with a constellation of bullet holes. The circular fissures serve as bleak foils to the stylish garment, the stark contrast of expressing one’s identity and losing it, swiftly and utterly. The austerity of the print only makes it more unnerving; the discomfort of knowing something is a symbol without knowing what it symbolizes. It’s the eeriness of a dress spotted on the side of the road, its wearer nowhere to be seen. Simpson, who was born in Brooklyn and works there today, has employed a variety of media including photography, video, collage and painting to explore the relationship between image and identity, especially as it relates to race and gender. One of her most iconic photography series, 1989’s “Necklines,” depicts tightly cropped photos of black women’s necks, punctuated by a white collar. The images are reminiscent of elegant perfume ads, disembodied and cut short. Beneath the images, words like “neckline,” “necking,” “necklace” and “breakneck” suggest beauty, love and violence simultaneously. For her most recent exhibition at Salon 94, Simpson excerpts images from old issues of Ebony and Jet magazines, along with Associated Press photos from the 1930s to 1970s, to confront contemporary issues of racism and police brutality. The fragmented ads and news clippings become, through Simpson’s hand, incorporeal symbols, addressing pain and exasperation that is as relevant today as it was in the ‘60s. Amplifying the screen-printed photos with ink and paint, Simpson conjures the excruciating numbness that results from an endless onslaught of gross injustice.Simpson’s serialized, monochromatic works read like pages in a newspaper that stretch throughout time and space, grouping together the stories that by now are as familiar as folklore. We reached out to Simpson to learn more about her life and work. As a kid growing up in New York, what influence did museums and galleries have on you?Growing up in New York with parents who weren’t New Yorkers, I was brought to plays and museums constantly. I wasn’t as much influenced by visual artists at that time, as much as theater. Although certainly way over my head, the experience of theater brought language and literature to life, which I found amazing.I was also personally involved in dance as a child. I did ballet with the Bernice Johnson Cultural Arts Center, a dance school in Jamaica, Queens. We had our recital at Lincoln Center. As a young, black child, to perform on that stage was really amazing. I felt ownership over it. Because so much art and performance was part of my early education, I felt very at home in certain institutions, like New York was also my city. Today, it’s rare for a child growing up in a public school environment to feel that sense of ownership in relation to different New York institutions.Did you make visual art growing up?I was really interested in photography. I remember being really sick with the flu one winter and going through so many Kleenex tissue boxes when I realized that on the backs there were these coupons. If you sent in a bunch you could get a Polaroid camera. My parents also gave me a hand-me-down camera. I remember taking pictures of my dog and of my neighborhood. That’s where I started. At what point did you realize art was more than a hobby, but a career?Well, I went to the the High School of Art and Design for high school. And because of all my experiences in the arts, in some way, I kind of chose my course because I couldn’t imagine doing anything else but.Were you worried, practically, about “making it” as an artist? At that time, I had expertise in graphic design so I wasn’t really worried about getting a job. There was a point while I was in college at the School of Visual Arts when my dad, who was paying my tuition, said he wanted me to take more educational certification classes, to pursue being a teacher. I didn’t want to do that so I ended up taking out student loans and paying for my college education myself.I went with my gut pursuing what I wanted to do. In terms of the art market, I didn’t foresee the success that would happen. Going into college I had a residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem where I met Kellie Jones, who was a very young curator at the time, working towards a PhD in art history, and David Hammons, who was an artist in residence at the time.I was really young and wanted a broad network. But I never really equated the success of other people with anything to do with me. It was just amazing to be a fly on the wall and watch other people work.You mentioned Kellie Jones. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship ― how it shifted over time?When I met Kellie, I think she was a curatorial intern at the Studio Museum at the time. One day we went out to lunch in Morningside Park and got to know each other. She was into art. I was an artist. It was one of my first experiences meeting a young black woman and being able to talk about art history in an expansive way in an institutional setting that included us. I had taken a bunch of classes at SVA and was somewhat well-versed.It was about creating this milieu of people I could talk to about what I was interested in. That was really important to me. Community. People that had interests that would amplify my own, and inform them in different kinds of ways. Kellie was one of the first people to do that. I feel like, as a younger artist, I was not so much ambitious about having a career, but about really having an interesting experience and being within certain artistic communities I thought were important. Trying to find a way in, even through being a fly on the wall.Ebony and Jet magazines are collaged and repurposed in your upcoming Salon 94 exhibition, and have factored into your past work as well. What roles have these publications played in your life?My grandmother and mother are from Chicago, and that certainly is the mecca for Johnson Publishing Company. At my grandparents’ house, they got Ebony and Jet on a weekly basis. Many years later I came across this box of magazines, a lot of them from the mid ‘60s, that mentioned the death of Martin Luther King Jr. and all these significant issues from the civil rights era.It struck me that the magazine understood its audience as being African-American. Even just going through the advertisements for beauty products, cigarettes, and liquor ads. There is something about them that focuses the ads to a black audience. I started collecting them and now have a mini archive. There are also ties to the way we live now. In the ‘60s and early ‘70s, the political issues that were at hand are still in play now in a very obvious way.In your Salon 94 show, the magazine fragments take on an almost ghostly presence, a stark departure from your earlier, more celebratory series on black beauty. Can you talk about the space you mentally occupied when creating these more recent works, and their relation to what’s going on in the world?I think, for me, this show is a little different in the way I entered into the subject matter. Some of it is a result of the barrage of deaths by police brutality over the past few years, which we can see and experience almost in real time through Facebook or Instagram. That, to me, has been unnerving and unrelenting in a way. That does seep into the work. The piece “Polka Dots & Bullet Holes,” for example, features a dress that has polka dots, aligned with these arbitrary dots that are bullet holes. They are all bleeding or dripping with ink.Also, I found it to be an emotional time for me in terms of my personal life. The work has this personal unrelenting drama and, at the same time, that is reflected in the larger scope of what is going on in America at this moment.You’ve spoken about the “free-form, spontaneous quality” of applying ink to canvas, as opposed to the more methodical process of selecting, cutting, and pasting images. When you’re working, do you feel as if you’re inhabiting distinct speeds and spaces depending on the medium you’re working with, or does it all flow together? Even with the collages, which combine AP photos with different things from Ebony and Jet, everything is kind of thrown together instinctually. I try not to overthink so much, to make these combinations of things quickly and instinctually. I work in so many different mediums, I like being in this particular period of jumping back and forth. There’s a lot of shifting back and forth as the thing is being made. In this period I’ve had more time as an artist in the studio to work and play.Is it possible to describe how you know when a work is finished?I have certain deadlines, so my studio manager is keeping things on schedule. There was actually a moment recently when one of my paintings got completely wrapped up and it wasn’t done. We had to take it out again.But really, it’s done when it’s done. It’s unexplainable. That’s been nice. So much of the other work I’ve done is conceptually tight, but now that it’s involving my hand and gestures, it prolongs the finished thing. I can’t define the line between finished and unfinished until I just say that it is. It is so physical. Who knew painting was so physical? I didn’t consider that until I really started to get into it. I know it intellectually, but in terms of process, now I really understand how that plays out.Your piece “Enumerated,” at 12 feet tall and 9 feet wide, is arguably the focal point of the exhibition. It’s such a simple yet searing image, can you talk about how this piece came to be? It’s a detail from an advertisement I saw that was counting these nails. The first thing that came to my mind whenever I see that way of counting to five ― those four lines with a line through them ― is always a prisoner carving marks into a wall. Probably from film, or maybe Albert Camus.Counting ― whether counting time or incidents ― that’s something we do unconsciously. When something happens over and over, or we’re waiting for something to end. When I think of Black Lives Matter and the platform they have given to families that have experienced police brutality, the mothers and sisters and wives, there is always this waiting that occurs in terms of: Will these officers be prosecuted? All those things — waiting and time and outcome, the repetition of that, is something that I feel.The piece is conceived of as a series of five panels. As you approach it, you really don’t see that they are nails, but they just look like these strikes. The unrelenting enormity of the number and counting. I’m not trying to direct the viewer to a specific political event, but more of a conceptual space. Living in the time that we’re living in, the viewer will come to some of their own conclusions as to how they might read the work. It’s not imperative that someone understands everything that I’m saying right now. You’ve mentioned in other interviews that you often meditate before beginning a day in your studio. How has this routine influenced your practice, if at all? I think it’s really to keep my sanity. For some people, mediating or yoga is this thing of calming. For me, meditating can be upsetting. I can be weeping. But it brings me to how I am feeling now. Rather than trying to avoid it or readjust, it makes me confront it. However I am in that moment, in that emotional state, I accept it. I can feel vulnerable or sad and distraught and still work. Part of the practice of working is accepting that there will be a range of emotions and states that come in, not just a good happy state in which to work. I can say to myself, ‘I don’t feel great today. Okay, let’s go in with that.”Lorna Simpson’s work will be on view until Oct. 22, 2016, at Salon 94 in New York.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

In Simpson’s “Polka Dot & Bullet Holes #2, 2016,” a bifurcated image juxtaposes a woman’s polka-dot dress with a constellation of bullet holes. The circular fissures serve as bleak foils to the stylish garment, the stark contrast of expressing one’s identity and losing it, swiftly and utterly. The austerity of the print only makes it more unnerving; the discomfort of knowing something is a symbol without knowing what it symbolizes. It’s the eeriness of a dress spotted on the side of the road, its wearer nowhere to be seen. Simpson, who was born in Brooklyn and works there today, has employed a variety of media including photography, video, collage and painting to explore the relationship between image and identity, especially as it relates to race and gender. One of her most iconic photography series, 1989’s “Necklines,” depicts tightly cropped photos of black women’s necks, punctuated by a white collar. The images are reminiscent of elegant perfume ads, disembodied and cut short. Beneath the images, words like “neckline,” “necking,” “necklace” and “breakneck” suggest beauty, love and violence simultaneously. For her most recent exhibition at Salon 94, Simpson excerpts images from old issues of Ebony and Jet magazines, along with Associated Press photos from the 1930s to 1970s, to confront contemporary issues of racism and police brutality. The fragmented ads and news clippings become, through Simpson’s hand, incorporeal symbols, addressing pain and exasperation that is as relevant today as it was in the ‘60s. Amplifying the screen-printed photos with ink and paint, Simpson conjures the excruciating numbness that results from an endless onslaught of gross injustice.Simpson’s serialized, monochromatic works read like pages in a newspaper that stretch throughout time and space, grouping together the stories that by now are as familiar as folklore. We reached out to Simpson to learn more about her life and work. As a kid growing up in New York, what influence did museums and galleries have on you?Growing up in New York with parents who weren’t New Yorkers, I was brought to plays and museums constantly. I wasn’t as much influenced by visual artists at that time, as much as theater. Although certainly way over my head, the experience of theater brought language and literature to life, which I found amazing.I was also personally involved in dance as a child. I did ballet with the Bernice Johnson Cultural Arts Center, a dance school in Jamaica, Queens. We had our recital at Lincoln Center. As a young, black child, to perform on that stage was really amazing. I felt ownership over it. Because so much art and performance was part of my early education, I felt very at home in certain institutions, like New York was also my city. Today, it’s rare for a child growing up in a public school environment to feel that sense of ownership in relation to different New York institutions.Did you make visual art growing up?I was really interested in photography. I remember being really sick with the flu one winter and going through so many Kleenex tissue boxes when I realized that on the backs there were these coupons. If you sent in a bunch you could get a Polaroid camera. My parents also gave me a hand-me-down camera. I remember taking pictures of my dog and of my neighborhood. That’s where I started. At what point did you realize art was more than a hobby, but a career?Well, I went to the the High School of Art and Design for high school. And because of all my experiences in the arts, in some way, I kind of chose my course because I couldn’t imagine doing anything else but.Were you worried, practically, about “making it” as an artist? At that time, I had expertise in graphic design so I wasn’t really worried about getting a job. There was a point while I was in college at the School of Visual Arts when my dad, who was paying my tuition, said he wanted me to take more educational certification classes, to pursue being a teacher. I didn’t want to do that so I ended up taking out student loans and paying for my college education myself.I went with my gut pursuing what I wanted to do. In terms of the art market, I didn’t foresee the success that would happen. Going into college I had a residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem where I met Kellie Jones, who was a very young curator at the time, working towards a PhD in art history, and David Hammons, who was an artist in residence at the time.I was really young and wanted a broad network. But I never really equated the success of other people with anything to do with me. It was just amazing to be a fly on the wall and watch other people work.You mentioned Kellie Jones. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship ― how it shifted over time?When I met Kellie, I think she was a curatorial intern at the Studio Museum at the time. One day we went out to lunch in Morningside Park and got to know each other. She was into art. I was an artist. It was one of my first experiences meeting a young black woman and being able to talk about art history in an expansive way in an institutional setting that included us. I had taken a bunch of classes at SVA and was somewhat well-versed.It was about creating this milieu of people I could talk to about what I was interested in. That was really important to me. Community. People that had interests that would amplify my own, and inform them in different kinds of ways. Kellie was one of the first people to do that. I feel like, as a younger artist, I was not so much ambitious about having a career, but about really having an interesting experience and being within certain artistic communities I thought were important. Trying to find a way in, even through being a fly on the wall.Ebony and Jet magazines are collaged and repurposed in your upcoming Salon 94 exhibition, and have factored into your past work as well. What roles have these publications played in your life?My grandmother and mother are from Chicago, and that certainly is the mecca for Johnson Publishing Company. At my grandparents’ house, they got Ebony and Jet on a weekly basis. Many years later I came across this box of magazines, a lot of them from the mid ‘60s, that mentioned the death of Martin Luther King Jr. and all these significant issues from the civil rights era.It struck me that the magazine understood its audience as being African-American. Even just going through the advertisements for beauty products, cigarettes, and liquor ads. There is something about them that focuses the ads to a black audience. I started collecting them and now have a mini archive. There are also ties to the way we live now. In the ‘60s and early ‘70s, the political issues that were at hand are still in play now in a very obvious way.In your Salon 94 show, the magazine fragments take on an almost ghostly presence, a stark departure from your earlier, more celebratory series on black beauty. Can you talk about the space you mentally occupied when creating these more recent works, and their relation to what’s going on in the world?I think, for me, this show is a little different in the way I entered into the subject matter. Some of it is a result of the barrage of deaths by police brutality over the past few years, which we can see and experience almost in real time through Facebook or Instagram. That, to me, has been unnerving and unrelenting in a way. That does seep into the work. The piece “Polka Dots & Bullet Holes,” for example, features a dress that has polka dots, aligned with these arbitrary dots that are bullet holes. They are all bleeding or dripping with ink.Also, I found it to be an emotional time for me in terms of my personal life. The work has this personal unrelenting drama and, at the same time, that is reflected in the larger scope of what is going on in America at this moment.You’ve spoken about the “free-form, spontaneous quality” of applying ink to canvas, as opposed to the more methodical process of selecting, cutting, and pasting images. When you’re working, do you feel as if you’re inhabiting distinct speeds and spaces depending on the medium you’re working with, or does it all flow together? Even with the collages, which combine AP photos with different things from Ebony and Jet, everything is kind of thrown together instinctually. I try not to overthink so much, to make these combinations of things quickly and instinctually. I work in so many different mediums, I like being in this particular period of jumping back and forth. There’s a lot of shifting back and forth as the thing is being made. In this period I’ve had more time as an artist in the studio to work and play.Is it possible to describe how you know when a work is finished?I have certain deadlines, so my studio manager is keeping things on schedule. There was actually a moment recently when one of my paintings got completely wrapped up and it wasn’t done. We had to take it out again.But really, it’s done when it’s done. It’s unexplainable. That’s been nice. So much of the other work I’ve done is conceptually tight, but now that it’s involving my hand and gestures, it prolongs the finished thing. I can’t define the line between finished and unfinished until I just say that it is. It is so physical. Who knew painting was so physical? I didn’t consider that until I really started to get into it. I know it intellectually, but in terms of process, now I really understand how that plays out.Your piece “Enumerated,” at 12 feet tall and 9 feet wide, is arguably the focal point of the exhibition. It’s such a simple yet searing image, can you talk about how this piece came to be? It’s a detail from an advertisement I saw that was counting these nails. The first thing that came to my mind whenever I see that way of counting to five ― those four lines with a line through them ― is always a prisoner carving marks into a wall. Probably from film, or maybe Albert Camus.Counting ― whether counting time or incidents ― that’s something we do unconsciously. When something happens over and over, or we’re waiting for something to end. When I think of Black Lives Matter and the platform they have given to families that have experienced police brutality, the mothers and sisters and wives, there is always this waiting that occurs in terms of: Will these officers be prosecuted? All those things — waiting and time and outcome, the repetition of that, is something that I feel.The piece is conceived of as a series of five panels. As you approach it, you really don’t see that they are nails, but they just look like these strikes. The unrelenting enormity of the number and counting. I’m not trying to direct the viewer to a specific political event, but more of a conceptual space. Living in the time that we’re living in, the viewer will come to some of their own conclusions as to how they might read the work. It’s not imperative that someone understands everything that I’m saying right now. You’ve mentioned in other interviews that you often meditate before beginning a day in your studio. How has this routine influenced your practice, if at all? I think it’s really to keep my sanity. For some people, mediating or yoga is this thing of calming. For me, meditating can be upsetting. I can be weeping. But it brings me to how I am feeling now. Rather than trying to avoid it or readjust, it makes me confront it. However I am in that moment, in that emotional state, I accept it. I can feel vulnerable or sad and distraught and still work. Part of the practice of working is accepting that there will be a range of emotions and states that come in, not just a good happy state in which to work. I can say to myself, ‘I don’t feel great today. Okay, let’s go in with that.”Lorna Simpson’s work will be on view until Oct. 22, 2016, at Salon 94 in New York.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Ha!FX CEO John Landgraf announced Tuesday that the Emmy-winning horror anthology series has been renewed for a yet-untitled seventh season. Meaning the time to start putting good vibes into the universe ― so that “AHS” superstar Jessica Lange might feel compelled to join the upcoming cast despite past comments ― is now.“The sustained success through six installments only proves how intensely the series resonates with fans,” Landgraf said in a statement, adding that “’AHS’ confronts our deepest fears with unmatched suspense and style.”If the network has learned anything from the current season, it will likely not reveal the show’s new theme anytime soon. A solid number of viewers ― over 5 million ― watched the Season 6 premiere to finally discover, after months of tiny teasers, what the theme would be.And it didn’t disappoint. “American Horror Story: Roanoke” had been on fans’ wish lists for years, and the season offers a fun explanation for that particular history mystery by suggesting the lost colonists had actually moved inland to haunt one particular spot of land for eternity and kill anyone who got in their way.If series co-creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy are at a loss for new theme ideas, here are just a few suggestions off the tops of our heads: - “American Horror Story: Camp,” our worst social anxieties are revisited, but now there’s also a blowtorch-wielding madman running around, too.- “American Horror Story: Pageant,” a nonfiction exploration of girls’ beauty pageant culture in the United States.- “American Horror Story: Newsroom,” a live-stream of our desk next to that guy who types way too loud.“American Horror Story” returns with a new episode Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET on FX."

After months of political wrangling, Congress last week finally approved a little more than half of that to fight the virus.“Because we’ve had to wait these seven months, we haven’t been able to get a running start on some of the critically important studies to understand more fully the impacts of Zika, to establish better diagnostic tests, to improve our way of controlling mosquitoes,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adding that vaccine development efforts were also delayed.Health officials on a conference call with reporters also said money they had redirected from other efforts, such as for Ebola and cancer research, was unlikely to be reimbursed.”There’s a cost to protecting Americans from the dollars that were reprogrammed,” Frieden said.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell promised that the new funds would be allocated quickly. But she said critical time and energy were spent on working to get the funding instead of working to use it.”That money would be out the door if we had received it at the time we asked for it,” Burwell said.Asked for examples of what would not be funded or would be underfunded because Congress approved $800 million less than what was requested, Burwell pointed to hard-hit Puerto Rico. She said $141 million would be earmarked for Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories out of $271 million that had been requested.There are more than 25,000 cases of the mosquito-borne virus in the United States and its territories, including more than 2,300 involving pregnant women. Most of the cases are in Puerto Rico, but there is a limited active outbreak in Miami.The virus, which can also be transmitted through sex with an infected person, has been linked to a variety of serious birth defects, including microcephaly and severe brain abnormalities.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

But the precedent set could have broad ramifications in North Carolina and four other states within the regional appeals court’s jurisdiction if left in place, prompting the village to appeal.Other appeals courts have ruled differently regarding these weapons, with most finding that police officers have more leeway to use Tasers even when there is not an imminent threat.Taser International Inc, which manufactures the devices, filed a brief asking the high court to hear the case.A Taser is a device intended to serve as a non-lethal method of control for law enforcement officers to restrain dangerous people but in some cases the electrical shock can cause death.Armstrong was not taking his prescribed medication at the time of the incident that led to his death. Police were called when he was seen walking on a road outside a local hospital. After two officers spoke to him, he wrapped his arms and legs around a pole and refused to move, leading one of the officers to use his Taser, which was set to “stun” mode.It appeared to have no apparent immediate effect on Armstrong, but he died after eventually being pulled away from the pole.(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has beef with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.).Warren has campaigned with Toomey’s Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, and called Toomey “Mr. Wall Street.” Toomey’s criticism of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren’s brainchild, doesn’t endear him to her. He’s said that he wants the agency dismantled.But Warren has another problem with him, too.“In the lead-up to the financial crisis, big banks cost cities and towns billions of dollars by giving them terrible financial advice that just so happened to help those banks’ bottom lines,” Warren told The Huffington Post on Monday.“Congress tried to fix that problem ... with a simple rule: If big banks are advising municipalities, they have to act in their clients’ best interests,” she added. “Sen. Toomey wants to gut that rule and go back to the days when Wall Street could swindle cities with bad advice.”Here’s what Warren’s talking about: Toomey pushed bills in 2011, 2012 and 2013 that would have made it easier for Wall Street banks to rip off local governments by selling them dodgy investments designed to benefit Wall Street.Before the financial crisis, banks and other investment advisers convinced scores of Pennsylvania cities, towns, school boards and utilities to buy interest-rate swaps, financial products that the state’s auditor later called “highly risky and impenetrably complex transactions that, quite simply, amount to gambling with public money.” (An interest rate swap is, in effect, a bet on whether interest rates will go up or down.)Municipalities ended up losing hundreds of millions of dollars on these deals.A provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed in 2010 aimed to protect taxpayers from having to cover local governments’ bad bets with Wall Street ever again. That law stated that people who advised local governments on municipal securities had what’s called a fiduciary duty — basically, they needed to be able to reasonably defend the advice they gave governments. Toomey didn’t like this change, and pushed hard to gut the new rule. He introduced or co-sponsored bills — backed by the bank lobby — in three consecutive years that would have exempted banks from the requirement that they give local governments advice that is in taxpayers’ best interest. “That’s a whopping exemption to drop in there,” said Marcus Stanley, the policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit that opposed Toomey’s proposal. “It permits them to do all kinds of stuff: Pay-for-play, and to effectively give bad advice that benefits them.” Basically, Toomey’s bills would have let the banks keep doing what they were doing before the crisis.Allowing those shenanigans to continue would have been a big problem for Toomey’s constituents. As the Pennsylvania auditor found, swaps “are susceptible [to] being marketed deceptively, and they principally benefit the investment banks and the multitude of intermediaries who sell them to relatively unsophisticated public officials.”Before the housing crash, Pennsylvania’s market for municipal interest rate swaps was the largest in the nation. At least 107 Pennsylvania school districts and 86 other municipal bodies had entered into swap deals on some $15 billion of debt by 2009, according to the auditor general’s report.Pennsylvania mayors, city councils and school boards were what Wall Street sometimes calls “dumb money.” They were suckers, and it cost Pennsylvania taxpayers dearly. One city, Bethlehem, lost at least $55 million on swap deals. The Butler Area School District, outside Pittsburgh, lost $5 million. The Delaware River Port Authority lost at least $56 million. Erie spent $2.9 million to terminate a bad swap deal. Lackawanna County paid nearly $10 million to end its deal after it discovered it was paying 10 times the interest it would have if it hadn’t made the deal. The Scranton school district was paying 17 times as much as it should have been. Lancaster County paid $3.9 million to end its swap deal. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission lost $109 million — more than $50 million of it in cancellation fees. Philadelphia Gas Works, a utility, spent $12 million to get out of its swap deal. The city of Philadelphia could end up losing as much as $186 million, the city’s treasurer testified in 2012. The city’s transit agency, SEPTA, lost another $41 million. The Port Authority of Allegheny County lost $39.5 million on its swap deal. Westmoreland County paid $8.5 million to get out of its deal.And Philadelphia’s cash-strapped school district, which for several years budgeted no money to buy books for students, lost more than $161 million. It wasn’t just that local government leaders had made bad financial decisions. There was also fraud. In 2011, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $92 million to settle a case brought by 25 states over charges that it rigged bids to take advantage of local governments and nonprofits.“Basically, you had all kinds of skullduggery in municipal financing,” Stanley said. “You had these insider situations where the underwriter was giving bad advice, you had all these cases where municipalities were ripped off on swap deals, and you had cases where the municipal officials were much less sophisticated or more naive than the banks.”Toomey’s bills never made it out of committee in the then-Democratic-controlled Senate. His office didn’t respond to requests for comment about why he supported the bills. But it’s no surprise that he thinks selling complex financial products to unsophisticated local governments should be easy and relatively unregulated: He used to do it. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Toomey ran sales and trading at a British bank called Morgan Grenfell, where he managed a $21 billion derivatives portfolio.

His statement is not true.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f1b6271a0000f3045b6745.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump held a high-dollar fundraiser in Chicago last week. Then another two in Michigan. And then another one in New Jersey on Saturday.Want to know who hosted them? How many people showed up? What the minimum donation was? Well, too bad. It’s none of your business.At least that’s how the Republican presidential nominee and the Republican National Committee see it, repudiating years of standard practice by both GOP and Democratic presidential nominees ― and undercutting a key Republican attack against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her secretiveness.“Any other answer than they simply don’t care would be over-analyzing it,” said Kevin Madden, a top adviser to 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. “That’s always been a core argument of Trump critics even inside the party: that he’s the one candidate who actually makes a debate with Clinton over issues of trust and transparency a competitive one. It shouldn’t be close.”Clinton’s campaign after each fundraising event discloses the name and location of the host, the minimum donation and the number of attendees. Clinton further releases a list of her “bundlers,” those supporters who collect donations on her behalf ― another common practice that Trump is not doing.“The Trump campaign doesn’t seem to care about the perception that this undermines their ability to prosecute Hillary Clinton’s lack of transparency,” said fellow Romney 2012 alumnus Ryan Williams. “This is a candidate who hasn’t even released his tax returns ― a much bigger issue than disclosing information about fundraisers.”Indeed, with his refusal to disclose his financial history, his unwillingness to permit a small contingent of journalists to accompany him on all his travels and his opaque fundraising, Trump has actually become the least transparent, most secretive nominee in the post-Watergate era.Trump’s campaign did not respond to queries from The Huffington Post about why it was not disclosing fundraising details. One top RNC official promised “to look into” the question, but never followed up with an answer.The Clinton campaign began releasing information about its fundraising events right from its start in April 2015. On Friday evening, for example, Clinton held a fundraiser at the Miami Beach home of Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, the campaign reported. The minimum contribution was $10,000, while “chairs” had to donate or contribute $100,000 per couple. About 130 people attended.The campaign has sent out 98 such fundraising reports to the media in the past six weeks alone. The Clinton campaign also lists all of its bundlers who have raised or contributed $100,000 or more on its website, even though the law only requires disclosure of bundlers who are registered lobbyists.Trump’s campaign didn’t file a lobbyist bundling report for the second quarter with the Federal Election Commission. Nor does it make any effort to disclose its non-lobbyist bundlers on its website.Texas GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak said the Trump campaign’s reluctance to disclose event details might be based on the hosts’ preference to remain secret.“My strong suspicion is that the Trump campaign has had difficulty finding hosts for fundraising events, because when a name is publicly revealed, that person faces threats, harassment and boycotts, as one restaurant owner did in Dallas during the summer,” Mackowiak said.Other Republicans have a different take. Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Florida GOP lobbyist and bundler who does not support Trump, said revealing that he’s raising big money from the usual donors goes against the myth Trump has been selling. “Because the names, amounts, and locations would undermine the narrative that he is the friend of Joe Lunchbucket, beholden to no one, and the sworn enemy of special interests,” Stipanovich said.That’s clearly the storyline Trump puts out to his supporters. “Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors,” Trump told his audience at a Pennsylvania rally Saturday night. “My campaign is powered by my money. My money. And by small-dollar donations from hardworking patriots like all of you.”In reality, little of that statement is true. Trump has scaled back his personal donations to his campaign. While he spent $50 million of his own money during the primaries supplemented by the sale of hats and other souvenirs, Trump is putting about $2 million a month now into his own campaign, while donors are kicking in the rest. Of the $90 million Trump and the RNC raised in August, $88 million came from other people.And while Trump has been getting strong support from those giving small donations, he’s also been soliciting and receiving five-figure, even six-figure, checks from the “big business” and “big donors” that he trashes.Of the donations to Trump’s joint committees with the party that were transferred to the RNC through the end of August, 75 percent of the $20.1 million came from just 601 donors who gave $10,000 and above, according to a Huffington Post analysis of FEC filings.Trump has had a fundraiser hosted for him by Robert Murray, the owner of a coal mining company cited for numerous safety violations. He has accepted money from the political action committee of GEO, the private prison company. He’s taken big checks from gambling interests, lobbyists, developers and financial services executives, among many others.His habit of doing so came as a surprise to at least one Trump supporter recently.“He’s taking money from lobbyists?” said Amanda Middleton, 35, who brought her 17-year-old son to a recent Trump rally in Toledo. “I’ve never even heard that, and I watch politics 24/7.”Most voters, much less most Trump supporters, though, are not likely to care, said another anti-Trump Republican. “I don’t think it hurts,” said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party who said he’s been amazed how little a campaign finance scandal seems to have mattered in a congressional race there. “It’s been informative how few people care and how many shrug and say they all do it.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

By that point, it’s possible the next president will be in office and a replacement for Scalia will have been confirmed.With the Senate in recess until after the November elections, the only possibility for Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice for the vacancy, is that Congress will consider his nomination during the lame-duck session. Hillary Clinton has indicated that she might look to someone other than Garland if she’s elected president. To Marielena Hincapié, executive director at the National Immigration Law Center, the court’s move on Monday and the uncertainty over its ninth member only underscore the stakes in the presidential election. “The fact that the Supreme Court has continued to fail to act on the nation’s most pressing issues only serves to remind us that we need a fully functional court today, not next year,” she said in a statement, which also called on the Senate to confirm Garland.“Voters must turn out to ensure that we elect a president who will shape the future of the country ― not just for the next four years but for decades ― as she or he will get to nominate several Supreme Court justices,” Hincapié added.Her group is involved in a parallel legal effort to allow Obama’s executive actions on immigration to be implemented in those states that are pro-immigration and that weren’t involved in the Texas-led lawsuit over the deportation deferral plan.Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, claimed in a statement Monday that the Supreme Court, by denying the federal government’s request, had “validated” the state’s position in the case.“This is the latest setback to the president’s attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitution’s separation of powers and the rule of law,” Paxton said.But the court’s one-line order, much like its original one-line ruling in June, was silent on the actual merits of the case. Which is to say: The justices have yet to deliver the final word."

She would assign her students to watch the debates and interview their parents about the candidates.But today, she says she wouldn’t urge them to tune in for the hate-fueled debacle that is 2016. “I’m not so sure I’d really want my kids to watch this debate,” said Eskelsen García, now president of the National Education Association, on a call with reporters Monday. “It’s really kind of disturbing what they’re hearing out there.”The NEA is the largest labor union in the country and represents 3 million educators, roughly three-quarters of them women. It has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, and now it’s leading a campaign that portrays her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, as a schoolyard bully who’s filling children with hate. The union, which has steered at least $1 million to a Clinton-affiliated super PAC, plans to run online ads and send mailers to voters’ homes hammering that message in battleground states.“There is bullying going on, and [there are] children who feel that they are given permission to repeat some of the things they’re hearing out of Donald Trump’s mouth,” Eskelsen García said. The Clinton campaign and its allies have referred to the GOP nominee’s alleged influence as the “Trump Effect.” Its existence hasn’t been scientifically proven, but anecdotes from schools are out there. Eskelsen García referenced one of them: White students at a high school basketball game in Indiana holding up a picture of Trump and shouting “Build a wall” to their opponents from a largely Latino school.Trump has lashed out against Mexican and Muslim immigrants, vowing to return all undocumented immigrants to their countries of origin and to ban Muslims from entering the United States.The term “Trump Effect” was coined by the authors of a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which alleged there was an uptick in school bullying stemming from the presidential campaign. Students singled out their immigrant classmates for taunts, according to an online survey that teachers filled out. Among the SPLC’s findings: “Teachers report that students have been ‘emboldened’ to use slurs, engage in name-calling and make inflammatory statements toward each other.” Also, “Kids use the names of candidates as pejoratives to taunt each other.” (PolitiFact evaluated Clinton’s references to the “Trump Effect” while on the trail, rating her claims “mostly true.” The site noted that the SPLC survey was “unscientific,” though its data shows “recurring themes.”) Joy Lyn Bock, an NEA member living near Columbus, Ohio, said this year’s political discourse has obviously affected her eighth-grade social studies class. One of her students ― the 14-year-old daughter of Peruvian immigrants ― made a “startling statement,” she said. The girl is a U.S. citizen, but she told her class that she would be “sent back to Peru” in the event of a Trump victory. The child had gotten that impression from her parents’ talk about the election, Bock said. “My student told her class that her parents said it will not be safe to continue to live in the United States if Donald Trump becomes president,” Bock said. The episode, she added, “broke my heart.”Bock said she has voted Republican in the past but will be voting for Clinton next month.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

California recently announced it would no longer do business with the bank, and Illinois is expected to follow with its own announcement on Monday.Representatives from Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and US Bank declined to respond when The Huffington Post asked them if they use the same high-pressure, lofty sales quotas that pushed underpaid Wells Fargo employees to rip off customers in an effort to keep their jobs or earn bonuses to enhance their low hourly pay.

Consumers have reported problems with unauthorized credit card openings at other banks since at least 2015. The CFPB has received 638 complaints from people who said they received credit cards they did not ask for since January of that year, according to an analysis the S&P Global Market Intelligence released last week. Just 28 of those complaints were directed at Wells Fargo; 31 were for Bank of America; 59 were about JPMorgan Chase and 83 complaints regarded Citi.“Those banks that don’t do this [sales incentives] are happy to say so,” Anastasia Christman, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, told HuffPost.That none of these banks were willing to talk about their practices is perhaps a sign of extreme caution in the wake of the penalties levied on Wells Fargo. The bank was forced to pay $185 million in fines earlier this month, including a record $100 million penalty levied by the CFPB. At the time, CFPB Director Richard Cordray put the banking industry on notice.“This was outrageous conduct. It was a violation of trust and an abuse of trust. It should not have happened, and I guarantee you that we will be seeing that it does not happen again at any bank,” he said in an interview with CNBC. “We will be looking for these types of problems.”Bank workers interviewed for the NELP report talked about the immense pressure to sell more products to customers, who often not only didn’t need a new credit card ― but would likely face financial harm from one.“If someone’s getting married, tell them to get a credit card. Any life event that happened, you were supposed to say, ‘Get a credit card for it.’ If you heard kids in the background, the answer was a credit card,” a Rhode Island Bank of America service specialist told the organization.The comprehensive analysis was based in part on interviews with 75 workers currently or recently employed by seven major banks ― including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and US Bank.

You can’t make that sacrifice.”Amalgamated Bank, a small New York-based union-owned bank, is one of the few financial institutions to publicly disclose it does not use sales quotas or incentive pay for cross-selling. The bank announced last year it would pay its workers at least $15 an hour.Until recently, Amalgamated did offer bonuses to branch managers for reaching certain goals in opening accounts, but the bank plans to discontinue the practice at year’s end.“We don’t want to have any shred of doubt in our consumers’ minds that we are watching out for their best interests,” Amalgamated CEO Keith Mestrich told HuffPost. He said tellers at Amalgamated often make far more than $15 an hour.But Mestrich’s bank isn’t public and under the same pressure to increase its bottom line as the largest banks.

We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.”Clinton referenced the 9-year-old’s powerful words and made an important point about her own role as a grandmother, specifically about the fears black grandmothers face that she doesn’t.“I’m a grandmother and like every grandmother, I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren,” she said. “But my worries are not the same as black grandmothers.”The Democratic presidential nominee added later:“[B]ecause my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state ― let’s be honest here. They won’t face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.”Clinton visited the church about two weeks after Charlotte police fatally shot a black man named Keith Lamont Scott. Following the shooting, Clinton called on the city to release the police footage of it to “ensure justice.” (The city later released footage, which did not have clear evidence as to whether Scott was in possession of a handgun like authorities said.)During her speech, Clinton said the United States should not delay taking action against racism, learning to acknowledge implicit bias and reforming its criminal justice system because “every child deserves the same sense of security.”“Every child deserves the same hope,” she said. “They should not be facing fear. They should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be and what their contributions to our country could be as well.”Listen to part of Clinton’s speech below.H/T CNN"

1313,1313,THE WORLDPOST,Women Go On Strike In Poland To Protest Proposed Anti-Abortion Law,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poland-abortion-protest_us_57f28a1be4b024a52d300f68,Thousands of women in black gathered to protest.,2016-10-03,"Polish women take part in a nationwide strike and demonstration to protest against a legislative proposal for a total ban of abortion on October 3, 2016 in Warsaw.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f28c281a0000f3045b69f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WARSAW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Thousands of women in black went on strike across Poland on Monday, closing down restaurants, government offices and university classes, and blocking access to the ruling party headquarters in Warsaw to protest against plans for a total ban on abortion.Legislation proposed by an independent group would forbid any termination, tightening Poland’s already restrictive rules that allow abortion only in the case of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s health, or when the baby is likely to be permanently handicapped.It is unclear whether the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government will back the draft law, introduced by the group Ordo Iuris. But the possibility of new restrictions has stirred an intense debate in the staunchly Catholic Poland.“I didn’t go to work today,” said Gabriela, a 41-year-old market researcher from Warsaw.“They are violating our civic rights, and I wanted to support all the women who may be hurt, who may be denied medical help and forced to have a disabled child ... And I am doing it for my daughter.”Critics say the proposed rules would discourage doctors from conducting prenatal testing, particularly if procedures carry the risk of miscarriage, or put the life of women with an ectopic pregnancy at risk.The draft rules allow for termination if a woman’s life is in direct danger.Women and doctors could face prison if convicted of causing what the proposed rules call “death of a conceived child.”Dressed in black, women chanted “We want doctors, not missionaries!” and “Jaroslaw, get out!” in front of the central Warsaw offices of PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski.Some carried posters saying: “A government is not like a pregnancy - it can be terminated.”POLITICAL DILEMMAFor PiS, which swept into power a year ago on a promise of more wealth equality and conservative values in public life, the proposed rules pose a dilemma.It could antagonize the powerful Catholic church if it fails to back the legislation - or fan an even wider public outcry if it does.Poland remains one of Europe’s most Catholic nations, with about 90 percent of citizens declaring allegiance to the church. But the clergy’s sway over the heart and soul of churchgoers, although still strong in some places, has been waning.PiS officials have been quoted in local media saying the party may introduce its own proposal in parliament that would allow abortion in the case of rape and incest and a threat to the mother’s health but disallow terminations of handicapped fetuses.“The right to life, or as some insist, the right to an abortion, is an important moral challenge for our civilisation, our western civilisation,” Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski told RMF FM radio.“Let them have fun,” he said of the protesting women. “They should go ahead if they think there are no bigger problems in Poland.”Official statistics show several hundred legal abortions are conducted in Poland each year. But activists say many women are denied access to the procedure when doctors invoke a legal right to decline to perform it on moral or religious grounds.Tens of thousands are done illegally, activists say, with many women crossing the border to Germany or Slovakia to obtain the procedure."

About 30 percent of Vietnam veterans have had it in their lifetimes.PTSD is also a risk factor for suicide among veterans. On average, 20 veterans die from suicide every day.The stigma associated with PTSD ― that you are weak or unstable if you have it, for example ― is one of the reasons people don’t seek help. The fact that Trump reinforced that stigma did not go over well with vets.“Trump’s comments about veterans with PTSD reveal his total disdain for veterans and military families and highlight just how disconnected he is with our community,” Will Fischer, an Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient, said in a statement. “Calling combat veterans weak is mighty bold coming from someone who’s kept awake at night over a mean tweet and who leveraged a minor injury and family privilege to dodge service during Vietnam.”Others vented on Twitter.Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to comment but pointed to a statement issued by Marine Staff Sergeant Chad Robichaux, the man who asked Trump the PTSD question in Monday’s forum.“I think it’s sickening that anyone would twist Mr. Trump’s comments to me in order to pursue a political agenda,” said Robichaux. “I took his comments to be thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have, and I believe he is committed to helping them.”The Republican presidential nominee did go on to say he would make veterans’ mental health a priority if he wins in November. He promised “a very, very robust level of performance” in VA mental health services.“We are losing so many people that can be taken care of if they have proper care,” he said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Between 1998 and 2003, the Trump Organization rented more than 8,000 square feet of office space to Bank Melli on the 44th floor of the GM Building in New York, court documents show. During that time, the Iranian bank would have been included under a sweeping U.S. embargo against Iranian businesses. The Treasury Department designated Bank Melli in 1999 as being under the control of the Iranian government.The Treasury Department sometimes issued special licenses allowing Iranian entities to conduct limited business in the United States. A court filing identified by Tyler Cullis of the National Iranian American Council shows that Bank Melli was granted a license in 1996 to operate in New York. The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request on how long that license remained in effect.The Trump campaign declined to comment to CPI on whether the candidate was aware he had conducted business with an Iranian state-owned bank or on whether the licenses were in place to make such an operation legal. The campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post.The Treasury Department went on to sanction Bank Melli in 2007, accusing the bank of providing banking service to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups involved in Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Experts told the Center for Public Integrity that the bank likely supported proliferation activity and Iran’s military years before the Treasury Department publicly condemned the bank in 2007.The revelation that Trump drew profits from an Iranian bank later tied to terrorism is the latest in a stream of episodes that expose contradictions between the Republican presidential nominee’s public rhetoric and his private financial dealings. Since announcing his presidential bid, Trump has repeatedly referred to Iran has the world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism and slammed the 2015 international nuclear accord with Iran as the “worst deal” ever made. He often criticizes his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for her support of the nuclear accord and has, at various times, promised he could renegotiate a better deal ― or would simply scrap the agreement altogether.Trump has also accused Clinton of being ethically compromised because she served as secretary of state while her family’s nonprofit organization accepted donors from foreign governments. “She will cut deals with our foreign adversaries as long as they are willing to line her pockets,” Trump said after Iran Air struck a deal with Boeing, a company that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. Complete details about the extent of Trump’s financial ties to Iranian companies are limited because he refuses to release his tax returns. If Trump fails to do so before Election Day, he will be the first major party candidate since 1972 to keep this information hidden from voters.Clinton policy adviser Jake Sullivan pointed to the CPI report as further evidence that voters should see Trump’s tax returns.“He talks a big game but when it comes to making a buck, he’ll deal with anyone,” Sullivan said in a statement. “The conflicts of interest presented by Trump’s business and his own desire to boost his bottom line above all else demonstrate clearly why voters should know more about Trump’s business deals and what they mean for how he’ll govern.” Read the full Center for Public Integrity story here.This piece has been updated to include information about Bank Melli’s 1996 license and comment from the Clinton campaign.

There hasn’t been a storm this strong to hit the country since 1954.Matthew, currently characterized as a Category 4 hurricane, was about 275 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital, by midday Monday, and moved at about 130 miles per hour.It should be making landfall in Haiti sometime late Monday. The Dominican Republic ― which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti ― Jamaica and eastern Cuba are also preparing for life-threatening rains.Rough waters in the lead-up to the storm have already killed two fishermen in Haiti, The Associated Press reported.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the country will see 15-25 inches of rain.“A lot of Haiti is deforested,” hurricane center spokesman Dennis Feltgen told The Huffington Post. This increases the likelihood of deadly flash floods and mudslides. “All that water will be coming down fast, racing down mountains,” he said.A second concern is storm surge. Water on the east side of the island could rise 7 to 10 feet above dry ground, Feltgen said.“If you stand at 6 feet tall you’re looking at 4 feet of water above your head,” he said. “And add on all of the waves being driven from the hurricane, it’s even higher than that.”Poverty and disease have prevented Haiti from bouncing back after natural disasters in the past. The 2010 earthquake killed hundreds of thousands and left an estimated 60,801 people internally displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration. More than six years later, much of the shoddy infrastructure has yet to be rebuilt.Some also fear another cholera outbreak. Following the earthquake, U.N. peacekeepers accidentally brought the disease to the country. The organization didn’t admit its role in the 2010 outbreak until recently, even though the epidemic has killed at least 10,000 people and sickened hundreds of thousands.Haiti is the poorest country in the Northern Hemisphere, according to the World Food Programme. And emergency preparations for the storm seem to be minimal.The U.S. Agency for International Development said it’s prepared to offer emergency relief supplies, including shelter materials, blankets, hygiene kits, household items and water purification equipment, according to a statement released Sunday.But there are only about 1,300 emergency shelters across the country, enough to hold up to 340,000 people, according to the country’s civil protection agency. More than 10 million people live in Haiti.“Some of us will die but I pray it won’t be a lot,” Serge Barionette in the southern town of Gressier told CBS News."

At least 50 percent turnout in the plebiscite was required to legitimize the result.Along with other ex-Communist countries in eastern Europe, Hungary opposes a policy that would require all EU states to take in some of the hundreds of thousands of mainly Muslim migrants seeking asylum in the bloc after arriving last year.Orban told parliament the referendum had achieved its goal as more Hungarians, some 3.28 million, repudiated the migrant quotas than had voted for EU membership in a 2003 referendum.He said 1 million more voters supported his government’s migration policy now than voted for his Fidesz party in the 2014 parliamentary election, when he was returned to power.“This decision, this support (from the people) obliges me to act on it,” Orban told parliament as opposition lawmakers hissed and booed.“Fidesz and the Christian Democratic Party believe the appropriate, honest and necessary step is to give legal weight to the will of the people ... Therefore, I am initiating an amendment to the constitution,” he said, without elaborating.“MISTAKE”Jobbik chairman Gabor Vona has repeatedly called for a constitutional amendment to protectHungary from migrant quotas imposed by the European Commission.“Since yesterday you (Orban) have become a failed politician ... You will not be taken seriously by Brussels bureaucrats,” Vona said in parliament on Monday. “Brussels will ruthlessly exploit your irresponsibility and mistake.”Vona said EU authorities would zero in on the fact that the referendum failed legally, and this would weaken Hungary’s bargaining position in EU deliberations on migrant policy.The European Commission said it took note of Hungary’s referendum and it was up to Budapest to deal with the outcome.Vona also said the referendum result ended a era in which Orban’s government could use the migration issue to distract attention from all of Hungary’s problems under its watch, including serious corruption and emigration due to low wages.Orban has led resistance to the stance taken by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has said EU states have an obligation to share the burden of taking in refugees.He responded to the influx last year by sealing Hungary’s southern borders with a razor-wire fence and deploying thousands of soldiers and police.In power since 2010 and with his party still firmly ahead in opinion polls, Orban could still use the referendum to keep the issue of migration on the political agenda in the run-up to the 2018 election, some analysts say.Many Hungarians were disappointed with Sunday’s outcome.“What is at stake is the future of the country. The people should have voted for the future of our children and yet many people were too lazy to go to vote. They should be ashamed of themselves,” said Istvan Nemeth, a lawyer in Budapest.Orban says deciding whether to accept migrants is a matter of national sovereignty. He saysHungary - with its Christian roots - does not want to take in Muslims in large numbers as they pose a security risk.Human rights groups criticized Orban’s government for stoking fears and xenophobia with an aggressive campaign ahead of the referendum."

The United States and European Union imposed sanctions against Moscow its actions in Crimea.Kirby said the United States would continue to communicate with the Russian military to ensure that American and Russian aircraft operating in Syria do not come into conflict with each other.But he said the United States would withdraw all personnel it had dispatched to prepare for military co-operation with Russia under the latest ceasefire agreement.“Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments ...and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed,” Kirby said.U.N. envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said he “deeply regrets” the U.S. announcement but vowed to “to push energetically for a political solution” to end the war.Meanwhile, U.N. diplomats said the United Nations Security Council would begin to negotiate on Monday a draft resolution that urges Russia and the United States to ensure an immediate truce in Aleppo.China’s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said now was the time for more cooperation, but Britain’s Ambassador to the U.N. Matthew Rycroft said he was not surprised by Washington’s action."

The digital activist group Avaaz has started a global campaign to help American ex-pat voters cast ballots in the hope of helping to swing the election against Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f2902f170000f70aac913c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An international group of activists concerned about the rise of Donald Trump is helping Americans abroad cast absentee ballots in the hope of helping to defeat the Republican nominee ― and they’re counting on Mexico to play an outsized role. Avaaz, a global civic group with about 40 million members, launched a digital tool this month to help make it easier for Americans living outside the country’s borders to register to vote. It only takes a few minutes for users to enter their information and for the website to walk them through the registration process.The State Department estimates that about 7.6 million U.S. citizens live outside the country ― a number larger than the populations of all but 12 U.S. states ― and that another 70 million travel abroad each year. Provided someone is eligible to vote back home, all they have to do to vote while abroad is request an absentee ballot. Voters can generally register and receive their ballots online, and many states also allow them to submit their votes electronically.And yet, many people don’t bother. Just 12 percent of American expat voters cast a ballot in the 2012 election, estimates a study published this year by the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University. People serving in the military accounted for just over half of the absentee ballots requested, the study found. Yet Avaaz views Americans abroad as a group large enough to swing the presidential election. The group believes most U.S.-born expats tilt toward the progressive side of the spectrum. “There’s been a lot of appetite in our group for a while now to do something about Donald Trump, because he’s really seen as a global threat,” Emma Ruby-Sachs, the deputy director of Avaaz, told The Huffington Post. “There’s very little happening in the world that wouldn’t be affected by Donald Trump winning the presidency.”The group campaigned in Mexico City last week to spread the word about the tool and get more Americans to use it. Trump has repeatedly used America’s southern neighbor as a punching bag since launching his presidential campaign last year. But Avaaz notes that as many as 1 million American expats and migrants live in Mexico ― most of whom lean Democratic, according to the Houston Chronicle. Retired U.S. Army Col. Eric Rojo-Stevens, who has been living in Mexico for the last four years, is helping Avaaz spread the word about the tool. He served as a voting officer who helped distribute and collect ballots during his military days ― when the process was more complicated and depended on snail mail ― and hopes the tool will push more Americans to carry out their civic duty. “Voting is easy,” Rojo-Stevens said. “It just takes a few minutes. And it’s something we must do. Our future depends on who we elect.” Though a lifelong Republican, Rojo-Stevens says he’ll probably cast a ballot for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson on Nov. 8. “Trump’s ignorant comments about Mexicanas and the wall, that’s an obvious turnoff,” Rojo-Stevens said. “Whatever he does to the U.S.-Mexico relationship is going to affect all Americans here. And there are many people who do business here.” Anyone who wants to cast a vote from abroad should try to do so soon. The federal government recommends that Americans living abroad “get in the habit” of registering by January. But many people who haven’t registered yet still have time ― most states’ deadlines to register and request an absentee ballots fall this month.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

He once spotted an Eritrean child who had a clumsily drawn tattoo on his arm: It read, “One Day.” “If you leave Eritrea behind when you’re just 14 years old, you have the right to hope for a better life ahead,” Penso told HuffPost Italy. “That boy’s story encapsulates all the drama immigrants reaching Europe face: They’re looking for a mother, and find a stepmother instead. They’re looking for a warm embrace, and instead they find a windowless room from which they can’t even see the sun.”“For that boy, ‘one day’ finally arrived, but it was nothing like he imagined,” he added.That phrase inspired Penso’s most recent exhibition in Italy, which showcases his work documenting the perilous journey that people undertake to escape violence and persecution in their home countries. The crisis has drawn many photojournalists and photographers to the Mediterranean region and Europe, but Penso’s work has received particular acclaim. His photos were named Time magazine’s Pick for Story of the Year last year, and he has been awarded the Burn Emerging Photographer Fund, as well as the Magnum Foundation Emergency Fund.The desire to put a human face on the crisis keeps Penso going.“Through my photographs, I’m trying to show people what the refugee crisis is really like,” he said. Penso’s latest exhibition, One Day, will run from Oct. 6 to Oct. 27 at the Officine Fotografiche in Rome.

About $500 worth of Durban Poison,” he told HuffPost. Greenhand spent a week on the ganja gorilla, and even added a smokeable version of the 3-year-old child who slipped into Harambe’s cage at the Cincinnati Zoo.The challenge, he said, was getting a message that’s as strong as the marijuana inside.“I wanted Harambe to look innocent, as if he’s defending the child,” Greenhand said. Greenhand charges up to $10,000 for his elaborately designed joints, and they are usually happily smoked by his cannabis-loving customers.But that won’t happen with Harambe.“After I finished making it, there was so much symbolism connected with Harambe that I told Cannabend, ‘We shouldn’t smoke it,’” he said.Instead, Greenhand’s gorilla joint will be put on display behind glass.“It should last for at least five years without degrading,” he said.Greenhand’s tribute is already starting to attract visitors to the weed shop and that pleases him.“I think it’s good for people to see it in its natural habitat,” he said.You can see Greenhand’s work here and also below."
