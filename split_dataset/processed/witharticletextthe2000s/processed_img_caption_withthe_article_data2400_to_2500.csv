The Carto-founded group touts its support for Moore and his Foundation for Moral Law on its web site. The contribution to Moore’s group stands out as one of just a handful it has made to organizations not explicitly involved in Holocaust denial.The people who run the Foundation to Defend the First Amendment have an ideology that is, “Total Nazi; and notice I didn’t say neo-Nazi,” Todd Blodgett, the former head of the white supremacist record label Resistance Records — and later an FBI informant — told HuffPost.The contribution to Moore’s nonprofit from Carto’s group was found after a HuffPost review of public tax documents. There is no evidence that the nonprofit returned the check.Moore’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. His foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Carto, who died in 2015, was one of the most notable leaders of the racist and anti-Semitic far right in the U.S. after World War II. Through his Liberty Lobby political advocacy group and its attendant publications ― including American Free Press and SPOTLIGHT magazine ― he spread racist and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories to his readership. Carto supported former Alabama Gov. George Wallace’s segregationist presidential campaign in 1968 before founding the Populist Party, which gave a political platform for noted racists like David Duke. In 2004, he signed the Duke-penned New Orleans Protocol, which advocated for the mainstreaming of white supremacist ideology. Carto’s publications included those where the white supremacy was watered-down in an effort to target paleo-conservative supporters of Pat Buchanan. Other publications explicitly promoted Nazism and fascism.In addition to donating to Moore’s group, the Foundation to Defend the First Amendment provided tax-exempt donations to Carto publications including The Barnes Review, an explicitly white supremacist magazine that in 2004 ran an article stating that Adolf Hitler should have won the 1938 Nobel Peace Prize.But most of the nonprofit’s donations went to support Holocaust deniers, in particular those who faced prosecution in Europe or Canada. In 2005, the same year the foundation donated to Moore’s nonprofit, it also gave $1,000 to Ingrid Rimland, a Holocaust denier married to Ernst Zundel, who himself had been imprisoned in Germany for promoting Holocaust denial. The foundation also gave $1,000 that year to Germar Rudolf, whom the U.S. extradited to Germany to face Holocaust denial charges in 2005. The Canadian Association for Free Expression, a white supremacist group headed by Paul Fromm, also received $1,000 from the foundation in 2005. Two other $1,000 donations in 2005 went to a 9/11 truther group called Reopen911.org and to Police & Military Against New World Order, a far-right wing conspiracy organization. The latter group, however, returned the $1,000 donation in 2006.At the time the Foundation to Defend the First Amendment donated to support Moore’s nonprofit, the group was headed by a Carto protege named Jim Tucker Jr. Tucker, who died in 2013, was a writer for both SPOTLIGHT and American Free Press with a specialty in conspiracy theories related to the Bilderberg Group, an international collection of leaders in business and government. Other individuals who sat on the board of the nonprofit at that time included Christopher Bollyn, a 9/11 conspiracy theorist who claims Israel was behind the attacks, and American Free Press author Pat Shannan, who believes both 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing were committed by the U.S. government with Israeli help.“The basic goal of every editorial board meeting for Carto was to find out what’s upsetting people and find ways to blame it on Israel,” said Blodgett, who frequently sat in on editorial meetings at both SPOTLIGHT and The Barnes Review.Moore, a controversial figure even within Alabama, has emerged as a favorite of the far-right wing in the U.S. and earned the endorsement of former White House chief strategist and Breitbart head Steve Bannon. A former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore was kicked off the court in 2003 for refusing a court order to remove a statue of the Ten Commandants that he placed at the state courthouse. After winning election to serve as chief justice again in 2013, Moore was suspended in 2016 for refusing to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court’s Obergefell ruling that legalized same-sex marriage across the nation.Moore has called for the criminalization of homosexuality; said that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress; believes, without any evidence, that some parts of the U.S. live under Sharia Law; claimed, like President Donald Trump, that former President Barack Obama is not an American citizen; blamed the 9/11 attacks on gays and abortion; and lamented the divisions between “reds” and “yellows,” an apparent reference to Native Americans and Asian-Americans.Moore is “much closer to our ideal Alt-South candidate: Southern, Christian, populist and nationalist, slashing and willing to defy the federal government,” Shannan, the 9/11 truther who sat on the board of the Foundation to Defend the First Amendment when it donated to Moore’s nonprofit, wrote in an endorsement of Moore published last month. “The White vote in the South, which was splintered during the late 20th century, has reconsolidated like it was in the Jim Crow South.”Shannan added that he declined to endorse Moore until after the primary, because “it would have been fodder for a media narrative that ‘white supremacists support Roy Moore’ and would have been an unnecessary distraction in the race.”The receipt of a contribution from a bonafide pro-Nazi organization is far from the first controversy surrounding Moore’s Foundation for Moral Law. The nonprofit paid more than $1 million to Moore between 2007 and 2012, far more than the group reported on its tax disclosures, according to the Washington Post. Moore’s group also hosted two events at its offices by neo-Confederate, pro-secession groups, according to a CNN report. The foundation’s largest known donor is Michael Peroutka, a Maryland county commissioner who used to sit on the board of the League of the South, a white Christian separatist group, according to Talking Points Memo. The League of the South was one of the organizers of the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, that ended with the killing of a counter-protester.When HuffPost called the Foundation to Defend the First Amendment, the phone was answered by an operator who stated the location as American Free Press. HuffPost’s call was then directed to Chris Petherick, the editor-in-chief of American Free Press and current head of Carto’s foundation. When asked to explain the group’s 2005 donation to the Foundation for Moral Law, Petherick responded, “That’s Roy Moore.” Then he hung up.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said that Blodgett sat in on meetings at SPOTLIGHT and American Free Press. He sat in on meetings at SPOTLIGHT and The Barnes Review."

The winner receives a $65,000 cash prize."

The couple is expecting their second child together.The “Piano Man” singer, 68, confirmed the news in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, published on Saturday, saying, “We are due next month.” A rep for the musician confirmed the timeframe to HuffPost on Wednesday. Billy and Alexis have been together since 2009 and got married in the summer of 2015. They are already parents to 2-year-old daughter Della Rose. Billy is also father to 31-year-old Alexa Ray Joel with ex-wife Christie Brinkley. Just before the couple welcomed Della in 2015, Billy opened up about becoming a father in his 60s in an interview with UPI. “Pretty wild, huh?” he said at the time. “I’ve still got the mojo. I’m excited!”“I’m gonna spend a lot of time with this kid,” he said. “I was thinking about that. I’m probably going to be able to spend more time with this kid than most people are able to spend with their children, because I don’t have a regular job. I could be a stay-at-home dad for as long as I can stay alive.”Now he’ll have two little ones in the house to spend time with. "

Her latest series shows the rare disease experience in a new light.Hughes photographed patients and medical personnel dressed up in evening wear while going through everyday scenarios for people with rare diseases ― like having surgery, meeting with a medical consultant or getting treatment. She calls the series “Rare Beauty.”“With Rare Beauty, I wanted to encourage people to look at an image and want to know more,” Hughes told HuffPost. “In order to break down barriers it is important to engage with people, and to do that, you have to gain their interest. The thinking behind Rare Beauty was that people will be curious enough to wonder why the surgeon is wearing a dinner jacket or why an anesthetist is in an evening gown and read the story behind the image.”She added, “I also wanted to inject some beauty into environments that by their very nature can be sterile and uninviting.”Hughes’ work photographing people with rare diseases is inspired by her 10-year-old son Isaac who has a rare neurological condition called Moebius syndrome. “As a young child he was unable to walk, talk and we had to be incredibly careful with what he ate. Looking at him today and what he has achieved is inspiring,” the mom said, adding that he likes the same sorts of things other boys his age enjoy, such as soccer.“I recently drove him to school and he was chatting away to me when he said ‘I am a chatterbox aren’t I mummy?’” she recalled. “They are words I never thought I would hear. He still has support in school, and because of verbal dyspraxia it sometimes takes him longer to process things. But he has such a strong personality and is very determined to overcome any obstacles.”Through her “Rare” project and experience with Isaac, Hughes has met some amazing medical professionals, who inspired her to highlight “the wider impact of rare disease” in her work.“The effect of these often complex conditions can be far reaching, such as the families involved, the consultants in hospital who have to treat sometimes incredibly rare conditions or the nurse who might have to put on a big smile after having dealt with a difficult situation,” she explained. “With Rare Beauty I wanted to include some of the other people affected and tell their stories.”Hughes supplemented the photos with interviews and personal stories from the people involved, including the families, medical staff and ecclesiastical team at the two hospitals. She hopes that sharing these stories will encourage people to support those with rare diseases in their own communities. To create Rare Beauty, the photographer collaborated with Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Alder Hey Children’s Hospital and BBC’s Children In Need charity. Hughes and hospital representatives worked together to identify patients, families, surgeons, consultants, nurses, chaplains, lab staff and other people who might like to share their experiences. “It was very important for the families involved to share their stories as they live with the consequences of these diseases on a day-to-day basis and recognize that with more awareness comes acceptance, said Hughes. “For the staff it was an opportunity to show that they do not always know all the answers but they work in partnerships with the families on their rare disease journey.” The patients ranged in age from 1 to to 18 years old and had rare diseases or undiagnosed conditions. Charlotte James boutique in Chester loaned them clothes, so they had a variety of outfits and styles. “The patients and staff alike had a wonderful time dressing up and taking part. Even though the photo shoot was for a serious purpose, everyone enjoyed the experience,” said the photographer. With “Rare Beauty,” Hughes wants to raise awareness around the different challenges people like her son can face and how to support them. Said the photographer, “I hope that through these images people want to know more and consider the wider impact of rare disease. People assume that because something is rare it does not affect many people but this is far from reality.”"

Looking at him today and what he has achieved is inspiring,” the mom said, adding that he likes the same sorts of things other boys his age enjoy, such as soccer.“I recently drove him to school and he was chatting away to me when he said ‘I am a chatterbox aren’t I mummy?’” she recalled. “They are words I never thought I would hear. He still has support in school, and because of verbal dyspraxia it sometimes takes him longer to process things. But he has such a strong personality and is very determined to overcome any obstacles.”Through her “Rare” project and experience with Isaac, Hughes has met some amazing medical professionals, who inspired her to highlight “the wider impact of rare disease” in her work.“The effect of these often complex conditions can be far reaching, such as the families involved, the consultants in hospital who have to treat sometimes incredibly rare conditions or the nurse who might have to put on a big smile after having dealt with a difficult situation,” she explained. “With Rare Beauty I wanted to include some of the other people affected and tell their stories.”Hughes supplemented the photos with interviews and personal stories from the people involved, including the families, medical staff and ecclesiastical team at the two hospitals. She hopes that sharing these stories will encourage people to support those with rare diseases in their own communities. To create Rare Beauty, the photographer collaborated with Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Alder Hey Children’s Hospital and BBC’s Children In Need charity. Hughes and hospital representatives worked together to identify patients, families, surgeons, consultants, nurses, chaplains, lab staff and other people who might like to share their experiences. “It was very important for the families involved to share their stories as they live with the consequences of these diseases on a day-to-day basis and recognize that with more awareness comes acceptance, said Hughes. “For the staff it was an opportunity to show that they do not always know all the answers but they work in partnerships with the families on their rare disease journey.” The patients ranged in age from 1 to to 18 years old and had rare diseases or undiagnosed conditions. Charlotte James boutique in Chester loaned them clothes, so they had a variety of outfits and styles. “The patients and staff alike had a wonderful time dressing up and taking part. Even though the photo shoot was for a serious purpose, everyone enjoyed the experience,” said the photographer. With “Rare Beauty,” Hughes wants to raise awareness around the different challenges people like her son can face and how to support them. Said the photographer, “I hope that through these images people want to know more and consider the wider impact of rare disease. People assume that because something is rare it does not affect many people but this is far from reality.”"

8,HEALTHY LIVING,"In A Single Week, Plague Cases More Than Doubled In Madagascar",Lauren Weber,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plague-outbreak-madagascar_us_59dfcb1ce4b0a52aca169b21,A far more infectious airborne strain is hitting cities hard.,2017-10-18,"Government workers spray disinfectant during cleanup of a market in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, on Oct. 10.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e6658e150000a001746195.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of plague cases has more than doubled to a total of 805 in Madagascar in the past week, according to Madagascar’s Office of National Risk and Emergency Management.At least 74 people have died of the curable disease so far this year. There were 320 suspected and confirmed cases as of last Tuesday.While plague is endemic in the island country of Madagascar, which typically sees 400 or so cases in the September-to-April outbreak season, this recent outbreak has several differences.First, the infections began earlier in the season, with the first case in August. And, crucially, more than 70 percent of infections have been pneumonic, meaning they are airborne and spread person to person via saliva droplets when an infected person coughs, making them far more infectious and easily spread than the more typical bubonic cases, which are spread by fleas on rats.This also means those who live in dense urban areas are at greater risk, according to Nyka Alexander, commications officer for the World Health Organization, who is based in the capital, Antananarivo, the hardest-hit city.“More of the plague [is] in urban settings or in settings where people live closer together and in areas where they don’t normally have plague.”If discovered early, plague is easily curable in a few days with a round of antibiotics. But if left untreated, it’s nearly always fatal, according to WHO press officer Christian Lindmeier.Madagascar’s public health system is not currently equipped to handle this onslaught of cases or the airborne strain of the disease. The Antananarivo hospital that usually treats bubonic plague each year has a limited number of beds, so scaling up treatment facilities, antibiotics and contact tracers requires an international effort. Lindmeier told HuffPost last week that cases will continue to go up as international organizations, including the Red Cross, UNICEF and WHO, assist the Madagascar government and its Ministry of Health in looking for them.In Antananarivo, fear has been growing along with the rising death toll. While the WHO shipped over 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and $1.5 million in relief funds in early October, the capital has been shutdown. The international health community has called for an additional $5.5 million in funds. People have been banned from gathering in public spaces. Schools, public buildings and other gathering places have been closed. Local pharmacies saw a run on masks, which are not even effective unless they are changed often, according to UNICEF’s Madagascar deputy representative, Jean Benoit Manhes.“It’s too early to tell when this will get better,” Lindmeier said.While the outbreak had previously been contained to Antananarivo, which is known as Tana, and the coastal city of Toamasina, the WHO announced Sunday a probable case in a 34-year-old man who had visited Madagascar and returned to Seychelles on Oct. 6. WHO said Wednesday that the probable case and other potential cases in Seychelles had tested negative for the plague.A foreign national and 11 of the 34-year-old man’s close contacts remain hospitalized as a precaution, and hundreds more who were on his flight have been monitored.Manhes, who is based in Tana, says the country has not seen massive exits at the airports or from the city yet, and overall there is less risk of international contamination since Madagascar is an island. However, this could affect the end of tourism season in the next month or so. Manhes also stressed that people who have the plague are not contagious until they start exhibiting its flu-like symptoms.But the people in Tana are scared, according to Pedro Pablo Opeka. The Catholic priest, who goes by Father Pedro, was awarded the Legion of Honor for his work creating a 60,000-plus community for the poor called Akamasoa on the outskirts of Tana.“The current mood in Antananarivo is worrying, people are fearful of catching this deadly disease,” Father Pedro told HuffPost in an email.So far, the priest has only seen one fatality, a mother of seven. “We had to bury her at 2 a.m. and convince her family of the urgency so that others wouldn’t be contaminated. We succeeded in convincing them, and they didn’t resist, they accepted.”Much like in the Ebola epidemic before this, epidemiologists are concerned about the proper burial of infected bodies. In Madagascar, the custom is to “turn the bones” a year and a half after death, which Lindmeier said is not recommended for someone who has died of plague.“Everyone is pretty sensitive that you need to deal with the communities in the right way in order to make it possible for them to deal with their loved, deceased one in the best possible way,” Lindmeier said. “In Ebola, they originally took dead bodies away and didn’t let them be seen. That will be avoided this time.”This article has been updated to include WHO’s statement Wednesday with new test results."
9,POLITICS,Just 2 Of Trump's 19 CEO Advisers Condemn Order Targeting Muslims Over Chaotic Weekend,Emily Peck and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ceo-trump-muslims_us_588d5f26e4b08a14f7e66d10,It appears that many in the influential group aren't brave enough to stand up to the president.,2017-01-29,Elon Musk was one of the two CEOs who spoke publicly against Donald Trump's executive order targeting Muslims and refugees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588d5fef1b0000260004d003.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are nearly 20 chief executives and prominent business leaders signed up to advise President Donald Trump. But only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick have so far had the gumption to speak out against the president’s executive order blocking refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.The order, issued Friday, sparked protests at airports across the nation. By Saturday, a federal judge in Brooklyn had temporarily blocked parts of it.Chief executives of large corporations are nearly universal in their support for increased immigration. It’s hard to imagine that any CEO on Trump’s advisory panel supports a ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries in principle.But Trump’s power and the allure of the presidency are apparently enough to cow the corporate chiefs into staying silent on matters of law and fundamental American values.Musk and Kalanick may have been emboldened by fellow Silicon Valley CEOs, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, who were blasting Trump’s ban. Immigration is particularly important in the tech sector, which often looks outside the country to hire talent.“The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges,” Musk tweeted Saturday night, using the sort of mild language that counts for aggressive in the corporate world. Just days earlier, The New York Times reported that Musk and Trump having a “budding bromance.”Tesla employs a small number of people potentially affected by the ban. But the company does not believe any employees are being detained, a source familiar with the company told HuffPost. Tesla’s HR and legal teams are working with the employees who may be affected, the source said.Kalanick, who’s faced criticism for his role advising Trump, offered a more detailed response. In an email to Uber employees with the subject line “Standing up for what’s right,” the chief executive said he plans to raise the issue with Trump at the advisory board’s first meeting on Friday.“While every government has their own immigration controls,” Kalanick wrote in the note, which he also posted to Facebook, “allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.’s policy since its founding.”Kalanick said the order would have far-reaching effects at his ride-sharing company. A dozen or so Uber employees are legal residents but not naturalized citizens, and they may not be able to get back to the U.S. if they travel abroad. And thousands of drivers, who are not technically employed by Uber, may not be able to get back in the country for 90 days.“That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families—and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time,” he wrote.The CEO said Uber would compensate these drivers “pro bono” over the next three months to help them, with more details to come. A doctor at Cleveland Clinic, whose CEO is also on Trump’s board, said she was forced to leave the country hours after landing in New York on Saturday because she holds a passport from Sudan.In an email to employees, JPMorgan’s operating committee ― which includes Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who sits on Trump’s CEO advisory panel ― said it was committed to the company’s employees and lauded the strength of diversity, but did not criticize the ban in any way.In another internal message provided to The Huffington Post, the human resources leader at IBM said the company’s “first priority” was to identify and communicate with employees who were directly affected by the executive order. The memo also said the company would ensure that employees with “affected families” received the help they needed.General Motors said Sunday it is still assessing the impact of the order. A spokesperson from Boston Consulting Group, whose CEO Rich Lesser is on the council, told HuffPost that he is serving in that role as an individual, not as a representative of the consulting firm.Other companies whose CEOs are serving on Trump’s advisory council, including Disney, Walmart, General Electric and Blackstone, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Consulting firm Ernst & Young declined to comment on Trump’s policies when asked earlier this week.Meanwhile, a virtual who’s who of tech CEOs ― those not on Trump’s advisory board ― came out swinging on Saturday against the ban. Apple CEO Tim Cook told his employees that the company had already reached out to the White House to explain how bad this order is for employees, according to an internal email obtained by HuffPost. “There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday’s immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them,” Cook wrote.Earlier this week, Cook reportedly had dinner with Trump adviser (and son-in-law) Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump.“Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,” Cook wrote in his note.Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Syria is one of the countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban.Other tech CEOs spoke out against the order on various social media platforms.Netflix CEO Reed Hastings posted a Facebook message that said, “Trump’s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.”“Worse,” he added, “these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe.”Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who was snubbed from a recent meeting between Trump and other tech bigwigs, tweeted his disapproval Saturday night. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was born in India, offered up a more personal criticism in a post on LinkedIn. “As an immigrant and as a CEO, I’ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,” he wrote.At least 76 Microsoft employees have visas from the six countries listed in the ban, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote in an email to employees. The company is advocating against the policy.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos hasn’t commented, but in an email sent to employees on Saturday, the company’s head of human resources offered workers information on how to handle the new immigration policies, while also affirming its commitment to diversity.“From the very beginning, Amazon has been committed to equal rights, tolerance and diversity—and we always will be,” HR Vice President Beth Galetti wrote. “We’ve worked hard to attract talented people from all over the world, and we believe this is one of the things that makes Amazon great—a diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers.”Also on Saturday, Google recalled staff to the U.S. because of the Trump order. CEO Sundar Pichai, also born in India, slammed the administration’s move in an email obtained by Bloomberg.This article has been updated with a comment from General Motors, information on a Cleveland Clinic doctor, and internal messages from IBM and JPMorgan.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

10,ENTERTAINMENT,Academy Calls Possible Effect Of Trump's Ban On Foreign Nominees 'Extremely Troubling',Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/academy-awards-trump-ban_us_588cca81e4b08a14f7e62883,Director Asghar Farhadi is one Oscar nominee who could miss the ceremony.,2017-01-29,"Asghar Farhadi poses with his Academy Award for best foreign language film for ""A Separation"" in 2012.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588cd97117000030001d0e98.jpeg?cache=Bqn0Mlak0y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, responding on Saturday to reports that filmmaker Asghar Farhadi could miss the the 89th Academy Awards due to President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking millions of people from several majority-Muslim countries, called Farhadi’s possible absence “extremely troubling.”Farhadi, who won an Oscar in 2012 for his film “A Separation,” was born and lives in Iran, one of seven nations from which Trump has barred immigrants and visitors to the U.S. for at least 90 days. The Academy Awards air Feb. 26. In a statement provided to The Huffington Post on Saturday, an Academy spokesperson said that the group stands for the “human rights of all people” regardless of borders or religion. Farhadi, meanwhile, has yet to comment on the matter.“The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences,” the statement reads. “As supporters of filmmakers ― and the human rights of all people ― around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran ‘A Separation,’ along with the cast and crew of this year’s Oscar-nominated film ‘The Salesman,’ could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin.”Farhadi is nominated again this year in the best foreign language film category for “The Salesman,” which follows an Iranian couple starring in a local production of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman.”Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit that promotes diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Iran, was the first to speak out on Farhadi’s possible banning. The Tribeca Film Festival, which awarded Farhadi Best Narrative Feature in 2009 for his film “About Elly,” issued a similar statement, calling the situation “heartbreaking and unacceptable.”One of the stars of “The Salesman,” Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, spoke out earlier this week in anticipation of Trump’s executive order about boycotting this year’s ceremony.“Trump’s visa ban for Iranians and others is a racist move and unacceptable,” she wrote on social media in Persian and English. “Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won’t attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest.”In his 2012 Oscar acceptance speech for “A Separation,” Farhadi emphasized that the divide between the U.S. and Iran is fueled by politicians, not the people. He spoke about what the Academy’s recognition meant to Iranians watching at home. “At this time, many Iranians all over the world are watching us and I imagine them to be very happy,” he said. “They are happy not just because of an important award or a film or a filmmaker, but because at the time when talk of war, intimidation and aggression is exchanged between politicians, the name of their country Iran is spoken here through her glorious culture, a rich and ancient culture that has been hidden under the heavy dust of politics.”“I proudly offer this award to the people of my country,” he went on, “a people who respect all cultures and civilizations despite hostility and resentment.”In response to Trump’s executive order, the Iranian Foreign Ministry released a statement on Saturday that prohibits U.S. citizens from entering the country. Calling Trump’s ban an “open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation in particular,” the action signals a further deterioration of ties between the two nations. The Huffington Post has reached out to Farhadi’s representatives and will update this post accordingly. Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated that Alidoosti’s tweet was in Arabic and English."

On Saturday, the pop star tweeted her disgust for the action, which also bars Syrian refugees indefinitely. “This is devastating!” she wrote, seemingly referring to the president as “an immoral pig.” That same night, a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, put a temporary halt on parts of Trump’s executive order. Thousands of demonstrators gathered to protest the travel ban at airports across the country.Aside from Rihanna, plenty of other stars, such as Debra Messing, Michael Moore and Alyssa Milano, expressed their anger and sadness about the executive order on social media. John Legend also spoke out about the issue at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday night. The Grammy winner went off-script while presenting a clip from “La La Land” to deliver a poignant speech about acceptance. “Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump,” Legend said. “I want to specifically tonight reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.” "

DuVernay stated, “The audience needs to voice what we want to see and get involved in the storytelling.” She added that it’s about “changing the narrative.” The panel included a diverse group of speakers including Los Angeles Police Commissioner Cynthia McClain-Hill, Hip-Hop Artist Nipsey Hussle, and Melina Abdullah, Professor and Chair of Department of Pan-African Studies at Cal State University, LA, as well as the Los Angeles chapter lead of Black Lives Matter.The panel discussion, sponsored by www.blackwoodalliance.com in partnership with The California Endowment, included conversations about the importance of artists involvement in raising the consciousness of people to empower positive change. DuVernay pointed out that “traditional roles are changing in terms of access.” When asked by DuVernay how to get more young people involved in social change, Nipsey Hussle stated, “Content creators influence the young people. Let young people know that we have the power to create what we need.” Melina Abdullah thanked DuVernay for “using her voice” to create change, calling it “art for liberation.”Ava DuVernay poignantly pointed out that the “13th” is more than just a documentary to be watched, she stated that audiences should be compelled to look at their belief systems and behavior and possibly be inspired enough to be moved.The “13th” is showing in 190 countries in the world."

The recent conflict has exacerbated this situation as ongoing insecurity has hamstrung humanitarian efforts. In a country where 40% of the population are under 15, over half of the 2.3 million people affected by the fighting are children, meaning the conflict will have a significant ripple effect on CAR’s future development. Three years on, a quarter of schools remain closed due to damage inflicted by militias, insecurity and displacement; only a third of children are enrolled. Thousands became child soldiers and remain too traumatized to return to the classroom.Theirs is a childhood interrupted, a childhood lost.But as tragic as the situation is in the country, beyond the region, public interest is minimal and fleeting. The situation in CAR has often been billed as the “forgotten crisis”, overshadowed by events in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. But an aid worker told me this tag was paradoxical. To be forgotten, they told me, implies this obscure West African nation was actually ever in our collective consciousness. So this poses an age-old quandary for foreign correspondents: how do you make people care about strangers in a faraway land? And with President Trump’s isolationist and insular stance, with the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union, we arguably live in an era of ever-shrinking geographic and political borders. How also can reporters combat the superficial and temporary ‘clicktivism’ that we saw with the ‘Kony 2012’ campaign? CAR was also only the briefest of blips in the news cycle a few years ago with journalists parachuting in to cover the conflict itself, but not its aftermath. The news beast has to be fed, and the media spotlight quickly moves on to the next disaster, the next war. So how can a journalist engage and hold an audience’s attention on a country once the guns have fallen silent?Casting my mind back to my own childhood, I came up with a possible answer to these important questions. I remembered my love of the choose-your-own-adventure-style books that were so popular in the 80s - books that empowered the reader to direct the narrative. Should I enter the haunted house? Who do I choose as my guide through the mountains? Such an approach always made me feel infinitely more invested in the story. And so my upcoming #ArtBeyondBorders photo/graphic novel will adopt a similar participatory approach. I have produced immersive online comics on child marriage, female genital mutilation, and female child soldiers before. The power of the illustrated format can be harnessed to immediately hook an audience into an intimate virtual conversation with its characters like a monochrome block of text never could. But this project will veer away from the traditional reporter-audience paradigm; I want readers to take on a less passive role and to make the experience truly “interactive”. In addition to following my field updates via the #ArtBeyondBorders hashtag on Twitter and Instagram, I want to transport readers to CAR, to cross borders with me. Travel with Central African artist Didier Kassai and I as we visit classrooms, vocational skills training centres, refugee camps, villages and hospitals from tomorrow until the end of February. Help me with the storytelling, become an “armchair foreign correspondent”.: What questions didn’t I ask; who should ‘we’ speak to, or what should ‘we’ report on, next. This “live” feedback I hope will not only allow me to address issues I may have overlooked in my reporting while still in situ, but also make you, the reader, feel like you’re investing in the project. You can also help me make difficult editorial decisions during the production phase before we release the graphic novel and 360 video in Summer 2017. What topics do we focus on? Whose stories do we discard?The #ArtBeyondBorders project ultimately strives to produce an empathy engine, a mechanism that will improve the storytelling and help break down borders. But any machine is only as efficient as its component parts, its cogs, and pistons -- or in this case, you, the reader.This project is supported by the 'Innovation in Development Reporting Grant' programme of the European Journalism Centre, financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."

And with President Trump’s isolationist and insular stance, with the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union, we arguably live in an era of ever-shrinking geographic and political borders. How also can reporters combat the superficial and temporary ‘clicktivism’ that we saw with the ‘Kony 2012’ campaign? CAR was also only the briefest of blips in the news cycle a few years ago with journalists parachuting in to cover the conflict itself, but not its aftermath. The news beast has to be fed, and the media spotlight quickly moves on to the next disaster, the next war. So how can a journalist engage and hold an audience’s attention on a country once the guns have fallen silent?Casting my mind back to my own childhood, I came up with a possible answer to these important questions. I remembered my love of the choose-your-own-adventure-style books that were so popular in the 80s - books that empowered the reader to direct the narrative. Should I enter the haunted house? Who do I choose as my guide through the mountains? Such an approach always made me feel infinitely more invested in the story. And so my upcoming #ArtBeyondBorders photo/graphic novel will adopt a similar participatory approach. I have produced immersive online comics on child marriage, female genital mutilation, and female child soldiers before. The power of the illustrated format can be harnessed to immediately hook an audience into an intimate virtual conversation with its characters like a monochrome block of text never could. But this project will veer away from the traditional reporter-audience paradigm; I want readers to take on a less passive role and to make the experience truly “interactive”. In addition to following my field updates via the #ArtBeyondBorders hashtag on Twitter and Instagram, I want to transport readers to CAR, to cross borders with me. Travel with Central African artist Didier Kassai and I as we visit classrooms, vocational skills training centres, refugee camps, villages and hospitals from tomorrow until the end of February. Help me with the storytelling, become an “armchair foreign correspondent”.: What questions didn’t I ask; who should ‘we’ speak to, or what should ‘we’ report on, next. This “live” feedback I hope will not only allow me to address issues I may have overlooked in my reporting while still in situ, but also make you, the reader, feel like you’re investing in the project. You can also help me make difficult editorial decisions during the production phase before we release the graphic novel and 360 video in Summer 2017. What topics do we focus on? Whose stories do we discard?The #ArtBeyondBorders project ultimately strives to produce an empathy engine, a mechanism that will improve the storytelling and help break down borders. But any machine is only as efficient as its component parts, its cogs, and pistons -- or in this case, you, the reader.This project is supported by the 'Innovation in Development Reporting Grant' programme of the European Journalism Centre, financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."

This in Washington DC today. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588e639b17000018002d91be.jpg?ops=crop_0_80_1600_1120%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Today’s rally in Washington D.C. was one of many protesting the executive order signed by President Trump on Friday that amounts to a ban on Muslims from a range of countries in the Middle East, and was very different from any march I’ve seen before. The visa suspensions are a propaganda gift for ISIS, and have hit a nerve at the core of American society. The executive order calls for the suspension of visas, immigrant and nonimmigrant entry from seven Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Sudan), a suspension of the refugee resettlement program, an indefinite suspension to U.S. resettlement of Syrian refugees, and directs the State Department to prioritize religious minorities for entry into the United States over other vulnerable groups, restricting resettlement of Muslim refugees from Muslim-majority countries. It has also sparked a broad range of protest across the country.Today’s event in Washington was the perfect answer to the question posed after the Women’s Marches last week of What Happens Next? The executive order mobilized thousands of people to flock to airports last night in solidarity with detained immigrants, to demonstrate their opposition to the order of offer legal help. More marched today in many American cities and towns.Today’s atmosphere wasn’t like anything I’d ever witnessed at an American demonstration. My first big American protest was in 1983, the twentieth anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther King’s I have a dream speech. It was a huge March for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, a show of strength by the American labor movement and others. I’ve been to plenty in the 34 years since, and given speeches at some. But today’s protest had a completely different taste, as though the country is teetering on the edge of a political earthquake with people from vastly different backgrounds ready to stand firm for basic values of rights.Today Veterans for American Ideals, a group of more than 2000 veterans of the U.S. armed forces, urged President Trump to reconsider the ban. The new administration, less than two weeks old, is already inspiring a formidable and eclectic coalition of opposition against its early actions targeting refugees.Something different is taking shape in the U.S. and the visa ban has triggered a spontaneous reaction to protect human rights. Anger and actions are growing at what many see as an Islamophobic act “This is taking us back 70 years, you can’t ban an entire religious group to solve a problem. Trump claims it’s not a Muslim ban but he’s allowing religious minorities in from those Muslim-majority countries on the list,” said Muslim-American Mobashra Tazamal who was at the march today. “People are often fleeing from violence enabled by America.”The executive order is an obvious attempt to block vulnerable Muslim refugees fleeing terrorism and persecution from securing safety in the U.S., and helps fuel ISIS’s charges that the West is at war with the entire Muslim faith. History is made by people who say no, and last night and today Americans from across the country said no to the targeting of refugees, no to the visa bans and no to Islamophobia. "
16,WOMEN,There Is Still Work Ahead For Workplace Equity,"Linda A.

According to the National Women’s Law Center, female workers are still typically paid just 79 cents for every dollar paid to male workers. The disparity is even worse for many women of color, with African-American and Latina women being paid only 60 and 55 cents, respectively, for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. This is why Equal Pay Day will be “celebrated” this April, along with sister Equal Pay Days later in the year to recognize women workers of color – these days symbolize how far into the year women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year.When President Obama signed the first piece of legislation of his administration, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, this law not only lifted the time restriction for filing a claim under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, but recognized numerous practices as discriminatory – think career ladder or other promotion denials, tenure denials, and failure to respond to requests for raise – all of which had an effect on achieving pay parity.Essentially, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act removed some of the obstacles women faced when trying to advocate for themselves to achieve equal pay.While the act recognized the reality of wage discrimination, its enactment was especially critical forvictims of domestic and workplace violence. Consider this: discriminatory practices by employers in terms of wages, raises, and promotions negatively impact workers and their wages, but for a survivor, the financial insecurity caused by the pay gap and the low wages it perpetuates means it’s all the more difficult to escape a violent situation at home or at work. If a woman relies on her partner’s income to bolster her economic stability or is barely making ends meet in a low-wage job, she has little to no resources to change her living or work circumstances. This makes workers in low-wage industries especially vulnerable to sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking and trafficking. Their workplaces—retail, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, clinics, private residences and farms—often make them vulnerable to perpetrators, while their economic precariousness makes them less likely to report incidents or seek help. Exacerbating the challenges these workers face, many of them earn less than the national average wage, endure unsafe and exploitative working conditions, and may have uncertain immigration status. Barriers such as immigration status, skill level, education and language ability may prevent them from reporting harassment or abuse, on the job or at home, and bringing perpetrators to justice.While we need to raise the minimum wage to a livable wage, robust laws and policies to end discrimination and harassment in the workplace, and stronger health and safety regulations to improve working conditions, workplaces also have an important role to play to create fair, safe and healthful work environments. All employers, but especially those with low-wage workforces, should take steps, such as paying fair wages to all of their employees without regard to gender, and providing flexible leave policies and other resources that can help workers experiencing violence, to ensure their workers are financially secure and have the ability to escape dangerous situations.We hope on the anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, employers take note of the importance of fair pay and fair treatment of all workers – men and women. It’s not only the right thing to do; it can save women from violence, and could even save lives.If you’re looking to learn more about workplace safety and equity, head over to our website for resources.Linda A.

Chesnut, Ph.D., author of Transforming the Mainline Church, co-authored this piece.

Chesnut, Ph.D., author of Transforming the Mainline Church, co-authored this piece.Full disclosure: The authors are part of a large extended family which includes dozens of Syrian Muslims. Over the past few days several of them have been tragically caught up in President Trump’s banning admission to the U.S. by nationals of seven predominantly Muslim countries.One is a student at Harvard Medical School who was refused reentry after having traveled to Jordan for a medical conference. The other is a young mother of four children who were denied boarding on a flight from the Middle East to rejoin their husband/father in California.So, is Trump’s ban justifiable? Possibly so, were it were based on any coherent, effective rationale for protecting Americans from terrorism. That, however, is clearly not the case.Over the past three decades not a single citizen of any one of those seven countries has been responsible for any act of terror in the U.S. In fact, Americans have a greater chance of being killed by a gun-toting toddler! Of course, the most curious omission from Trump’s list of seven countries is Saudi Arabia, the home country of almost all the 9/11 terrorists and the premier national source of radical Sunnism.The ban is obviously nothing but a cruel and badly bungled back-door attempt at fulfilling Trump’s absurd campaign promise to ban Muslims from our shores.In addition, the ban carves out an exception for Christians. How then can this be viewed as anything other than unjustifiable discrimination based on prejudice toward certain religious faiths and nationalities? That is clearly in violation of our constitution, our laws, and our values.We are a nation of immigrants who have proudly celebrated our welcome to the “tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” in the words of Emma Lazarus’s poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, one of our most cherished national emblems.Is it Christian? We ask that question because President Trump claims to be a Presbyterian and because a large majority of white Christians (particularly Evangelicals at 81 percent) voted for him. Christians, Jews, and Muslims, of course, share an extensive range of sacred scripture and common values.On the very weekend this ban was signed, Christians of many denominations heard read in their churches the prophetic words of Micah 6:8: “This is what the Lord requires of you: Only to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.” Justice, kindness and a humble attitude: This is the standard and this is the test of true faith, often enjoined upon God’s people in scripture as an imperative to welcome and treat fairly the alien and the foreigner.Jesus said that at the very heart of the matter are the dual and inseparable commandments to love God with all our whole self and our neighbors as ourselves—practically expressed by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, tending to those imprisoned, and welcoming the stranger. Furthermore, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were refugees, fleeing for their very lives from the murderous tyranny of King Herod, just as millions of innocent Syrians have been fleeing the deadly tyranny of both Assad and ISIS.Beyond the hundreds of thousands lives impacted, Trump’s ban runs contrary to the national interest. It will alienate a new generation of Muslim youth not only in the seven nations but also across the Muslim world. Commanders of the Caliphate must view Trump’s ban as a godsend, which will supply them with many fresh recruits who become convinced that the U.S. is embarking on a crusade against Islam.And while the near-extermination of Christians in Iraq and Syria at the bloody hand of ISIS is of grave concern and demands action, the linking of it to the creation of Cristocracy in the U.S. must be rejected. If religion of all stripes flourishes in our country, it’s because of the absence of state-sponsored faith. Vice President Pence and others in Trump’s cabinet espouse a volatile mix of theocracy and Islamophobia that puts our cherished freedoms of both religion and non-belief at risk.In short, Trump’s back-door Muslim ban must be rejected as inhumane, contrary to the national interest and at odds with Christian values."

America again watched in horror, grieving the cruel effects of terrorism on our homeland. But regardless of gender, faith, or national origin, we were all Americans on that tragic day.Fast forward, 13 months later, and President Trump’s executive order imposing a ban on the very same Americans, now prevents their families from visiting, denies them access to emergency medical treatment in the U.S., and separates them from their loved ones indefinitely.We are all too familiar with adversarial relations between our government and that of Iran. However, the great majority of Iranians who came to America, as many other immigrant groups and refugees before them, did so to leave behind persecution and oppression. They are victims, not terrorists, and by virtue of that very fact, Iranians are the least likely to engage in terrorism. Furthermore, by using a broad brush to label all Muslims as enemies of America, the order ignores the fact that there has never been a single act of terror committed by anyone of Iranian descent in the United States. Iranians were not among the perpetrators of 9/11 or the San Bernardino attack or any of the other acts of terror that have taken place in the United States. If anything, Iranians are today a primary target and victim of ISIS – which targets not only Christians, Jews and other “infidels,” but also rejects Iran’s Shia Islam as a perversion of the faith. This is all the more remarkable given the fact that countries whose nationals have been active in committing acts of terror on U.S. soil are entirely exempted from this order, calling into question its efficacy and intent. Moreover, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that the people of Iran have consistently demonstrated their affinity for the core values of our American democracy including liberty, freedom, and the rule of law. On 9/11 they spontaneously held emotional candlelight vigils expressing solidarity with our victims. So, by unfairly targeting all Iranians, the executive order undermines the solidarity between those who live in democratic countries like America and those working hard to implement these ideals in their own countries. Here, Iranian Americans prove every day that we are patriotic and fully support our national security concerns. We serve on the front lines of our national defense, whether on the battlefield, in government, or as technology-providers and first responders. However, given the questionable legality of such a widespread ban based on national origin or faith, today we offer our loyal opposition to the blanket ban on the entry of Iranian nationals, viewing it as misplaced punishment and detrimental to our national security. This sentiment is consistent with what then-Governor Pence declared in December 2015: “Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.”Instead, we believe a balance can be struck that addresses our national security concerns without alienating more than two million Americans of Iranian descent, 70 million Iranian nationals and Muslims worldwide while imposing unnecessary pain and human suffering on the innocent. Accordingly, The Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA) urges the president to make clear that his executive order does not ban the re-entry of established permanent residents, dual nationals and those who have secured valid visas, and to avoid a policy based on national origin and faith. Even President Reagan exempted the relatives of Americans in 1986 with respect to the entry of Cubans into the United States. This in no way contradicts the need for rigorous background checks, which we agree is essential. As a nation of immigrants, America has always made room for the next wave of “the tired, the poor and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free ...” Without exception, each wave of immigrants has had to pay its dues before fully assimilating into America: The fact is, street discrimination is a simple reality every immigrant faces, but that immigrant has always looked up to the Constitution and the Office of the President to act as his or her champion, guaranteeing that they will never be violated by way of legalized discrimination. As the leader of a nation of immigrants, it is our sincere hope that President Trump will adhere to the best of American values and reevaluate his executive order, keeping it consistent with our constitutional values and the governing immigration laws of the land, while ensuring our national security. Accordingly, we urge the amendment of the order to exclude relatives of American citizens as well as permanent residents and students, no matter what their national origin or faith."

The general ban on those from the named countries remains.ISIS has been pushing a line that the West is at war with Islam and that Muslims will be forced to take sides for or against the U.S. and that there will be no “gray zone” in between. ISIS predicted in its glossy magazine Dabiq in 2015 that “The Muslims in the West will quickly find themselves between one of two choices ....Eventually, the grayzone will become extinct and there will be no place for grayish calls and movements.”The visa bans imposed by the new administration chime perfectly with this analysis, and are effectively a blanket ban on Muslims coming from much of the middle east, including those fleeing from ISIS in Syria and Iraq. It’s polarization that ISIS craves, and what President Trump has just handed them. In a 7,000 word essay on “The Extinction of the gray-zone,” ISIS laid out its reasoning for the elimination of any middle ground. TWO CAMPS WITH NO THIRD IN BETWEEN explains the Dabiq headline, and quotes Osama Bin Laden commending President George W. Bush. “The world today is divided into two camps,” said Bin Laden. “Bush spoke the truth when he said ‘Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.’ Meaning, either you are with the crusade or you are with Islam.”By preventing many Muslims from coming to America, including those who are already legal permanent residents of the U.S. but happened to be out of the country when the order was issued, President Trump has encouraged suspicion against all Muslims, exactly what ISIS is hoping for. President Obama understood this dynamic, and how important it was to avoid it. Last year he said  “Groups like ISIL [ISIS] and al Qaeda want to make this war a war between Islam and America, or between Islam and the West. They want to claim that they are the true leaders of over a billion Muslims around the world who reject their crazy notions.... That’s their propaganda. That’s how they recruit. And if we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire religion ― then we’re doing the terrorists’ work for them...It won’t make us more safe; it will make us less safe ― fueling ISIL’s notion that the West hates Muslims, making young Muslims in this country and around the world feel like no matter what they do, they’re going to be under suspicion and under attack. It makes Muslim Americans feel like they’re government is betraying them.”If a basic rule of war is doing what your enemy least wants you to do, Trump’s action is a massive blunder. Quite apart from the moral considerations of what it means to turn people away who are escaping from terrorism, this is a particularly dense move in the fight against ISIS.Dareen Khalifa is Deputy Director of The Day After Association, an independent, Syrian-led civil society organization working to support democratic transition in Syria. “There will be rejoicing in the ranks of ISIS at what Trump has done,” she said. “It’s a counterproductive, dangerous act that hurts Syria and helps terrorists.”"

Lupu, F. Elwood and Eleanor Davis Professor of Law Emeritus, George Washington University Law SchoolDonald Trump’s recent order, cruelly and arbitrarily barring refugees and Muslim immigrants from entering the United States, is just the latest despicable act by an illegitimate president. Orders of this sort are unfortunately unsurprising. They are an expected outgrowth of Trump’s racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBTQIA agenda. Trump’s illegitimate presidency and his anti-American agenda are why millions of people joined the Women’s March the day after his inauguration. Marchers advocated human rights for all, social and economic justice for all. The marchers, and many millions of others, are determined to oppose and resist a President who lost the popular vote, and whose election came about through voter suppression, intervention by the FBI, and conspiracy with Russian operatives. Since his Inauguration, Trump has taken numerous actions that reinforce the necessity for this resistance. In addition to his viciously inhumane and unlawful order to block refugees and Muslim immigrants from entering the United States, his anti-immigrant agenda has already taken the form of an order to build a hateful, wasteful, and ridiculously expensive wall on portions of our border with Mexico. His outrageous lies, continuously repeated in a hopeless effort to legitimize his illegitimate presidency, about supposedly fraudulent voting in the 2016 election, provide additional cause to refuse to normalize. Like his absurd claim that more people attended his Inauguration than any other, his assertion about voter fraud would be laughable if it were not so subversive of our democracy. But phony allegations of fraud are the only way for Trump to argue that he won more votes than Hillary Clinton. Trump’s neurotic claims about the size of his electoral and popular support, his minions’ outlandish lies in support of his claims, and their clumsy attempts to intimidate the press, would all be laughable if they too weren’t so serious. Those actions are a threat to the Constitution and the norms of American democracy. Trump’s nominations of corrupt and incompetent nominees for high public office are dangerous and deplorable, and risk grave harm to the social fabric, economic well-being, and quality of justice in the United States. Trump’s character failings, his illegitimacy, and his dangerous plans for the nation all require resistance. All demand a concerted and collective determination to never normalize.The American people, including many who have never before engaged in politics, are galvanized, determined and strong. The admirable and energetic resistance has included public protests; phone calls to our elected representatives; financial contributions to the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other organizations committed to fight Trump’s radical agenda; and a vast array of mobilizations and creative acts, large and small. In a rapid response to the order banning refugees and Muslims, several federal judges quickly ordered the government not to return detainees, stranded in U.S. airports, back to their countries of nationality, but their status remains uncertain. Spontaneous protests erupted at JFK airport and elsewhere. The University of Michigan announced it would not provide the government information about its students’ immigration status, and New York cab drivers boycotted JFK airport during rush hour as a symbol of solidarity and protest.The resistance has, so far, arisen organically. Millions of Americans have been encouraging, demanding, participating in, and even leading the resistance. Our Democratic Senators and representatives in Congress ideally should be at the point of this spear, at the front of this resistance. At the least, they should be following the lead of the American people, and joining the all-out resistance.What they absolutely should not do is subtly undercut the resistance by acts of collaboration and normalization. Unfortunately, they have done so. Democratic leaders have publicly stated their plan is to not block everything, but rather to pick their fights. Even before Trump was nominated, they offered an olive branch, asserting that they would work with Trump on issues where they agreed. Those are commitments to normal behavior by members of the opposition party at the beginning of a normal presidency.We admire the seventy members of the House of Representatives who boycotted the Inauguration, but it would have been far more powerful if every Democratic Senator and House member had similarly boycotted. That would not have undermined the peaceful transfer of power, but it would have signaled that this president does not deserve and should not receive any semblance of normal respect.We admire the two New York Representatives who traveled to JFK airport to stand in solidarity with the refugees being held there. But it would have been far more powerful – and an important act of leadership of the resistance – if many more elected officials had joined them and had called for work stoppages, demonstrations, or other forms of protest.Normalizing was acquiescing and participating in hearings and votes on cabinet nominees, even when Trump had not yet been sworn into office and thus lacked any authority to make those nominations. That, too, is normal behavior from every opposition party at the beginning of a presidency. And the business-as usual treatment of nominees has taken other forms, as well. Ben Carson is totally unqualified to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, yet even Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, two of the most progressive and thoughtful members, voted in his favor in Committee. That is an act of normalizing Trump.In fairness, Warren, Brown and others have resisted. Schumer, for example, pledged to fight Trump and his fellow Republicans “tooth and nail” on most issues, but he added that “Democrats wouldn’t say ‘no’ to a proposal just because the president-elect supports it.” The qualification about selective opposition, presumably made in an effort to sound reasonable, is also a form of normalization.What would it mean for Democratic leaders to stop normalizing? First, they must forcefully object to every nominee unless he or she offers persuasive evidence of integrity and competence. Second, every Executive Order the president signs should be met by legislation, sponsored by all Democrats, designed to overturn the order unless it is demonstrably good policy. None of the Executive Orders to date come close to meeting that standard. In order to slow down all action, Democratic Senators should refuse unanimous consent to everything. The Deputy Chief of Staff to now-retired Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has provided an excellent justification for why this should be done, a blueprint for how to accomplish it, and an analysis of its beneficial impact.Unanimous consent should only be granted if Democrats wrest concessions for doing so. If Democratic legislators determine it is in the national interest to support legislation, they can do so, but they should not announce they will do so ahead of time, and certainly not trade their legitimizing votes for crumbs.They should not be restrained by normal rules of decorum at the State of the Union and other public addresses. While they should attend and let Trump speak, they should be quick to boo and to shout “You lie!” and “Putin’s Puppet!” when Trump’s assertions call for those reactions. Perilous times call for disruptive measures.When this illegitimate president and his GOP collaborators act outrageously, such as issuing a ban on refugees, and when resistors start to act, Democratic leaders should help shine a spotlight on those actions and join in them. Perilous times call for courage and solidarity.In addition to resisting, Democratic leaders should offer positive alternatives to bad policy proposals. In response to the Republican calls for repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats should demand Medicare for all. They should hold their own hearings – outside the Senate, if the Republicans refuse them space – on every issue where the American people are not being heard.Democrats must offer a new, bold, and progressive agenda, on which the next election can be a referendum. In short, they should lead the resistance and offer hope to a dispirited, angry, and frightened nation.We recognize that much of what we are calling for represents a radical inversion of the norms of our democracy. But a horrifying inversion of those norms by those in power demands a response in kind. Many may believe that the kind of behavior we are recommending will undermine our political institutions, and stimulate a race to the bottom in political decency. In normal times, we might agree, but the breadth and intensity of the resistance to Trump’s presidency is a powerful signal that these are not normal times. Under current conditions, lawful resistance is essential to preserve our democracy.These are dangerous moments for the Republic, and the rapidly exploding political crisis of early 2017 is what brings resisters to the street. We will be back in the streets on many occasions in the immediate future. The minority party must act like the loyal opposition – loyal to the Constitution, not to the pretenders to the throne.We recognize that it will take courage of many kinds – political, economic, and even physical – for the established institutions of political opposition to rise to this moment.

Lupu, F. Elwood and Eleanor Davis Professor of Law Emeritus, George Washington University Law SchoolDonald Trump’s recent order, cruelly and arbitrarily barring refugees and Muslim immigrants from entering the United States, is just the latest despicable act by an illegitimate president. Orders of this sort are unfortunately unsurprising. They are an expected outgrowth of Trump’s racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBTQIA agenda. Trump’s illegitimate presidency and his anti-American agenda are why millions of people joined the Women’s March the day after his inauguration. Marchers advocated human rights for all, social and economic justice for all. The marchers, and many millions of others, are determined to oppose and resist a President who lost the popular vote, and whose election came about through voter suppression, intervention by the FBI, and conspiracy with Russian operatives. Since his Inauguration, Trump has taken numerous actions that reinforce the necessity for this resistance. In addition to his viciously inhumane and unlawful order to block refugees and Muslim immigrants from entering the United States, his anti-immigrant agenda has already taken the form of an order to build a hateful, wasteful, and ridiculously expensive wall on portions of our border with Mexico. His outrageous lies, continuously repeated in a hopeless effort to legitimize his illegitimate presidency, about supposedly fraudulent voting in the 2016 election, provide additional cause to refuse to normalize. Like his absurd claim that more people attended his Inauguration than any other, his assertion about voter fraud would be laughable if it were not so subversive of our democracy. But phony allegations of fraud are the only way for Trump to argue that he won more votes than Hillary Clinton. Trump’s neurotic claims about the size of his electoral and popular support, his minions’ outlandish lies in support of his claims, and their clumsy attempts to intimidate the press, would all be laughable if they too weren’t so serious. Those actions are a threat to the Constitution and the norms of American democracy. Trump’s nominations of corrupt and incompetent nominees for high public office are dangerous and deplorable, and risk grave harm to the social fabric, economic well-being, and quality of justice in the United States. Trump’s character failings, his illegitimacy, and his dangerous plans for the nation all require resistance. All demand a concerted and collective determination to never normalize.The American people, including many who have never before engaged in politics, are galvanized, determined and strong. The admirable and energetic resistance has included public protests; phone calls to our elected representatives; financial contributions to the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other organizations committed to fight Trump’s radical agenda; and a vast array of mobilizations and creative acts, large and small. In a rapid response to the order banning refugees and Muslims, several federal judges quickly ordered the government not to return detainees, stranded in U.S. airports, back to their countries of nationality, but their status remains uncertain. Spontaneous protests erupted at JFK airport and elsewhere. The University of Michigan announced it would not provide the government information about its students’ immigration status, and New York cab drivers boycotted JFK airport during rush hour as a symbol of solidarity and protest.The resistance has, so far, arisen organically. Millions of Americans have been encouraging, demanding, participating in, and even leading the resistance. Our Democratic Senators and representatives in Congress ideally should be at the point of this spear, at the front of this resistance. At the least, they should be following the lead of the American people, and joining the all-out resistance.What they absolutely should not do is subtly undercut the resistance by acts of collaboration and normalization. Unfortunately, they have done so. Democratic leaders have publicly stated their plan is to not block everything, but rather to pick their fights. Even before Trump was nominated, they offered an olive branch, asserting that they would work with Trump on issues where they agreed. Those are commitments to normal behavior by members of the opposition party at the beginning of a normal presidency.We admire the seventy members of the House of Representatives who boycotted the Inauguration, but it would have been far more powerful if every Democratic Senator and House member had similarly boycotted. That would not have undermined the peaceful transfer of power, but it would have signaled that this president does not deserve and should not receive any semblance of normal respect.We admire the two New York Representatives who traveled to JFK airport to stand in solidarity with the refugees being held there. But it would have been far more powerful – and an important act of leadership of the resistance – if many more elected officials had joined them and had called for work stoppages, demonstrations, or other forms of protest.Normalizing was acquiescing and participating in hearings and votes on cabinet nominees, even when Trump had not yet been sworn into office and thus lacked any authority to make those nominations. That, too, is normal behavior from every opposition party at the beginning of a presidency. And the business-as usual treatment of nominees has taken other forms, as well. Ben Carson is totally unqualified to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, yet even Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, two of the most progressive and thoughtful members, voted in his favor in Committee. That is an act of normalizing Trump.In fairness, Warren, Brown and others have resisted. Schumer, for example, pledged to fight Trump and his fellow Republicans “tooth and nail” on most issues, but he added that “Democrats wouldn’t say ‘no’ to a proposal just because the president-elect supports it.” The qualification about selective opposition, presumably made in an effort to sound reasonable, is also a form of normalization.What would it mean for Democratic leaders to stop normalizing? First, they must forcefully object to every nominee unless he or she offers persuasive evidence of integrity and competence. Second, every Executive Order the president signs should be met by legislation, sponsored by all Democrats, designed to overturn the order unless it is demonstrably good policy. None of the Executive Orders to date come close to meeting that standard. In order to slow down all action, Democratic Senators should refuse unanimous consent to everything. The Deputy Chief of Staff to now-retired Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has provided an excellent justification for why this should be done, a blueprint for how to accomplish it, and an analysis of its beneficial impact.Unanimous consent should only be granted if Democrats wrest concessions for doing so. If Democratic legislators determine it is in the national interest to support legislation, they can do so, but they should not announce they will do so ahead of time, and certainly not trade their legitimizing votes for crumbs.They should not be restrained by normal rules of decorum at the State of the Union and other public addresses. While they should attend and let Trump speak, they should be quick to boo and to shout “You lie!” and “Putin’s Puppet!” when Trump’s assertions call for those reactions. Perilous times call for disruptive measures.When this illegitimate president and his GOP collaborators act outrageously, such as issuing a ban on refugees, and when resistors start to act, Democratic leaders should help shine a spotlight on those actions and join in them. Perilous times call for courage and solidarity.In addition to resisting, Democratic leaders should offer positive alternatives to bad policy proposals. In response to the Republican calls for repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats should demand Medicare for all. They should hold their own hearings – outside the Senate, if the Republicans refuse them space – on every issue where the American people are not being heard.Democrats must offer a new, bold, and progressive agenda, on which the next election can be a referendum. In short, they should lead the resistance and offer hope to a dispirited, angry, and frightened nation.We recognize that much of what we are calling for represents a radical inversion of the norms of our democracy. But a horrifying inversion of those norms by those in power demands a response in kind. Many may believe that the kind of behavior we are recommending will undermine our political institutions, and stimulate a race to the bottom in political decency. In normal times, we might agree, but the breadth and intensity of the resistance to Trump’s presidency is a powerful signal that these are not normal times. Under current conditions, lawful resistance is essential to preserve our democracy.These are dangerous moments for the Republic, and the rapidly exploding political crisis of early 2017 is what brings resisters to the street. We will be back in the streets on many occasions in the immediate future. The minority party must act like the loyal opposition – loyal to the Constitution, not to the pretenders to the throne.We recognize that it will take courage of many kinds – political, economic, and even physical – for the established institutions of political opposition to rise to this moment. But the Democratic Party, and a fiercely independent press, must not fail us. If they do, the consequences will be irreparable.If Democratic legislators have doubts about what resistance looks like, they should simply remember Republican opposition to Barack Obama, who took office with full legal, political, and moral authority. With far fewer protestors in the street – and with those protestors angry at both Wall Street and Washington – Republican legislators refused to acknowledge Obama’s legitimacy, and instead, sought to block him at every turn possible. An illegitimate, dangerous, egomaniacal, racist, xenophobic, misogynist, and narcissistic autocrat in the White House today deserves resistance proportional to the danger he presents.Nancy J.

22,POLITICS,Trump’s Immigration Orders Signal End Of Civil Rights Era,"Elliott Young, ContributorProfessor of History and Director of Ethnic Studies at Lewis &...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-immigration-orders-signal-end-of-civil-rights_us_588d396ee4b0de286b257414,We can expect that our domestic civil rights will go right out the window.,2017-01-29,"<p>Massive protest at JFK airport terminal 4, Jan. 28, 2017</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588d3b0017000023001d0efd.jpg?ops=crop_26_340_1982_1408%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On January 27th, President Trump issued an Executive Order on immigration that brings us back to the days of overtly racist and discriminatory policies. In 1965, Congress ended the national-origins quota system that had been in place since the 1920s because it was clearly discriminatory, favoring northern Europeans and against eastern and southern Europeans, Africans and Asians. The Hart-Cellar Act was heralded as a complement to the Civil Rights legislation enacted just two months earlier. On signing the landmark immigration act, President Lyndon Johnson stated,“This [old] system violates the basic principle of American democracy, the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to the faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.”We can expect that our domestic civil rights will go right out the window with the end of non-discriminatory immigration policies. Trump’s immigration orders end all refugee entries for four months and ban all citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries (Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen) from entering the country.Hours after signing the order, scores of refugees with valid visas and green-card-holding permanent residents from those countries were detained at US airports or prevented from boarding airplanes to the US. Thousands of protestors rushed to JFK to protest. The outright ban on 134 million people from entering the US echoes the blanket ban on Chinese from the late-nineteenth century, which was expanded to include other Asian countries in 1917 in what was called the Asiatic Barred Zone. The only difference now is that Trump’s ban is more draconian than the earlier racist legislation that only targeted laborers, and had exemptions for merchants, students and diplomats. Trump’s only exemption is for diplomats.The Trump administration has argued that it has authority under a 1952 law to “suspend the entry” of “any class of aliens” that are detrimental to the interest of the United States. However, in 1965 Congress explicitly limited the president’s powers, stating clearly that no person can be “discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.” Trump may try to contend that banning entry and issuing a visa are two different issues, but a fifth grader can see through this ruse.Trump’s Order creates an explicit religious test for immigration by prioritizing Christian over Muslim applicants for refugee status. Unfortunately, the 1965 Act did not ban religious discrimination, but the US Constitution does. Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe told MSNBC, “I believe Trump’s unprecedented proposal would violate our Constitution, both the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses and the equality dimension of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.” Tribe further suggested that Trump’s ban would violate the No Religious Test Clause of Article VI.Lawyers will challenge the president on all of these issues, and they may prevail in the courts. After all, the courts blocked Obama from granting reprieve for deportation for his DAPA program that was designed to temporarily shield parents of undocumented childhood arrivals from deportation proceedings. The courts argued that such a blanket protection overstepped the executive authority of the president. If Obama’s protection of a few million undocumented people living in our country is overly broad, then surely the blanket ban on 134 million people from seven different countries is outrageously so.In the days following the election, students and faculty at colleges and universities throughout the country mobilized to protect the DACA students who were being threatened by Trump. More than 125 petitions gathered over 100,000 signatures and scores of university presidents either declared their schools Sanctuary Campuses or said they would not cooperate with federal immigration authorities unless compelled to do so by a legal order. Although Trump promised to end DACA on Day One, so far the administration has been mum on the question. They may choose just to let DACA lapse and not renew it, which would be a less public way of ending the program, but clearly the massive protests by students and faculty had an impact.Instead of focusing on ending DACA, Trump promised to target 2-3 million “criminal aliens” first. However, Trump’s executive orders have drastically expanded the definition of criminal alien to anyone who has “committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense,” meaning anyone who is believed to have broken any type of law whether that person has been charged with a crime or not.Trump’s priorities for deportation also includes those who committed “fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,” a catch-all category that targets people who have used a false Social Security number to obtain a job. And finally, those who have received a deportation order but have not left are also a priority for Trump’s regime. This new expanded definition of “criminal alien” includes virtually all of the 11 million undocumented, with the significant exception of the 750,000 DACA students.The #SanctuaryCampus and Sanctuary City movement managed to capture the hearts and minds of millions, but the question is whether such protections can be effective given Trump’s current priorities. In Portland, a sanctuary city in a sanctuary state, ICE has been trolling the DUI diversion program in the Multnomah County courthouse, arresting immigrants. By turning our courts into de facto internment camps for immigrants, we will dissuade immigrants from showing up to court as witnesses or appearing there if they have been charged with minor infractions. In Portland, Mayor Ted Wheeler, who runs the Police Department, and District Attorney Rod Underhill share primary responsibility for deportations through the arrest and conviction of undocumented people and lawful permanent residents for low-level crimes. If our sanctuary cities do not do a better job of preventing the hijacking of our local courts, then the sanctuary will have become a meaningless designation that makes ourselves feel good while leaving immigrants vulnerable.Mass incarceration began with “broken windows policing” that targets low-level offenders and puts them in jail. In this new era of mass deportation, the link between broken windows policing and immigration detention and deportation could not be any more clear. Fighting for immigrants rights requires us to end such policies of over-policing that brings undocumented immigrants into the courts and jails where they are vulnerable to ICE raids.Immigrant rights activists cannot simply tout the Americanness of Dreamers and declare sanctuaries. They must also fight to end the carceral state by demanding that their mayors and city councilors order their local police to stop arresting people for low-level crimes.People often ask what would you have done when millions of Mexicans were forced out of the US in the 1930s and 1950s or when over 100,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans were put into internment camps during WWII. Today, you have the moral obligation to answer the call. Nothing less than massive civil disobedience in the face of Trump’s racist immigration policies will do."
23,RELIGION,If You See A Muslim At The Airport,"Kifah Shah, ContributorAmerican Muslim hipster (#mipsterz) working in Karachi's devel...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/if-you-see-a-muslim-at-the-airport_us_588ddf13e4b0cd25e49049d8,Show them you know they are not an enemy.,2017-01-29,<p><em>Rachel Hannah said she would tell her friends about this experience and she asked me to do the same</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588ddffd1700001a001d0f8e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One month before the November 2016 election, I boarded a plane from LAX to JFK. I cautiously squeezed past a middle-aged married couple to my widow seat while feeling a little paranoid. The anti-Muslim rhetoric during the campaign season, full of vows to register, deport or ban Muslims, made me feel extremely uncomfortable every time I stepped into an airport. Every week I read articles about #FlyingWhileMuslim; Muslims were being refused entry onto planes and escorted off their flights for speaking in a foreign language. I knew it could happen to me.As I sat down, I feigned cool but felt a gnawing pressure to make sure everyone on the plane knew I was not an enemy. Glad to be hidden in a corner seat, I glanced to my right as the couple next to me began taking out several religious texts before takeoff. The woman beside me noticed my curiosity and we began talking. Rachel Hannah sat with her husband and several Hebrew texts while reciting traveler’s prayers openly on the plane. Suddenly, a knot in my stomach came undone and I felt relieved for the first time since I stepped into the airport. Rachel Hannah prayed, her husband prayed, and eventually we all sat there and prayed our similar but different Islamic and Jewish traveler’s prayers for everyone’s safe passage as we began taking off. Yesterday, thousands of protesters demonstrated at airports across the country as refugees and immigrants entering the U.S. were detained. Although an emergency stay was granted against the executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, and hundreds of lawyers volunteered hours late into the night to defend people, I cannot imagine how the detainees felt. I only experienced a microcosm of the fear, heartache and gnawing pressure they must have felt to assure everyone that they are not an enemy. The day I sat next to Rachel Hannah, I spoke to her about why she was choosing to vote in a way I would never consider. For her, it was a matter of one political position, and after hours of conversation, I cannot fathom her approving of what is happening today. I could not imagine we would be here today with a call-it-by-any-other-name Muslim Ban, but now that we are, please take a moment to consider the fear and anxiety Muslim, refugee, immigrant and undocumented communities are facing today. If you see a Muslim at the airport in the weeks, months or years to come, show solidarity, warmth and reach out, especially if they are under attack. If your local airport has actions against detentions, attend with open arms welcoming refugees and immigrants. If you can donate, assist organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, the Council on American Islamic Relations, the International Refugee Assistance Project, or the International Rescue Committee (plus hundreds of others doing critical work). If you have five minutes, call your local representative and give them a piece of your mind about how unconstitutional the recently-issued executive orders are. And if you see a Muslim at the airport, show them you know they are not an enemy."

The love of Christ destroys such silly fears.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588e21f017000019002d9147.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Perhaps the only thing more annoying than political rhetoric is people’s reactions to it.Nobody wants to be seen as friendly to the other side, so any reaction to anything political must be a statement about your loyalty.Take this refugee mess brought on by President Donald Trump’s executive order that bans people from (some) terror-affiliated countries from entering the United States. Reaction from center-left folks has been that it’s a bad, unAmerican idea.From the center-right, we’ve heard… well, not much.I’ll speak up: I think the ban, however you want to spin it, is a bad idea. It’s also sad. And frustrating. And, yes, unAmerican. As a conservative, and as a Christian, I feel a little lonely saying that. Why?Enter that annoying, wrong-headed party loyalty.Not only are Republican politicians who fairly recently called such a ban unconstitutional now silent and/or approving, but a surprising number of former #NeverTrump-ers are reverting back to their old political habits.“Republican under attack! Must defend! Something, something, talking points! U-S-A!”Somewhere along the line, the thinking on both sides of the aisle became, “If the other side is against it, it must be a good idea.”This is ludicrous.It’s especially bothersome among conservative Christians (my people), many of whom parrot Republican talking points out of habit because they see Jesus wrapped in an American flag rather than sitting at the right hand of God.“Nope, can’t agree with a godless liberal. That would make me a godless liberal, wouldn’t it?”Even when Republicans/conservatives have actual reservations about something, like the refugee/Muslim ban (and let’s be real; it’s a Muslim ban), the urge to line up with the party is just too strong for most to speak up about those reservations. After all, can’t risk not being allowed to hang with the cool kids. Gotta keep that seat at the table, amirite?My conviction tells me the ban is a short-sighted approach to national security. I keep picturing those images of dead or wounded refugee children, and I hurt for them. I don’t understand how anyone, especially a Christian, can see those images and think, “Sorry, not my problem. That’s just the price of keeping America safe.”Even if that’s not been an actual thought, it’s the logical conclusion of the position: that you’re cool with innocent, scared kids dying in terrorist attacks so you can make the extremely small chance of you dying in a terrorist attack get slightly smaller. I just don’t get it. Yes, I understand that the government’s primary job is to keep the country safe. I just disagree that this ban will keep us safe. I don’t understand it from a biblical perspective, and I don’t understand it from a logical one.Seriously, if one of those refugee kids came to you, crying, injured and scared, would you really look at them and their equally scared parents and say, “Sorry. Helping you is just too risky”?I don’t think 99 percent of people would do that. But, again, never underestimate that good ol’ party loyalty. (And, yes, I know that the government isn’t required to help anyone who doesn’t live here. But that doesn’t mean we can’t.) I’m not scared of anyone, regardless of religion, race, nationality or any other such identity. No Christian should be. The love of Christ destroys those silly fears. I don’t understand why people choose to bow to their fears rather than their faith.Despite what the rhetoric might tell you, it’s true that you’re way, way, way more likely to be killed by a falling dresser than by a refugee. If it’s criminals who scare you, there are already plenty of American-born bad guys doing bad stuff that threatens your safety.Look, I get that some of the refugees could be terrorists. I’ll even grant you that a relative few probably are. ISIS is sneaky and resourceful. I get it. I really do. I still don’t care. I’m not afraid. I refuse to be ruled by fear. And, no, this ban isn’t rooted in caution. It’s just plain fear at best and bigotry at worst.To compare it to another crazy topic, it reminds me a little of the gun control debate. I’m not an anti-gun guy. I’m not a pro-gun guy, either. I’m actually quite indifferent toward guns. But I do know we have a LOT of guns in America. And a LOT of people who probably shouldn’t have guns do have guns. There’s much greater reason to be concerned about gun violence than terrorism, just because of the law of probability. But, strangely, conservatives just aren’t afraid of guns. This is despite guns being used in a lot of violent individual crimes, in mass shootings, in suicides and in accidental deaths.Gun deaths happen by the dozens every day in the United States. Terror attacks don’t. But, yes, as a conservative, I’m supposed to love guns and fear terrorists. I’m supposed to list potential terrorists coming into the country as one of my greatest fears.Well, sorry.I don’t know how else to say it: I’m not scared. I wish people — especially Christians — would stop trying to convince me that I should be."

The dance party was initiated by the queer-based grassroots movement called Werk for Peace, which was founded by Firas Nasr, in tribute to the 49 beautiful souls who were killed, and 53 injured, at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. It’s nothing new to say that clubs have been safe havens for many of us as we came into our identities, seeking community and acceptance. But what I love about the concept of taking dance to the streets as a form of protest is that it thrusts us out of our safe enclaves and into visible spaces. Werk for Peace has inverted the queer club and made the world our catwalk.It’s a given that our community is on edge, and bracing for what comes next. And as a woman, it is deeply triggering to have had a sexual predator voted into the White House. The idea that he has been entrusted to enter the White House and walk, sleep, eat, tantrum, and touch our physical history feels like a violation in itself. It’s within the narcissistic realm of possibilities that he could paint the oval office gold and replace every piece of art with portraits of himself, before he rolls up his sleeves and tries to strip us of every right we’ve earned to please his religious zealot campaign contributors. But before he does that, let’s dance.For the last eight years the LGBTQ+ community has made amazing strides. We won marriage equality and legal protections against job discrimination, repealed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, won political positions, and even earned the right to be Boy Scout leaders. But there are still many battles to fight, especially for our trans and gender non-conforming community members who are fighting for their right to choose the bathrooms that match their gender identity and protection from an epidemic of violent hate crimes. It’s natural to wonder what the first strike will be when the President is wild card assembling a cabinet of queer-hating white supremacists and the Vice President is a staunch supporter of conversion therapy (aka torture) and wants to decimate our community. But hey, I was going to try not to get heavy.There’s a popular therapeutic technique where a person is called upon to write a different ending to a traumatic event. For instance, a client may recall a childhood story where they felt trapped within a frightening or abusive situation. The therapist asks them what they wish they could have done in that situation. The client wishes they could have run away. The therapist prompts them to recall the story, but this time to imagine themselves running away just in time, escaping the situation and the ensuing trauma. In this way the client rewrites their story and relieves some trauma.Since the election, I feel an underlying sense of trauma that has lessened my resilience in many situations. I realize it’s because I grew up in a very conservative Greek, male-dominated household where my mother, sister, and I were isolated from others, and had little if any self-determination. I was expected to leave the house only once I married a man. Having a misogynist, predatory, and controlling President in the White House rings all my warning bells; him being in power is symbolic of a national dysfunctional family relationship. When I see the First Lady’s face crumble after the President delivers her a stern look, I am taken right back to my volatile home of origin. But they aren’t our parents, and we aren’t their trapped children. We will write our own ending to this story.This is the year to be Queer – with a capital Q. In this climate, Queer includes all us queer folks across the spectrum of sexuality, gender, physical ability, presentation, and anatomical gloriousness. But it isn’t only us. Because truth is, in the current political climate, if you aren’t a straight, white, patriarchy-loving religious zealot, you’re queer too. That’s why understanding and honoring intersectionality and coalition building is so important. It’s us and them and there is strength in numbers. So let’s link arms with our millions. If you forget who they are, replay the footage from January 21, 2017. All over our country and around the world as far as Antarctica and Nairobi, people marched. That is cause for celebration. Whether you’ve never marched before or you’ve marched a million times, you are all welcome to this party.The way we’re going to fight back is by loving each other strong. Donate to legal organizations that protect our rights. Organize political actions and post daily reminders of what we can do each day to make change. Be like Pam Howell and bake an extra turkey for the local LGBT kids homeless center on Thanksgiving. Start a writing collective or make copies of your poems to pass out on the street like Michelle Tea did back in the day. Be like Firas Nasr and werk it on the roof of a car in front of the Vice President’s house. Do your art. You don’t have to be a star to be exceptional. We have a chance every day to be kind and to bring love and creativity into this world. When times feel hard—and they will—remember that we are surrounded by amazing, inspiring people who are ready to fight to create and protect the world we want. The fight takes many forms, whether it’s activism or art or kindness. Let us flower when they want us to wither. Let us grow when they want us to shrink. Find love each day. That’s how we’ll survive. We will persist."

In a presidential memo Saturday, Trump reorganized the National Security Council by removing the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from the principals committee, which is the meeting for the most senior national security officials. Under the previous two administrations, they had permanent seats. Instead, the DNI and Joint Chiefs chair will now get to be there only when what is being discussed is relevant to their “responsibilities and expertise.”In their place will be Bannon, one of Trump’s closest advisers. Bannon previously served as chairman of Breitbart News, a publication that regularly airs white nationalist views. Rice served as national security adviser and United Nations ambassador to President Barack Obama. Late Saturday night, she tweeted that what Trump is doing is “stone cold crazy.” Bob Gates, who served as defense secretary under both Obama and President George W. Bush and as CIA director under President George H.W. Bush, also said what Trump is doing is a mistake. “Adding people to the National Security Council never really bothers me,” he said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “My biggest concern is there are actually, under the law, only two statutory advisers to the National Security Council and that’s the Director of Central Intelligence, or the DNI, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.”“I think pushing them out of the National Security Council meetings, except when their specific issues are at stake, is a big mistake,” he added. “I think that they both bring a perspective and judgment and experience to bear that every president, whether they like it or not, finds useful.”White House press secretary Sean Spicer called Rice’s tweets “clearly inappropriate language from a former ambassador” Sunday on “This Week.” When asked by host Martha Raddatz what Bannon brings to the National Security Council, Spicer replied, “Well, he is a former naval officer. He’s got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now.”White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also defended the reorganization on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday, claiming that the DNI and Joint Chiefs chair are “included as attendees anytime that they want to be included.”“If you read the order they’re invited as attendees to the Security Council at any time,” he said.Trump’s order, however, does not say that. It clearly states: “The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.”Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Most of the country’s politicians have remained strangely silent on the topic.Public commentators did not connect the dots even as President-elect Trump attacked the civil rights hero, John Lewis, when having a Klan sympathizer for a father would seem to be highly pertinent in explaining his behavior.Yet the factual evidence seems strong. Trump’s father Fred was arrested in New York City in 1927, when a group of Klansmen got into a brawl with police officers during a Memorial Day parade in Queens. There is a document trail, and the names, dates, and addresses match up. The New York Times published a story about the riot and the seven men who were arrested; Fred Trump is mentioned by name. His address is given at 175-24 Devonshire Road, Jamaica, New York City, and the federal census of 1930 shows that Fred Trump resided at that address. The newspaper does not identify him as a Klan member, or clarify whether he was wearing a Klan robe—as were many of the demonstrators―but he did get arrested, and all seven men were represented by the same attorneys. Two days after the brawl, Fred Trump was discharged from custody, with no explanation that can be discovered from public records. The Times further reported that a police commissioner planned to investigate the Klan riot.After the website Boing Boing reported the story in 2015, Donald Trump denied it, and he has not publicly discussed it since then.The New York Daily News, the Washington Post, the New York Times and a few other news outlets mentioned the connection briefly in 2016, and then they dropped it. Throughout the campaign, most of the media maintained a deafening silence, as did most of the nation’s politicians in both parties. If Fred Trump was a full-fledged Klansman, no one seemed interested in pursuing the story. A diligent researcher might have at least tried to find the commissioner report in the city archives. Journalists and politicians displayed the most determined zeal in investigating every aspect of Hillary Clinton’s email in 2016, and 20 years ago they showed the same zeal in investigating the Clintons’ investment in Whitewater.Yet the family history of the Republican Party’s nominee merited nothing close to that scrutiny. And this is the immediate family, the man’s own father, not some distant ancestor from another century, a father with the power to shape the boy’s most profound assumptions about the world. Moreover, Donald Trump has often expressed his admiration for his father. Thoughtful adults can hear the echoes of one hundred years ago in the president’s encouragement of violence at campaign rallies, his prejudices against minorities, and his use of violent language.Historians know that the Ku Klux Klan, founded in Tennessee in 1866 by ex-Confederate officers, was created to intimidate black Southerners, especially those who wanted to vote, as well as the region’s ethnic and religious minorities. Since the 1860s, the Klan has spread all over the United States, with chapters in every region, and its targets have expanded to include immigrants, gays, and women who work outside the home. In the 1920s, the Klan grew dramatically in the cities of the North, often in response to the arrival of Catholics from Eastern and Central Europe. Accordingly, the Klansmen in Queens protested their presence in 1927 in New York City.But in the public mind, the organization is still associated largely with the South. Perhaps that is one explanation for the silence on Fred Trump, Donald’s origins in the urban North. Maybe it is still too hard to face up to bigotry and prejudice anywhere outside the South.We can easily imagine what would have happened if there had been the faintest rumor that Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, or Al Gore had a Klan sympathizer in the family—page one stories and protracted coverage in the media, politicians holding forth, bristling with the assumption that the allegation was probably true. Carter, Clinton, and Gore would have been judged unfit for public service, and their careers would have ended long before they reached national office.Maybe there are other explanations for the silence about Fred Trump, beginning with shame, a deep embarrassment that the Klan has lasted so long and spread throughout the country, including New York. Perhaps it was the hope that the son would turn away from the spectre of a man who had been arrested at a Klan riot. Maybe it was the well-meaning but naïve belief that Donald Trump could not win the election.Now he inhabits the White House. Let us hope that the country’s media and political leadership recover their usual probing interest in the President’s background, his motives, and his veracity. The future of the Republic may depend on it."

The judge issued an emergency stay on part of Trump's executive order, ruling that sending refugees stopped at U.S. airports back to their countries would be harmful.

Why is it that neither George W. Bush and Barack Obama who were facing far worse times involving terrorism than Donald Trump is facing today never felt the need to institute such draconian measures at our borders and at U.S. airports as regards these seven countries over the past 16 years? Is there something different in the world on January 28th than there has been in the last decade and one-half that necessitates such action? No, there is nothing new going on. There is no fresh threat of terrorist attacks. As the story plays out, it is now increasingly evident that the Trump Administration never consulted either its own State Department over potential assaults on our soil or spoke to those officials in the government handling refugees over the issue of admission of such peoples. They would have found out: First, we are already prepared to ward off all menaces to our population; and, second, contrary to Trump's claim that no full background investigations were completed on these foreigners, that all of the individuals seeking entry into the U.S. from these seven states had gone through extreme vetting before being allowed into our country. The FBI, the CIA, U.S. embassies and other intelligence agencies have had to review each person asking for the right to stay in the U.S. Further they would have found that none of the earlier persons who gained entry into the U.S. under Bush and Obama were ever involved in any terrorist activity of any nature. And, in any case, it is clear that Trump's executive order is aimed at Muslims despite his cover story that it is targeting terrorists. The real terrorists involved in 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia -- a nation which is not even being banned under Trump's executive order. No, the true reason that Trump is acting in this manner is to try to demonstrate that he is ""tough"" on Muslims while his predecessors -- Obama and Bush -- were weak. He holds to his false assertion that only he, as America's new leader, knows how to handle ISIS and Al Qaeda. But he is actually the timid chief executive in this drama. He is so insecure about America's strength and about his own resolve to deal with any sudden unforeseen strikes that he feels he must demonstrate a faux command at our borders or otherwise, he believes, he will be seen as a failure. In fact, he displays little grip on reality -- just the opposite, he indulges in a fantasy about enemies that don't exist at this time. This is a man preyed on by paranoia who, in his great self-doubt and fearfulness, is acting out his deepest anxieties with such drastic moves and doing huge and long-lasting damage to the prestige and authority of the United States.

A war against the facts. A war against the president of Mexico. A war against the media. A war against the environment. A war against NATO. A war against muslims. A war against our election system. A war against Hollywood celebrities. A war against women's rights. A war against China. A war against presidential etiquette. A war against refugees.Barack Obama's presidency is just a few days into the rear view mirror, and already questions are being raised about whether or not these wars that Trump has incited, will ever end.The sitting president's continued flame-throwing and open hostility towards the world, both domestically and internationally, is increasingly raising tensions inside the United States and abroad, while sowing the seeds of conflict, chaos and instability across the planet.Trump's actions are even raising questions about whether his dangerous and divisive moves are putting Americans, and all of Earth's human inhabitants, on a collision course destined for global war.We sincerely hope not, as this question is downright scary to imagine or even to conceptualize.At the heart of what makes the Trump presidency so dangerous is his overt willingness to look the American people in the eye-- and flat out lie to them. Trump first did it through his press secretary, Sean Spicer, regarding the crowd size of his inauguration. Then he did it himself the following day at CIA headquarters, conveying the same falsehood as Spicer. At the same event, Trump misrepresented the facts about his relationship with the intelligence community, saying the media created the illusion that he had a poor relationship with the apparatus, when just days before his inauguration it was Trump who callously compared it to ""Nazi Germany."" The next day, and the third day of Trump's presidency, his senior advisor, Kellyanne Conway, refused to dispute Trump's lies, instead branding them as ""alternative facts,"" on NBC's show Meet the Press. Even worse, on day four, after being sworn in as America's 45th commander-in-chief, Trump lied to Congressional leaders, saying there was widespread voter fraud to the tune of 3-5 million votes in the November 2016 election. The false claim essentially undermined both the legitimacy of his election as President of the United States, as well as the entire fabric that holds our representative democracy together.These lies likely only scratch the surface of what's to come from Trump in the years ahead, and unfortunately, his tyrannical, schizophrenic and erratic behavior is increasingly putting every American's security at risk.Think about it. If Trump is willing to advance a reckless and delusional lie about his own election after voter fraud allegations have been widely debunked, or about the size of his inauguration crowd due to his obsession with being best and with his inferiority complex, what will stop him from lying about a world conflict that could put our nation into harms way? Such a move could lead to war, bloodshed and even the loss of American lives - and we would never even know if we could believe the pretenses behind said war.Beyond his boldfaced lies, Trump's simplistic stroke of the pen through executive orders or his alienating tweets to other world leaders are establishing unease and severe volatility across the globe-- and it doesn't seem to bother him or his quisling advisors one bit.All of these dynamics at play point to the fact that with every day that goes by, instability is brewing across the land and a sickness is growing inside of America that's spearheaded by our nation's demagogue of a leader, Donald Trump.Understandably, President Obama noted that he would extend to Donald Trump the same traditional courtesy that so many presidents before him did by remaining silent and letting the new president lead without interference from their predecessor.That said, desperate times call for desperate measures, and after an unprecedented and unorthodox election, perhaps that in this new world order we live in, old traditions don't apply any more. Given his far-reaching popularity with Americans and people abroad, it's far past time for President Obama to break tradition and his silence. Now, at our darkest hour, we need our nation's greatest communicator to dust off his sneakers and get back into the fray. The man who once inspired a nation to believe that we were not red states or blue states. The skinny kid with the funny name, who once made us believe in hope and change. The only thing that can defeat fear is hope. President Obama, we know you have given everything you have for us, and we don't have any right to ask you to sacrifice a moment longer. But the American people need your talents, we need your voice, we need your quill, and we need your moral authority. You said last fall that you would defeat Donald Trump if you went toe-to-toe against him.It's time for you to prove it."

It also warns that the new policy could be disastrous for science and research in the United States.Trump’s order, signed Friday, halts the U.S. refugee resettlement program for four months and bars people from seven Muslim-majority countries for at least 90 days. The status of affected green card holders, who are legal permanent U.S. residents, will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, officials said.“US research institutes host a significant number of researchers from the nations subjected to the upcoming restrictions,” the petition states. “From Iran alone, more than 3000 students have received PhDs from American universities in the past 3 years.”Trump’s action will necessarily limit collaborations between researchers from different nations and could “potentially lead to the departure of many talented individuals who are current and future researchers and entrepreneurs in the US,” the petition says. For those reasons, the petition organizers call the executive order “detrimental to the national interests of the United States.”Signatories to the petition include 15 Nobel laureates in fields like physics, economics and medicine.Emery Berger, a professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is not one of the organizers but has signed the petition. He called the executive order “very chilling” in a Washington Post interview.“I’m sure it will send really promising star students across the border to Canada or elsewhere,” Berger said, referring to those choosing where to study. He also noted that students from the affected countries who are currently in the U.S. are frightened of not being allowed back if they travel out of the U.S.The executive order has had near-immediate impact on academia and research.There have been multiple reports of students detained or blocked from returning to the U.S. after traveling abroad, including an anthropology Ph.D. candidate who told The Guardian that he dare not go to his home country of Iran because he has vocally criticized human rights violations there.Sarah Knuckey, a Columbia Law professor, said the visa ban would impede collaborative research on how to improve people’s health during periods of armed conflict.ABC’s chief foreign correspondent Terry Moran tweeted Saturday that Princeton had already lost 11 prospective Ph.D. candidates in computer science.Princeton’s dean issued a warning on Saturday morning that “strongly advised” students and scholars who may be affected to avoid traveling outside the U.S. for the time being. Immigration attorneys and advocacy groups throughout the country have been giving similar counsel."

Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588d60cf1700002f001d0f31.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s executive order targeting Muslims and refugees led to chaos in the hours after he signed it, as refugees and immigrants arrived at U.S. airports only to be detained or told they couldn’t enter the country and businesses had to scramble to adjust to the new policy. “We are hearing that last night a lot of people were turned away,” said Abed Ayoub, legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. “It’s had a direct impact on a lot of people.” The order, which Trump signed Friday afternoon, bans Syrian refugee resettlement in the U.S. indefinitely. It will also shut down the entire refugee program for 120 days and bar all immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days.The order goes far beyond refugees or tourists ― it means that about 500,000 green card holders who reside in the U.S. but are originally from one of the seven countries will need a waiver to return to their homes, White House officials said Saturday. It also applies to people from the seven countries who hold dual citizenship and are not U.S. citizens. This means that people of both French and Yemeni nationality, for example, would be denied entry.Coming in the late hours of Friday, and with little apparent consultation with other agencies and groups prior to its publication, the president’s order has created havoc and confusion among those tasked with overseeing entry into the country, to say nothing of the people actually trying to enter the U.S.On Saturday afternoon, nearly 24 hours after Trump signed the order, a White House official said the administration was still working to determine the exact meaning of a very important piece of language: “in transit.” The order says that authorities may “determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis” in instances “when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship.”Because the precise meaning of that language is not clear, however, many people who were in transit when the order was signed have been detained and in some cases barred from entering the country.In the hours after Trump signed the order, government authorities detained two Iraqis at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, The New York Times reported. One of the men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, worked for the U.S. government for 10 years as an interpreter. He was detained upon landing at JFK on Friday night, but his wife and children were let through, a former colleague of Darweesh’s told The Huffington Post. Darweesh was released the following day.The other detained man, Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the country to join his child and wife, who had worked for a U.S. government contractor, The Washington Post reported.Lawyers for the two men told CNN they have filed a lawsuit against the president and the government over their detention. The action in federal court seeks a writ of habeas corpus — an order declaring their detention illegal — and the certification of a class action covering any immigrants and refugees denied admission at ports of entry across the country, according to the complaint filed in New York.Google, meanwhile, told traveling staff members to come back to the U.S., BBC News reported.And refugee organizations began notifying volunteers that the families they planned to help were no longer on their way. Alisa Wartick, 36, said she and a group of 38 people in her neighborhood had co-sponsored a Syrian refugee family through the organization Refugee One in Chicago. The family ― a mother, father and 16-month-old daughter ― was supposed to arrive on Monday to join the woman’s parents and siblings. The co-sponsorship group had already furnished their apartment, and met the family via FaceTIme so they could see their new home, which they now may never see again. “Just imagining raising a child in a refugee camp environment and then being told you could see your family again, you could be reunited with your mom and your daughter’s grandma and being told ‘No, sorry, you’re three days too late for that’ ― I can’t imagine what that’s like,” Wartick said.Church World Service, one of the organizations that handles refugee resettlement, had been planning to welcome 212 refugees next week, 164 of them joining family members already in the United States, according to a spokeswoman. Those 212 refugees are no longer expected to arrive.Protesters gathered at airports throughout the country on Saturday to demonstrate against Trump’s executive order. Hundreds crowded JFK’s Terminal 4, chanting “Love trumps hate!” and “No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here!” BuzzFeed broadcast the protest live on Facebook.Large crowds were also reported at San Francisco International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.Though Trump, on the campaign trail, had pledged to stop refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, there was some skepticism that he would actually follow through on the proposal. Business groups had warned against it, as did religious organizations, including some with traditionally conservative political leanings.Moreover, congressional Republicans spoke out over the summer against any policy that would bar people from entering the United States based on their religion. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was one of those critics. But on Friday evening, he offered a statement of support for Trump’s proposal.The ripple effects of the executive order make clear the difficulty in taking a blunt campaign promise and applying it to real-world governance, with seemingly unforeseen outcomes and immediate, frightening disruption in people’s lives. People took to Twitter to share the uncertainty now surrounding their Syrian colleagues and friends.In other cases, people who made it to safety in the United States are now having trouble meeting family members from their home countries. Mohammed Al Rawi, who risked his life working for the Los Angeles Times bureau in Baghdad, moved to Long Beach, California, in 2010. His 69-year-old father was leaving Qatar to fly to Los Angeles to visit him Friday night when a U.S. official stopped him and informed him that Trump had “canceled all visas,” Al Rawi wrote on Facebook.U.S. officials then detained Al Rawi’s father in an unknown location and confiscated his passport, making it impossible for Al Rawi to book him a hotel in Qatar to sleep for the night, he said. His father’s phone died, so he has not been able to get in touch.Meathaq, 45, and Mahmoud, 49, of Baghdad just arrived in Knoxville, Tennessee, in August with their 5-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter. But they have twin 18-year-old daughters still living in Iraq.Thanks to Mahmoud’s work as a translator for the U.S. Army, they were able to get a special immigrant visa. The process for approving their visas took four years, beginning when they first applied in 2012. By that time their daughters were over 18, which meant the U.S. government required greater processing. Now the twins are stuck in Baghdad, and their parents fear they will not be able to reunite with them. (Both Meathaq and Mahmoud withheld their last names out of concern for their twin daughters’ safety.)“I am crying all the time, especially after the new law from President Trump,” Meathaq said. “I miss them and the situation in Iraq is so bad and I don’t know what to do to help.”Even the film industry has felt the impact. The executive order will prevent Iranian film director Asghar Farhadi from traveling to the Oscars ceremony next month. Farhadi’s “The Salesman” was nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category this year. Farhadi became the first Iranian director to win an Oscar in that category in 2012. Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, a co-lead in “The Salesman,” said this week that she would boycott the Oscars over the visa ban.Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, shared several stories on Twitter of individuals affected by the ban, including people with green cards to be in the U.S. The Huffington Post is working to verify those stories.Zane Shami, a naturalized U.S. citizen who has lived in the U.S. for over two decades, said he’d been expecting his mother, who is 67, to arrive to live with him on Feb. 7.Shami’s mother was born in Syria but has been living in Kuwait, where Shami was born and where his siblings live, since the civil war in her native country leveled her town.

35,POLITICS,"Trump's Executive Order Is Already Hurting Refugees, Muslims And Families",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-muslim-refugee-ban_us_588cb24ee4b0176377948a09,People are being turned away at airports.,2017-01-28,People gather at the international arrivals area of Washington Dulles International Airport on Jan. 28 to show their support for immigrants and refugees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588d61c817000026002d90a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s executive order targeting Muslims and refugees led to chaos in the hours after he signed it, as refugees and immigrants arrived at U.S. airports only to be detained or told they couldn’t enter the country and businesses had to scramble to adjust to the new policy. “We are hearing that last night a lot of people were turned away,” said Abed Ayoub, legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. “It’s had a direct impact on a lot of people.” The order, which Trump signed Friday afternoon, bans Syrian refugee resettlement in the U.S. indefinitely. It will also shut down the entire refugee program for 120 days and bar all immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days.The order goes far beyond refugees or tourists ― it means that about 500,000 green card holders who reside in the U.S. but are originally from one of the seven countries will need a waiver to return to their homes, White House officials said Saturday. It also applies to people from the seven countries who hold dual citizenship and are not U.S. citizens. This means that people of both French and Yemeni nationality, for example, would be denied entry.Coming in the late hours of Friday, and with little apparent consultation with other agencies and groups prior to its publication, the president’s order has created havoc and confusion among those tasked with overseeing entry into the country, to say nothing of the people actually trying to enter the U.S.On Saturday afternoon, nearly 24 hours after Trump signed the order, a White House official said the administration was still working to determine the exact meaning of a very important piece of language: “in transit.” The order says that authorities may “determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis” in instances “when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship.”Because the precise meaning of that language is not clear, however, many people who were in transit when the order was signed have been detained and in some cases barred from entering the country.In the hours after Trump signed the order, government authorities detained two Iraqis at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, The New York Times reported. One of the men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, worked for the U.S. government for 10 years as an interpreter. He was detained upon landing at JFK on Friday night, but his wife and children were let through, a former colleague of Darweesh’s told The Huffington Post. Darweesh was released the following day.The other detained man, Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the country to join his child and wife, who had worked for a U.S. government contractor, The Washington Post reported.Lawyers for the two men told CNN they have filed a lawsuit against the president and the government over their detention. The action in federal court seeks a writ of habeas corpus — an order declaring their detention illegal — and the certification of a class action covering any immigrants and refugees denied admission at ports of entry across the country, according to the complaint filed in New York.Google, meanwhile, told traveling staff members to come back to the U.S., BBC News reported.And refugee organizations began notifying volunteers that the families they planned to help were no longer on their way. Alisa Wartick, 36, said she and a group of 38 people in her neighborhood had co-sponsored a Syrian refugee family through the organization Refugee One in Chicago. The family ― a mother, father and 16-month-old daughter ― was supposed to arrive on Monday to join the woman’s parents and siblings. The co-sponsorship group had already furnished their apartment, and met the family via FaceTIme so they could see their new home, which they now may never see again. “Just imagining raising a child in a refugee camp environment and then being told you could see your family again, you could be reunited with your mom and your daughter’s grandma and being told ‘No, sorry, you’re three days too late for that’ ― I can’t imagine what that’s like,” Wartick said.Church World Service, one of the organizations that handles refugee resettlement, had been planning to welcome 212 refugees next week, 164 of them joining family members already in the United States, according to a spokeswoman. Those 212 refugees are no longer expected to arrive.Protesters gathered at airports throughout the country on Saturday to demonstrate against Trump’s executive order. Hundreds crowded JFK’s Terminal 4, chanting “Love trumps hate!” and “No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here!” BuzzFeed broadcast the protest live on Facebook.Large crowds were also reported at San Francisco International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.Though Trump, on the campaign trail, had pledged to stop refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, there was some skepticism that he would actually follow through on the proposal. Business groups had warned against it, as did religious organizations, including some with traditionally conservative political leanings.Moreover, congressional Republicans spoke out over the summer against any policy that would bar people from entering the United States based on their religion. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was one of those critics. But on Friday evening, he offered a statement of support for Trump’s proposal.The ripple effects of the executive order make clear the difficulty in taking a blunt campaign promise and applying it to real-world governance, with seemingly unforeseen outcomes and immediate, frightening disruption in people’s lives. People took to Twitter to share the uncertainty now surrounding their Syrian colleagues and friends.In other cases, people who made it to safety in the United States are now having trouble meeting family members from their home countries. Mohammed Al Rawi, who risked his life working for the Los Angeles Times bureau in Baghdad, moved to Long Beach, California, in 2010. His 69-year-old father was leaving Qatar to fly to Los Angeles to visit him Friday night when a U.S. official stopped him and informed him that Trump had “canceled all visas,” Al Rawi wrote on Facebook.U.S. officials then detained Al Rawi’s father in an unknown location and confiscated his passport, making it impossible for Al Rawi to book him a hotel in Qatar to sleep for the night, he said. His father’s phone died, so he has not been able to get in touch.Meathaq, 45, and Mahmoud, 49, of Baghdad just arrived in Knoxville, Tennessee, in August with their 5-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter. But they have twin 18-year-old daughters still living in Iraq.Thanks to Mahmoud’s work as a translator for the U.S. Army, they were able to get a special immigrant visa. The process for approving their visas took four years, beginning when they first applied in 2012. By that time their daughters were over 18, which meant the U.S. government required greater processing. Now the twins are stuck in Baghdad, and their parents fear they will not be able to reunite with them. (Both Meathaq and Mahmoud withheld their last names out of concern for their twin daughters’ safety.)“I am crying all the time, especially after the new law from President Trump,” Meathaq said. “I miss them and the situation in Iraq is so bad and I don’t know what to do to help.”Even the film industry has felt the impact. The executive order will prevent Iranian film director Asghar Farhadi from traveling to the Oscars ceremony next month. Farhadi’s “The Salesman” was nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category this year. Farhadi became the first Iranian director to win an Oscar in that category in 2012. Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, a co-lead in “The Salesman,” said this week that she would boycott the Oscars over the visa ban.Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, shared several stories on Twitter of individuals affected by the ban, including people with green cards to be in the U.S. The Huffington Post is working to verify those stories.Zane Shami, a naturalized U.S. citizen who has lived in the U.S. for over two decades, said he’d been expecting his mother, who is 67, to arrive to live with him on Feb. 7.Shami’s mother was born in Syria but has been living in Kuwait, where Shami was born and where his siblings live, since the civil war in her native country leveled her town. She was approved to come to the U.S. as a refugee after extensive vetting, Shami said. But now she’s unable to move here as planned, or even to visit.“I’ve done everything right. I did the checklist,” Shami said. “There’s no reason my mom can’t come here. It’s very un-American to say that we’re going to ban her just because she has a Syrian passport.

36,THE WORLDPOST,Donald Trump Withdraws Proposal To Create Safe Zones In Syria,Nick Robins-Early and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-syria-safe-zones_us_5889175ae4b0024605fd95fb,The controversial policy would pose a number of logistical and political problems.,2017-01-28,"U.S. President Donald Trump (R), flanked by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly (L), delivers remarks at Homeland Security headquarters in Washington, U.S., January 25, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58891aa81c00002d00d94474.jpeg?cache=rZGOMtJgvY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing the United States’ refugee resettlement program, barring Syrian refugees indefinitely and temporarily restricting immigration from unnamed countries is already resulting in families being stopped at airports.But the order is also notable for its exclusion of a provision, which appeared in an earlier draft of the order, that would have created a process for establishing so-called safe zones in Syria.That clause would have instructed the secretary of defense to draft a plan within 90 days to create “safe zones to protect vulnerable Syrian populations,” according to a copy of the draft published by The Huffington Post on Wednesday.The decision to omit the safe zones proposal allows the Trump administration to avoid, at least temporarily, the complex questions that such a policy would raise. Creating and protecting safe zones could increase American military intervention in Syria, and pose a number of political and logistical problems regarding its implementation.Both Republican and Democratic officials have at times advocated for implementing safe zones in Syria. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made safe zones part of her foreign policy platform during her 2016 presidential campaign, and prominent GOP figures like Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) have all advocated for the policy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel also supported potential safe zones along the Turkey-Syria border, and has discussed the idea of havens for displaced Yazidis in northern Iraq. Turkey has previously backed the policy as well, and already controls a strip of land in Syria along its border that has become something of a de facto safe zone for internally displaced people.Many politicians advocate safe zones as a middle ground between large-scale military intervention and inaction, while claiming they will mitigate the flow of refugees into other states. But experts say safe zones require large amounts of resources, military personnel and money to implement. Safe zones can also have unintended consequences that endanger the civilians they aim to protect.“People tend to think of safe zones as being an easy answer, but it just isn’t,” Elizabeth Ferris, a professor at Georgetown’s school of foreign service, said. “Once you start talking about a safe zone with some kind of guarantee of security, who is going to provide that security? ... European or U.S. or Turkish troops on Syrian soil, carrying arms, without the governments permission? I think it’s a recipe for disaster, a tinder keg.”“Safe zones, internationally, have not been terribly successful,” she added.One of the most infamous examples of a failed safe zone is from the Bosnian civil war, after the United Nations designated the town of Srebrenica a demilitarized “safe area.” Bosnian Serb forces attacked the lightly defended town in July of 1995, killing at least 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys. The attackers raped and sexually abused women and girls during the assault. Tens of thousands fled.More than two decades later, the international community sees the Srebrenica massacre as a lesson of the potentially disastrous consequences if states and organizations are not willing to properly secure and enforce safe zones. Even when safe zones are relatively successful, they can rack up huge costs and necessitate a large military presence. The United States and other countries deployed 20,000 troops to safeguard a Kurdish area of northern Iraq for a few months in 1991. The U.S. also implemented a no-fly zone in 1991 to protect the Kurds: It lasted for 12 years, but even this measure sometimes proved ineffective at stopping Saddam Hussein’s forces from killing Kurdish civilians.If the United States pursues a safe zone inside Syria, there’s still the question of whether to do so as part of an agreement with Russia, Iran, Turkey and President Bashar Assad’s government ― all of whom have forces fighting in Syria. Without an agreement with the Assad regime, Ferris and other analysts say that a safe zone could be a potential target for the so-called Islamic State, Russian airstrikes and pro-Assad forces. Defending such a haven would likely require significant security, and potentially create the conditions for the U.S. or other governments’ forces coming into conflict with Russia or Assad.“If it’s not with the regime’s consent, then it’s basically a very hostile action – particularly if you’re going to provide any troops for security to the safe zone,” Ferris said. Defending a safe zone could therefore push the U.S. or other government forces deeper into Syria’s conflict. Experts also highlight that safe zones are not lasting solutions, and as long as there is still conflict in Syria, it will be hard for internally displaced people and refugees to return home permanently."
37,POLITICS,"Donald Trump Promised To Bring Back Jobs. For These Workers, He's Taking Them Away.","Dave Jamieson, Amanda Terkel, and Sam Stein",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hiring-freeze_us_588b9f18e4b08a14f7e5c121,The federal hiring freeze means people who thought they have positions no longer do.,2017-01-28,Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) praised Trump for the hiring freeze.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588ba14c1b0000260004cdda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this month, Jessica Barlow learned that she would finally be landing a good government job, working as a call center employee inside a federal building in Cleveland.A 39-year-old mother of two, Barlow already works in the building’s daycare center, but under a federal contractor. Though she loves her job, she earns only $9.27 per hour. The call center job would bring her a salary $10,000 higher, and have better benefits and the stability of government work. She says that on Jan. 6 she was informed she’d be starting soon.Then, on Monday, President Donald Trump announced a federal hiring freeze. “We were waiting on our start dates,” said Barlow, who no longer believes she has a job, despite the long application procedures and background checks. “It was a 14-month process to get to the point we were at.” Barlow views herself as part of the working poor. But under the Trump administration’s logic, she is part of the venal Washington “swamp” that needs to be drained. Never mind that Barlow works 350 miles from the Beltway, and says she and her husband can barely cover basic necessities for their 14-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son.Trump promised the freeze while on the campaign trail, and delivered on it during his first week in office. Except under certain circumstances, vacancies in federal positions will not be filled for at least the next 90 days, as agencies “pause” to re-evaluate how they are staffed; the primary exceptions are for military, national security and public safety jobs. Although current employees will not be laid off, the administration hopes it will trim the federal workforce through attrition.“We’ve got to respect the American taxpayer,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, explained Monday. “[T]o see money get wasted in Washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting.”Trump campaigned on the idea of bringing good jobs “back to America,” but for those who had solid government positions on the line, their jobs are at risk of being taken away. With the hiring process bottled up, their lives are effectively on hold, leaving many unsure of how they’ll pay their bills if a job doesn’t materialize at the end of the freeze, if and when that comes. When Kristin Williams, 55, heard about Trump’s hiring freeze, she called the Census Bureau to find out if she might still get a seasonal Census job that would last until Sept. 30. She’d already filled out extensive paperwork for the post and was waiting to hear on the next steps. But the staffer told her that as of now, the position would remain unfilled. Williams, who lives in Pennsylvania, was counting on the job. She is a self-employed artist who sells her work on Etsy and has been struggling to re-enter the workforce ever since she took time off to take care of her mother, who was sick, for five years. When she tried get back on her feet in 2010, the job market was tough for someone with her skills.“I have been underemployed since then,” Williams said. “It was at a point where it wasn’t even worth looking for jobs because it was like the whole middle was hollowed out. There were really low-paying crappy jobs or jobs where you had to have so much experience it wasn’t even worth applying.”One reason she was excited about the Census job was that it would allow her to give money back to the government. She owes a fair amount in property taxes, she said, and was going to talk to the agent about a payment plan, hinging on the expectation that she would get this temporary work that would bring in new income. “But now what am I going to tell them? I have absolutely no means of paying it,” Williams said, adding, “It’s starting to feel really really desperate. It’s just like, the last blow. I didn’t even cry. I’m just numb. I’m angry, I’m numb. I’m scared. I just don’t know what I’m going to do.”The Census Bureau did not return a request for comment on the freeze. Though the size of the federal workforce has remained fairly consistent over the last several decades ― actually decreasing as a share of the overall civilian workforce ― Republicans have long portrayed it as constantly ballooning. GOP leadership praised Trump for instituting the hiring freeze, but it could prove more costly and damaging than they acknowledge. Democrats and federal employee unions have pointed to a Government Accountability Office study that analyzed a series of freezes in the late 1970s and early 1980s in which auditors found that they were “ineffective,” failed to substantially reduce the workforce while disrupting agencies, and led to “decreased oversight” and “lost revenue” for the government. Human resource experts have warned that Trump’s freeze would merely encourage the most qualified workers to leave the government to pursue more promising options, leaving behind the least productive employees. It also makes it harder to change jobs within the government, disrupting workers’ life plans. One Defense Department employee, who asked for anonymity to protect her job, recently received a tentative offer for a promotion within the agency that required relocating. She and her husband are veterans, a demographic disproportionately employed in federal jobs. They sold their house and put an offer on a new one. Then came the freeze.“Now I’m just in this limbo where I’m probably going to have to rent a house, and I’m going to have to switch my kids’ schools. ... It’s very frustrating for us,” she said, adding that they were allowed to withdraw the offer on the new house. She said she was thankful that her current team is understanding about her situation and letting her stay in her position. Other federal employees who work on seasonal shifts worry they won’t be let back on the job. A park ranger named Bob, who asked to not reveal his last name for fear of retribution, said that his start date of May 1 at a historical civil war park might be canceled. The job pays $12.49 an hour, and Bob, in his mid-60s, is semi-retired. For him, the freeze is both a financial and emotional hit. Bob first went to the park with his wife on Memorial Day and fell in love with the spot after hearing about its history. Then and there, he resolved to give future visitors that same experience. He volunteered as a ranger for three years before becoming a paid ranger this last one. “The people who do this don’t go out and read a script,” he said. “It is a labor of love. No one who wears that park service uniform does it for the money.”A spokesman with the National Park Service said they were still looking for guidance as to whether their 10,000 seasonal park rangers could be rehired when the crowds begin to swell in the summer. “I don’t know what I’m going to do after May 1,” Bob said. “I want to work and continue contributing. But we don’t know what’s going to happen and that’s as bad as anything else. It has created a huge upheaval for 10,000 families.”  At the heart of a federal hiring freeze is a belief that the government is in need of shrinking. But when it shrinks, it’s not just federal employees who are affected but also those people dependent on government workers, functions and agencies. “Everyone is hurting for positions now, and they’re going to hurt even more,” said J. David Cox, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 670,000 workers. “The real person who’s going to feel the pain is the person who waits longer to get their social security benefits, the veteran who waits longer to have a claim adjudicated, and someone with a safety problem at their workplace.”In her daycare job, Barlow looks after the children of federal workers in her building, many of whom told her they’re concerned about their workloads now that open positions won’t be filled. One employee told her they were expecting to hire more than two dozen employees in the department Barlow was hoping to join. They don’t expect that will be happening now. “It’s heartbreaking, and I don’t understand what the endgame is for Donald Trump,” she said. “It’s really frustrating to walk into a building and know there are empty desks upstairs.”"
38,POLITICS,Lawmakers Think It's Not Easy Enough To Carry Concealed Weapons In Their States,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/concealed-carry-laws_us_588ba63be4b0176377943055,Proposed bills would roll back a range of safety requirements.,2017-01-28,New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu says he would sign a bill taking away police discretion in granting concealed carry licenses.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588bb8e81b0000250004ce30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pat Sullivan was working as a local police chief in southern New Hampshire a few years ago when a man with a tinfoil hat came into his station to apply for a license to carry a concealed weapon. Based on the man’s hat and the fact that he had been arrested for threatening the life of a radio host in the state, Sullivan denied him the license. New Hampshire is an open carry state, but gives local law enforcement officers like Sullivan the power to deny concealed handgun permits at their discretion.Now, New Hampshire is on the verge of eliminating the 94-year-old law that requires residents to get a license in order to carry a concealed weapon. Without that law, the police won’t even get a chance to look over the next man in the tinfoil hat.It’s already legal to carry a concealed handgun without a permit in nearly a dozen states. The current efforts in New Hampshire and several other states to repeal even their modest licensing measures reflect the determination of the National Rifle Association and other gun advocates to make it even easier to carry a gun. With Republicans gaining control of a record number of state legislatures in November, that push looks likely to succeed.The New Hampshire Senate has already passed a bill to repeal the state’s licensing measure and the House is expected to follow. Former New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D), who is now a U.S. senator, had vetoed two previous attempts to repeal the licensing requirement, but a spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu (R) says he will sign the measure should it reach his desk. A vetting process allows law enforcement to make sure that people who might be a threat to others and who have a history of violent misconduct or other problems aren’t allowed to carry a concealed weapon, said William Rosen, counsel at the gun safety group Everytown. Repealing concealed carry requirements, he said, would dismantle a “longstanding and sensible public safety system.”Sullivan, now the executive director of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, and other law enforcement officers have spoken out against the New Hampshire bill.The state’s century-old licensing requirements have worked well, according to Zandra Rice Hawkins, executive director of the progressive advocacy organization Granite State Progress.“Somebody may not be a prohibited person on paper, but they’re certainly not somebody who should have that added benefit of having a hidden loaded weapon,” Rice Hawkins said in explaining why the police should have discretion whether to grant concealed carry licenses.She said people ask how concealed carry differs from open carry. “I give that example of the person who has been in several bar fights or has a history of assault. It is a very different situation if you are exchanging words with someone and you do not know that they have a hidden loaded weapon with them ― versus someone who’s open-carrying, you have a little bit more sense of where that person is coming from.”Sullivan said the permitting requirement also provides an additional level of security for police officers.“There are many people that carry concealed weapons that are doing good, that aren’t doing bad things. However, there is an element that we deal with as law enforcement, in terms of a regular basis, that are no good,” he said. “They are committing crimes, violent crimes, and we don’t know whether or not they do or do not have a weapon on them. With the permits, you at least have an idea as to whether or not they have a legal weapon on them. You encounter someone roadside, you don’t know what you have. It kind of just gives that little bit of added security and safety.”Similar bills to lift concealed carry requirements are pending in Texas, Kentucky, Utah and North Dakota.The Texas measure would simply remove all current licensing requirements and allow anyone who is permitted to purchase a handgun to legally carry it. Among those requirements that residents must now meet if they want to carry a gun: They must be 21 years old, have no felony convictions, not be a “chemically dependent person” and owe no child support. They have to get fingerprinted, pay a $140 application fee, complete a classroom training course and pass a written examination and proficiency demonstration.“I think that anyone that doesn’t go through training is an idiot. But I think that government-mandated testing and training is a joke,” Texas state Rep. Jonathan Stickland (R), who is sponsoring the legislation, told HuffPost. “I will tell you, I’ve put probably hundreds of hours into my firearms training. And I think most responsible gun owners understand that government-mandated stuff is typically not sufficient. I think it gives a false sense of security.”Stickland said that his measure was intended to make it less costly to carry a handgun.“We’re just trying to remove the barriers for the folks that can’t financially afford to do so. We think their Second Amendment rights matter just as much as the people who can pay the fees, the government-mandated tests,” he said.Kentucky also doesn’t make it too difficult to carry a concealed weapon. To obtain a license, residents need to meet the federal requirements necessary to buy a firearm, have no felony convictions and complete a training course. They also need to be 21 and have no history of certain criminal offenses and no dependency on drugs or alcohol.State Sen. Albert Robinson (R), the sponsor of a bill to repeal the licensing requirement, noted that the Kentucky constitution explicitly guarantees the right to bear arms. His bill, he said, was a matter of convenience for gun owners.“If you’re in shorts and you have a holster around your ankle, it’s perfectly legal according to the constitution to do that,” Robinson said. “If you put your britches back on, it’s covered and it’s illegal. If you have a jacket or a coat or something, if you have a jacket off and you have one on your side, it’s constitutionally legal. But if you put your jacket back on, it’s simply illegal.” Robinson feels comfortable allowing people to carry weapons without training.“That’s a free choice that people have. If they want the training, we encourage it, but the constitution does not require it and I’m not gonna put any extra stuff on it,” the lawmaker said, adding that he wanted to allow people to be “nice and courteous” if they didn’t want to flash their gun outside.He acknowledged that he’s worked with the NRA on his legislation.“I worked with the NRA on it, this bill, it’s a bill that they’re promoting. I wrote the bill willingly, but of course you know they’re supporting me on this. This is an NRA bill. It is, but it’s my bill,” Robinson said. “They and I encourage people to know how to handle the weapons, because if you get one that don’t know how to handle it, you have a need to get it out and the person could take it away from you and beat your brains out with your own weapon that way.”Bills to repeal licensing requirements to carry guns are often dubbed “constitutional carry,” a label that Everytown’s Rosen calls a “facetious misnomer” because there’s no guaranteed right to carry a concealed weapon in the U.S. Constitution. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to bear arms for lawful purposes, but the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, made it clear that some restrictions on the right would be constitutional.“Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,” Scalia wrote.Rice Hawkins noted that if New Hampshire’s licensing requirement is repealed, suspected drug dealers would legally be able to carry a concealed weapon.“Now is somebody who’s already breaking the law going to follow other laws?” she asked. “Probably not.

Jonathan Stickland has sponsored a measure to eliminate permitting requirements to carry a concealed handgun.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588cac1e1700002f001d0e58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pat Sullivan was working as a local police chief in southern New Hampshire a few years ago when a man with a tinfoil hat came into his station to apply for a license to carry a concealed weapon. Based on the man’s hat and the fact that he had been arrested for threatening the life of a radio host in the state, Sullivan denied him the license. New Hampshire is an open carry state, but gives local law enforcement officers like Sullivan the power to deny concealed handgun permits at their discretion.Now, New Hampshire is on the verge of eliminating the 94-year-old law that requires residents to get a license in order to carry a concealed weapon. Without that law, the police won’t even get a chance to look over the next man in the tinfoil hat.It’s already legal to carry a concealed handgun without a permit in nearly a dozen states. The current efforts in New Hampshire and several other states to repeal even their modest licensing measures reflect the determination of the National Rifle Association and other gun advocates to make it even easier to carry a gun. With Republicans gaining control of a record number of state legislatures in November, that push looks likely to succeed.The New Hampshire Senate has already passed a bill to repeal the state’s licensing measure and the House is expected to follow. Former New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D), who is now a U.S. senator, had vetoed two previous attempts to repeal the licensing requirement, but a spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu (R) says he will sign the measure should it reach his desk. A vetting process allows law enforcement to make sure that people who might be a threat to others and who have a history of violent misconduct or other problems aren’t allowed to carry a concealed weapon, said William Rosen, counsel at the gun safety group Everytown. Repealing concealed carry requirements, he said, would dismantle a “longstanding and sensible public safety system.”Sullivan, now the executive director of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, and other law enforcement officers have spoken out against the New Hampshire bill.The state’s century-old licensing requirements have worked well, according to Zandra Rice Hawkins, executive director of the progressive advocacy organization Granite State Progress.“Somebody may not be a prohibited person on paper, but they’re certainly not somebody who should have that added benefit of having a hidden loaded weapon,” Rice Hawkins said in explaining why the police should have discretion whether to grant concealed carry licenses.She said people ask how concealed carry differs from open carry. “I give that example of the person who has been in several bar fights or has a history of assault. It is a very different situation if you are exchanging words with someone and you do not know that they have a hidden loaded weapon with them ― versus someone who’s open-carrying, you have a little bit more sense of where that person is coming from.”Sullivan said the permitting requirement also provides an additional level of security for police officers.“There are many people that carry concealed weapons that are doing good, that aren’t doing bad things. However, there is an element that we deal with as law enforcement, in terms of a regular basis, that are no good,” he said. “They are committing crimes, violent crimes, and we don’t know whether or not they do or do not have a weapon on them. With the permits, you at least have an idea as to whether or not they have a legal weapon on them. You encounter someone roadside, you don’t know what you have. It kind of just gives that little bit of added security and safety.”Similar bills to lift concealed carry requirements are pending in Texas, Kentucky, Utah and North Dakota.The Texas measure would simply remove all current licensing requirements and allow anyone who is permitted to purchase a handgun to legally carry it. Among those requirements that residents must now meet if they want to carry a gun: They must be 21 years old, have no felony convictions, not be a “chemically dependent person” and owe no child support. They have to get fingerprinted, pay a $140 application fee, complete a classroom training course and pass a written examination and proficiency demonstration.“I think that anyone that doesn’t go through training is an idiot. But I think that government-mandated testing and training is a joke,” Texas state Rep. Jonathan Stickland (R), who is sponsoring the legislation, told HuffPost. “I will tell you, I’ve put probably hundreds of hours into my firearms training. And I think most responsible gun owners understand that government-mandated stuff is typically not sufficient. I think it gives a false sense of security.”Stickland said that his measure was intended to make it less costly to carry a handgun.“We’re just trying to remove the barriers for the folks that can’t financially afford to do so. We think their Second Amendment rights matter just as much as the people who can pay the fees, the government-mandated tests,” he said.Kentucky also doesn’t make it too difficult to carry a concealed weapon. To obtain a license, residents need to meet the federal requirements necessary to buy a firearm, have no felony convictions and complete a training course. They also need to be 21 and have no history of certain criminal offenses and no dependency on drugs or alcohol.State Sen. Albert Robinson (R), the sponsor of a bill to repeal the licensing requirement, noted that the Kentucky constitution explicitly guarantees the right to bear arms. His bill, he said, was a matter of convenience for gun owners.“If you’re in shorts and you have a holster around your ankle, it’s perfectly legal according to the constitution to do that,” Robinson said. “If you put your britches back on, it’s covered and it’s illegal. If you have a jacket or a coat or something, if you have a jacket off and you have one on your side, it’s constitutionally legal. But if you put your jacket back on, it’s simply illegal.” Robinson feels comfortable allowing people to carry weapons without training.“That’s a free choice that people have. If they want the training, we encourage it, but the constitution does not require it and I’m not gonna put any extra stuff on it,” the lawmaker said, adding that he wanted to allow people to be “nice and courteous” if they didn’t want to flash their gun outside.He acknowledged that he’s worked with the NRA on his legislation.“I worked with the NRA on it, this bill, it’s a bill that they’re promoting. I wrote the bill willingly, but of course you know they’re supporting me on this. This is an NRA bill. It is, but it’s my bill,” Robinson said. “They and I encourage people to know how to handle the weapons, because if you get one that don’t know how to handle it, you have a need to get it out and the person could take it away from you and beat your brains out with your own weapon that way.”Bills to repeal licensing requirements to carry guns are often dubbed “constitutional carry,” a label that Everytown’s Rosen calls a “facetious misnomer” because there’s no guaranteed right to carry a concealed weapon in the U.S. Constitution. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to bear arms for lawful purposes, but the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, made it clear that some restrictions on the right would be constitutional.“Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,” Scalia wrote.Rice Hawkins noted that if New Hampshire’s licensing requirement is repealed, suspected drug dealers would legally be able to carry a concealed weapon.“Now is somebody who’s already breaking the law going to follow other laws?” she asked. “Probably not. But we also shouldn’t make it easier and give them the flexibility to be able to do that.”"

With yesterday’s new blanket ban on immigration from Iran (one of seven Muslim-majority countries targeted), President Trump is going well beyond US precedent and taking steps directly against Iran’s population.Even if banning entire countries were an effective way to fight terrorism (which it is not), the inclusion of Iran in this ban is extremely hard to justify. While the list does not include the countries of origin for the 19 hijackers in the September 11 attacks, it includes Iran because its government is a state sponsor of terror; not because of the actions of its citizens. In fact, not a single Iranian national has committed an act of terror against the US homeland. Conflating government action with that of its people is both dangerous and harmful to US interests. It is noteworthy that in signing this executive order, President Trump stated that, “We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.” Perhaps, like many Americans, the President is unaware that the vast majority of Iranians actually hold a very positive view of the United States. As I wrote in another article, Debunking the Many Myths Americans Have About Iran, Iranians are among the friendliest people towards the US in the Middle East, a region where US good will is in short supply. It is in America's strong national interest to retain this support; not to alienate the entire population with a blanket ban on immigration. It is easy to see how Iranian good will toward the US will quickly diminish; the stories of those who will be affected by this ban are both frustrating and heartbreaking. One person who will no longer be able to come to the United States is a good friend of mine who was hoping to complete her Geophysics PhD at an American university. For the past two years it has been her singular goal to study English and improve her IELTS and GRE scores so that she could transfer to a school in the US. My friend is one of those people Trump claims he wants to come here: one of the best and the brightest in her subject in Iran, having earned a full scholarship to Tehran University. It is distressing that she may no longer be able to study in the US because of a ban that I cannot rationally explain.Until the ban is lifted or Iran complies with the Trump administration’s request for additional information on Iranian citizens (which is unlikely), the people of Iran will no longer be able to study, visit family, or start a new life here. They are understandably shocked and upset. However, this action has ramifications beyond the effects on individual lives; it will also erode over thirty years of American messaging to the Iranian people. Since the 1979 revolution, American leadership has been making the case that US sanctions and opposition to Iran have been a function of Iranian government policies and are not directed towards the Iranian people. Unfortunately, President Trump’s new ban sends exactly the opposite message. "

We fiercely condemn the executive action orders you’ve signed: banning Syrians from taking refuge in the United States, halting immigration to the United States from Muslim nations, and ordering the construction of a Mexican border wall. These, all under the pretense of, “Protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry,” meanwhile only selectively banning some Muslim nation’s citizens from entering, and while altogether neglecting to recognize that in this country: what makes America great, are Americans - the melting pot of refugees and immigrations from generational waves. The diversity, the international communities, the embrace of different cultures and languages, are what make America great. What we believe you’ve neglected to recognize just yet, is that we - as entities of humanity - have all fallen victim to circumstantial society. Not one single person on Earth chooses where they are born, and not one of us gets to choose what history precedes us.What I believe you’ve neglected to recognize just yet, is that conflict and terror do not solve themselves through governments and leaders, or through walls and immigration bans. Peace does not lie in the hands of Presidents and Executive Orders. History has shown that Peace lies in the hands of the many - Peace is in our, the people’s, hands. Your spiteful ban on refugees entering the United States, and your immigration bans on Muslim countries, your proposed wall on the Mexico border, are NOT who we are. This is NOT who America is. On the day after Holocaust remembrance day, let us remember and NEVER FORGET the impact of these types of legislations. Let us recognize our DUTY as fellow human beings to do whatever is in our power to combat prejudice, and to fiercely condemn violence and war.It is our duty to help those seeking refuge from war, those who have lost everything but the clothes on their backs in an effort to remain safe. I personally say this with my thoughts and my heart recognizing the plight of all of the refugees I was personally honored to meet during my time volunteering at Ritsona Refugee Camp, and all of the refugees who have shared their stories with me at Voices of Refugees*. I say this after my experience with these human beings day-in and day-out for months - witnessing the weight of displacement and trauma beyond their control. I've heard harrowing stories of loss and of suffering, I've seen people lose hope and fall victim to their own torn souls. These human beings are only seeking a pathway to peace - denying them that right is denying our history as a nation, and the world's history as a combatant force.It is also our moral obligation as a people to recognize that diversity is what makes us who we are - that segregation and prejudice are NOT the answer to terror or to keeping America “safe”.We, as a people, will continue to be compassionate and open. We will continue to embrace our differences, not isolate them. And we WILL still keep our heads and hopes up because we know the tremendous impact love and empathy has.You may try to close our borders, your may try to neglect our heritage as a nation. But, we as a people, will not tolerate hatred and prejudice. We will not tolerate suffering and struggle.We WILL march, we will demonstrate, and we will fight against these executive orders, against injustice, racism, and xenophobia - but most importantly: we will be compassionate, and we will be open in our minds and hearts. Our sentiments are stronger than any pen to a paper, and our will is what will ultimately triumph over all.And to be absolutely clear:NO HUMAN BEING IS ILLEGAL.AND YES, REFUGEES ARE - AND WILL ALWAYS BE - WELCOME.*Familiarize yourself with human beings from Syria, Iraq, Sudan, and elsewhere who are now officially banned from seeking refuge in the United States:"

Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 20, 2017.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588cea6d17000017002d9020.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last weekend, protesters took to the streets of Washington D.C. for the inauguration of America’s 45th President, Donald J. Trump. While the vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful, there were highly publicized reports of some riots, which resulted in serious damage to vehicles and businesses. According to the media, approximately 100 protestors were responsible for smashing the storefront windows of a McDonalds, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Starbucks in downtown Washington D.C. In addition, these protesters caused a host of other damages, including breaking the windows of cars and limousines and using flares and other incendiary devises to catch them on fire. In response, Trump supporters maintained that the act of rioting is only endemic to Democrats, claiming that there were “no riots when Obama was elected.” Although I dispelled this historically revisionist account in part with an earlier article published in The Hill, the inauguration riots deserve further analysis. Just as in 2017, the protests of Obama’s inaugurations were largely peaceful. However, many of the demonstrations against Obama were founded in racist rhetoric. For example, in 2009, the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan asked for its members to wear black armbands and fly the U.S. flag upside down on Inauguration Day and Obama’s first full day in office. In addition, the National Socialist Movement website released a statement that asked for mobilization, saying that, “President-elect Obama is going to be the spark that arouses the ‘white movement.’” The National Socialist Movement and its supporters felt that Obama’s election was good in one sense, because it would make ""white people clear of the fact that that government in Washington, D.C., is not our government."" Petitions to secede from the union were filed on behalf of 23 states following Obama’s election to a second term. Obama’s inauguration in 2013 was also peacefully protested by demonstrators, such as the Westboro Baptist Church, who carried signs that read, “Fag Lover Obama,” “Soldiers Die 4 Fag Marriage,” and “Antichrist Obama.” Even Donald J. Trump responded to Obama’s second election into office by asking his followers to “march on Washington” in protest. However, although the majority of demonstrations against Obama’s inaugurations were peaceful, while being rooted in racist rhetoric, there were also riots. For example, in 2013, 50-60 protestors smashed “a DVA Federal Credit Union ATM at 800 K Street NW, smashed a window and splattered paint on a side window at a bank at 901 7th Street NW and smashed a window at the Hooters at 825 7th Street NW, D.C.” One of the pamphlets left at the scene suggested that the culprits were anarchists, not conservatives or Republicans. A pamphlet left at the scene read, “Against Every Cop. Against Every Boss. Against Every President.”It is highly likely that the same or similar group who rioted against President Obama caused the damage at President Trump’s inauguration. Prior to Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, anarchist groups threatened to disrupt the events. Moreover, in the wake of the damage, the anarchy symbol was sprayed in graffiti on the side of the Board of Education Building in downtown D.C. Conservative news outlets also circulated pictures of vandalized New Orleans monuments, attributing the graffiti to “Anti-Trump Rioters.” However, again here, the graffiti was accompanied by an anarchy symbol. Ultimately, conservatives need to stop forgetting history in order to discredit Trump protesters. The hundreds of thousands of people who marched on Washington last weekend were by and large voicing legitimate concerns. Attempting to delegitimize their message by citing the violence and damage caused by a few will do nothing more than to further polarize our nation."

While there are some moments where we glimpse the rich wisdom that animates the Society of Jesus, my biggest problem with Silence is that it conveys torture much more effectively than it conveys Christian faith. Christianity makes a radical, startling truth-claim: God, the source of all reality, is a personal being who is in love with the human community. That love is discernible in our amazing inner lives and in the way love defeats hatred over and over in human history. Further, such love is so fecund that God personally united with us even more deeply in the historical person of Jesus of Nazareth.In this opening salvo, I am guilty of the same mistake that Silence makes: I started with ideas instead of a description of the work: the consequences of Christianity’s radical idea. Christianity should always be about the work. The work that flows from recognizing that every person participates in the same unity between the human and the divine that Jesus disclosed. The work that is required so that people are treated as they are: not simply animals with very sophisticated brains. We are animals but animals that possess the capacity for reflecting, loving, and creating beauty. Ideas, the conceptual description of our human experience, are necessary but must be secondary to the work. That is what Silence gets wrong about the experience of the Jesuits and their tiny communities in Japan.If the goal of a narrative is to communicate human experience, this visual narrative communicates relentless suffering with the artful use of the peasants’ bodies against themselves. The juxtaposing of the excessively well-tended bodies of the aristocrats with the neglected and starved bodies of the peasants is the most effective feature of the film. The inner life of the Jesuits was not nearly so well expressed. What does this cinematic Silence teach us? The powerful use other human persons as stoop laborers; the efficiency with which they manage peasants as resources is staggeringly effective. It teaches us what institutionalized terrorism looks like. More horrific than a Western dungeon precisely because the various implements are so elegant to the eye. Beautiful grass mats that bind the peasants for execution by drowning; soft, carefully wrapped cloths that cover people who are hanging upside down while they slowly bleed from a neck wound. The deep ugliness of dehumanization is cloaked in delicate and graceful objects. The film is blazingly clear in communicating that aspect of the experience of missionary Christianity; it is quite dim when it comes to expressing the message of love and hope and the acts of care that marked the work of those early Jesuits.Lest I presume too much knowledge about “the Jesuits,” let me provide some context. Jesuits are members of a Catholic community that was founded by Ignatius of Loyola, to a Basque family in Spain in 1491. The community he founded was highly effective in responding to the corruption in the institutional Catholic Church in the 14th and 15th centuries. Though his cultural milieu was Catholic, he came to his own personal faith as an adult. That move is an enduring one; many people grow up in a religious practice and embrace or reject it as adults.When Ignatius discovered Christianity’s truth-claims from the inside-out, he experienced a deep desire to serve the mission of Jesus Christ. That desire was ignited in an adult personality that was predisposed for vigorous striving. As one with such inclinations would, he wanted to understand the Christian story the better to serve it. So he went on a rigorous journey of action and study so that he could stabilize the insight that changed his life. He made it his business to understand Jesus as an intimate companion; he made it his business to create a way of life that served Jesus. Another Jesuit with a Japanese connection, Pedro Arrupe, (he had some medical training and used it in the immediate aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing), described this Ignatian work as “forming men and women for others.”Such is Catholic Christianity in a Jesuit key: service to Jesus begins in listening to his story so that story is told again and again by and in our own individual lives. The most effective way to shape your own Christian life is to connect Jesus’ life with your own. In so doing, Jesus becomes your companion and thus guides and directs and animates both your thoughts and your behaviors. This is what so many of my students display so well.I did not learn this Jesuit key until I was in graduate studies in Catholic Theology. My learning curve has been steepest since I have been teaching Catholicism using Ignatius’ method. My best mentors have been students, usually those who attended Jesuit high schools where Arrupe’s charge to form “men and women for others” is the stated educational philosophy. Two such young men recently gave me a formative jolt. Eric and Josef were seniors at Santa Clara when I came to know them. As we moved through class together, they displayed their Jesuit training over and over. Since I now know that lens so well, when it is present, I recognize that particular gleam. Just last spring when it seemed impossible that we would send a sexual predator to the White House, I was visiting with them before class one day. We were conversing about television and since The Game of Thrones is quite popular I asked if they had been watching the current season. Eric said, “I don’t watch it.” Josef: “Yeah, I used to but it promotes rape culture so I stopped.” Both were so matter-of-fact with such a critically acute stance, that I felt a little rocky on my feet for a moment.Young men in their early 20s identifying and rejecting “rape culture.” Such a judgment displays a robust understanding of an essential Ignatian insight that flows from the deep attention to the imagination: “finding God in all things.” Women’s bodies are not “things”; they are intense locations of personhood and must be treated as such. More than once, when watching The Game of Thrones, I had asked myself what the difference is between this image of a woman’s naked body and pornography. I found myself asking the same thing throughout Silence. What is the difference between these images of torture and the glorification of torture?Josef and Eric displayed the Ignatian move between experience and critical thinking with the precision of ballet dancers. They were particularly impressive because they are so young and the culture of their youth is saturated with images of human bodies, especially women’s bodies as objects. Every generation has to navigate the perilous territory where our bodies draw us deeper into intimate relationships. In our time many think “humiliating women is acceptable” and that women “deserve” to be treated as collections of alluring body parts. I nod to Michelle Obama for that language from her stirring response to the now, and hopefully always, infamous film of Donald Trump describing his well-honed techniques for groping women.Eric and Josef were doing Christian work by refusing to use the power of their own imaginations to embrace tableaus that denigrate human bodies. Why? Behavior functions. Watching women’s bodies being treated like things fabricates the idea that women’s bodies are just that: things.Jesuits are famous for their muscular attention to the human imagination. Ignatius recognized that in order to navigate the room between our inner lives and our actual human experiences in the world, we needed more than ideas and concepts. We are people of the story, the narrative. Yes, the story better have a theme otherwise it is not a story but just a disjointed collection of events. But if the theme becomes disconnected from the experience one of two things happen. It becomes an ideology that no longer reflects real, actual experiences of human persons and communities. Or staleness sets in and the story becomes obsolete.The Judeo-Christian Story is the story of God’s presence to human persons. That experience, like everything human, privileges our bodies, our complexly simple bodies. Our inner life is rooted in our actual, physical, historical life in the world. That challenging pivot, between the inner and the outer is the center of gravity for our humanity. We are people of the story. We reflect on our experience of ourselves to ourselves. Things happen to us and we automatically ask ourselves what they mean. Even the most un-self-reflective person does so to some degree; it is the constitutive feature of our personhood. If we are people of the story we are therefore people of the question. What does the story mean? What does our embodiment mean and how is it related to our spiritual features that resides in our minds, our imaginations, our motivations?This radically embodied situation is where Silence was so dissatisfying. It certainly displays embodiment acutely. The inner life of the Jesuits was not nearly so well expressed. We are given images of the cross and a couple vague references to how the hope for “paradise” gives the peasants a way to manage their relentless deprivation and the menacing character of their existence. Rodrigues’ determined explanation of how the “truth” belongs to Christianity is overly conceptualized and deeply unsatisfying especially in the face of such well-executed violence upon the bodies of the very people Rodrigues claims to value. One of the most profoundly moving moments is the exquisitely subtle acting of Tadanobu Asano, the Interpreter, as he conveys contempt for the Jesuits as well as the tiniest signal of his carefully veiled compassion for the peasants. Immersed in the experience he does not for one minute buy Rodrigues’ claims about the “truth.”I do not dispute that there is a relationship between the truth and Christianity. But it is not primarily located in the conceptual, the intellectual. Its foundation, its center of gravity is the essential human question about whether or not human existence has any ultimate meaning. Are we like the Japanese peasants? The Inquisitor sees them as commodities, animals that perform the labor required for the delicately opulent lives of the powerful. In Silence, except for the well disguised compassion of the Interpreter, the powerful display no love. In contrast, when the peasant Christians embrace the two Jesuits, their love and care shines through the drab conditions of their lives. The imagery of the peasants in hiding provide some rich moments where even in the deprivation, the intimate care in that small community fairly seeps from the screen.Love is located in our bodies; our bodies carry and serve all our intimacies. Expressions of family, friendship, community, and sexual love all share the same abiding conundrum of our lives as embodied spirits. What is the relationship between our bodies and our spirits? Are our desires for knowledge, love, beauty just complicated chemical reactions set in motion by some crazy combination of our own genes and the events of our lives? Jesus’ story proclaims a resounding “no” to that question. Sadly, Silence tries to tell a Jesuit story with the barest reference to Jesus’ story and so misses both."

However, under President Trump’s Executive Order, these refugees can still be admitted to the US. This applies even if they are not members of religious minorities. Moreover, some Muslims can still be admitted to the US under the so-called “Muslim Ban.” Those who are interested in allowing those refugees who have already been accepted for admission into the US into our country can act now to help them.First, the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security have the discretion to allow even refugees from banned countries into the US. Section 5(e) of the executive order clearly states that The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine, on a case-by-case basis, to admit individuals to the US if “they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest. . . .” The executive order specifically mentions that such an exception might apply “when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship—and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.” Those refugees who have assisted US forces are, perhaps, the least likely refugees to hurt the security or welfare of the US. These refugees have already risked their lives to help US forces in their countries of origin, demonstrating an incredible amount of loyalty to our great country. Moreover, these refugees have already undergone an extensive vetting process, sometimes lasting as long as three years, in order to be approved for admission into our country in the first place. If anyone is likely to arouse the sympathies of the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security—especially General Kelly, a former Marine General whose command was assisted by Iraqis—it is these refugees.Second, Muslim refugees can still enter the US under the executive order. The so-called “Muslim Ban” does not only allow an exception for Christians. It allows exceptions for those who are “religious minorities” in their home countries facing religious persecution. True, this would allow the refugee applications of Christians to be favored over those of many Muslims. However, it would also allow in other refugees—including Sunnis, who are a religious minority in Iraq. (Ironically, it would also allow members of the Alawi sect in Syria, who are members of President ‘Asad’s tribe and often protected by the government, over persecuted Sunnis from that country, but that is another matter). Sunnis from Iraq, including those refugees now being turned away at US airports—could still be admitted. The Secretaries of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security again has the discretion to “issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked,” on a case-by-case basis.Want to help those refugees currently stranded at US airports, who have already been admitted into the US, or who have claims that should be considered? Call the Secretaries of State (202-647-6575) and Homeland Security (202-282-8495). Whenever possible, give them the names of those refugees who are stranded, or who have already been admitted into the country. (I’m currently trying to find out names to link here). Call your reps, give them names, and ask them to pressure the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to do the same. Doing so is imperative—not only to help those refugees who have helped us, but to make sure those who choose to help US troops in the future are unafraid to do so.Jill Goldenziel is Associate Professor at Marine Corps University-Command and Staff College in Quantico.

Sahar Algonaimi, a 60-year-old Syrian national who lives in Saudi Arabia, was detained for nearly five hours at Chicago O’Hare International Airport Saturday morning. She was ultimately forced to board a flight back to the United Arab Emirates, from where she’ll go on to Saudi Arabia. Her sister, 40-year-old Nour Ulayyet, who lives in Indiana and is an American citizen, provided HuffPost with photos of Algonaimi’s plane ticket; her visa to enter the U.S., issued by the U.S. government; and a signed letter from a surgeon to immigration officials saying Algonaimi was “needed to assist” in the care of her sick 76-year-old mother, who is recovering from a surgery for breast cancer. According to Ulayyet, Algonaimi was interviewed by immigration officials in Abu Dhabi and was permitted to board Etihad Airways Flight 151, which arrived in Chicago at 8:48 a.m Saturday.Although Algonaimi had a visa to be in the U.S. ― where she planned to stay for one week ― officials detained her and told her she would not be allowed past the border. “The officer told me that it’s the executive order,” Ulayyet said, recounting a phone call with the border officials detaining her sister. Ulayyet said she and her sister pleaded with the border officials to let Algonaimi visit their sick mother, even for a few hours. But the officials, although kind and apologetic, wouldn’t budge, she said.The mother and her two daughters all wept over the phone to each other ― Algonaimi from the airport, her mother from her hospital bed and Ulayyet from by their mother’s side. “I needed someone to be with me here,” Ulayyet tearfully told HuffPost in a phone call from the hospital Saturday, occasionally excusing herself to translate her mother’s Arabic into English for the attending nurses. She has four children who are staying with friends while she tends to her mother. “We left Syria because of such situations,” she said. “I didn’t leave for Syria for this.” Etihad Airways, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Trump signed the executive order Friday afternoon during a ceremony at the Pentagon. The order bans Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S. indefinitely, shuts down the whole refugee program for 120 days, and bars all immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from entering the country for at least three months.Hours after Trump signed the order, heartbreaking stories emerged from around the country of immigrants, visitors and refugees being detained or deported ― or, in some cases, both ― by border officials scrambling to adjust to the new law. ProPublica reports that the executive order will prevent half a million green card holders, also known as legal permanent residents, from returning home to the U.S. from trips abroad. A White House official told reporters on Saturday that those green card holders can be approved to return with a waiver on a case-by-case basis.A spokeswoman for Church World Service, an organization that handles refugee resettlement, told HuffPost it had planned to welcome 212 refugees next week, the majority of whom would be joining family members already in the U.S. Now the organization expects no refugees to arrive, and no happy reunions. Trump repeatedly made disparaging, fear-mongering and false remarks about Muslims during his presidential campaign. His executive order Friday partially fulfills a campaign promise to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. There have been no fatal terror attacks in the U.S. by immigrants from any of the seven Muslim-majority countries in Trump’s immigration ban.“This is an inhumane law,” Ulayyet said Saturday. “I’m willing to advocate against this law. I’m a local citizen and I do have rights to have a family member come here.”When asked what she would tell Trump if given the opportunity, Ulayyet said that she wishes he could be in her situation. “I want him to feel that same feeling that I have,” she said. Ulayyet said she was proud to take an oath to become an American citizen, and that she’s proud to be a part of this country.“But with this happening now in front of my eyes, how am I going to teach my kids and tell them that this is a free country?” she said. “How can we tell my kids that we have to take care of each other?”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588cd92517000030001d0e96.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new order on Friday largely limiting immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and temporarily suspending all refugee programs. This devastating and unfortunate action comes at a time when migrants and refugees need our help more than ever. A time when a vulnerable population already running from hate and violence in their home countries is asking us to have their back, to lend a hand.But measures like this executive order by the administration do the exact opposite of this. They aim to rid society of terror, not understanding that they’re hurting the very people trying to escape that terror. That by shutting people out, they’re separating whole families, changing the course of so many people’s futures and condemning innocent humans to a dire fate.Already, people are being turned away at airports. It’s been barely 24 hours.And all of a sudden, the people my organization, Catholic Relief Services, helps every day are being deemed a security threat, so much so that aid workers like us are left struggling to do an already testing job.The reason for this measure we are told is to ensure that terrorists do not slip through our asylum and immigration systems. A suspension such as this, the administration claims, would allow for screenings to be modified and strengthened.But there’s a fundamental problem with restrictive orders like this and the premise on which they are based.To deny entry to the United States to people fleeing violence and terror in their communities ― people who have undergone intensive security screenings ― betrays one of our foundational identities as Americans. It is in America’s DNA to be a beacon of hope for those suffering under oppressive regimes.In fact, refugees seeking to enter the U.S. from Syria are already subjected to a rigorous screening system that often takes two years. They are interviewed and their backgrounds are examined by various agencies and government entities in transit countries, and again by the U.S. ― one of the most detailed and careful screening systems imaginable. Now, all Syrians are being shut out indefinitely?We do not oppose further strengthening of this screening system, but we know that U.S. authorities can both keep Americans safe and welcome refugees. And we reject the notion that the resettlement system must be suspended as the system is strengthened.Are terrorists active in the countries targeted by the executive order? Yes. And their victims are residents of those countries ― Syrians, Somalis, Iraqis, Iranians, Yemenis, Sudanese and Libyans. Not Americans.So many have fled that terror seeking safety. Yet the tragically ironic message of this executive order to these victims of terror is this: you cannot come here because you might be a terrorist.But let me present you with the other side so you can understand why the people from these seven countries need our compassion, not our fear.Meet the Basheer family, one of the 1.25 million Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the Middle East and Europe Catholic Relief Services has helped.They left their hometown of Aleppo, Syria a couple of months ago when bombs destroyed their house. Khaled, his wife and three children survived the blast, but their residence didn’t.They lived in a tent for over a year, each day fearing more attacks. The incessant gunfire and explosions and the thought of what the terrorists could do to them drove Khaled and his family to leave.“We were very frightened of an attack by the [Islamic State],” Khaled said. “We heard such horrible stories [about] how cruelly they kill innocent people and rape women and young girls.”“We were frightened every single minute,” he told us.The Basheer family don’t have their own place yet ― they’re in a refugee camp in Serbia ― but they plan to go to Germany and build a new life there if they can.It won’t be the same, Khaled said, but the former construction worker is determined to create something that can once again feel like home.And then there’s 42-year-old Hassan Zaroid.Before the war, Zaroid owned his own business in Homs, Syria. But in 2012, he fled the country to neighboring Jordan with his pregnant wife because it had become too dangerous there. He watched as the life he had built for his new family was ripped away from him in a moment.“I was happy. I had a house. I had a car. But then I lost everything,” Zaroid, who now works for our partner, Caritas Jordan, said.The refugee center in Zarqa has given Zaroid a new sense of hope and purpose even in spite of losing everything.“I’ve gotten better. I’ve started seeing other people who were worse off than me,” he said. “Through my prayers to God I feel optimistic that tomorrow will be a better day.”It’s the experience with refugees like Zaroid and Basheer who continue to give back all that they can that leads us to strongly object to what we have read in the executive order.These are humans just like us. They are the type of people who would make great citizens, great neighbors. They aren’t monsters looking to terrorize America. We trust them, and you should, too.The United States was founded over 240 years ago as a nation of immigrants, many of them refugees fleeing religious persecution. In the years since, the United States has been a beacon of hope for millions seeking freedom and opportunity.And 74 years ago, Catholic Relief Services was founded to help refugees from the violence of World War II. We have worked to build on the ideals of our faith and our country as we seek to help the poor and desperate around the world.We should all work to further this American heritage, especially at a time when turmoil has forced over 65 million people from their homes, more than were displaced after the war at our opening.They need our help, not our hostility.Walling ourselves off from the world – whether with barbed wire, bricks or visa denials – is not going to solve this problem. Instead, we must work together to bring peace where there is fighting, to bring security where there is violence, to bring prosperity where there is poverty.In Matthew 25, Jesus told us to “welcome the stranger.” Pope Francis said “there must be no family without a home, no refugee without a welcome, no person without dignity.”Applying a religious test to determine who should be assisted ― or allowed ― to come to the United States is not what the Gospel teaches us. It’s not what America teaches us. We assist people in need because we are Catholic, not because they are.The inscription on the base of the Statue of Liberty says, “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free... The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me; I lift my lamp beside the golden door.”Those are the kind of executive orders that we should be following."

He did this on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which honors the victims of that atrocity — many of them refugees who tried to flee to the U.S. but were turned away.Our grandparents were refugees.Max Horst Segall and Frieda Lopatka were born in Germany in 1916. They grew up down the street from each other in the Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood of Berlin.When they were teenagers, they fell in love.Max and Frieda were both raised Jewish. Frieda, however, was born to a Christian mother, which meant under Jewish law, she wasn’t Jewish. But in 1936, Frieda chose to formally convert to Judaism so that she could be with Max. At that time, she also received her Hebrew name — Esther, after the clever and resourceful Jewish hero who saved her people from extermination while they were living in a foreign land.In the late 1930s, the German government was obsessed with “protecting” its citizens from Jews, who were portrayed as an internal threat. Citizenship in Germany was based on your father’s birthplace. Because Max’s birth father was born in a disputed area between Poland and Germany, Max was never able to obtain citizenship. After his birth father died, his stepfather, who had fought for Germany in World War I, adopted him. But Max still couldn’t get documents proving that he was German. He was treated as a stateless person — an illegal immigrant. On Oct. 28, 1938, in the middle of the night, he was arrested in his parents’ apartment in Berlin, interrogated, beaten and deported — first to a concentration camp and later to the Warsaw Ghetto.By August 1939, with war looming, Esther had obtained two visas — one to Peru and one to Chile. By that point, many people outside Germany knew that Jews were suffering horrific persecution under the Nazis. But most nations, including the U.S., never opened their doors more than a crack. The perverse logic of the Nazi regime meant that Esther, with her Christian mother, was able to get permission to emigrate. But she never used her visas. She wanted to be with Max. She stayed in Berlin. This is her passport:Soon enough, the government came even for the Jews whose German citizenship was unquestioned. On Nov. 1, 1941, Esther was taken to Grunewald train station. Most people brought there at that time were deported to extermination camps and gassed, or simply shot in the forest and buried in mass graves. Esther, along with Max’s parents, was deported to the Warsaw Ghetto. There they were able to find Max again. In 1942, before the Nazis liquidated the Warsaw Ghetto, Sgt. G――-, a Nazi soldier, helped Max and Esther escape. They were both caught and returned to the ghetto. The Nazi soldier helped them escape again, and they hid in the countryside. During this time, Max joined the Polish Resistance and fought with them from 1942 until 1944. On Easter Sunday, 1944, our grandparents audaciously returned to Berlin by train, carrying fake papers. Max figured that Berlin, which the Nazis had declared free of Jews in May 1943, was the last place the government would look for them. They hid in an attic. It was searched several times, but they were never found.The war ended, and Max and Esther were reunited with their surviving family members. Although they had been married in hiding, they wed again in a civil ceremony on June 4, 1945, just weeks after V-E Day. They wanted to emigrate to the U.S., not Israel. “We’d had enough excitement already,” they said later. But even after the horrors of the Holocaust, the U.S. still refused to open its doors to Jewish refugees. So Max and Esther did what most refugees spend huge periods of their lives doing: They waited.Slowly, the door cracked open. President Harry Truman permitted some 35,000 to 40,000 displaced persons, most of them Jewish, to come between 1945 and 1948. In 1948, Congress passed a law allowing more Jews to reach U.S. shores. In late 1949, our grandparents arrived. The next year, they received a letter from Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson:A few years ago, Rachel won a fellowship and traveled to Germany to learn more about Max and Esther. Through archival research, she found testimony given by our grandfather after the war — and the address where they had hidden in the outskirts of Berlin. She went to that house and knocked on the door. The people who had lived there in the 1940s no longer did. But the current residents had records of the previous owners, a family named B――-.Two brothers, by then in their late 70s, had lived in the house as boys during the war. Rachel set up a call with them. The older brother didn’t remember anything other than that they had been forbidden to enter certain parts of the property when they were little. But then the younger brother revealed something he had never told his sibling before. In their mother’s last years, she had confessed to him that during the war, she and his father had sheltered a young Jewish couple.On Max’s application for U.S. citizenship in 1954, the government asked him whether he had, in the United States or any other country, been arrested, been charged with a violation, broken any law or ordinance, or been fined or imprisoned. He checked “yes.” Then he wrote this:1938: Concentration Camp, Germany. Outcome of Case: Deported to Poland.Our grandparents died when we were young. They loved this country. They were deeply grateful to the U.S. and the other nations that fought and won the war against Hitler. But when we went through their things, we found many valuables stored away in unexpected places. They spoke only rarely about their early lives — and usually to their son-in-law, not their daughter — and they never felt totally safe. They knew how fast a country could change.We miss them. We think about them a lot these days — and the people who chose to help them, and the people who chose not to.Pay attention.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

All the main populist movements from across Europe gathered together there to celebrate the Brexit and Trump victories as a premonition of their own expected success in elections over the coming year. They called on their fellow Europeans to “wake up” like the Americans and British and take back control of their national destinies. What animates these movements for national sovereignty, and paradoxically ties them together across borders, is a double antipathy. Their revolt is against both the faceless forces of global integration represented by trade agreements or Brussels “Eurocrats” and the face-to-face presence of immigrants whom they see as despoiling their own national identities.Scott Malcomson insightfully points out that these movements in Europe see their cultural nationalism not as intolerance of others, but as a defense of diversity in the form of their unique, familiar and cherished way of life they now see as under assault. In their conflated anxieties over Muslim immigrants and terrorism, which they share with President Donald Trump and his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, populists are demonstrating what political scientist Samuel Huntington said after the 9/11 attack by Osama bin Laden about that terrorist leader: “Just as he seeks to rally Muslims by declaring war on the West, he has given back to the West its sense of common identity in defending itself.” More so than in the U.S., the European nationalist’s idea of belonging bears some very worrying baggage. As novelist Elif Shafak says in an interview with The WorldPost, “I am far more concerned about the rise of populism across Europe than the rise of populism in the U.S. Here in the old continent, there is almost a visceral fear of diversity and ‘the other.’” She goes on to say that, “we need to bear in mind that this history is still alive in a fractured, fragmented and uneven continent where we do not always encounter the checks and balances that exist in the U.S. Constitution.” Mimicking the cry of the Koblenz meeting, Shafak concludes, “So, yes, it is a ‘wake up’ call. But not for the tribalists. It is a wake-up call for democrats and liberals and cosmopolitans, for anyone and everyone who holds democracy and pluralism dear. It is a wake-up call for us.”As Nick Visser reports, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing back against the nationalist upsurge. Speaking to church leaders in Germany on Monday, she declared, “We won’t get anywhere by trying to solve problems with polarization and populism. We’ve got to show that we’re committed to the basic principles of our nation.”Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis says he thinks it is Germany’s insistence on Europe-wide austerity policies that are at the root of the problem. To defeat the nationalist resurgence he proposes a “New Deal” for Europe that is an alternative to those policies which he sees as a, “gift to today’s coalition of European right-wing parties called the ‘Nationalist International.’” He continues: “Europe can survive neither as a free-for-all nor as an Austerity Union in which some countries ... are condemned to permanent depression.” President Trump this week also took the first steps toward fulfilling his campaign promise of building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and proposed cuts in federal funding for “sanctuary cities” across the U.S.On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto insisted once again that Mexico would not pay for a border wall ― which he said undermined the “respect” of his “sovereign nation”― and cancelled his upcoming trip to Washington. The two have since spoken by phone. Former Mexican president and chair of the Berggruen Institute’s 21 Century Council, Ernesto Zedillo, goes further. He said to me this week that Trump’s proposals toward his country have “defied legal and economic rationality” from the start and that now, “the time has come to admit that the actions of the new administration have cancelled, at least for the foreseeable future, any agreement stemming from dialogue and negotiation that could satisfy the legitimate interests of both parties.” Labelling the American president’s actions “aggression,” Zedillo joins the rallying cry of his countrymen: “What we reject under any circumstances is any attempt to use a single inch of our territory to build such an abominable structure. It goes without saying that all Mexicans are behind President Peña Nieto when he tells President Trump that we will not pay for his extravagant, offensive and useless project.”In addition to his directives on Mexico, the American president also delivered on his pledge to limit Muslims entering the U.S., signing a document late Friday whose full details still remain unclear at the time of this article’s publish. Charles Kurzman argues that the the proposed limits are “absurd” and counterproductive. It is the strategy of the self-proclaimed Islamic State, he writes “to take advantage of the West’s hypersensitivity to small scale Islamist attacks.” He continues: “Since 2001, there have been zero fatalities in the U.S. by extremists from the countries on Trump’s list.”As Trump crosses off executive order after executive order and as Syria talks sideline America yet again, many wonder if the U.S. president will go easy on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two leaders are slated to speak this weekend, but already, Ukrainians are on edge. From Kiev, just days after Trump’s inauguration, Ian Bateson reports that many there fear the special relationship between Putin and Trump could leave Ukraine in the cold. “We have seen the rhetoric. Now we are waiting for performance,” one politician says. Back in America, millions of demonstrators took to the streets across the U.S. and elsewhere to protest Trump’s policies even before executive orders had been signed. Turkish journalist Ilgin Yorulmaz, who participated in the Washington march, sees a correspondence with resistance in her home country and other countries across the world. “Women (and men) share the same concerns about gender inequality and sexual harassment,” she writes, “regardless of if they live middle class lives in Manhattan or face discrimination on the subways of Istanbul.” Aykan Erdemir and Merve Tahiroglu score new moves by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to consolidate executive power. “An overly centralized polity, a weak legislature and Erdogan’s authoritarianism have brought Turkey to the brink,” they write. Also reflecting on the massive demonstrations, Margaret Levi reviews the experience of how social movements in American history have ultimately shifted the political agenda. These photos document the scope of demonstration that took place last weekend around the world. Hayley Miller reports that despite the Trump administration’s renewed focus on fossil fuels, a new Pew poll says two-thirds of Americans favor a path to a renewable energy future. Writing from Hong Kong, Li Jing reports that Chinese officials say they are prepared “to take a leadership role” in defending the Paris climate accord no matter what the new Trump administration decides to do. Following the splash of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s defense of globalization in Davos last week, Minxin Pei sees trouble for him at home as adversaries resist his anti-corruption crackdown and economic reform agenda. “2017 will be a dangerous year for Xi,” he says. In South Africa, in fact, attempts to model government off of China have already created tension among political parties, explain Eric Olander and Cobus van Staden, with one mayor taking a controversial trip to Taiwan, sparking a Trump-esque “one China” policy violation backlash. Looking to the far future, Deep Space advocate Mary Lynne Dittmar imagines how a full-fledged effort to settle on Mars can help us in our troubled home planet. “Why Mars?” she asks, “Why not the Moon? Simply put, Mars is the best place to develop a ‘local’ infrastructure enabling us to live on another planet, albeit one millions of miles away. In a very real sense Mars is at the far end of the infrastructure we are preparing to revitalize in this country.” Finally, our Singularity series looks at the moral dilemmas posed by new advances in genetic screening that further enable “designer babies” whose characteristics can be selected.EDITORS: Nathan Gardels, Co-Founder and Executive Advisor to the Berggruen Institute, is the Editor-in-Chief of The WorldPost.

51,POLITICS,"Anne Frank Was A Refugee, Too",Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anne-frank-refugee_us_588bc0a4e4b01763779456f4,Her story is a warning about the tragic consequences of turning desperate people away.,2017-01-28,"Sisters Margot Frank and Anne Frank, who both died in the Holocaust.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588925b31c00002d00d944a9.jpeg?cache=PNu2lnXnjg&ops=crop_18_76_1367_1633%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Millions of people have read Anne Frank’s diary to understand the horrors of the Holocaust. But the fate of Frank and her family is also a disturbing reminder of what can happen when the U.S. turns its back on refugees.On Friday, people around the world commemorated International Holocaust Memorial Day, including President Donald Trump, who then rolled out drastic plans aimed at restricting refugees. A number of Jewish organizations have spoken out against Trump’s actions ― the parallels between the experience of Jewish refugees fleeing Europe during the Holocaust and Syrian refugees today are hard to miss.While Frank, a German refugee who died in a Nazi death camp at age 16, is now widely idolized, Americans at the time may have viewed her with the same indifference they currently feel toward refugees from Syria and elsewhere.Frank was a teen when she wrote her now-famous diary, an evocative chronicle of the years her family spent hiding from Nazis in Amsterdam. They were eventually discovered and sent to death camps. She, her sister and her mother all died.Her father, Otto Frank, survived, and later published his daughter’s writings. For decades, teachers have used Anne Frank: The Diary of A Young Girl to teach the value of tolerance and the dangers of hate.Frank’s life could have turned out much differently. In 2005, historians discovered a trove of documents showing Otto Frank’s desperate attempts to gain asylum in the U.S. Over several months in 1941, he wrote letters asking a prominent American friend and a couple of relatives to help get visas for him and his family.“It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for,” he wrote in one letter. “Our own fate is of less importance.”Frank’s American contacts campaigned to government agencies on the family’s behalf and put up thousands of dollars, but increasingly restrictive U.S. immigration policy meant the arduous process eventually failed. Jews in the occupied Netherlands faced growing persecution, and several months later, the Franks went into hiding.Their story reflects the experiences of tens of thousands of others who were denied visas to the U.S. and were later killed.At the time, most Americans opposed taking in more Jewish immigrants, and authorities suggested that refugees posed a national security threat ― President Franklin D. Roosevelt said some Jews seeking asylum could be Nazi spies or saboteurs, according to historian Richard Breitman. In a painful reminder of the consequences of anti-refugee policies, Jewish educator Russel Neiss tweeted on Friday from the perspective of Jewish refugees whose names appeared on the passenger list of the St. Louis ocean liner in 1939.The ship, originally bound for Cuba, carried hundreds of Jews who were fleeing Germany. When Cuban authorities turned away all but a couple dozen people, the 908 remaining passengers sent a telegram begging U.S. authorities to allow them entry. They were denied.Turned away and forced to return to Europe, 254 of the ship’s passengers were murdered in the Holocaust. The Holocaust Memorial Museum has collected their stories online.Trump issued a benign statement Friday morning to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. His pledge to “make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world” followed months of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslims fear-mongering on the campaign trail and a surge of hate crimes after his election.A few hours later, Trump signed an executive order he said would establish “new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.” Details of the final document were hazy, but a draft sought to ban Syrian refugees indefinitely, reduce the number of refugees admitted overall, and suspend admitting people from certain countries. Here’s what Neiss had to say about plans to turn refugees away:Nearly 500,000 Syrians have been killed in the country’s ongoing civil war, and more than 11 million have been displaced. Last year, the United States admitted fewer than 13,000 Syrian refugees, who underwent a long and complicated vetting process to enter the country.Anne Frank’s stepsister Eva Schloss is an Auschwitz survivor. Last January, she condemned the world’s treatment of refugees and said Trump was “acting like another Hitler by inciting racism.”“The experience of the Syrian refugees is similar to what we went through,” Schloss told Newsweek. “We haven’t really learnt anything,” she said."

We don’t want them here,” he said at a swearing-in ceremony at the Pentagon for Secretary of Defense James Mattis. “We don’t want to admit into our country the very threats we are fighting overseas.”Trump approved the refugee ban amid the biggest refugee crisis in history and on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which honors the millions of people killed during World War II, many of whom tried to flee to the U.S. but were turned away.It’s not the blanket ban on Muslims that Trump advocated for during his campaign, and it does not single out any country by name other than Syria for its refugees.But Trump did say earlier in the day that he would prioritize helping Syrian Christians. He also mentioned “radical Islamic terrorists” while signing it. And in the text, it carves out an exception for admitting refugees who are religious minorities even while nearly all others will be barred for 120 days.Here’s what the order will do, with immediate effect:Block refugee admissions from the war-torn country of Syria indefinitely.The executive order, one of many during Trump’s first week in office, is a radical departure from President Barack Obama’s efforts to admit more refugees and improve relationships with Muslims.The State Department is working to implement the executive order’s changes immediately, spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. He said the agency will announce changes affecting travelers as soon as possible.The new policies are expected to affect tens of thousands of people: refugees preparing to come to the U.S.; foreign nationals, immigrants and would-be visitors from designated countries; and Americans whose families will now be unable to visit.Trump’s executive action, a draft of which The Huffington Post obtained earlier this week, fulfills his campaign promise to bar Syrian refugees and partially fulfills his vow to temporarily ban Muslims from the U.S. — a promise he later amended to apply only to people from certain Muslim-majority countries.During his run for president, Trump repeatedly suggested that Syrian refugees and Muslim immigrants are likely terrorists. There is no proven link between refugees and terrorism. Nearly 800,000 refugees have come to the U.S. since Sept. 11, 2001, but fewer than 20 have been arrested on terrorism charges during that time, according to the State Department.Advocates for civil rights, religious liberty, refugees and immigrants decried Trump’s decision as unjust, unnecessary and even harmful. “If terrorism and economic development are indeed related, more migration decreases the opportunity for terrorism,” Vincenzo Bove, an associate professor of politics at the University of Warwick in Britain and the lead author of a 2016 University of Chicago study that found no link between refugees and terror, said in The Washington Post last year.Half of all terrorist attacks carried out in the U.S. since 9/11 were committed by people born in the U.S., according to a 2015 New York Times analysis. Halting immigration from the designated countries “does nothing but plays in the hands of our enemies, it does not strengthen our security,” Khizr Khan, a Trump critic and the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq, said on a call with reporters Friday.The order may also endanger U.S. national security interests, experts said, by imperiling strategic alliances in the Middle East and possibly even playing into the hands of militant organizations like the so-called Islamic State.The order may be “a gift to ISIS,” former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday. “I have no doubt that they will use this order as propaganda” to support their anti-Western rhetoric.A total of 65 million people are displaced worldwide, about 21 million of whom are refugees, according to U.N. data, a number that hasn’t been seen since World War II.The Syrian conflict alone has created more than 4.8 million refugees, most of whom are still stuck in neighboring countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. An additional 6.6 million people are internally displaced.The U.S. has long been the global leader in refugee resettlement, although more than 99 percent of refugees are never placed in other countries, according to UNHCR. Obama, heeding calls from many to take greater responsibility in light of the worsening crisis, raised resettlement quotas from 70,000 people in the 2015 fiscal year to 85,000 in 2016. He also pledged to award at least 10,000 of the 2016 slots for Syrians. Obama proposed admitting 110,000 refugees in the 2017 fiscal year; Trump’s order cuts that by more than half.Trump’s refugee order isn’t entirely unprecedented. The U.S. suspended refugee resettlement for two months following the September 11 terrorist attacks. But since then the government increased its screening measures substantially. Today, all refugees go through an extensive vetting process that typically lasts between 18 to 24 months, with additional screening for those from Syria and Iraq. But many Republicans say that the screening is insufficient. After a terrorist attack in Paris in 2015, more than half of U.S. governors ― including Vice President Mike Pence, then governor of Indiana ― tried to block Syrian refugees from resettling in their states. Courts blocked states’ efforts to ban Syrian refugees because the power to set that immigration policy goes to the federal government. Earlier in the day, Trump issued a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day that spoke about “the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust” without once naming who most of them were: Jews persecuted and discriminated against based on their religion. “In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good,” Trump said. “Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Evans, a drifter and con-man who shared little about himself ― even his age and real identity are mysteries ― may also be responsible for the slaying of a former girlfriend whose body has never been found, authorities said. The woman and children whose bodies were discovered in New Hampshire remain unidentified. DNA tests linked Evans to a preschool girl whose skeletal remains were found in 2000, New Hampshire police said this week. The body of the girl, aged 2 to 4, was found with the remains of a younger girl, aged 1 to 3, inside a 55-gallon steel drum discarded in the woods near Allenstown, in Merrimack County. The remains were so badly decomposed that causes of death couldn’t be determined.Evans was the biological father of the older child, according to the DNA tests. He was not genetically related to the younger girl.But DNA evidence did connect the toddler to the remains of a woman and a girl found not far away in the same woods 15 years earlier.On Nov. 10, 1985, a hunter walking in the wooded area found a steel drum containing the remains of a woman and girl whose age was estimated at 5 to 11. The woman was estimated to be 23 to 32. A medical examiner determined both died as a result of blunt force trauma. New Hampshire State Police Lt. Joseph Ebert told The Huffington Post that mitochondrial DNA testing indicated the woman is related to the oldest and youngest of the three girls, but their exact relationship is unclear.Police said they believed the steel drums were dumped together, and were probably pushed around by kids. They were found about 100 yards apart.Subsequent searches turned up nothing, leads dried up and forensic reconstruction portraits of the victims failed to produce new leads.New life was breathed into the case last year, when a genetic genealogist identified a child Evans was accused of abandoning in California in 1986 as the biological daughter of a woman named Denise Beaudin, who had disappeared in 1981 in New Hampshire. California authorities knew from DNA tests that Evans was not the biological father of that girl, Lisa Beaudin. But once investigators learned Evans had a relationship with Lisa’s mother, they tracked his movements to New Hampshire. Lisa Beaudin was adopted shortly after Evans abandoned her and now has children of her own.Denise Beaudin was 23 when she and Lisa ― then an infant ― disappeared in New Hampshire, according to Strelzin. The link prompted New Hampshire authorities to compare Evans’ DNA with the steel drum victims.Strelzin said he suspects Evans kept Lisa with him as he traveled from New Hampshire to California as “bait” to snare additional victims.“He had a reason for keeping Lisa with him, and then he didn’t want her anymore,’’ Strelzin said.Authorities said Evans probably killed the woman and girls whose bodies were in the drums sometime between 1977 and 1981. They also believe he killed Denise Beaudin. DNA has ruled out that she is the unidentified woman found in the steel drum.Evans’ downfall came in 2002, when authorities in California accused him of murdering his girlfriend, Eunsoon Jun. Her dismembered body was found in the basement of a Richmond home.Evans pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years to life. He was serving his time when he died of natural causes in 2002.Authorities said they believe Evans was in his 60s. His life was a thick docket of arrests and aliases, but thin on personal details. In addition to Bob Evans, he was known as Curtis Mayo Kimball, Gordon Curtis Jenson, Gerald Mockerman, Lawrence Vanner and variations of those names.“He was a calculating guy,” Strelzin said. “He didn’t give out much information about himself. He was being smart about trying to cover his tracks.”Investigators plan additional searches in Merrimack County, in an attempt to locate Beaudin’s body.Lisa Beaudin, now married with three children of her own, has discovered her roots as a result of the investigation. Since learning the identity of her biological mother, she’s been reunited with her grandfather and cousins.“I want to send out a heart-felt thank you to all the organizations and tireless individuals who made this possible,” Lisa Beaudin said in a statement released this week by authorities. “As a victim in this incredulous story, I would like to ask that the media respects my privacy. … Please turn your focus toward the un-identified victims, and other potentially unknown victims in this case, and hopefully their families will also be offered some closure.”Anyone with information in this case is asked to contact New Hampshire State Police at 603-223-3856, or the Manchester Police Department at 603-668-8711."

He was not genetically related to the younger girl.But DNA evidence did connect the toddler to the remains of a woman and a girl found not far away in the same woods 15 years earlier.On Nov. 10, 1985, a hunter walking in the wooded area found a steel drum containing the remains of a woman and girl whose age was estimated at 5 to 11. The woman was estimated to be 23 to 32. A medical examiner determined both died as a result of blunt force trauma. New Hampshire State Police Lt. Joseph Ebert told The Huffington Post that mitochondrial DNA testing indicated the woman is related to the oldest and youngest of the three girls, but their exact relationship is unclear.Police said they believed the steel drums were dumped together, and were probably pushed around by kids. They were found about 100 yards apart.Subsequent searches turned up nothing, leads dried up and forensic reconstruction portraits of the victims failed to produce new leads.New life was breathed into the case last year, when a genetic genealogist identified a child Evans was accused of abandoning in California in 1986 as the biological daughter of a woman named Denise Beaudin, who had disappeared in 1981 in New Hampshire. California authorities knew from DNA tests that Evans was not the biological father of that girl, Lisa Beaudin. But once investigators learned Evans had a relationship with Lisa’s mother, they tracked his movements to New Hampshire. Lisa Beaudin was adopted shortly after Evans abandoned her and now has children of her own.Denise Beaudin was 23 when she and Lisa ― then an infant ― disappeared in New Hampshire, according to Strelzin. The link prompted New Hampshire authorities to compare Evans’ DNA with the steel drum victims.Strelzin said he suspects Evans kept Lisa with him as he traveled from New Hampshire to California as “bait” to snare additional victims.“He had a reason for keeping Lisa with him, and then he didn’t want her anymore,’’ Strelzin said.Authorities said Evans probably killed the woman and girls whose bodies were in the drums sometime between 1977 and 1981. They also believe he killed Denise Beaudin. DNA has ruled out that she is the unidentified woman found in the steel drum.Evans’ downfall came in 2002, when authorities in California accused him of murdering his girlfriend, Eunsoon Jun. Her dismembered body was found in the basement of a Richmond home.Evans pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years to life. He was serving his time when he died of natural causes in 2002.Authorities said they believe Evans was in his 60s. His life was a thick docket of arrests and aliases, but thin on personal details. In addition to Bob Evans, he was known as Curtis Mayo Kimball, Gordon Curtis Jenson, Gerald Mockerman, Lawrence Vanner and variations of those names.“He was a calculating guy,” Strelzin said. “He didn’t give out much information about himself. He was being smart about trying to cover his tracks.”Investigators plan additional searches in Merrimack County, in an attempt to locate Beaudin’s body.Lisa Beaudin, now married with three children of her own, has discovered her roots as a result of the investigation. Since learning the identity of her biological mother, she’s been reunited with her grandfather and cousins.“I want to send out a heart-felt thank you to all the organizations and tireless individuals who made this possible,” Lisa Beaudin said in a statement released this week by authorities. “As a victim in this incredulous story, I would like to ask that the media respects my privacy. … Please turn your focus toward the un-identified victims, and other potentially unknown victims in this case, and hopefully their families will also be offered some closure.”Anyone with information in this case is asked to contact New Hampshire State Police at 603-223-3856, or the Manchester Police Department at 603-668-8711."

The comic’s parodies of a chemically altered Whitney Houston and an overly enthusiastic Oprah Winfrey – played without remorse or reservation during her eight-year run on MADtv ― proved as iconic as they were scathing. The fiery actress doesn’t mince words about the queer community either.“I don’t give a fuck who you fuck; that’s your business,” said Wilson emphatically.“That, to me, doesn’t define you as gay [people],” she continued during an interview on Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “The complexities of your relationships, and the commitment to your relationships, define you as a human being who happens to be in love with another man.”In 1995, when Wilson was cast as a series original on sketch comedy MADtv, she had no idea her performances would lead to a cult-like queer following. When she started to spoof legendary vocalist Whitney Houston, however, the actress noticed an increasing number of LGBT fans.“The ‘diva’ aspect seemed to really speak to people, especially young, gay men,” she told Podomatic’s No. 1 ranked LGBT podcast.Though the skits were well-received by audiences, the subjects of Wilson’s parodies sometimes did not appreciate the portrayals. Though noting Whitney “liked” her caricature – “She didn’t take herself too seriously,” the actress said, drawing incredulous gasps from both hosts – Oprah was less charitable.“She did not appreciate it,” Wilson told listeners, noting it did not prevent her from continuing. “It did not matter. As long as your audience agrees there is some semblance of a possibility [in a performance] they concur with, then I can do that.” (The comedian then launched into an extensive run-down of Oprah’s behaviors contributing to those still-relevant parodies. The result is an epic, must-listen read of the media magnate which gagged both hosts.)WATCH: Debra Wilson as Whitney Houston on MADtvSince leaving MADtv in 2003, Wilson has been incredibly busy, largely as a voiceover actress in both animated projects and popular video games. Most recently, she signed on for six episodes of the tello films web series My Sister Is So Gay.Written by and starring Terry Ray and Wendy Michaels, up-tight, homophobic Amanda (Michaels) crash lands in the home of her gay brother Seth (Ray) after finding her husband has cheated with her best gal-pal. Her misplaced distress about the break-up –- and increasing curiosity about Seth’s lesbian coworker (Wilson) – signal more to Amanda than possibly even she realizes. WKRP in Cincinnati icon Loni Anderson and Nashville actor Tilky Jones costar.According to Wilson, the role is special for many reasons. Not the least of which, she said, is how producers allowed her to fully, physically become the character — one of only a hand-full of roles to do so. Five years ago, she shaved off her well-known dreadlocks. Since that time, she has stretched her earlobes to an inch in diameter and undergone full-body tattooing.“They’ve wanted me to embody a character using my own body,” she pointed out. WATCH: The Trailer for My Sister Is So Gay Featuring Debra WilsonLending herself to the role physically is simple enough, but embodying the character emotionally is a different challenge. Though it is Wilson’s third time as an onscreen lesbian, the actress is quick to note she never approaches any role by focusing on its sexuality. In an effort to avoid a “stereotypical” performance, she looks first to the heart of the character.“If you stripped away who you slept with, you’d still be this human being who goes through the trials and tribulations, your joys, your sorrows, your celebrations and chooses how you experience and express your humanity,” she explained.“So if you’re playing that first, and the character happens to be gay based on the lines, then so be it,” Wilson said. “So I’ve never really played a ‘gay character.’ I’ve always played a person in the midst of a situation – who happens to be gay.”Taking that into account, Wilson says, allows a performance to convey a full range of human experiences. Whether those experiences are “complex,” “beautiful” or “sexual,” thinking of a character as “human” rather than a “gay person” staves off “cliché.” “More than anything else, I am talking about the complexities of having human relationships,” Wilson concluded, “The complexities of having love relationships, and that person happens to be of the same sex.”tello films is an emerging queer media portal featuring original, lesbian-focused content.

The newly installed president had barely taken his hand off the Bible but he began to implement his rally script by executive order.  The latest of these, halting the refugee resettlement program and screening out Muslims from future admissions, will result in innocent lost lives. Other stab-in-the-dark policies may turn out to be catastrophic for America, but tactically this is smart. It means that opposition groups are drowning each other out. Pipeline opponents, reproductive rights advocates, First Amendment defenders, science advocates, environmentalists, international relations experts, economists, and friends of refugees and immigrants are all trying to make themselves heard at the same time.Has there ever been a more important moment to come together? Five years ago in these pages I called for a Good Faith Alliance. In many ways we have done that, but as the last election showed, it is far from complete. Look at this list:  It's from the front page of the Democratic National Committee. It reaches out to African Americans, Americans with Disabilities, Latinos, Native Americans, LGBT ... all the way to ""young people and students,"" yet it implicitly excludes the white working class. That's a huge mistake. As Mark Lilla wrote in the New York Times, ""If you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them. If you don't, those left out will notice and feel excluded.""But it's not really a matter of writing a longer list. For resistance to succeed, we not only have to come together in a Good Faith Alliance, we have to be willing to focus on the most urgent causes for the greatest number of people, even if those don't happen to be closest to our hearts. I'm not saying we should throw refugees to the wolves -- no one care more about refugees than me. I'm saying we need to support one another's causes and join forces in the broadest possible front.Think about the enormous success of The Women's March. It was great to see a number of men taking part, but how many more might have come to a march for all? Now, there's talk of a scientists' march. And perhaps others as well. But if every interest group goes at this on its own, the most unpopular new president in modern history will have his way. Blitzkreig will be followed by Divide and Conquer. We can't let that happen. We cant wait for another Martin Neimoller to recognize that, truly, we are all in this together."

The only thing that separates successful people from the rest is how they respond after they fail.When facing obstacles, you have to decide if you're going to let them be the excuse for your failure or if you're going to make them the story behind your success. ""There is no failure. Only feedback."" -Robert Allen When you adopt the right attitude, failure is a great teacher. Failure interrupts your routine and gives you an opportunity to explore new solutions, but only if you have the right attitude.Psychologist Albert Bandura conducted a study that showed just how great a role our attitudes play in the face of failure. In the study, two groups of people were asked to complete an identical management task. The first group was told that the purpose of the task was to measure their management abilities. The other group was told that the skills required to complete the task were improvable and that the task was merely an opportunity to practice and improve. The trick was that the researchers made the task so difficult that all participants were bound to fail, and fail they did. The first group--feeling like failures because their skills weren't up to snuff--made little or no improvement when they were given opportunities to repeat the task. The second group, however, saw each failure as a learning opportunity, and they performed at progressively higher levels each time they attempted the task. The second group even rated themselves as more confident than the first group.Just like the participants in Bandura's study, we can either view our failures as reflections of our abilities or as opportunities for growth. The next time you catch yourself wallowing in the self-pity that often accompanies failure, focus on what you can control: your attitude. Some of the best lessons in life are also the toughest to accept and to adopt the right attitude toward. These are the lessons that challenge your flexibility and willingness to learn. When we don't embrace them soon enough, the lessons we learn turn out to be harsh ones. 1. The first step is always the hardest. When you want to achieve something important, that first step is inevitably going to be daunting, even frightening. When you dare to make that first move, anxiety and fear dissipate in the name of action. People that dive headfirst into taking that brutal first step aren't any stronger than the rest of us; they've simply learned that it yields great results. They know that the pain of getting started is inevitable and that procrastination only prolongs their suffering.   2. Good things take time. Success, above all, requires time and effort. Author Malcolm Gladwell suggested that mastery of anything requires 10,000 hours of tireless focus. Many successful people would agree. Consider Henry Ford, whose first two automobile businesses failed before he started Ford at the age of 45, or author Harry Bernstein, who dedicated his entire life to writing before he finally landed a best-seller at the age of 96. When you finally do succeed, you realize that the journey was the best part of it.  3. Being busy does not equal being productive. Look at everyone around you. They all seem so busy, running from meeting to meeting and firing off e-mails. Yet how many of them are really producing, really succeeding at a high level? Success doesn't come from movement and activity; it comes from focus--from ensuring that your time is used efficiently and productively. You get the same number of hours in the day as everyone else, so use yours wisely. After all, you're the product of your output not your effort. Make certain your efforts are dedicated to tasks that get results. 4. You will always have less control than you want. There are too many extenuating circumstances in life to control every outcome. You can, however, control how you react to things that are out of your control. Your reaction is what transforms a mistake into a learning experience and ensures that a victory doesn't send your ego through the roof. You can't win every battle, but with the right attitude, you can win the war.  5. You're only as good as those you associate with. You should strive to surround yourself with people who inspire you, people who make you want to be better. And you probably do. But what about the people who drag you down? Why do you allow them to be part of your life? Anyone who makes you feel worthless, anxious, or uninspired is wasting your time and, quite possibly, making you more like them. Life is too short to associate with people like this. Cut them loose.  6. Your biggest problems are mental. Almost all our problems occur because we time travel: we go to the past and regret things we've done, or we go to the future and feel anxious about events that haven't even happened. It's all too easy to slip into the past or jet into the future. When you do, you lose sight of the one thing that you can actually control--the present. 7. Your self-worth must come from within. When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself with others, you are no longer the master of your own destiny. When you feel good about something that you've done, don't allow anyone's opinions or accomplishments to take that away from you. While it's impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don't have to compare yourself with others and you can always take people's opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain--you're never as good or bad as they say you are.  8. Not everyone will support you. In fact, most people won't. Some people will inundate you with negativity, passive aggression, anger, or jealousy, but none of this matters, because, as Dr. Seuss said, ""Those that matter don't mind, and those that mind don't matter."" We can't possibly get support from everyone, and we definitely can't spend our time and energy trying to win over the people who don't support us. Letting go of the opinions of people who don't matter frees up time and energy for the people and things that do.9. Perfection doesn't exist. Don't seek perfection as your target. It doesn't exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you're always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently, instead of moving forward, excited about what you've achieved and what you'll accomplish in the future.  10. Fear is the number one source of regret. When all is said and done, you will lament the chances you didn't take far more than you will your failures. Don't be afraid to take risks. I often hear people say, ""What's the worst thing that can happen to you? Will it kill you?"" Yet, death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you--the worst thing that can happen to you is allowing yourself to die inside while you're still alive.  Bringing It All TogetherSuccessful people never stop learning. They learn from their mistakes and they learn from their triumphs, and they're always changing themselves for the better.What other harsh lessons have shaped who you are today? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."
59,HEALTHY LIVING,Expanding the Emergency Room Model: 'Central Care System' Could Help Americans Gain Universal Health Care Access,"Dr. Sudip Bose, Contributor★Emergency Physician ★Iraq War Veteran ★CNN Hero for treating ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/expanding-the-emergency-r_b_14444940.html,,2017-01-28,2017-01-27-1485559094-5151682-drsudipbosecriticalcarecenters.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2017-01-27-1485559094-5151682-drsudipbosecriticalcarecenters-thumb.jpg,"By Dr. Sudip Bose, MD -- There are many reasons why emergency rooms are dangerously overcrowded. With millions of Americans lacking adequate access to primary care providers, emergency rooms have become the primary health care system and safety net for the uninsured, underinsured and those without access to other medical care. Overcrowded and with overworked staffs, ERs are perilously close to collapse in many places. (See my other article on ERs here: Our Nation's Emergency Rooms). In fact, many already have closed their doors. There is an increased demand for emergency department care, as hospital emergency rooms have experienced a 32 percent increase in patient volume over the past decade.There are many reasons why we are seeing an influx in the volume of people seeking care in the ER. For starters, the fastest-growing age group in the United States is those over age 65, according to the 2010 US Census, and emergency room visits by the elderly are rising at an alarming rate. We also have a shortage of primary care physicians, and a growing percentage of health care practitioners that do not accept Medicare and Medicaid because of low reimbursement rates. Confounding those issues is the EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) of 1986, which requires emergency rooms to treat all comers, regardless of urgency or income. Two-thirds of emergency visits occur after business hours, when doctors' offices are closed. For people who find themselves in distress without access to care for these various reasons, the emergency room is often the only place to turn, and the double doors will always be open for them.Under the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare,"" with more people having coverage and wanting to see doctors, primary care physicians cannot keep up with the demand. Since patients were not able to get timely appointments to see their own physicians, they resorted to seeking care in emergency rooms. Waiting times already have caused dangerous lag times for the most critical patients to be seen because exam rooms in the ER are occupied with others who also need medical care. The narrow hallways of most perilously overcrowded emergency departments will struggle to create room between the man coughing up blood in the corner and the crying child with a broken arm.Ambulances carrying patients with life-threatening conditions are currently diverted from the nearest ER on average once every minute in the US because there are no exam rooms available where they can be treated. A critical patient may have to be rerouted several miles away to other ""emptier"" hospitals in order to be seen. Already we see patients losing consciousness from cardiac disease while in the ER waiting room, and some patients must suffer the humiliation of being evaluated in the hallway for conditions such as diarrhea. Simply put, space is limited and the system is stretched nearly beyond its limit. An incidence of a multi-car crash on the highway, a shooting at a mall or even the next flu epidemic can take an ER from being at maximum capacity to beyond the number of patients they are able to care for properly. The sad reality is that any of us could end up in an ambulance, only to learn the ambulance must continue on to another hospital because the nearest ER is already overflowing and cannot take on another major emergency. In critical situations every moment counts, so it is the patients - the people in need - who stand to lose most in this situation.Despite increasing demand for emergency care, there is a decreasing supply of emergency rooms. Over the past decade, financial burdens have caused hundreds of our ERs to close their sliding double doors for good, leaving people without options for emergency care. Increased financial burden on emergency rooms largely results from low reimbursement rates. Remember that per EMTALA regulations, emergency departments must treat anyone who walks through the door in need of care, many of whom cannot afford to pay a hospital bill. Even for those with insurance coverage, often there is a portion of the bill that is owed by the patient, and sometimes they must choose between paying the hospital and buying food for their families. In addition, Medicare pays a fraction of the amount billed for care, thus further reducing the costs that a hospital can recoup for care. The dollar amount billed by hospitals is largely facility fees, not charges billed to see emergency room doctors.• Emergency rooms are dangerously overcrowded • Counter-intuitively the problem may be the solution • Expanding the emergency room model and sending more patients to ERs may control costs and improve access • To do this we must allocate more of our health care dollars to the ER • Utilize the ""central care system"" to redirect patients appropriately to a primary physician, urgent care, or ERKnowing that information, why do doctors choose to specialize in emergency medicine? The average emergency physician statistically provide nearly $140,000 of uncompensated charity care annually. Based on those statistics, it is fair to say that doctors choose emergency medicine not for money, but to make a difference for people in need. These physicians are dedicated to caring for all people, regardless of income, and find their work very rewarding on a personal level.In comparison, if a gas station were mandated to provide gasoline for every car that drove through and a large portion of that gasoline was uncompensated, eventually the gas station would be forced to close. Emergency care is efficient, managing to treat more than 130 million of the sickest patients each year using less than two percent of the trillions of dollars spent on health care annually in the United States.,  It is unfortunate that less than two cents of every health care dollar goes to emergency care when the ER provides care for every person, at any time of day or night, and any one of us may be the next patient as we are all one heartbeat away from an emergency.Another reason for the decreased supply of available emergency care is that very good doctors leave clinical practice because of high liability in malpractice lawsuits. This has resulted in a shortage of critical ""on call"" specialists who curtail their services due to high liability and low reimbursements in emergency situations. So what is a tearful parent to do when her child urgently needs a neurosurgeon, orthopedic surgeon or other specialist, but those specialists are no longer available on call? Furthermore, the physicians who continue to treat patients in hospital emergency situations may try to defend themselves against malpractice lawsuits by ordering unnecessary tests or procedures -- x-rays and CT scans, for example -- but in doing so exposes the patient to potentially hazardous radiation. Medical liability reform should reduce this type of defensive medicine by doctors who fear lawsuits, thus decreasing cost and improving efficiency to both patients and providers. Many people have the misconception that doctors order additional tests because they receive more compensation, but in reality these practitioners fear malpractice lawsuits if the studies are not performed. Such reform is necessary to sustain any healthcare system in our country, not only to keep physicians in practice but to reduce costs of medical care.What is the anatomy of the solution?It may sound counter-intuitive, but sending more people to the emergency room is what I would propose. Instead of offering only emergency services, however, the ER needs to evolve to encompass mental health and primary care clinics to create a ""central care system,"" allowing more people to be seen. Emergency rooms already provide 24-hour care to people who need urgent medical attention, but also to those whose work schedules or other issues make it impossible to be seen during regular clinic hours. In the ER, the infrastructure already exists to see anyone with a common cold to mental health issues to heart attacks and strokes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; obtain labs, x-rays and the aforementioned CT scans (computed tomography scans -- CT or ""CAT"" scans). It is logical to use what already works.It is a dangerous fantasy to think that urgent care centers or mini-clinics can eliminate ER overcrowding. While urgent care facilities are staffed with competent medical providers and use the best technology for many injuries and illnesses, they lack the overall expertise and resources to handle true emergencies. The wrong patient visiting an urgent care center in order to save money or time could well cost a life. Urgent care centers are very much needed and should continue to be available, but are no substitute for emergency care.With today's 24-hour lifestyle we can buy groceries, fly across the world, Tweet a message to thousands of people, and even work out at the gym at any time, day or night. Medical care has to adapt to the fast-paced world in which we live. When a patient comes into the hospital central care system, they will initially present to a main check-in area where staff will determine how urgently he or she needs to be seen. A person experiencing a heart attack will be sent immediately to the emergency department, but a child with bronchitis will be directed to see another qualified practitioner quickly in the adjacent clinic or urgent care. By the same token, patients presenting with problems that do not need urgent treatment will be asked to schedule an appointment with a doctor at a local clinic within a couple of days.Every day we have lists of things to do for our families, jobs, recreation and other obligations. We prioritize our to-do lists constantly, taking care of the most urgent and important needs first. It may sound counter-intuitive, but sending more people to the emergency room is my proposed solution.In a medical setting the term for determining priority is ""triage"". The triage system is why you may wait in the ER waiting room for hours, as patients in need of emergency treatment must be seen first. With the central care system, there will be physician assistants and nurse practitioners who are available to treat less urgent issues and thereby reduce waiting times. In this way more people can be seen appropriately, without sacrificing quality or timeliness of care. Digital platforms like liveClinic.com can also be used to connect virtually to someone's own primary care doctor. Of course patients needing to see providers for less critical situations will still spend some time in the central care waiting room, just as they currently do in doctors' offices and urgent care clinics. Using that time to educate people will improve understanding about disease prevention, healthy living, vaccinations, home treatments for common illnesses like flu and colds, and other issues related to health. Introducing basic health education while people wait to see providers in the central care system may help them to avoid or more effectively manage chronic diseases and other common health issues. If we ""use the wait to educate,"" the information can be spread by word of mouth and it has the potential to benefit the entire community.Traditional primary care at outpatient clinics should continue to exist outside the hospital. A patient can schedule appointments with a primary care physician for regular check-ups or to manage any chronic health issues. But for acute illnesses or injuries, the central care system is available 24 hours a day to accommodate those needs. The central care system will also be able to schedule future appointments for patients to be seen by their regular doctors during normal clinic hours.In any business, tasks are usually delegated based upon experience and skill. The owner of a grocery store has a lot of responsibilities, but of course he has many employees who have various jobs in the store. If the owner were to spend part of his time stocking shelves or bagging groceries, work reserved for the owner would be neglected and fall behind. In the same manner, the central care system will be more efficient. Escaping the entrenched mentality of professional roles will be important for streamlining medical jobs, leading to better separation of cognitive and technical aspects of care. That means nurses should not do jobs that can be automated or delegated to technicians, and physicians should ask nurses to perform certain tasks so they are free to attend to other patients. Efficient use of all resources, both human and automated, is critical to maintaining productivity, suppressing costs and providing appropriate care.That means digital information as well. Efficient universal electronic medical record system that still incorporates patient confidentiality is critical. If someone is on a trip hundreds of miles away from home and is injured or becomes ill suddenly, and is unresponsive, when that person arrives at an emergency department, ER doctors would not have access to his medical history, medicines or other factors that may affect the way his emergency is treated. Without an adequate understanding of a patient's medical history, the wrong type of treatment or misdiagnosis could result. For example, the hospital staff does not know what medicines this person is on, and may prescribe another medicine in the ER that could cause dangerous interactions with the patient's current medications. Having a full and clear picture of someone's history is critical to ensuring appropriate treatment. That could be done digitally. Skyrocketing health care costs must also be addressed in the development of the central care concept. In order to tackle the issue of cost we must first recognize that the ""cost"" of care is not necessarily equal to the amount ""billed."" For example, although the cost of pressing the ""on"" button may be similar, patients and insurance companies are billed anywhere from under $500 to upwards of $10,000 for a CT scan. Although the effort of doing the scan is similar, the amount billed often varies wildly depending on the type of facility where the scan is performed (such as a hospital emergency room, a freestanding clinic, or an outpatient clinic). The amount billed also varies by whether or not the patient has insurance, the area or areas of the body being scanned, and whether or not contrast is used for the scan. Remember, too, that half of all ER bills are never paid, meaning they have to bill higher amounts to make up some of that money lost in order to keep the facility in operation. This discrepancy in the amount billed and the actual cost of performing that CT scan could be narrowed after the above changes make the entire system more efficient. No matter where or when the scan is performed, we must consider the fixed cost of purchasing and maintaining equipment, paying the technician performing the scan as well as the radiologist who evaluates the results, and cost of maintaining the facility. Still, the wide gap in the price of CT scans and other types of testing needs to be evaluated to achieve better balance in the cost of care across all boards.America's innovation has defined who we are as a nation; it has propelled us to the world's wealthiest population, and today it must be tapped to resolve the health care crisis that threatens Americans' personal and financial well being. As Obamacare is repealed and replaced and/or amended in some way, I would hope that the crafters of the legislation take into account the efficiencies listed above, added to the economies of scale that would be gained through consolidation. This will create a strong foundation that would be complemented by future universal health coverage for Americans. As we see health care reform evolve in America, the issues presented will need to be taken into account. Our nation must change to meet the demands of our health, and our demands must change to meet the needs of our health.For more about Dr. Sudip Bose, MD, please go to SudipBose.com and visit his nonprofit TheBattleContinues.org where 100% of donations go directly to injured veteransSOURCES1 - ""The Unisured: Access to Medical Care"" American College of Emergency Physicians.

Read Episode Thirty-Four: Finished!. Or, start at the beginning: An Illness's Introduction. Find all episodes here.After the thrill of seeing Hadley's murals on the walls of the Montana State Capital building, coming home to my novel that was growing roots in a file on my laptop was hard. The disappointment I felt in myself was directly proportional to the admiration I felt for Hadley. It was impossible not to compare our trajectories. Hadley, plagued as she'd been with serious health issues all her life, had turned out many notable projects in her 38 years, culminating in a historic, grand-scale commission. Here I was, on the verge of 60, and I hadn't managed to get Dream House, the project that most mattered to me, out into the world. I'd witnessed Hadley's deep satisfaction, unveiling the strongest and most celebrated work of her life. I wanted that!The week following my trip to Montana, I attended a rousing orchestral performance. I found myself imagining a violinist playing her instrument in her room for years on end with no clear prospect of ever being heard. An absurd notion, as music is meant to be listened to. We don't think of writing as a performing art. But like musicians, writers work assiduoaulsy to craft an affecting expression of their ideas and stories in order to touch an audience with their words. Writers, I glumly mused as the orchestra played on, can write for years without having their work read.Away doom and gloom! I couldn't let my discouragement quash my determination. I began making inquiries about self-publishing. I had no well-considered bias against this route to publication; I just didn't feel I had the stamina it takes to make it happen. No sooner had I begun my research, than an email popped up that made my heart gallop. Jay, my Dream House editor, had a colleague who was interested in publishing the book.It was tempting to get carried away by the excitement of this news. But I didn't share it even with my husband, Lewis, because the only thing worse than riding the rollercoaster of publication hopefulness that had begun four years earlier was taking those closest to me along for the ride. Two weeks after Hadley's mural unveiling, in a state of suspended belief, I drove downtown to meet with Lisa McGuinness, publisher at Yellow Pear Press. We hit it off and right then and there, nailed down details and deadlines to meet for publishing in the fall, November 2015. Within eight weeks of my meeting with Lisa, my novel had a cover and I was proofreading the galleys. Every week, I let the new reality sink in a little more, but I still felt unable to celebrate. In part, this was because publishing had been a dream for so long that it felt too good to be true. Also, with many hands involved in its production, I fretted about whether the physical book would have the qualities I hoped for. And then there was the obvious: apprehension about how the novel would be received.Another reason I felt excitement bubbling up only at discreet moments was not related to anxieties about my novel, but rather, what was happening in my day-to-day, i.e., life, which goes on despite the alternate realities our work sometimes constructs for us. Sylvia, after a short remission, was not winning her fight with cancer. The July ablation she'd had on the small lesion on her liver appeared to trigger an inflammatory response, resulting in a new proliferation of cancer cells. By February, she was housebound, except when she needed to see her doctor, and was spending much of her days sleeping. One Saturday evening in mid-March, the water heater on the second floor of her house began leaking through the floor. The plumber who came on Monday used a blowtorch too close to a fire sprinkler in the water heater closet, setting off a monsoon in the house. Sylvia's daughter, Meredith, home at the time, called 911 and me. Then, she led her bathrobed mother down into the street and helped her and their dog into their parked car. When I arrived, there was mayhem: two fire trucks, water everywhere, my stunned, sliver of a friend sitting in the car out front. I drove her to my house and set her up in bed.Sylvia, her husband Peter, Meredith, and their Golden Retriever stayed with us for a week while their house dried out. It was profoundly affecting to witness the tender, complicated care Peter and Meredith gave Sylvia, and to have one of my dearest friends under my roof at the end of her life. When she was sleeping, I tried to carry on with the daily tasks that were moving my book forward, but my awareness of Sylvia's ephemerality kept me in the present moment. I didn't want to miss something important. I savored the times she asked me to help shift her tiny frame in the bed, each brief conversation we shared. ""I don't want to keep going like this,"" she told me one day. We talked about what's within a patient's power when they are ready to stop suffering and say goodbye. What could be more important, and yet how many times in life do we get the chance to talk this way with someone we love? One morning when we were chatting, she looked deep in thought for a few moments and I braced myself for something difficult. Finally, she said, ""I probably won't be able to eat it, but just in case, can you save me some of the Bolognese sauce you made for dinner?"" She laughed. She was such a foodie. She'd been eating Gerber baby arrowroot biscuits, mashed potatoes and ground chicken for days; no wonder she craved some zest!That week, I barely thought about Parkinson's, which felt like a mere annoyance. But I thought a lot about what awaits me and everyone close to me at the end of our lives. During Sylvia's stay, I talked to Hadley and she recalled her last days with her stepfather, Charlie. Our conversation about dying was disorienting, as if I were looking through a camera lens at the four of us -- Hadley, Sylvia, Charlie, and myself -- trying to adjust the focal length to correspond with our (unspoken) perceptions of where we were on the timelines of our lives.In late March, I sat on Sylvia's bed in the bright California sunshine streaming through the windows. She was waifish, every bone explicit. Always meticulously groomed, she worried aloud about how long her fingernails had grown and I asked her if she'd like me to cut them. Sylvia was a private person, and I felt honored when she said yes. As I held each of her cool, delicate fingers in my hand and clipped, I took my time, relishing the intimacy of this simple task, taking it in as Sylvia's last gift to me. She died several days later with Peter and Meredith by her side.Winter and spring were a blur of proofreading the Dream House galleys -- every word and punctuation mark, six times (by the time the book went to print, I probably could've told you to pick a word, any word, and I would've been able to turn to the page where it was written)--and pulling together promotional material at the behest of the publicist. Among other things, this included setting up an author Facebook page and a website, which I was lucky enough to have our son, Tobias, design. I learned how to describe the book in as few, hopefully enticing, phrases as possible: ""An architect of houses searching for home,"" ""...how we shape and are shaped by our houses,"" ""What makes a house feel like home?"" As tedious as the production period was at times, after years of editing Dream House with nothing but hope and encouragement to keep me motivated, I gobbled up the tasks before me, knowing that there would be a monumental payoff. Finally, I was able to put to bed all my sad feelings that are best described by the old question, ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?""In July, Lisa met me for lunch to present my printed book. When she passed it across the table, I was unprepared for the emotional rush that sent me diving for my napkin to brush away tears. To me, the book was an exquisite object. The quiet but evocative jacket featuring an image of the Maine house where I was raised perfectly captures the tone and landscape of the novel; the size and weight of the book is modest but inviting. I hadn't dared to hope the physical embodiment of my story and the story itself, in which I explored everything that most moved me: space and architecture, love and motherhood, pain and healing, ocean, sky and trees, would be so well integrated, so...right.A week before the book's publishing date, in late October 2015, we threw a party. I dubbed it the ""If not now, when?"" party. I'd been casting about for an excuse to have a very big party for years and a book event seemed more fun than waiting for a milestone birthday, which, especially when you have a progressive, degenerative disease, is not necessarily a cause for celebration. The party was a blast. Local friends and my neurologist came. Friends from the other coast as well as our daughter Elena, my sisters, their husbands and some of their offspring flew in. Tobias's band played and I danced with the freewheeling women in my writing group. Lisa set up a bookselling table and friends generously stood in line to purchase books and have me sign them. While turning my Sharpie loose on book after book, it finally became real to me: my book!Did I have Parkinson's? Not that night! I spoke into a microphone for the first time in my life. I was nervous, since presenting to groups has never been easy for me, but being in that crowd of well-wishers was like soaking in a warm bath.  From November through April, I talked about Dream House in the west and in New England at bookstores, private parties, newspaper and radio interviews, seven book groups and an architecture school. Awesome family and friends from around the country facilitated opportunities for me to speak and sell books. Mindful of my energy's ebb and flow, I only scheduled events where I knew people who would fill the chairs.   I never stopped feeling nervous when approaching the podium, afraid I'd go blank in the middle of a thought. I did a couple of times, but managed to recover well enough. After describing the inspirations for the novel, I would read a couple of passages and feel my anxiety drop away. Speaking the words I'd written, I re-experienced the passion I'd felt when I started the book years ago. It was powerful to feel I was engaging my listeners' emotions and imagination, not by selling plot or drama but simply through my choice and arrangement of words.Finally, I was out of my room, playing my music. People were listening.  I didn't push much beyond my limitations to publicize Dream House, so the post-publication experience was entirely positive. Even at the event in my hometown, 3000 miles away, where I feared God-knows-who would surface to scold me with a wagging finger for airing my family's troubles, people were warm, inquisitive and even a little proud of their homie author. In addition to old family friends I hadn't seen in decades, two of my first childhood girlfriends were in that room, as well as my first love; their presence added a distracting tenderness to the occasion. Everywhere I went, I filled with gratitude for people's inquisitiveness, enthusiasm, and their persistent pursuit of literature.That Lewis was the best roadie ever made all the difference. It was as if he'd read a manual on how to support your Parkie wife while she's on a book tour. He hefted my carryon into the overhead bin. Took my hand in the airport when he saw my leg dragging. Schlepped boxes of books and ran peoples' credit cards at private events. While at our Airbnb, he dashed to the market for groceries, made me coffee every morning and, in the evenings before my book talks, a mini margarita to boost my confidence. (Trust me; it works.) Each day, he rode a bike for an hour and a half but insisted he wasn't too tired to go back out and take a three mile walk with me, because he knows that exercise is what keeps my body from shutting down altogether. He was excited to greet the wonderful old friends who came out of the woodwork. Throughout the ""season of Dream House,"" Lewis expressed no complaints. He had lost his partner in architecture years before, but was now proud to crow about her book to anyone who'd listen. He was thrilled for me, but also, like many partners of those with debilitating conditions, he understands the importance of turning up the light on life's joyful passages and significant accomplishments.So, how did it feel to finally be published at 60? Besides joy, another feeling: relief when I finished my book tour. Taking stock of my Parkinson's progression, I had a sense that publication came not a moment -- or at least year -- too soon. Also a relief was to be done with the story that had been parked in my brain like a giant RV full of claustrophobic family members, and to clear out my cabinet filled with paper drafts, some dating back to the late 20th century. I could move on.Parkinson's added to my life a new community of friends like Hadley with whom I can share the experience of our disease. The release of Dream House provided another avenue for making meaningful connections. Friends and total strangers have written to me about why they resonated with the novel; the territories that I'd burned to explore ignited in them vivid memories and powerful emotions. I've felt honored and delighted that they've shared, sometimes in intimate detail, tales of their complicated relationships with a house, with a parent, or their children. This -- touching the hearts and minds of my readers and in return, being moved by their stories -- was the least expected but greatest reward of realizing my long-time dream.

Since 2000, the Jane Goodall Institute, a conservation nonprofit that’s worked extensively in Gombe, specifically with the park’s endangered chimpanzees, has been using NASA’s and the U.S. Geological Survey’s Landsat satellite images to inform their chimp conservation strategies and boost their efforts to improve the living standards of local communities.“Unlike maps, which don’t show the chimpanzees’ habitat side-by-side with human activities, Landsat imagery shows both scientists and the villagers the direct result of various land uses ― farming and logging for example ― and how they shaped the surrounding terrain and forests,” NASA wrote in a news release this week.The images have allowed conservationists to pinpoint where chimps are most at risk in the park and to design the best strategies to protect them. “NASA satellite data helps us understand what it means to be a chimp by overlaying distribution of the habitat with the chimpanzee behavior and ranging data,” Lilian Pintea, vice president of conservation science at the Jane Goodall institute, said in a statement.The images have also helped villagers in the region to implement better land use strategies. Deforestation, caused by unchecked agriculture, local logging and charcoal production, has for decades posed a major threat to both chimps and people living in and around Gombe. The apes have lost critical feeding and nesting grounds, while people have suffered the degradation of valuable forest resources like honey and important tree species. Local water cycles have also been altered, triggering widespread erosion and flash flooding. Conservationist Jane Goodall, founder of the institute that bears her name, recalled seeing the “bare” hills of Gombe when she flew over the park in 1990. “We flew over ... and it was absolutely horrifying to me to see that,” she said during a 2011 talk. “Yes, I knew there was deforestation outside the park but I had not realized it was total deforestation.” Local communities, she said, were hard-hit by the forest’s destruction. “People were clearly struggling to survive,” Goodall said in the NASA video published this week. She and her colleagues needed a way to engage with villagers ― to help them understand the extent of the deforestation crisis and empower them to make better land use choices that would not just be beneficial to their communities but to chimps and other wildlife too. “Gombe has taught us that long-term conservation is not possible without engaging local populations as partners and addressing their basic needs,” the Jane Goodall Institute writes on its website. “At the same time, Gombe has also shown us that the long-term prosperity of people depends upon protection of natural resources.”The satellite images, Pintea said, were the perfect tool to educate and inspire.“[The villagers would] tell stories about how the hills were covered in forest,” he said in the clip. “But then when you show them a picture, it’s very shocking to everybody, realizing what has been lost.”The images motivated villagers to form partnerships with the Jane Goodall Institute to help protect valuable forest reserves and to find better ways to sustainably manage their land. This technology, NASA said, has been a “game changer for improving local conservation efforts.”Today, the forests of Gombe are steadily recovering. Satellite images captured between 2005 and 2014 show the hills of the park growing greener by the year. (Animation credit: DigitalGlobe/the Jane Goodall Institute)Pintea said scientists have been using Landsat satellite images to help monitor and study chimps across their entire range, not just those in Gombe.About one million chimpanzees roamed the Earth at the start of the 20th century, according to the Jane Goodall Institute. Today, that number has plummeted ― mostly due to habitat loss ― to under 300,000. “Current trends indicate that African ape populations will decline by an additional 80 percent in the next 30-40 years,” the institute writes on its website. “We have a generation and a half ― possibly two ― to alter the trend.” Correction: The photos at the top of this post show areas outside Tanzania’s Gombe National Park. A previous version of this article said the images were of the park itself. "

The wall was erected in 1961 to prevent a massive emigration from East Germany to West Germany. It is now referred to as the “Wall of Shame.”In 1963, then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy proclaimed “Ich bin ein Berliner” (I am a Berliner) during a famous speech in which he stressed American solidarity with West Germany after the wall was erected.As Müller points out in his memo, America supported Berlin during the Cold War, and U.S. President Ronald Regan called for the Berlin Wall to be torn down in 1987.“We cannot let all our historical experience get trashed by the very people to whom we owe much of our freedom: the Americans,” Müller said, warning Trump not to go down a road of “isolation and ostracism.” Trump’s internationally condemned border wall proposal is aimed at curbing illegal immigration from Mexico.“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said during a speech upon announcing his candidacy in June 2015. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us (sic). They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to build the wall. Throughout his election campaign, he repeatedly said that Mexico would pay the billions of dollars needed for construction.Mexican officials, including former President Vicente Fox, have repeatedly refused to pay for a wall they have no interest in building.“Mexico does not believe in walls. I’ve said time and again; Mexico will not pay for any wall,” Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto said in a Spanish video statement posted online. His refusal triggered familiar retaliation from Trump in a dispute that has largely played out over Twitter.On Thursday, Peña Nieto canceled a meeting with Trump that was set to be held the following week as tensions between the two leaders increased. In turn, Trump’s administration has proposed a 20 percent tax on Mexican goods imported to America.This type of hostility only cripples both parties, Müller warned.“Wherever such divides exist, like in Korea and Cyprus, they cause slavery and pain,” he said. “Our division destroyed the prospect of millions.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/schumer-tillerson_us_588b7f51e4b08a14f7e5872b,The Senate minority leader slammed the former Exxon Mobil chief's Russia ties the same day Donald Trump plans to talk to Vladimir Putin about sanctions.,2017-01-27,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says in a statement, ""I will oppose his nomination, and I encourage the full Senate to do the same.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588b8ae017000030001d0c8b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that he plans to vote against former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. “I will oppose his nomination, and I encourage the full Senate to do the same,” Schumer said in a statement released shortly before President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin about sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. “Mr. Tillerson’s refusal to back new sanctions on Russia, and his refusal to even pledge to fully defend the current sanctions regime is unacceptable but not surprising given his closeness to Vladimir Putin and the depth of Exxon’s investment in Russia,” the Senate minority leader said.Schumer said the oil magnate’s record on climate change and his refusal to break with Trump on a possible registry of Muslims would inflame already tense relationships with other countries. “Just one week into his administration, President Trump is turning our foreign policy into shambles,” Schumer said. “His nominee for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, a man who will not lift a finger to fight climate change and will not rule out a Muslim registry, would make it even worse.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) went even further Friday, calling Tillerson’s nomination “one of the worst choices Trump has made.” Under Tillerson, Exxon Mobil shifted its public messaging to acknowledge that the climate is changing, but continued to fund groups that undermine the overwhelming scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the chief cause. Tillerson publicly backed a national tax on carbon as early as 2007. Yet the company lobbied against two bills that would have established carbon taxes in Massachusetts as recently as last year, when Tillerson was still chief executive.During his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Tillerson brazenly refused to answer questions about how much Exxon Mobil knew about climate change decades ago. Trump ― who has called global warming “a hoax” and stacked his Cabinet with fossil fuel allies ― has already erased climate change from the White House website, signed executive orders to build controversial oil pipelines and made moves to muzzle and gut the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump plans to impose dramatic restrictions on immigration and refugee admission and temporarily reject travelers from from seven Muslim-majority countries, according to a draft version of a White House executive order. Tillerson said at his hearing that he doesn’t support a blanket ban on Muslims entering the U.S., but dodged questions about a registry, a proposal that critics say echoes early Nazi Germany policies on Jews. Friday, coincidentally, marks Holocaust Remembrance Day. Schumer’s vote is unlikely to derail Tillerson’s confirmation. He narrowly won approval from the Senate committee that hosted his hearing when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) voted for him, despite having grilled him aggressively at the hearing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) moved on Tuesday to set a procedural vote to confirm Tillerson in the full Senate by the end of next week. But Schumer is under intense pressure to beef up his resistance to the Trump administration. Progressive protesters have gathered outside his offices in Washington and New York in recent weeks, demanding he muster something that resembles to the scorched-earth opposition Republicans led to obstruct former President Barack Obama.Schumer, however, has so far cast his ballot to approve all three Trump nominees that have come up for a vote."

The Destiny’s Child star, 35, plays a woman who opts for a life of celibacy in her new Lifetime movie, “Love By the 10th Date,” which airs Saturday. In a Tuesday interview with The New York Post, Rowland shared her thoughts on a range of intimate topics, including bisexuality and open marriages. Couples, Rowland said, would be wise to have open discussions about their same-sex experiences before getting romantically involved. “There are some women who are not finding the real truth about their partner’s sexuality until they go through their man’s phones,” she said. “But it happens with guys, too, not just women. I can’t tell someone how to feel about dating someone who is bisexual or had a past gay experience, but it’s proper to ask in today’s times.” When it comes to open relationships, Rowland admitted to being less personally knowledgable, but noted that she’s “not in any position to judge anybody.” “None of my girlfriends that I know of have open relationships,” she said. Pointing to Mo’Nique, who is in an open marriage with husband Sidney Hicks, she added, “We’re in a new time and space where sexuality should be talked about — whether you want to be with two people or three.”The star previously spoke out on behalf of her LGBTQ fanbase in a 2013 Access Hollywood interview, while performing at the GLAAD Media Awards. “They’ve always been wonderful, always been supportive, and always been loyal,” she said. “I think that’s what feels so great, is that you always feel loved and you always get that love back.”Read the full New York Post interview with Kelly Rowland here.

In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good.”The juxtaposition casts light on a long history of American skepticism toward people seeking refuge in their country.Surveys taken last year found that most Americans oppose temporarily barring Muslims from other countries, but that there’s also little enthusiasm for helping Syrian refugees. Last fall, a majority of Americans told Pew Research that the U.S. doesn’t have a responsibility to accept Syrian refugees, and 50 percent of voters in a Quinnipiac poll they’d favor “suspending immigration from ‘terror prone’ regions, even if it means turning away refugees from those regions.” In the years leading up to World War II, many Americans were also suspicious of Jews fleeing the Nazis. In 1938, 65 percent of Americans told Gallup that the persecution of Jews in Europe was at least partially their own fault, and nearly three-quarters opposed allowing “a larger number of Jewish exiles from Germany to come to the United States to live.” In theory, the public supports helping those in need. When asked in 2011 whether the inscription on the Statue of Liberty — “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free” — should still apply to immigration policy, 62 percent of Americans said it should. In the face of a specific crisis, their views often turn less welcoming.“Americans have a general reluctance to accept refugees into the U.S., even in response to situations that are clearly oppressive,” Frank Newport, the editor-in-chief of Gallup, wrote in 2015. He noted that the firm had found majority support for allowing in refugees only once, in response to a 1999 question about bringing several hundred Albanian refugees from Kosovo.Polls from Gallup and other organizations taken since the 1930s show that mistrust of the people fleeing international conflicts is, by now, a well-worn part of U.S. history.All charts are courtesy of the Roper Center at Cornell University:Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

During his first successful run for Congress in 2000, his campaign website boasted that he would direct funding away from HIV/AIDS treatment and funnel resources into “conversion therapy.” As a U.S. representative for Indiana, he said in a 2006 speech that same-sex marriage would lead to “societal collapse.”It’s unclear where the president himself stands on marriage equality, because he has made competing statements on the issue. He said in February that he’d consider appointing Supreme Court justices who would overturn same-sex marriage legislation, but in November he called the issue “settled.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer raised eyebrows ― and worries ― on Monday when he could not definitively assure LGBTQ Americans that protections put in place for queer federal workers would remain under the Trump administration. What’s more, the president’s prospective Cabinet is incredibly troubling to the community, with many of his appointees boasting anti-queer records.Ben Carson, who the Senate has confirmed to be secretary of housing and urban development, once compared homosexuality to pedophilia and incest.Some transgender people and allies are also concerned that Betsy DeVos, if confirmed as education secretary, could endanger the rights of trans students ― specifically, by rolling back a directive under the Obama administration that called upon public schools to guarantee students access to facilities that best matched their gender identity. The DeVos family has donated millions of dollars to anti-LGBTQ organizations, including the National Organization for Marriage, Institute for Marriage and Public Policy and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.LGBTQ-related pages on the White House and State Department websites have been removed during Trump’s first week in office.The Capital Pride Alliance, which organizes a massive LGBT pride weekend in Washington, D.C., every year, is partnering with Bruinooge to help plan the march.The group expects the march to be a part of its celebration, which is scheduled for June 8 to 11 this year. Bruinooge said he hopes to announce a date of the march within the next week. “We are working with individuals who would like to organize a march to ensure that it would complement an already powerful and impactful weekend,” said Ryan Bos, the executive director of the Capital Pride Alliance. “Our hope is that we can galvanize this energy and this desire to take action and really channel that into our communities across the country and world.”Bruinooge emphasized the group’s commitment to inclusivity and diversity within the march and on the steering committee, which they are currently working to develop.“We think it’s very important that we have a united front and that all our voices are heard,” Bruinooge said. “We encourage friends, family and allies of all religions, all races and all identities to participate.”Organizers are encouraging supporters to plan sister marches for people who can’t travel to D.C., but stressed the importance of coordinating with local LGBTQ organizations to avoid undermining existing plans for other pride events."
74,POLITICS,"State GOP Lawmakers Push Bills Targeting Protests, Fueling Free Speech Fears",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-protest-bills_us_588bacb8e4b0b065cbbbdce4,Republicans are pushing back on demonstrations amid rising tensions in the era of President Donald Trump.,2017-01-27,Supporters of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and thousands of demonstrators attend a protest against DAPL.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588bad3a1b0000250004ce02.jpeg?cache=Mwc41rh38n&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Timothy MclaughlinRepublican lawmakers in several central U.S. states are pushing bills that would crack down on demonstrations, drawing criticism from free speech campaigners and underlining the polarization over protests in the era of President Donald Trump.Bills have been introduced over the past month in states including North Dakota, Indiana and Iowa that would impose measures such as harsher penalties for demonstrators who disrupt traffic, and scrapping punishment for drivers who unintentionally strike protesters blocking their vehicles.The push for stricter laws comes as opponents of Trump have vowed to take to the streets to demonstrate against his policies on issues ranging from immigration to abortion and climate change. Hundreds of thousands of people took part in women’s marches on Jan. 21 in cities across the country.While the fate of the bills was not immediately clear, supporters say they sum up the frustration some people feel about protests that get in the way of their daily lives.“People are just kind of sick and tired of this garbage,” Nick Zerwas, a Republican state representative in Minnesota, said by telephone. “If you block a freeway, you ought to go to jail and when you get out, you ought to get the bill.”Zerwas has introduced two bills, one of which would increase the penalty for obstructing traffic to a gross misdemeanor, meaning offenders could face up to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine. The other would make protesters pay policing costs if their protests were deemed illegal or a nuisance by a court.In Iowa, Republican state senator Jake Chapman is the lead sponsor of a bill that would make it a felony to block traffic on roads with speed limits of 55 miles-per-hour (88 km) or more. Offenders would face up to five years in jail and a $7,500 fine.“People are really fed up with it,” Chapman said of the disruption caused by demonstrations.He said his constituents were not against the protests as such, but that they did not want their travel affected. He said demonstrations should be held in “appropriate” places.‘TRULY ALARMING’Free speech advocates said the proposals are worrying.“What’s happening is a truly alarming spread of state legislation that, if passed, will have the intent or impact of criminalizing peaceful protests,” said Lee Rowland, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union rights group.The bills were “unconstitutional right out of the gate,” Rowland said, adding that protests should be seen as a “success of representative democracy,” not a problem to be solved.Gregory Magarian, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, said the bills present a “major First Amendment problem,” referring to the section of the U.S. Constitution that guarantees the right to free expression.“They (the lawmakers) are putting their petty ideologies over the principles of free speech,” Magarian said.Defenders of the proposals, however, argue that they were formulated out of concern for public safety above all.One bill by Indiana Republican state senator Jim Tomes calls for police “to use any means necessary” to clear roads of people unlawfully blocking traffic no more than 15 minutes after law enforcement learns of the obstruction.In an emailed statement, Tomes said he had no problem with protesters who apply for permits in advance.In North Dakota, where hundreds have been arrested during protests against a pipeline, a bill by Republican state Rep. Keith Kempenich would shield motorists from liability if they unintentionally hit a protester on a roadway, injuring or killing them.Kempenich did not respond to requests for comment, but has said he introduced the bill after his mother-in-law was caught in a protest while driving.“It’s shifting the burden of proof from the motor vehicle driver to the pedestrian,” he told the Bismarck Tribune.(Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Bernadette Baum)"

New polls disagree over how Donald Trump’s first week in office was received. And the public shares what they want to see Trump prioritize as president. This is HuffPollster for Friday, January 27, 2017.CLINTON AND TRUMP VOTERS DIFFER OVER WHOM GOVERNMENT SHOULD HELP - HuffPollster: ""Voters who supported President Donald Trump in last year’s election have a lot of differences from those who supported Hillary Clinton ― including a fundamental, underlying divide over whom the government is designed to serve, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. Clinton voters say, 80 percent to 14 percent, that the government 'should try to help everyone in the U.S.' Trump voters say, 51 percent to 33 percent, that it 'should only try to help the people who deserve it.'...Clinton voters are equally unlikely to say there’s excessive help being provided either to people like them or to most Americans in general. Just 5 percent say the government does too much for either group. However, while just 29 percent of Trump voters say the government does too much for people like them, a 59 percent majority say the government does too much for most Americans."" [HuffPost] FIRST ROUND OF APPROVAL POLLS SHOW VARIED RESULTS FOR DONALD TRUMP - Steven Shepard: ""Thirty-six percent of voters approve of the way President Donald Trump is handling his job in his first week, according to a new poll that reflects a sharp divide along partisan lines. The Quinnipiac University poll, conducted over the first five nights of Trump’s presidency — last Friday through Wednesday — shows that a larger percentage, 44 percent, disapprove of Trump’s job performance….Trump’s approval rating in the Quinnipiac poll is lower than in some other surveys conducted in the early days of his administration. The latest Gallup tracking poll, conducted Monday through Wednesday, shows the percentage of all adults who approve of Trump (46 percent) is essentially equal to the percentage who disapprove (45 percent). That resembles a new automated-phone poll from the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling. And a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted last Friday through Sunday gave Trump a higher approval rating (46 percent) than disapproval rating (37 percent) among registered voters."" [Politico, Quinnipiac]Average approval in the mid-40s - Although approval ratings from Donald Trump range from 36 percent in Quinnipiac's survey to 59 percent in Rasmussen's automated-and-online tracking poll, most other surveys put Trump's initial numbers between 41 and 46 percent, with his disapproval generally hovering in the same range. Notably, surveys that tested both Trump's approval rating as president and his personal favorability consistently gave him lower numbers for the latter. HuffPost Pollster's aggregate for Trump's presidential approval -- which, with little data, remains prone to fluctuations -- gives him a 46 percent approval rating with 42 percent disapproving; his average favorability stands at about 42 percent, with nearly half viewing him unfavorably. [Approval chart, favorability chart]LAST WEEK'S INAUGURATION GETS POSITIVE MARKS FROM WATCHERS - HuffPollster: ""Most Americans who tuned into President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Friday give him positive marks for his address, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, although doubts and deep partisan divides remain. Fifty-five percent of Americans who watched or listened to the inauguration ceremonies, or who consumed later news reports about it, say Trump’s speech was excellent or good. Fourteen percent say it was just OK, and 26 percent say it was poor or terrible. (Gallup, which asked the same question in a one-night survey following the speech, found that 53 percent rated it excellent or good, 22 percent OK and 20 percent poor or terrible. Those results are significantly less positive than reactions to former President Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009, but on par with Americans’ feelings about the 2005 and 2013 inaugurations.)"" [HuffPost] Trump's protectionist pledge resonates - Cameron Easley: ""Trump told the country, 'From this moment on, it’s going to be America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.' Sixty-five percent of poll respondents viewed that message positively, including 64 percent of independents and half of Democrats. About 6 in 10 voters, including 48 percent of Democrats, also said the federal government should be required to follow Trump’s mantra: “Buy American and hire American.'” [Morning Consult] But most Americans don't buy the claim that the event drew record crowds - HuffPollster: ""President Donald Trump and his press secretary have repeatedly ― and falsely ― claimed that Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 was the best attended in history. But Americans don’t believe them. Just 7 percent of Americans think that Trump’s big day was better attended than Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. Fifty-six percent of Americans — including 41 percent of Trump voters — say correctly that more people came out for Obama’s inauguration. Nine percent think the two events were equally well-attended, and 28 percent say they aren’t sure….The White House had reason to believe that by turning an objective analysis into a partisan debate, they’d keep sympathetic members of the public on their side….Trump’s supporters, for example, are inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt in unclear situations. They give him the credit for shutting down a Republican effort to gut a congressional ethics watchdog. They’re more willing to accept liberal ideas when he proposes them or to edge away from conspiracy theories once he’s walked them back….There’s a clear partisan tint to the responses in the HuffPost/YouGov poll, with Hillary Clinton voters far more likely than Trump voters to affirmatively state that Obama’s 2009 inauguration was better attended. But even most Trump voters aren’t willing to take Spicer’s claims at face value."" [HuffPost] Other surveys also tested beliefs about crowd size:-Brian Schaffner and Samantha Luks: ""On Sunday and Monday, we surveyed 1,388 American adults. We showed half of them a crowd picture from each inauguration and asked which was from Trump’s inauguration and which was from Obama’s….For the other half, we asked a very simple question with one clearly correct answer: 'Which photo has more people?'"" [WashPost] -Meghan McCarthy: ""When it comes to whether voters think President Donald Trump’s inauguration or the Women’s March on Washington was more widely attended, political affiliations seem to drive perception."" [Morning Consult] HERE'S WHAT TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS WANT TO SEE FROM HIM AS PRESIDENT - HuffPollster: ""A new poll from Pew Research shows the public’s top policy priorities include terrorism, the economy and education. These priorities have differed slightly in the last few years, with protecting the environment gaining the most support since 2009 and people steeply dropping off in concern about improving the job situation….Of course, there are quite a few partisan divides. Republicans’ top three priorities are terrorism, the economy and jobs. Democrats’ top priorities are terrorism, education and the environment. While Democrats are generally more worried about climate change, the environment, and the poor and needy than their Republican counterparts, Republicans showed greater concern about the military and immigration than Democrats did."" [HuffPost] MOST MEXICANS HAVE A POOR IMPRESSION OF TRUMP  - Natalie Jackson: ""Eighty-nine percent of Mexicans have a 'bad' or 'very bad' impression of President Donald Trump, according to a mid-January poll from BGC-Excelsior. Only 3 percent said they have a 'good' or 'very good' impression of the new U.S. president….Global polling from Ipsos confirms the findings of the BGC-Excelsior poll. Eighty-one percent of Mexicans think Trump will be a bad president in that survey, the second-highest of the 24 countries polled.""

76,POLITICS,Women At March For Life Are Deeply Conflicted About Donald Trump,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/march-for-life-women-trump_us_588b94ece4b0b065cbbbc044,"""I almost didn't want to come,"" one said.",2017-01-27,"Miranda Malone, 21, holds a poster during Friday's anti-abortion rally in Washington.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588bb7b417000030001d0d24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Abortion opponents descended on the National Mall Friday for the annual “March for Life,” with many women saying they struggled to reconcile their strong views on abortion with their distaste for President Donald Trump. The crowd at the anti-abortion rally was far smaller than last weekend’s Women’s March on Washington, which may have been the largest protest in American history.“I almost didn’t want to come, because I knew I would be continuing to group myself with some people that I’m not proud to be grouped with,” said Miranda Malone, a 21-year old senior at University of Dayton in Ohio. “I don’t like the way he acts,” Mary Ryback, 52, of Milwaukee, said of Trump. “I do like that he is a pro-life president, and I did vote for him because of life, but it was very difficult.” For many women at the march, the issue of “life” is not just about abortion. Malone held a sign that said “Protect ALL Life,” including immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, refugees, the poor and unemployed, Latinos, the environment, and “the unborn.” A self-described “pro-life Democrat,” she voted for Hillary Clinton and traveled to the March for Life to ensure people like her have a voice in the anti-abortion movement, too. “I think that if were talking about eliminating abortion and protecting life, we need to provide more resources, like education and contraceptives for women,” Malone said. “I feel that a lot of people in this movement focus on shaming women for decisions they make, and I don’t agree with that way of thinking.” Maddy Buschur, a young Republican who attends Ohio State University, described herself as a “pro-life feminist” and “reluctant” Trump voter. She opposes some of his cabinet selections and was offended by many of comments he’s made about women, including his recorded boast that he can “grab them by the pussy” because he’s a celebrity.“It breaks my heart that that’s the point we’re at in society, that this is our leader, and that people are finding ways to defend his comments,” Buscher said. “I wasn’t sure if I should vote or not on the president, because I wasn’t sure I believe in the whole concept of ‘vote for the lesser of two evils.’ But at the end of the day, I think Hillary would have done more damage to women as feminists.” Buscher said she believes abortion rights are counterproductive to women’s equality. “It’s completely illogical to tell a woman that in order to succeed in our society, she needs to become more like a man by taking away her pregnancy,” she said. Trump has had mixed views on abortion over the years. He once described himself as “very pro-choice” and enthusiastically praised Planned Parenthood. Then, facing a backlash from conservatives on the campaign trail, he overcorrected by saying women should “face some sort of punishment” for having abortions ― a comment that made even anti-abortion groups cringe.In the weeks leading up to his election, Trump went out of his way to appease social conservatives on the issue, notably choosing anti-abortion warrior Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence led the fight against reproductive rights in Congress, and as governor of Indiana, throughout Barack Obama’s presidency.One of Trump’s first moves as president was to reinstate the so-called global gag rule implemented by President Ronald Reagan, which bans recipients of U.S. foreign aid money from referring patients to abortion providers or giving women information about abortions. Anti-abortion activists on Friday still seemed skeptical of Trump’s sincerity.“Do I trust him?” asked Ryback. “I trust in God, and I pray that God will use [Trump] and our representatives to make abortion illegal.” “I was a big fan of the [global gag rule], because I don’t think that’s where our funding should be going,” said Buschur. “As for the rest, I’ve just been holding my breath to see where it goes.”Other attendees were more vehemently opposed to the president. One woman from Fargo, North Dakota, stood on a bench on the National Mall holding a banner that said, “Pro-Life/Pro-Environment.” She said she cannot accept Trump’s policies on climate change or his approval of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline threatening Native American lands. She said the president cannot be “pro-life” without also protecting the earth. “I’m horrified and frightened and terrified,” she said of Trump. “He needs to be impeached immediately.”"

It was Roe v. Wade. Most Americans alre aware of the Supreme Court’s 1973 verdict in the watershed case, but fewer know the women who got us there. Lisa Loomer’s play “Roe,” running now at Washington, D.C.’s Arena Stage, tells the story of the case that established a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion through the lens of two people: the young and ambitious lawyer Weddington and the case’s plaintiff Norma McCorvey, a 20-something bartender and lesbian who, in court, was known by the legal pseudonym “Jane Roe.” In 2013, Loomer was approached by a friend about the possibility of writing a play about the case as part of a cycle of performances called “American Revolutions,” each recreating a moment of change in American history, commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Given Loomer’s previous work with narratives centered around women’s struggles, Roe v. Wade was of obvious interest. “I was interested in the case, yes, but I was also interested in why this case is still being argued 44 years later,” Loomer explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I wanted to understand why we, as Americans, cannot even talk to each other about this issue. In other words, I was interested in the divide in this country, and I thought that by looking at the divide over Roe, I might begin to look at the larger cultural divide, as well. Which is, ironically, what we are looking at right now, post-election.”After an initial run in Oregon, the play premiered in D.C., just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Before the election, Loomer imagined the production existing in a different context. “We imagined it happening during the inauguration of our first woman president,” she said.“We thought it would be a cautionary tale, as history should be, but also a celebration of how far women’s rights and human rights have come,” she added. “Clearly, we were surprised. The play is happening now in a totally different political climate.” The unexpected turn of events made “Roe” and its implications even more urgent, as Roe v. Wade’s ruling is now under unprecedented threat. One of Trump’s first actions as president was reinstating Ronald Reagan’s abortion “global gag rule,” which bans health organizations around the world receiving U.S. funding from mentioning abortion as a family planning option. And last week, Trump met with Judge William Pryor as a potential Supreme Court Justice, a man who called Roe v. Wade the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.” In writing “Roe,” however, Loomer’s mission was never to convince her audience of the importance of abortion to women’s liberation. Rather, she wanted to tell the complex story of the iconic court case with tolerance and compassion, giving voice and credence to both parties. “I did not want it to be a polemic,” Loomer said. “I did not want to further the divide. I feel that theater is a place where people — all kinds of people — can come together in the dark to look at an issue from a human point of view. Theater is a place to feel. To laugh, cry, be surprised, and to live in another’s shoes for a while.” Loomer tells her story through two protagonists: Weddington and McCorvey. At first, the women worked together on the case as allies. Yet, after the verdict, McCorvey became a born-again Christian and an anti-abortion activist. Weddington continued to champion women’s right to choose.“Their divergent journeys,” Loomer said, are representative of a broader picture. “Once I saw that odd turn of events, I thought it was a chance to tell the story of the cultural divide and look at why we can’t talk to each other as Americans.”In “Roe,” Loomer depicts the complex web of biases, fears and personal motivations that all humans grapple with regardless of their political affiliations. She also seamlessly highlights the effects that race, class and sexual orientation have on one’s opportunities and worldview. As a result, no minister, activist or millennial is stereotyped. There are no clear heroes or villains, just people ― messy, dedicated, and trying to do what’s right.During the play’s Washington run, Loomer speculates that most, but not all, of her audience leans liberal. Yet she’s received feedback from viewers on both sides of the political spectrum who appreciated seeing a nuanced and respectful picture of the other point of view.“Most people say that they went in very firmly sure of their stance, and they left sure of their stance, as well,” Loomer said of audience members who identified as both pro-choice and anti-abortion. “It didn’t change their mind, but it gave them an appreciation of the other side. For the first time, there was another side.” In the future, Loomer hopes to take “Roe” to a theater in the southern United States, where the audience’s political breakdown would likely shift. The goal, again, isn’t to change minds, but to raise the possibility of open dialogue. “My best hope is always compassion, a reverence for the complexity of human beings,” she said. “I think we can use that compassion now. I know it’s a time when people are extremely angry, and the last thing they want is to be asked to show compassion. Unfortunately, I just don’t know another way of even beginning to bridge this terrible divide in our country except for just listening to the other side. Just hearing it.”She also hopes to reach the young people in the audience, those who thought Roe v. Wade was another generation’s story. As Loomer said: “I think that people come away from the play with a deeper understanding of what is at stake, right now, in terms of choice.”“Roe,” a co-production with Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Berkeley Repertory Theatre, is written by Lisa Loomer and directed by Bill Rauch. It is on view until February 19, 2017 at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. Correction: An earlier edition of this article misspelled the playright’s name as Loomey. We regret the error. "

79,ARTS & CULTURE,'Roe v. Wade' Play Shows How Much Is At Stake For Young Women Today,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roe-v-wade-play_us_588a4237e4b0737fd5cc32f5,"""I feel that theater is a place where people ... can come together in the dark to look at an issue from a human point of view.""",2017-01-27,Sara Bruner (as Norma McCorvey) and Sarah Jane Agnew (as Sarah Weddington).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588a722017000026002d8bd7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In 1970, 26-year-old lawyer Sarah Weddington tried her first-ever contested case before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. It was Roe v. Wade. Most Americans alre aware of the Supreme Court’s 1973 verdict in the watershed case, but fewer know the women who got us there. Lisa Loomer’s play “Roe,” running now at Washington, D.C.’s Arena Stage, tells the story of the case that established a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion through the lens of two people: the young and ambitious lawyer Weddington and the case’s plaintiff Norma McCorvey, a 20-something bartender and lesbian who, in court, was known by the legal pseudonym “Jane Roe.” In 2013, Loomer was approached by a friend about the possibility of writing a play about the case as part of a cycle of performances called “American Revolutions,” each recreating a moment of change in American history, commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Given Loomer’s previous work with narratives centered around women’s struggles, Roe v. Wade was of obvious interest. “I was interested in the case, yes, but I was also interested in why this case is still being argued 44 years later,” Loomer explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I wanted to understand why we, as Americans, cannot even talk to each other about this issue. In other words, I was interested in the divide in this country, and I thought that by looking at the divide over Roe, I might begin to look at the larger cultural divide, as well. Which is, ironically, what we are looking at right now, post-election.”After an initial run in Oregon, the play premiered in D.C., just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Before the election, Loomer imagined the production existing in a different context. “We imagined it happening during the inauguration of our first woman president,” she said.“We thought it would be a cautionary tale, as history should be, but also a celebration of how far women’s rights and human rights have come,” she added. “Clearly, we were surprised. The play is happening now in a totally different political climate.” The unexpected turn of events made “Roe” and its implications even more urgent, as Roe v. Wade’s ruling is now under unprecedented threat. One of Trump’s first actions as president was reinstating Ronald Reagan’s abortion “global gag rule,” which bans health organizations around the world receiving U.S. funding from mentioning abortion as a family planning option. And last week, Trump met with Judge William Pryor as a potential Supreme Court Justice, a man who called Roe v. Wade the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.” In writing “Roe,” however, Loomer’s mission was never to convince her audience of the importance of abortion to women’s liberation. Rather, she wanted to tell the complex story of the iconic court case with tolerance and compassion, giving voice and credence to both parties. “I did not want it to be a polemic,” Loomer said. “I did not want to further the divide. I feel that theater is a place where people — all kinds of people — can come together in the dark to look at an issue from a human point of view. Theater is a place to feel. To laugh, cry, be surprised, and to live in another’s shoes for a while.” Loomer tells her story through two protagonists: Weddington and McCorvey. At first, the women worked together on the case as allies. Yet, after the verdict, McCorvey became a born-again Christian and an anti-abortion activist. Weddington continued to champion women’s right to choose.“Their divergent journeys,” Loomer said, are representative of a broader picture. “Once I saw that odd turn of events, I thought it was a chance to tell the story of the cultural divide and look at why we can’t talk to each other as Americans.”In “Roe,” Loomer depicts the complex web of biases, fears and personal motivations that all humans grapple with regardless of their political affiliations. She also seamlessly highlights the effects that race, class and sexual orientation have on one’s opportunities and worldview. As a result, no minister, activist or millennial is stereotyped. There are no clear heroes or villains, just people ― messy, dedicated, and trying to do what’s right.During the play’s Washington run, Loomer speculates that most, but not all, of her audience leans liberal. Yet she’s received feedback from viewers on both sides of the political spectrum who appreciated seeing a nuanced and respectful picture of the other point of view.“Most people say that they went in very firmly sure of their stance, and they left sure of their stance, as well,” Loomer said of audience members who identified as both pro-choice and anti-abortion. “It didn’t change their mind, but it gave them an appreciation of the other side. For the first time, there was another side.” In the future, Loomer hopes to take “Roe” to a theater in the southern United States, where the audience’s political breakdown would likely shift.

80,QUEER VOICES,Caitlyn Jenner’s Friend Has A Powerful Message For Conservative Women,James Michael Nichols,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jennifer-boylan-caitlyn-jenner_us_588b6989e4b0303c07532cef,"""If we are not here to look out for one another, what are we here for exactly?”",2017-01-27,Jennifer Boylan speaks at the 26th Annual GLAAD Media Awards.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588b6e7a17000025002d8d5a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Women from all walks of life came together at last Saturday’s Women’s March in a massive display of solidarity and resistance all around the globe.One such protestor was Jennifer Boylan, a long-time trans activist and author who marched with thousands of others in the Women’s March in NYC.While marching, Boylan used Twitter to send out a message to her friend Caitlyn Jenner, who was noticeably absent from the protest, about the responsibility women have to fight for one another ― even if they identify as conservative.The video made waves on the internet and some people tried to claim that Boylan was “throwing shade” or “dragging” Jenner. But Boylan told The Huffington Post that the intention was not to come for her friend ― who has previously stated that she is a conservative ― but rather start a larger conversation about what is articulated by Jenner’s decision to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration and not the Women’s March.“[Caitlyn has] done many good things for trans people, not only through raising our visibility, but through other things that she’s done in secret that she’s taken no public credit for,” Boylan, who regularly appeared on Jenner’s reality show, “I Am Cait,” told The Huffington Post. “I understand that she is a Republican, as are about half the women in this country and as are about a quarter of its LGBTQ people. I guess I understand that these voters feel that there are more important things than fighting for their individual rights, but of course I wish that they’d change their minds. But being a woman ― like being trans ― doesn’t mean any one thing, and I think it’s in all of our best interests to have a ‘big tent’ approach. As I’ve said before, ‘this dress is big enough for everyone.’”In Boylan’s eyes, if someone lives their life as a woman ― however they choose to define that term ― then they share a responsibility to fight for the rights of womanhood across the spectrum of identity.“For me, womanhood means fighting for other women, especially people without privilege, who rely on assistance to get pap smears, and access to contraception, and mammograms, and yes, safe and legal abortion. I know that there are other women who disagree,” Boylan said. “Personally, I think you can be for small government and low taxes and also understand that government can be a force for good. It can, in fact, save people’s lives. And if we are not here to look out for one another, what are we here for exactly?”Boylan added: “I have my doubts about whether the Republican party will ever change its tune, though ― it feels to me like so much of its core identity for the last quarter century has been about oppressing us. If the party becomes less homophobic and transphobic as a result of Caitlyn’s work ― or anyone’s work, I’ll be delighted. In the meantime, I’m going to keep marching. I wish Caitlyn would march too. As I said in the video, ‘Join me. The water’s fine.’”"

But an earlier leaked draft suggested the action would block refugee admissions from the war-torn country of Syria indefinitely and temporarily suspend the country’s refugee resettlement program.In an interview with The Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, Trump suggested that persecuted Christians would be given priority when applying for refugee status.A letter drafted by Christian aid organization Church World Service and signed by more than 2,000 faith leaders called on the Trump administration and members of Congress to “demonstrate moral leadership and affirm their support for the resettlement of refugees from all over the world to the United States.”The religious leaders condemned what they viewed as Trump’s longstanding bias against Muslims, stating in their letter: “Together, representing our various faiths, we decry derogatory language that has been used about Middle Eastern refugees and our Muslim friends and neighbors. Inflammatory rhetoric has no place in our response to this humanitarian crisis.”“The U.S. Refugee Resettlement program has been and should remain open to those of all nationalities and religions who face persecution on account of the reasons enumerated under U.S. law.”Among the letter’s signatories were several top-ranking religious officials, including The Rev. Elizabeth A. Eaton, presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, The Rev. Dr. John C. Dorhauer, president of the United Church of Christ, and Bishop Bruce R. Ough, president of the United Methodist Church’s Council of Bishops.Many renowned faith activists and leaders also signed the letter, including Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, Salam Al-Marayati, president of Muslim Public Affairs Council and progressive Christian activist Jim Wallis.The letter is a re-write of a petition Church World Service sent to Congress last year urging them to not bar refugees based on religion or nationality, Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy for the organization’s Immigration and Refugee Program, told The Huffington Post.The organization also reached out to faith leaders earlier this week to collect individual statements denouncing Trump’s then-anticipated executive order. Nearly 50 leaders answered the call.The previously leaked draft, which clearly singled out Muslims, elicited strong reactions from religious leaders. Rev. Dr. William Barber, architect of the Moral Revival faith movement wrote: “This ban on travelers, even children, from Muslim-majority and Middle Eastern nations, these threats against Mexicans and others who try to enter our country at our southern border, are the first steps in a Trump-era agenda that criminalizes faith, nationality, and people of color, and it flies in the face of the American and moral values we hold dear. These acts smell of racism and reek of xenophobia.”Trump signed the executive order on Holocaust Remembrance Day, when people around the world recall the horrors inflicted on religious and ethnic minorities by the Nazi party and the U.S.’s role in denying visas to those fleeing.""Vulnerable individuals from a host of religions, ethnicities and backgrounds have been and should continue to be resettled in the United States,” the religious leaders wrote.“As people of faith, our values call us to welcome the stranger, love our neighbor, and stand with the vulnerable, regardless of their religion.”"

Jose Rodriguez.U.S. Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas), Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and former Houston Mayor Annise Parker also endorsed Perez’s bid to lead the Democratic Party.“Tom Perez understands the complex challenges we have in Texas and understands the national party needs to make investments instead of treating Texas as an ATM machine,” Hinojosa said in a statement announcing his endorsement. “Tom is a friend, and if he’s elected chair, he will speak to the broad tent of the party and has the experience to turnaround [sic] large complex organizations.”The string of endorsements adds to Perez’s vote count as he courts the 447 party officials who will elect the next chair. Texas has several additional voting members who have not yet announced their support for anyone’s candidacy.Friday’s announcement also provides a publicity boost for Perez ahead of a regional forum for DNC candidates in Houston on Saturday.The forums give voting members an opportunity to hear from the seven major candidates, including Perez, U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley, South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison and media strategist Jehmu Greene.Friday’s endorsements follow several other major declarations of support for Perez.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a voting DNC member, endorsed Perez earlier this month. And on Thursday, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, a 500,000-person building trade union, endorsed Perez. He already has the support of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, and the International Association of Fire Fighters. Ellison, widely viewed as Perez’s chief rival in the race, enjoys the endorsement of the AFL-CIO, the country’s largest labor federation, and several of the country’s other large unions, including AFSCME and the Communication Workers of America.Watch HuffPost’s full interview with Tom Perez over here.The struggle between Ellison, an early backer of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential primary, and Perez, who endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is widely viewed as a proxy battle between different factions of the Democratic Party. While Sanders supporters and many Washington-based Clinton backers have rallied behind Ellison, other Clintonites have gotten behind Perez. Former President Barack Obama, under whom Perez served, has lavished glowing praise on him.Since the race began in November, however, ideological and policy battles have taken a back seat to insider politicking. Contenders are, after all, competing for the hearts of the 447 insiders who decide the race, not the party’s primary electorate. In a Jan. 18 debate among DNC candidates hosted by The Huffington Post, the candidates avoided highlighting their policy differences, with Ellison downplaying his desire to reinstate a ban on lobbyist donations to the DNC.Hinojosa was open about his support for Perez in an interview with HuffPost earlier this month. Friday’s statement represents his formal endorsement, according to Perez campaign spokeswoman Molly Nuñez.DNC members are expected to vote on the next chair on Feb. 25 in Atlanta.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Unite Here endorsed Perez; the union has announced its support for Ellison."

84,WOMEN,Sheryl Sandberg Comes Out Swinging Against Trump's Anti-Abortion Policy,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-global-gag-rule_us_588b4ffbe4b0303c07530d5d,The Facebook executive also said she supported the Women's March and wished she could've been there.,2017-01-27,This is what happens when women aren't in charge: Trump and his team sign an anti-abortion executive order on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58863f342900002800dd1374.jpeg?cache=rkRPwLrZ7v&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sheryl Sandberg is finally leaning in for the Trump era. The Facebook chief operating officer and author of the corporate feminist tome Lean In, is known for speaking up for women’s rights in the workplace. Yet she has been relatively silent as the Trump administration’s anti-women agenda takes shape.She was conspicuously absent from last weekend’s women’s marches. “She wishes she could have gone,” a spokesperson told The Huffington Post on Friday. Sandberg supported the march but couldn’t attend for personal reasons, the spokesperson said.Then this Thursday, after less than a week of President Donald Trump, Sandberg spoke up. In a post, she warned against the horrors of the Trump administration’s reinstatement of the Reagan-era anti-abortion Mexico City rule, known by opponents as the global gag rule. “[The] policy could have terrible consequences for women and families around the world,” Sandberg writes, sharing a long New York Times piece that explains how the Trump rule would ripple throughout the developing world, leaving women without health care and endangering lives.The global gag rule prohibits health care providers around the world who receive funding from the United States from even talking about abortion as a component of family planning. Even if the funding for the abortion counseling comes from another source, a clinic would still lose the money under the Trump rule, which he signed on Monday ― surrounded by men.Sandberg said she supported a bill proposed by two congresswomen that would permanently get rid of the rule.“[The] policy could have terrible consequences for women and families around the world,” Sandberg writes. “I started my career working at the World Bank on health care in India. I saw firsthand how clinics funded by foreign aid are often the only source of health care for women. When women are given even the most basic health care information and services, they live longer, healthier lives ― and they give birth to children who live longer, healthier lives.”Trump’s reimagining of the gag rule is even more severe than the original prohibition devised by President Ronald Reagan, which was limited to clinics that provide family planning services. The Trump gag extends to any health care providers around the world ― which would cut an estimated $8.5 billion in aid. “And this ban is harsher and broader than past orders by past presidents,” Sandberg writes, “because it covers every program that falls under global health assistance. That means it’ll hurt more people.”The rule is even more absurd, as Sandberg notes, because it has proved to be ineffective and counterproductive. Abortion rates doubled the last time the rule was in place, one study showed. Corporate feminism is a tricky thing. An executive at a public company is ultimately accountable to her shareholders and can’t just say whatever is on her mind politically. Other prominent female executives (there aren’t many) have been quiet on Trump.Although Sandberg is outspoken about the need for more women leaders, she’s said nothing about the conspicuous lack of women in Trump’s cabinet ― he’s appointed the whitest and most male cabinet since Reagan.Sandberg’s also kept mum about Trump’s effort to make women’s health care in the U.S. more expensive by getting rid of the Affordable Care Act or Congress’ moves to make abortion more expensive.Still, some hoped she’d say something. The Facebook executive endorsed Hillary Clinton during the presidential race and was rumored to be under consideration for Treasury secretary had the Democrat won the election.There are also rumors that Sandberg, who has a book coming out soon about how she coped with the unexpected death of her husband in 2015, is considering a run for the presidency herself.In December, she showed up for a meeting with Trump along with several other tech executives at Trump Tower. She’s reportedly reached out to Ivanka Trump about women’s issues. The gag rule perhaps is a less touchy subject. Though over the years, it’s been a political hot potato. Reagan put it in place, Clinton removed it, George W. Bush reinstated it and then Obama got rid of it.In a Facebook post, right after Trump won, Sandberg wrote about a “divisive election” and the need for women to keep fighting.“We must encourage more women to run for office across every party at every level of government until our representation matches our share of the population,” she wrote. “History is on our side – and we will get there.”Maybe so ― if leaders like Sandberg keep talking."

The National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) ― the only major museum in the world dedicated to celebrating the history of women-identified artists ― told The Huffington Post that inauguration weekend yielded the museum’s largest weekend attendance ever. The museum offered free admission to visitors the weekend of Jan. 21, as well as additional programming geared toward all the nasty women in town for the Women’s March on Washington. Initially, the museum was slated to host a “Nasty Women” tour, a guided journey through the works of women artists in the NMWA’s permanent collection who subverted gender norms and societal expectations, making some quality artwork in the process. As Deborah Gaston, director of education at the museum, explained to HuffPost: “A nasty woman is someone who refuses to be bound by the place society defined for her, someone who blazes her own trail.” Luckily for the NMWA, their programming has always incorporated such progressive sheroes. So many visitors, however, turned up to the NMWA, that instead of giving one “Nasty Women” tour as originally expected, the museum gave nine. In fact, inauguration weekend attendance was double the previous record for weekend attendance (with free admission), director of communications and marketing Amy Mannarino said.“We can’t say enough about the wonderful women and men that visited the museum,” Mannarino continued. “The crowd’s positive energy was palpable, and visitors filled all corners of the museum—enjoying art by women, chatting with friends, and enjoying free refreshments. We couldn’t have asked for more.”If you missed the “Nasty Women” tour, worry not. The NMWA is always highlighting the work of female artists who toppled stereotypes and challenged the male gaze. So in effect, every tour is a “Nasty Women” tour. As Gaston put it: “In a way, this tour is special, but in a way it’s what we always do. Here, it’s Women’s History Month every month. This is a perfect time for people to notice what we are doing here, but we’re doing it all the time.”Trump’s election seems to have inspired a renewed interest in feminist art, for obvious reasons. A string of “Nasty Women” art shows held around the country have raised over $50,000 for Planned Parenthood. And a New York–based exhibition called “Uprising / Angry Women” also compiled work from female-identifying artists giving Trump a piece of their minds. Cheers to women being creative, fearless and, of course, nasty. "

I hope y’all make peace with this,” Edwards said before he was put to death, according to the statement released by Clark.The execution was put on hold for about four hours as the Supreme Court considered several motions citing what lawyers for Edwards said were faults in previous legal proceedings. The court rejected those requests late on Thursday evening.The execution was the 540th in Texas since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, the most of any state.Edwards was convicted along with co-defendant Kirk Edwards, an older cousin, of the July 2002 murders of Dallas Subway sandwich shop employees Mickell Goodwin and Tommy Walker in a robbery.Kirk Edwards has a projected release date of July 2027, Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records showed.In an editorial posted online on Wednesday, the Dallas Morning News said the execution should be halted because there are too many unanswered questions in the case.“These questions do not paint Terry Edwards as innocent. But they do raise uncertainties as to whether the jury was misled when it determined he had pulled the trigger and deserved to die, it said.Lawyers for Texas have argued that new counsel for Edwards previously tried to halt the execution on similar grounds and that his conviction and sentencing were legal and proper.John Mills, an attorney for Edwards, said he had evidence indicating that Edwards was not the gunman.“Previous counsel has done virtually almost nothing to ensure that his case was investigated and that the powerful evidence undermining the reliability and the fairness of his conviction was brought to light,” Mills said in an interview.One of the main pieces of evidence was gunshot residue testing, which at trial was presented and used by prosecutors who said Terry Edwards fired the fatal shots.In court papers, lawyers for the Terry Edwards said the gunshot residue evidence was improperly interpreted and actually show that Edwards was not the shooter."

Health professionals urgently need the very best science in order to protect the public, and climate science has increasingly critical implications for their day-to-day work. With more and more hot days, which exacerbate the proliferation of the Zika virus and other public health threats, we cannot afford to waste any time.”Studies warn that climate change could undermine a half-century of health advances as more people experience health issues associated with heat waves, droughts and flooding.The event serves to fill the gap left by the CDC’s canceled Climate & Health Summit, which was intended to explore the “translation of science to practice” in dealing with climate change’s consequences on our health. Despite being in the works for months, the event was canceled just days before President Donald Trump was sworn into office. CDC spokeswoman Bernadette Burden told The Huffington Post last week that the agency is “exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017.”The cancellation isn’t surprising given how politicized climate change is, Frumkin said. “Sometimes the agency is subject to external political pressure; sometimes the agency self-censors or pre-emptively stays away from certain issues,” he told E&E News, who broke the news of the summit’s cancellation. “Climate change has been that issue historically.”Sources inside federal agencies said this week that the Trump administration has started taking action to limit access to government climate change information. Sources inside the the Environmental Protection Agency say they’ve been instructed to stop sending out social media posts and press releases, that their grant program has been frozen and that the EPA’s main climate change web page may come down.

88,POLITICS,Republicans Trying To Replace Obamacare Still Don't Have Any Idea What They're In For,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-retreat-obamacare-replacement_us_5888f549e4b0024605fd474a,They're just figuring out this is going to be hard.,2017-01-27,House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have not apparently emerged from their GOP retreat with a clear plan for Obamacare.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588b755417000025002d8d78.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― Senate and House Republicans came to their GOP retreat here to get on the same page on Obamacare, to figure out the broad strokes of a health care alternative and to emerge with a unified message.That did not happen.Republicans left town Friday with still more questions than answers on an Obamacare alternative, and the only thing lawmakers truly seem to agree on is that the Affordable Care Act needs to go.On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) laid out a timeline for repealing major parts of the 2010 health care law through a reconciliation process before April. At that point, the secretary of health and human services would begin issuing new guidance on Obamacare, which the lawmakers seem ready to consider part of a “replacement.”And then ... they’ve offered little idea what happens next, how long it will take or what it will end up.Republicans talk broadly about incorporating some elements they’ve already agreed to in the past, like expanding health savings accounts, creating high-risk pools and lifting barriers to the purchase of insurance plans across state lines. But those ideas alone assume that some crippled version of Obamacare remains in place and that Republicans in both chambers go along with gutting the health care system without a real replacement plan. The closer Republicans get to the sticking point, though, the more some lawmakers will want policy particulars, which their leaders simply don’t have.When HuffPost asked House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) on Friday for the proposed details of the replacement plan, he focused on the repeal.“What we’ve looked at is as many things as we can put in a reconciliation bill that not just deal with a repeal but also a replace,” Scalise said. He then explained that the measure ripping apart the law will contain only small portions of an Obamacare alternative because of Senate rules barring new policies in a reconciliation bill. After they pass that repeal, he said, Republicans would “start moving some other things through the legislative process.”“One of the flaws with Obamacare ― there were many ― was that [then-Speaker] Nancy Pelosi literally wrote the bill in a room with maybe two or three other people the night before the vote and nobody read the bill before they voted on it,” Scalise said.While it’s true the law enacted in 2010 included its fair share of backroom deals, the substance of the Affordable Care Act was the subject of a lengthy, open debate that started during the 2008 presidential campaign and continued in Congress for about a year ― with some 130 public hearings across five committees.President Donald Trump has vowed to pass a replacement in the same week or on the same day ― “could be the same hour” ― as the repeal. Although Ryan said earlier this month that he and Trump were “in complete sync” on that timeline, it appears it might be more spin than reality.Republicans now look ready to have an actual debate on Obamacare, with hearings and multiple bills. This process would take time and could generate significant backlash. If Republicans are able to repeal Obamacare with, say, a three-year delay on the effective date, they could use those years to develop and pass multiple individual components of a health care alternative.But those bills would likely all need 60 votes in the Senate, and there’s little incentive for Democrats to go along with gutting the law, especially if GOP lawmakers are shaky about what they’re doing.Some Republicans think this is where Trump might come in handy. “I like the idea that we have a president who’s going to be using the bully pulpit, flying around on Air Force One to those states where Democrats might want to be standing in the way of their own voters,” Scalise said.Again, that assumes Republicans themselves can agree on the broad strokes of a plan.On Thursday, Republicans held a two-and-a-half hour session on Obamacare that many lawmakers thought could produce those general agreements on a replacement. Instead, in the words of one member, “it was a farce.” Two other members characterized it as “pathetic.”A secret recording obtained by The Washington Post reveals the extent of lawmakers’ confusion and their wariness of barreling toward a repeal without a clear replacement plan. The general uneasiness is captured in one exchange when a lawmaker asked panelists a “simple question”: Will states be able to maintain the expanded Medicaid rolls provided for under the Affordable Care Act?“These are decisions we have to make,” replied another, according to The Washington Post. “That’s why we are here today.”“The only person in the room talking specifics was Dr. Cassidy,” one member told HuffPost, referring to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). “You might not like his plan, but at least he is talking about a real solution.”Cassidy’s plan,  which is also supported by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), is to essentially allow states where Obamacare is working well, like California and Michigan, to keep that structure, while other states where it’s not working so well, like Arizona and Tennessee, could adopt a new system. It’s easily pitched to voters and relies on the key Republican principle of bringing government closer to the people. Naturally, the plan looked dead on arrival.Republicans at that Thursday session reported to HuffPost that there were plenty of ideas tossed around, just no real consensus.“Lots of different perspectives on how to best fix the Obamacare fiasco,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said. “No coalition on any one form of repeal or fix.”Brooks himself is not necessarily against just repealing Obamacare and doing nothing more. “As a matter of law, if there is a repeal, then we revert back to the best health care system the world has ever known, and that’s the health care system America had in 2008,” Brooks has said previously.But other lawmakers argue that premiums and deductibles need to be reduced and coverage for the sick must be maintained ― all while repealing the taxes that help pay for Obamacare and removing insurance mandates.That was the position of Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas), who thinks Republicans can achieve all those things. Told that his insurance plan sounded like magic, Babin went on to praise the free enterprise system and decry the fact that some Americans had to change doctors under Obamacare.“Nothing’s magic,” he said.It’s not realistic, either. If you take away the mechanisms that pay for Obamacare ― as Republicans want to do ― insurance coverage will not miraculously get better or cheaper simply because there’s more competition across state lines. The net result will be fewer Americans insured, larger medical bills to be paid out of pocket, or a combination of the two. Real people will suffer real consequences.If you want to pass a health care alternative in the open, through regular order, with multiple bills, over many months ― to give full public consideration to a major decision ― you also have to deal with public opposition. Votes on measures that already look like they can’t win 60 senators will be even tougher. And the competing viewpoints ― from conservatives who want to see less government interference and support, from moderates and liberals who want to see more ― will duke it out in a very messy battle that could overwhelm an already jammed congressional schedule.Which is all to say: A Republican alternative to Obamacare faces real trouble, and that isn’t something you can resolve over a couple of days in a hotel ballroom.Laura Barron-Lopez and Jonathan Cohn contributed to this report."

Thirteen unions originally sued the state in St. Clair County Circuit Court to ensure its members were paid.State Comptroller Susana Mendoza, a Democrat, said on Thursday that her office was working on a plan to meet technical adjustments that a payroll stoppage would require and to partially pay some state workers.“Had Governor Rauner met his constitutional duty to propose a balanced budget in 2015 or 2016, we would not be facing a scenario where the livelihoods of our frontline employees could be threatened in this way,” Mendoza said in a statement, vowing to follow all court rulings.Related On HuffPost:"
