0,POLITICS,Most Republicans Think Trump's GOP Critics Are Hurting The Party,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-trump-critics-polling_us_59f8e9d3e4b046017faf91f7,The intraparty tensions in Washington haven't gone unnoticed.,2017-10-31,"Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) pauses to check his phone after announcing he will not run for re-election on Oct. 24, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f8ea12140000610d8ca9f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most Republicans think it doesn’t help their party when GOP congressional leaders attempt to rein in the president, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. Several Republican legislators who’ve announced they won’t stand for re-election have been emboldened to take on Donald Trump. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) publicly slammed Trump as “utterly untruthful” and the White House as an “adult day care center” after announcing he wouldn’t run again. Since declaring he wouldn’t stand for re-election, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called on his fellow lawmakers to “not be complicit and silent,” and “never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals.” Republicans who’d still like to be re-elected, however, have been largely loath to follow those examples, ducking questions about the president’s behavior or arguing that it’s simply not their problem. That reticence may amount to an ability to read the political tea leaves. According to the poll, 60 percent of Republicans and independents who lean toward supporting the Republican Party say it’s bad for the party when GOP members of Congress openly criticize Trump when they disagree with him. A 55 percent majority, meanwhile, say it’s a good thing for the GOP that some Republicans critical of Trump aren’t running for re-election.Voters who supported Trump in last year’s election are even more unified, with 65 percent saying it’s a bad thing for the party for Republicans to take on Trump, and an equal number saying it’s good for the GOP to have Trump critics retiring.The strength of Trump’s bully pulpit has proven, practically, to have limits: He couldn’t wholeheartedly sell his base on the GOP’s health care bill, or convince Alabamians to back Luther Strange over Roy Moore in a primary runoff. But taking Trump on does appear to carry tangible consequences for GOP politicians. Just 37 percent of Republicans in Tennessee now approve of Corker, down 24 points since February, according to a poll of the state’s voters released Friday by Middle Tennessee State University. Polling has found that Trump’s Republican backers mostly side with the president over the rest of the GOP. Many, however, see no conflict in supporting both the president and his party, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll.Most Republicans and Republican leaners ― 56 percent ― say they consider themselves supporters of both Trump and the GOP, with 18 percent saying they support only Trump and 16 percent saying they support only the GOP.Trump voters’ responses are notably distinct. While more than half say they support both Trump and the GOP, 28 percent say they support only Trump, and just 6 percent only the GOP.The infighting in Washington hasn’t gone unnoticed by the electorate. Just less than half of Trump voters believe that most or all Republicans in Congress generally support the president ― up from the 42 percent who said so in September, but down from 58 percent in July.Just 41 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners now say they’re satisfied with or enthusiastic about the politicians from their party who currently hold elected office, significantly below the 62 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who say the same about their party.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 24-25 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Senators from both parties didn’t just focus on the alleged Russian influence campaign; it also was clear there was some bipartisan agreement that the Silicon Valley companies that package and sell our attention have too much power.A key and crucial moment in the hearing occurred when Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) directed a tough line of questions to Facebook’s Stretch. Kennedy opened up by stating, “Your power sometimes scares me.” This is nothing to take lightly. In fact, the power of these companies is the key point underlying this scandal.Facebook and Google are two of the five richest corporations in the U.S. They both hold practical monopolies in their areas of expertise, social media and search, respectively. They’ve amassed this power and wealth by monetizing their users’ data and attention for advertisers. And now they’re being called to account for users’ data and attention being used to propagandize to them.Kennedy asked how many advertisers Facebook has, and Stretch responded that the company has around 5 million different advertisers each month. “Did China run ads in last election cycle?” Kennedy wanted to know. “Did Turkmenistan?”“Not that I’m aware of,” Stretch responded, providing the answer Kennedy expected. Kennedy then said it appears there’s no way for Facebook to adequately know everyone who is advertising on its site if there are 5 million different advertisers every month ― and Stretch admitted as much.Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) took Facebook’s Stretch to task over the fact that Russians purchased ads about U.S. elections with rubles. While it’s not strange for foreign advertisers to purchase advertisements in their local currency, Franken asked with a bit of wry humor, “You can’t put together rubles with a political ad and go, Hmm, those two data points spell out something bad?”Stretch admitted, “It’s a signal we should have been alert to,” but didn’t confirm the company wouldn’t accept political advertisements paid for in foreign currency in the future. In later questioning, Twitter’s Edgett said they would not accept foreign currency to pay for political ads. Google’s Salgado, however, attempted to explain that they would examine whether the use of foreign money to purchase political ads was a proper “signal” of inappropriate activity.Franken pressed Stretch about a ProPublica report that the company allowed advertisers to target paid messages to people who qualified as “Jew-haters.” Stretch confirmed Kennedy’s earlier point that the company can’t fully know the extent of advertising on the platform. “We’re not aware of any revenue using those targets,” he said.Later in the hearing, Kennedy returned to his earlier theme asking both Facebook’s Stretch and Google’s Salgado whether, even if it were against their internal rules, they could know the innermost details of a specific individual’s life. He asked about a report showing Facebook allowed advertisers to target teenagers at the exact moments they were most depressed and vulnerable. Stretch said the report was based on an internal document, and the company had already dealt with the issue. He said internal rules forbid the accessing of individual personal user data, but refused to state whether it was possible.Kennedy replied, “You have the ability to give me a list [of users] who are teenagers, who are insecure about their weight. You may not sell that but you have the ability. You may have a policy against it but I believe you can do it.”Google’s Salgado admitted that, while there are internal rules against accessing individual user data, “We certainly have the ability to look at a user’s account.”While the focus of the hearing was about the alleged Russian influence campaign, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, asked, “What nations do you worry about other than Russia?”It was a question that none of the tech company representatives had a clear answer for. It appeared the companies had not investigated whether any other foreign nation was involved in any kind of influence or propaganda campaign targeting the United States. Facebook’s Stretch said the problem “really is a global threat.”Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has introduced legislation with Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) to require online advertising disclosure, asked whether the companies would support her bill, called the Honest Ads Act. The three representatives all said they would like to work with her on the bill, but none definitively said they supported its passage.The corporate representatives began the hearing by detailing what happened in the 2016 election, and how their companies plan to respond to the alleged Russian influence operation that used false personas to purchase advertisements and disseminate content on the three platforms. Representatives for Facebook and Twitter both explained that the Russian influence operation began in 2015 but did not specifically manifest as opposition to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton until 2016. After the election, the operation shifted to one trying to discredit President Donald Trump. As had been reported previously, the campaign took various different angles, making Americans agitate over hot-button issues.Facebook and Twitter discussed their plans to institute previously announced disclosure policies for online political advertising. Google additionally said it would allow users to see the names of advertisement purchasers by clicking on a button related to the ad.At times, Google’s Salgado attempted to distance his company from both Facebook and Twitter. He stated how little was spent by Russian advertisers on politically relevant ads and how few views their YouTube accounts received in comparison to the larger problems of advertising, fake accounts and bots on the social media platforms.Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) was not pleased with the responses from the companies, calling them “a lot of Johnny-come-latelys.” He added, “There’s a lot you could have done earlier. I suspect that your advertising departments watched [their] profits go up.”The absence of company chief executives was also noted negatively. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said, “I wish we had the executives of your three companies here with us today.”The same three representatives will testify again before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Wednesday."

3,WORLD NEWS,Long-Lost Salamander Rediscovered In Guatemalan Jungle,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/salamander-rediscovered-guatemala_us_59f79bbce4b0aec1467a3fa2,"The ""golden wonder"" species had not been seen for more than four decades.",2017-10-31,The Jackson’s climbing salamander was last seen in 1975 and was feared extinct until its rediscovery this month. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f7b2f3140000610d8ca6b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — A species of salamander that had been feared extinct has been rediscovered in the Cuchumatanes mountains of Guatemala, the Texas-based Global Wildlife Conservation announced Monday.The Jackson’s climbing salamander, also called the “golden wonder” for its vibrant yellow color, had last been sighted in 1975, when two Americans discovered the species in the Guatemalan jungle. A guard at the Finca San Isidro Amphibian Reserve, in northwestern Guatemala, spotted a juvenile Jackson’s climbing salamander earlier this month during a routine patrol. It is just the third individual ever reported seen, according to GWC. The group, which launched a global quest earlier this year to track down long-lost species, described the rediscovery as exciting and unexpected. “I love this story because it conveys how protecting habitat gives species a fighting chance to survive on this planet,” Don Church, GWC’s president and director of conservation, said in a statement. “This rediscovery can only be a good omen for the future of the Search for Lost Species campaign. It’s a sign that if we get out there and work at it, many of these species can be found and saved.”A photo of the four-legged, yellow-and-black amphibian was sent to Carlos Vasquez, curator of herpetology at Universidad de San Carlos in Guatemala, who has spent more than 3,000 hours searching for the species since 2005. Vasquez confirmed that it was a Jackson’s climbing salamander, the conservation group said. “We had started to fear that the species was gone, and now it’s like it has come back from extinction,” Vasquez said in a statement accompanying Monday’s announcement. “It’s a beautiful story, and marks a promised future for the conservation of this special region.”The larger project, called “The Search for Lost Species,” is described as the “largest-ever global quest to find and protect” animals and plants missing for decades. GWC’s list of 25 flagship species — none of which have been officially declared extinct — comes from a larger list of 1,200 species considered “lost” in more than 160 countries. The group compiled the list with the help of experts at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and has begun launching expeditions in an effort to track down species. Priority species include the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo, last spotted in 1928 in Indonesia; the pink-headed duck, missing since 1949; and the bullneck seahorse, a species native to Australia never before seen in the wild. In an interview in April, Church told HuffPost that even if species aren’t found, the campaign offers “a message of hope and opportunity” on the importance of protecting hotspots of biodiversity. “It’s about raising the profile both of the species that we’re looking for but more so the places where they occur,” he said. But as Monday’s announcement made clear, there’s plenty of reason to be excited about the global quest."

The recent shootings in Las Vegas – reminiscent of our own tragedy at Virginia Tech – reminded us that we need solutions to the gun violence epidemic. But if Ed Gillespie becomes governor of Virginia, we’ll be choosing a leader who is beholden to the National Rifle Association (NRA), which has shown us time and time again that gun safety and racial equity are the last things they want. The NRA is dumping money into television ads and spending massive amounts of money in Virginia to buy off politicians like Ed Gillespie, a corporate lobbyist who is the Republican candidate for governor, and put them into power. And it seems clear that neither the NRA, nor politicians like Gillespie care how many innocent people, especially people of color, get hurt in their greed to dominate. The so-called “gun control” measures on Gillespie’s platform, all backed by the NRA, pretend to be tough on crime but do nothing to solve the problem of gun violence. What these measures actually do is target people of color. Just look at the failed Project Exile program Gillespie wants to reboot. Project Exile imposes stiffer sentences on people who have served prison sentences and are arrested in possession of a gun. People of color are more likely to be imprisoned in the first place, which means they are also more likely to receive harsher sentences under this program if they’re found with a gun after their release. Many of them are not even aware these laws exist.The NRA’s ideology plays into the hands of a criminal justice system that already disproportionately punishes people of color—particularly here in Virginia, which has one of the worst school-to-prison pipelines in the country. I personally know white women from college who got off with a warning when they were caught shoplifting, while my friend who is an immigrant was sentenced with a felony and jail time for stealing diapers for her baby in a moment of desperation. The criminal justice system does not treat everyone equally. That’s one of the many reasons I’m voting for Ralph Northam, a leader who will fight to reduce gun violence and protect the people of Virginia—people of all backgrounds, races and beliefs, including law-abiding gun owners. Northam understands that NRA-backed policies will worsen the problem of a justice system that puts a disproportionate number of people of color, immigrants and members of other vulnerable communities behind bars. When asked about Gillespie’s inclusion of Project Exile in his platform, Northam’s campaign replied that all ideas to reduce crime must be “implemented in a way that does not exacerbate the racial disparities in our criminal justice system.” Even before he began running for governor, Northam, a pediatric neurologist, used his medical expertise to push for new gun-control measures. Because of his experience treating wounded veterans as an Army doctor during Operation Desert Storm, Northam knows that assault weapons do not belong in our communities. And he knows firsthand about the need for restrictions on buying and carrying guns after seeing children suffering the consequences of gunshot wounds in his private practice. Las Vegas, Virginia Tech, Newtown, Orlando… every new gun-related tragedy demonstrates the urgent need for sensible gun safety measures to protect innocent Americans. This November, it’s more important than ever to keep the NRA at bay by electing leaders who put everyday people above the gun lobby. There’s too much at stake, both for people of color and the entire Commonwealth.

Bell took one for the team this year and dressed as Princess Elsa at her daughter Lincoln’s request, complete with a flowing aquamarine gown and tiara. “When your daughter demands you BOTH be ELSA for Halloween...you GRIN AND FORKING BEAR IT,” Bell captioned a photo of her in costume, adding a reference to her NBC sitcom “The Good Place.”Bell has gone on record saying that her daughters are essentially the only children in America with a disinterest in the adventures of Anna and Elsa, but apparently they’ve finally come around. “Despite how hard I tried, we’re not an Anna family,” Bell told USA Today at the premiere of “A Bad Mom’s Christmas.” “Sad but true.”“She don’t care,” she continued. “Anytime the word Halloween comes up she wants to put on her Elsa dress and her gloves. The gloves are a very big deal.”At least Bell has some practice stepping into the shoes of the ice princess. On an episode of her “Veronica Mars” co-star’s new show “Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television,” the actress dressed as Elsa, except this time it definitely wasn’t kid-friendly. Watch Bell as Elsa like you’ve never seen before in the clips below. "

He said, ‘You’ve got a very difficult job here, because I don’t want anyone to notice the costumes. They’ve got to look familiar, but not familiar at the same time.’”When Mollo won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design for the film, he said at the 1978 ceremony, “As you see, the costumes from ‘Star Wars’ are really not so much costumes as a bit of plumbing and general automobile engineering.”Mollo won his second Oscar for “Gandhi.”He also dressed up “Alien,” “Cry Freedom,” “Air America,” “Chaplin” and other films. According to IMDb, his last credit was on “Hornblower: Duty” in 2003."

11,MEDIA,Here's What 'Fox & Friends' Covered On Manafort Indictment Day,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-and-friend-manafort-indictment_us_59f74fa0e4b09b5c25675c24,"A tale of Trump tweets, Dean Cain and an emoji cheeseburger.",2017-10-30,"On the day that President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was indicted, ""Fox & Friends"" dedicated substantial time to asking why Hillary Clinton wasn't being investigated instead.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f75247140000ae528ca520.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the age of “FAKE NEWS,” it can be difficult to know whom to trust and what to believe. To get the real story surrounding Monday’s biggest news story — the federal charges against former Donald Trump campaign staffers Paul Manafort and Richard Gates — we decided to watch two straight hours of “Fox & Friends,” the fair-and-balanced Fox News morning show hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, three decent Americans simply searching for truth. Here’s our running diary. 7:02 a.m. EDT: OK, it seems like this indictment thing might be a big deal. Doocy called the potential indictments their “top story,” and Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins said that the network has “teams all over this town [Washington] to see what happens.” But wait, Doocy says: There’s some important context missing from the other networks’ coverage. Is it possible this is all part of a giant Democratic conspiracy to ruin Trump? “Keep in mind: This all got started after Hillary Clinton lost,” Doocy says, “and there’s a new Ed Klein book that’s coming out. Ed’s going to be on the show tomorrow. Essentially what he says is around Christmas time, [then-President] Barack Obama and some of his top lieutenants figured out, ‘OK, this is how we are going to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump.’”And we’re off. 7:05: Kilmeade suddenly seems extremely angry. Apparently the biggest story in the country has nothing to do with the day’s potential indictments, but with the corrupt Democratic Party. Here are some key terms to remember now: Fusion GPS, Uranium One, Hillary Clinton, dossier. 7:06: According to Kilmeade, the media is missing the big story surrounding the indictments. “The president has a different view on this, maybe you do too,” he say to his audience. “The big story is how do you even get this information.” Or, as this giant three-word question puts it: 7:07: We are currently reading the president’s tweets, and now Doocy is getting pretty riled up, too.“What he’s trying to do is ― he’s trying to shift the spotlight back to Hillary Clinton ...” Doocy says, “and suggest that the fact that she funded that the opposition research along with the [Democratic National Committee] was a sign that she was working with Russia.”He then adds, “There should be an investigation.”I can’t help but wonder: Why is the mainstream media ignoring this story? 7:08: 7:10: Earhardt is extremely angry about the leakers who disclosed late last week that indictments were coming in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election:Whoever leaked this indictment information that Mueller’s going to indict someone today ― whoever that leaker is, I don’t think they’re ever going to get caught. I think it’s just going to get brushed under the table just like everything else. None of these leakers are ever going to get caught.7:12: “Fox & Friends” is really fascinated by theoretical prospect of a Clinton-Russia investigation.7:17: A side-by-side of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Clinton appears on the screen. Should there be an investigation? “Fox & Friends” is simply asking the questions other networks are too scared to bring up. Just kidding: They know there should be. “The left continues to dismiss the Fusion GPS dossier as opposition research while denying any knowledge of its connection to the DNC, but we know it’s a fact,” Kilmeade says. 7:18: “Fox & Friends” have brought on a like-minded thinker who also cares only for the facts and not for any partisan agenda ― former Trump campaign senior adviser Michael Caputo. Are we talking about the potential indictments against Trump’s former campaign chairman yet? No we are not. We are talking about Clinton.“It went from being desktop research into Donald Trump’s businesses and apparently many other candidates’ to being a dossier put together by spies. It sounds like a lot of collusion to me,” Caputo says. Kilmeade is flabbergasted and disturbed: “What do you mean? Collusion with the Russians and with Fusion GPS and the Clinton campaign??”7:24: Apparently some dad got dressed up and looked like a member of ISIS or something. 7:25: Our heroes are getting in some attacks on NFL players who are taking a knee before games to bring attention to police mistreatment of people of color. “These players who are kneeling during the anthem, they’re taking out their anger about other issues on veterans and on the flag,” Earhardt says with horror in her voice. 7:29: OK, that was a nice break. Are we getting back to the potential indictment against Trump’s former campaign chairman?No, we are talking about a New York Post article that argued millennials should not be getting as excited as they do about Halloween costumes. The hosts ask former “Superman” actor Dean Cain for his opinion.Cain said he doesn’t really care if adults dress up, but does have an issue with political correctness run amok.“My biggest problem with what they’re doing with Halloween now is the cultural appropriation police,” he says. Kilmeade violently rolls his eyes into the back of his head in agreement. 7:33: During a segment about Google creating a cheeseburger with the cheese below the meat, Doocy jokes that the company’s employees should have just Googled where the cheese goes on a cheeseburger. It’s clear he absolutely loves this joke. Also, for some inexplicable reason, Kilmeade blurts out, “As you know, we’re American, we don’t care about other countries.” (This is a joke, I believe.)7:36: Indictments? No, it’s time to rip on two Trump critics ― Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). Doocy jokes about Kasich “getting Trumped” when they competed for the Republican presidential nomination. Earhardt throws out a comment about how Americans are “done with the swamp.” Kilmeade says Corker needs to “up the charisma level.” Roasted. 7:41: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway is here!It sounds like they are finally going to actually get into the Mueller stuff a bit more. Doocy starts us off with an introduction about the potential indictments that is not at all leading in its wording. “We know this because ― because somebody blabbed to CNN. Somebody leaked that; that may or may not be a crime. What are your thoughts?” Doocy asks.After quickly noting that this whole Mueller thing is a giant hoax perpetrated by the left, Conway is off to the races. She talks about the Clinton campaign and the Russian dossier before saying that the former secretary of state tried to destroy the American health care system 25 years ago when she was first lady. Then Conway complains that Clinton “just won’t go away,” which seems strange because she brought her up in the first place, but whatever. 7:44: A confused Earhardt interjects with an innocent, totally not biased question.“Why isn’t Hillary or her campaign and the DNC ― why aren’t they getting investigated for the Uranium One deal or for Fusion GPS, the dossier?”A patient Conway explains, “Because most people who would be doing the investigating slash covering the said investigation, Ainsley, voted for her and neither expected nor wanted the election results.” Good enough for Earhardt ― she’s convinced.7:47: The hosts flash some polling data showing that many people are frustrated with the tax system, for which Conway thanks them. “These numbers are so much more important than the silly approval ratings,” Conway says, before launching into a monologue about consumer confidence, Dow Jones highs and the like.Eventually Kilmeade seems to get bored and breaks in to ask about Fusion GPS and whether Conway thinks Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) ― the former DNC chairwoman ― is a liar. Then they return to the Mueller probe, something Conway says she and the president “hardly discuss.” “I don’t remember the last time I discussed this with the president,” she adds. 8:01:  Conway is gone, and we’re finally getting some real news! It’s confirmed: Manafort and longtime associate Rick Gates are being charged and are going to surrender to federal authorities. 8:03: Doocy is reading The New York Times story on the indictments off his phone.8:04: Kilmeade doesn’t look pleased. “The big question” surrounding Manafort, Kilmeade says, is whether the alleged crimes “happened during his months with President Trump.”8:06: Kilmeade looks like he’s about to punch someone. “Keep in mind, and I just keep saying this,” Kilmeade says, “just because you’re indicted doesn’t mean you’re guilty of anything! Then you have a chance to find out what they have and you mount a defense. Now you can start defending yourself.” 8:07: We’re reading Trump tweets again.8:08: Wait, they’re already re-running the interview with Conway? She was just on like 15 minutes ago! Nevertheless, here she is again saying journalists and investigators have a pro-Hillary bias. Then, back to the Democrats and the dossier. “Democrats say it doesn’t matter who paid for the dossier, because… it was them!” Kilmeade chirps. 8:24: Uhhhhhhhhhhhh ...8:25: Apparently someone at The Economist wrote a piece saying that “America’s love affair with uniformed men is problematic” and everyone is super pissed, especially Fox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, who calls this part of a larger “effort by the left” to bring down our “last standing institution.” (The magazine characterizes itself as “in the radical centre.”)Campos-Duffy then launches into a questionable attack on the Obama administration. The topic involves the celebrations of U.S. troops at NFL games ― planes flying overhead, etc. “It’s a great recruitment tool,” she says of the celebrations. “It also makes us feel warm and fuzzy. That’s the sound of freedom.”But, she adds, “Under the Obama administration, they made it harder to do those kind of flyovers on football games. So listen: This is part of a concerted effort.”Sorry to note this, but it was Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) who led the push against what came to be called “paid patriotism.” And the reason they were against it was because the Defense Department was using taxpayer dollars to pay the NFL to honor the troops.Anyway, then there’s an obligatory back-and-forth about how the investigation into Trump’s potential collusion with the Russians is ridiculous, and Campos-Duffy signs off.8:32: Manafort has turned himself in! Celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz is in the studio explaining that “Manafort is the first domino,” and that Mueller will probably try to use the indictment to get leverage to see what he knows about any potential collusion with the Russians. When Doocy says that White House lawyer Ty Cobb has already said that Manafort has no information on that, Dershowitz calls that “wishful thinking” and Doocy gets quiet and looks a little scared. 8:41: The Google cheeseburger is back, and Doocy has made the same joke about Googling where to put the cheese on a cheeseburger. Please kill me. 8:47: Correspondent Jenkins is back to help provide some context from the field. “Remember,” Jenkins says, “the fact that we’re following this play out right now in real time came because of a leak which could have potentially broken the law.”9:00: Well, it’s been two hours, and I think I have a pretty good handle on the Manafort and Gates indictments: Hillary Clinton is the problem, the leakers need to be locked up, Donald Trump is a victim, the left is conspiring to ruin the country and no one is paying nearly enough attention to the scandal surrounding Fusion GPS and Uranium One. Any questions? Didn’t think so."

But they can be just as dangerous and are far less regulated.By Jen FifieldThis story was a collaboration between Stateline and The Boston Globe.It was a brisk fall day in Nashua, New Hampshire — tailor-made for apple-picking and scarecrow-making at the Halloween festival at Sullivan Farm. When a hayride dropped Danielle Rogers and her family near a colorful bounce house, her 3-year-old son, Joseph, and the 2-year-old son of a family friend climbed inside. Then came a gust of wind and, as Rogers screamed, the inflatable house lifted off the ground. She grabbed the rope attached to the corner, but the wind yanked it from her hands. The bounce house, and the boys, went sailing high into the October sky, like a giant balloon — severely injuring the two boys. Inflatable attractions like bounce houses, obstacle courses and slides, which have increased in popularity in recent decades, may seem less ominous than roller coasters that flip riders upside down or carnival rides that send thrill-seekers whirling through the open air. But they can be just as dangerous and they are far less regulated. The estimated number of injuries on the attractions soared from 5,311 in 2003 to 17,377 in 2013, according to a Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) report analyzing U.S. hospital records. A Stateline analysis found that the trend continues, with an estimated 20,700 injuries last year. Only half of states — including New Hampshire — have regulations governing permits, inspections and insurance. But even where rules are in place, a Stateline investigation found major shortcomings. In several states that require all inflatables to be permitted, dozens of companies advertise inflatable rentals online, but do not have permits on file with the state. That means the state has no way of knowing if they have been properly inspected or are insured. Few states scout for events where inflatables will be set up, or search online for company listings. When they find illegal operators, states rarely issue fines or fees. And in a few states, the regulating agencies don’t have the authority to punish operators, even if they wanted to. In addition, state laws about amusement rides are often unclear, leaving operators unsure about whether inflatables are regulated and what the penalties are for those who don’t follow the rules. In many of the states that regulate inflatables, officials say that they try the best they can. But some admit it’s hard to manage. “It’s difficult sometimes because [operators] come and go quickly,” said Denise Oxley, general counsel of the Department of Labor in Arkansas. “Unless they set up at a local fair or event, or they open a little play place for kids, it’s hard to catch.” Even if the laws were better enforced, though, it wouldn’t solve the safety issues that plague the industry, according to interviews with state officials, inspectors, insurance agents and operators.Most injuries occur, they say, because operators are careless during setup, children aren’t supervised, and guidelines for safe play aren’t followed. But state laws focus on insurance and annual inspections — not on training for operators or rules on supervision.‘Like a Lawn Dart’ In New Hampshire, a state investigation found that the Nashua bounce house wasn’t staked down when the boys climbed in it that day in 2014. What happened next, when the wind came up, is detailed in a legal complaint filed by one of the boys’ parents. The house sailed over a fence, higher than a nearby barn. It was about 50 feet in the air when, with the boys still inside, it flipped over and shot to the ground “like a lawn dart,” the complaint said. Gary Bergeron, the owner of Rickety Ranch, an animal sanctuary on Sullivan Farm, had bought the bounce house just days before from a man living down the road, according to Nashua Police Department records. It cost him $1,500 and was at least 12 years old. Bergeron, at the time a licensed amusement ride inspector for the state, told police he inspected the bounce house and found several problems, including missing stakes. So he said he moved it to a fenced-off part of the farm, and put two haystacks in front of it to block it off. He blew it up to let it dry, he said, not because he intended it to be used. But witnesses, including farm visitors and volunteers, later told police that the bounce house wasn’t behind a fence, and wasn’t blocked off. And, police found, the bounce house had been advertised as a feature of the event: An ad on a local website invited the whole family to “jump in the jumpy house.” Bergeron, who organized the festival as a fundraiser for Rickety Ranch, declined to comment. He denies any fault or wrongdoing, according to civil court records. He was also criminally charged in June 2015 with failing to register the inflatable and not having it properly inspected. Bergeron pleaded no contest. Like New Hampshire, about half the states that regulate inflatables require them to be registered and inspected before being used at a public event. Other states regulate inflatables no matter where they are set up, including when they are rented out to private birthday parties and company events. No matter the laws, some business owners find ways around them. They cross state lines for a weekend fair without getting a permit, or change their business name or phone number to avoid detection, according to state officials. In states that attempt to regulate all inflatables, it can be hard for regulators to keep up. An online search in some of those states found dozens of operators without permits: 24 in Arkansas, 30 in New Mexico, 36 in Tennessee, and 90 in Texas. In New Hampshire, Briggs Lockwood, chief of tramway and amusement ride safety, says there are likely to be businesses the state doesn’t know about, but he “would have no idea really how big the problem is.” In fact, to assess the problem, many states have relied on help from competitors — inflatable operators dropping a dime on those operating without permits. This can lead to a cat-and-mouse game. Operators wait until the state inspector leaves before setting up, then another operator calls the inspector and tells him to come back, said Rob Gavel, the program manager for Maryland’s safety inspection unit. Tennessee has a reporting system on its website that allows people to report a company operating an amusement ride without a permit. The site also lists at least 18 inflatable companies that are currently advertising their services online but do not have permits. Stateline found 22 more. Mangled Mound of Vinyl In Nashua, Rogers and the other parents rushed to recover their children from the mangled mound of vinyl on the ground.Rogers’ son, Joseph Suomala, had several broken bones. Aayden Vogel, the younger boy, was far worse off. He was unconscious and not breathing with signs of a traumatic brain injury, according to the complaint. Joseph went to a local hospital by ambulance, Aayden to a trauma center by helicopter.Both boys survived but since 2000, at least four people died in U.S. accidents related to inflatables, according to Patty Davis, a CPSC spokeswoman. In the same time period, at least 18 people have died on other types of amusement rides and attractions. “Participatory” attractions — such as inflatables, go-karts and trampoline parks, in which people have greater control over their own movement — have significantly higher injury rates than other amusement attractions, said Kathy Fackler, president of the nonprofit Saferparks, which tracks amusement ride injuries and advocates for tougher safety standards. “Some of that you can mitigate as a parent or participant,” Fackler said. “But maybe not all of it.”The number of injuries on inflatables started to soar after 2008, according to the CPSC and an analysis of its data by the Child Injury Prevention Alliance. The trend can be explained in part by the 2008-09 recession, said Larry Cossio, who owns a national insurance agency that specializes in inflatables. As people lost their jobs, they looked for an easy way to make money, he said. Inflatables can be purchased online for as little as $1,000. All those people entering the industry without training or experience made injuries much more likely, Cossio said.Flyaway accidents like the one in New Hampshire remain rare. But they often receive a lot of attention and give the industry a black eye, said Kevin Baldree, owner of Austin Moonwalks, a permitted inflatables business in Texas. Other types of accidents are much more common, such as when children play rough and injure themselves or fall off the devices onto a hard surface, according to a Stateline review of injuries reported to states and of the CPSC’s injury database. The most common injuries include sprained ankles, broken arms and legs, concussions and strained or sprained necks.Hoping to prevent some of these injuries, a group of manufacturers, operators and regulators are updating industry guidelines to be much more specific and reinforcing the importance of proper setup, supervision and training, Fackler said. The guidelines will be finalized by ASTM International, which sets standards for thousands of devices.Supervision can do a lot to prevent these injuries, Baldree said, but parents often don’t watch their children.“They call that the ‘inflatable babysitter syndrome,’ ” he said. “The mom orders a bounce house and calls her friends, and then they go drink margaritas and not watch the kids all day.” Cost of Doing BusinessMany inflatable operators, such as Steve Rothenberg, owner of an amusement company in Maryland called Talk of the Town, say they support reasonable state regulations. Without them, “it would be a free-for-all,” Rothenberg said.But operators and insurance agents say the laws as they are currently enforced don’t keep children from being injured.Instead, operators say, they create an uneven playing field by increasing costs for operators who follow the rules. States often charge permit or inspection fees, ranging from $10 to $280 a year. And insurance can cost another $1,500 or more a year for each attraction, Cossio said. State officials say small businesses sometimes choose to shut down once they find out about those costs. For larger businesses, which are more likely to follow the rules, the costs add up. Ohio charges $255 each year for a permit and inspection. UltraSound Special Events, an entertainment company in the state, has about 40 inflatables, and pays about $11,000 just to stay in compliance, said Kevin Weiging, the company’s owner.These costs ultimately fall to the customer, who may choose another company to save a few dollars, Weiging said, “so you’re not only paying the fees, you’re also losing the business.”Instead, operators say states should focus on training. In Pennsylvania, operators can inspect their own attractions after they pass a test and get a permit. Many of them choose to do so — the state has about 1,300 certified inspectors. After that, they need 16 hours of continuing education every three years.The state audits the inspections every once in a while, and doesn’t see many problems, said Walt Remmert, director of the state’s bureau of ride and measurement standards.“If that’s their business, that’s their livelihood,” he said. “They have every reason to comply.” No Authority to PunishIn 2015, Bergeron was found guilty of not registering the bounce house and not having it properly inspected. New Hampshire fined him $2,480, with half of the payment suspended for a year of good behavior. Few states issue fines or fees to illegal operators, or take them to court.When state officials find businesses operating inflatables without permits, they are likely to shut them down on the spot if they don’t comply, or issue a sternly worded violation letter. If officials find they continue to operate, they issue additional verbal or written warnings. But punishment often stops there.New Jersey is among the strictest. State officials often issue fines when they find operators without permits or insurance, said Mike Baier, acting chief of the state’s bureau of code services. The fines can be up to $5,000. State officials have even gone as far as wage garnishment, Baier said.New Mexico amusement officials want more enforcement power, said Alex Sanchez, deputy superintendent of the state’s regulation and licensing department. The department advocated for a bill this year that would have made it clearer that inflatables are regulated in the state, and would have allowed the department to take legal action against operators. The bill didn’t pass; Sanchez said there was disagreement about whether to include rock climbing walls and centers. In Texas, the Department of Insurance, which regulates inflatables, doesn’t have the authority to fine operators or take them to court, said Jerry Hagins, a department spokesman.Baldree helped start the Texas Inflatable Operators Association in 2012 to push for stricter rules and strengthen state officials’ enforcement authority. Hagins said the state has increased its enforcement efforts since then. The state issued 960 noncompliance letters to amusement ride companies last fiscal year, up from 774 in fiscal 2014, according to a state report.But Baldree said he still sees illegal operators “on a day-to-day basis.”Claiming Negligence Aayden had to stay in the hospital for a month, relearning how to walk and talk, according to his parents’ court complaint. His severe brain injury left him with physical and mental disabilities, the complaint also said, and his eyesight is likely to be permanently damaged. Aayden’s parents, Kattrina Morales and Robert Vogel, along with Rogers and Joseph’s father, Bryan Suomala, are suing the farm and the sanctuary, as well as Bergeron, his wife and stepson, and Katherine Williams, an owner of the farm. The boys’ parents, along with their lawyers, declined to comment. In the lawsuit, Aayden’s parents contend that Bergeron and the other parties were negligent in allowing an unsupervised, unsecured, defective, un-staked bounce house to be played in, and that their negligence resulted in Aayden’s injuries, as well as his “loss of enjoyment of life, and tremendous and ongoing medical and occupational costs.” Bergeron, his family and the ranch deny these charges, and Williams and Sullivan Farm deny all involvement with the accident.A jury trial is scheduled for January.Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"

But they can be just as dangerous and are far less regulated.By Jen FifieldThis story was a collaboration between Stateline and The Boston Globe.It was a brisk fall day in Nashua, New Hampshire — tailor-made for apple-picking and scarecrow-making at the Halloween festival at Sullivan Farm. When a hayride dropped Danielle Rogers and her family near a colorful bounce house, her 3-year-old son, Joseph, and the 2-year-old son of a family friend climbed inside. Then came a gust of wind and, as Rogers screamed, the inflatable house lifted off the ground. She grabbed the rope attached to the corner, but the wind yanked it from her hands. The bounce house, and the boys, went sailing high into the October sky, like a giant balloon — severely injuring the two boys. Inflatable attractions like bounce houses, obstacle courses and slides, which have increased in popularity in recent decades, may seem less ominous than roller coasters that flip riders upside down or carnival rides that send thrill-seekers whirling through the open air. But they can be just as dangerous and they are far less regulated. The estimated number of injuries on the attractions soared from 5,311 in 2003 to 17,377 in 2013, according to a Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) report analyzing U.S. hospital records. A Stateline analysis found that the trend continues, with an estimated 20,700 injuries last year. Only half of states — including New Hampshire — have regulations governing permits, inspections and insurance. But even where rules are in place, a Stateline investigation found major shortcomings. In several states that require all inflatables to be permitted, dozens of companies advertise inflatable rentals online, but do not have permits on file with the state. That means the state has no way of knowing if they have been properly inspected or are insured. Few states scout for events where inflatables will be set up, or search online for company listings. When they find illegal operators, states rarely issue fines or fees. And in a few states, the regulating agencies don’t have the authority to punish operators, even if they wanted to. In addition, state laws about amusement rides are often unclear, leaving operators unsure about whether inflatables are regulated and what the penalties are for those who don’t follow the rules. In many of the states that regulate inflatables, officials say that they try the best they can. But some admit it’s hard to manage. “It’s difficult sometimes because [operators] come and go quickly,” said Denise Oxley, general counsel of the Department of Labor in Arkansas. “Unless they set up at a local fair or event, or they open a little play place for kids, it’s hard to catch.” Even if the laws were better enforced, though, it wouldn’t solve the safety issues that plague the industry, according to interviews with state officials, inspectors, insurance agents and operators.Most injuries occur, they say, because operators are careless during setup, children aren’t supervised, and guidelines for safe play aren’t followed. But state laws focus on insurance and annual inspections — not on training for operators or rules on supervision.‘Like a Lawn Dart’ In New Hampshire, a state investigation found that the Nashua bounce house wasn’t staked down when the boys climbed in it that day in 2014. What happened next, when the wind came up, is detailed in a legal complaint filed by one of the boys’ parents. The house sailed over a fence, higher than a nearby barn. It was about 50 feet in the air when, with the boys still inside, it flipped over and shot to the ground “like a lawn dart,” the complaint said. Gary Bergeron, the owner of Rickety Ranch, an animal sanctuary on Sullivan Farm, had bought the bounce house just days before from a man living down the road, according to Nashua Police Department records. It cost him $1,500 and was at least 12 years old. Bergeron, at the time a licensed amusement ride inspector for the state, told police he inspected the bounce house and found several problems, including missing stakes. So he said he moved it to a fenced-off part of the farm, and put two haystacks in front of it to block it off. He blew it up to let it dry, he said, not because he intended it to be used. But witnesses, including farm visitors and volunteers, later told police that the bounce house wasn’t behind a fence, and wasn’t blocked off. And, police found, the bounce house had been advertised as a feature of the event: An ad on a local website invited the whole family to “jump in the jumpy house.” Bergeron, who organized the festival as a fundraiser for Rickety Ranch, declined to comment. He denies any fault or wrongdoing, according to civil court records. He was also criminally charged in June 2015 with failing to register the inflatable and not having it properly inspected. Bergeron pleaded no contest. Like New Hampshire, about half the states that regulate inflatables require them to be registered and inspected before being used at a public event. Other states regulate inflatables no matter where they are set up, including when they are rented out to private birthday parties and company events. No matter the laws, some business owners find ways around them. They cross state lines for a weekend fair without getting a permit, or change their business name or phone number to avoid detection, according to state officials. In states that attempt to regulate all inflatables, it can be hard for regulators to keep up. An online search in some of those states found dozens of operators without permits: 24 in Arkansas, 30 in New Mexico, 36 in Tennessee, and 90 in Texas. In New Hampshire, Briggs Lockwood, chief of tramway and amusement ride safety, says there are likely to be businesses the state doesn’t know about, but he “would have no idea really how big the problem is.” In fact, to assess the problem, many states have relied on help from competitors — inflatable operators dropping a dime on those operating without permits. This can lead to a cat-and-mouse game. Operators wait until the state inspector leaves before setting up, then another operator calls the inspector and tells him to come back, said Rob Gavel, the program manager for Maryland’s safety inspection unit. Tennessee has a reporting system on its website that allows people to report a company operating an amusement ride without a permit. The site also lists at least 18 inflatable companies that are currently advertising their services online but do not have permits. Stateline found 22 more. Mangled Mound of Vinyl In Nashua, Rogers and the other parents rushed to recover their children from the mangled mound of vinyl on the ground.Rogers’ son, Joseph Suomala, had several broken bones. Aayden Vogel, the younger boy, was far worse off. He was unconscious and not breathing with signs of a traumatic brain injury, according to the complaint. Joseph went to a local hospital by ambulance, Aayden to a trauma center by helicopter.Both boys survived but since 2000, at least four people died in U.S. accidents related to inflatables, according to Patty Davis, a CPSC spokeswoman. In the same time period, at least 18 people have died on other types of amusement rides and attractions. “Participatory” attractions — such as inflatables, go-karts and trampoline parks, in which people have greater control over their own movement — have significantly higher injury rates than other amusement attractions, said Kathy Fackler, president of the nonprofit Saferparks, which tracks amusement ride injuries and advocates for tougher safety standards. “Some of that you can mitigate as a parent or participant,” Fackler said. “But maybe not all of it.”The number of injuries on inflatables started to soar after 2008, according to the CPSC and an analysis of its data by the Child Injury Prevention Alliance. The trend can be explained in part by the 2008-09 recession, said Larry Cossio, who owns a national insurance agency that specializes in inflatables. As people lost their jobs, they looked for an easy way to make money, he said. Inflatables can be purchased online for as little as $1,000. All those people entering the industry without training or experience made injuries much more likely, Cossio said.Flyaway accidents like the one in New Hampshire remain rare. But they often receive a lot of attention and give the industry a black eye, said Kevin Baldree, owner of Austin Moonwalks, a permitted inflatables business in Texas. Other types of accidents are much more common, such as when children play rough and injure themselves or fall off the devices onto a hard surface, according to a Stateline review of injuries reported to states and of the CPSC’s injury database. The most common injuries include sprained ankles, broken arms and legs, concussions and strained or sprained necks.Hoping to prevent some of these injuries, a group of manufacturers, operators and regulators are updating industry guidelines to be much more specific and reinforcing the importance of proper setup, supervision and training, Fackler said. The guidelines will be finalized by ASTM International, which sets standards for thousands of devices.Supervision can do a lot to prevent these injuries, Baldree said, but parents often don’t watch their children.“They call that the ‘inflatable babysitter syndrome,’ ” he said. “The mom orders a bounce house and calls her friends, and then they go drink margaritas and not watch the kids all day.” Cost of Doing BusinessMany inflatable operators, such as Steve Rothenberg, owner of an amusement company in Maryland called Talk of the Town, say they support reasonable state regulations. Without them, “it would be a free-for-all,” Rothenberg said.But operators and insurance agents say the laws as they are currently enforced don’t keep children from being injured.Instead, operators say, they create an uneven playing field by increasing costs for operators who follow the rules. States often charge permit or inspection fees, ranging from $10 to $280 a year. And insurance can cost another $1,500 or more a year for each attraction, Cossio said. State officials say small businesses sometimes choose to shut down once they find out about those costs. For larger businesses, which are more likely to follow the rules, the costs add up. Ohio charges $255 each year for a permit and inspection. UltraSound Special Events, an entertainment company in the state, has about 40 inflatables, and pays about $11,000 just to stay in compliance, said Kevin Weiging, the company’s owner.These costs ultimately fall to the customer, who may choose another company to save a few dollars, Weiging said, “so you’re not only paying the fees, you’re also losing the business.”Instead, operators say states should focus on training. In Pennsylvania, operators can inspect their own attractions after they pass a test and get a permit. Many of them choose to do so — the state has about 1,300 certified inspectors. After that, they need 16 hours of continuing education every three years.The state audits the inspections every once in a while, and doesn’t see many problems, said Walt Remmert, director of the state’s bureau of ride and measurement standards.“If that’s their business, that’s their livelihood,” he said. “They have every reason to comply.” No Authority to PunishIn 2015, Bergeron was found guilty of not registering the bounce house and not having it properly inspected. New Hampshire fined him $2,480, with half of the payment suspended for a year of good behavior. Few states issue fines or fees to illegal operators, or take them to court.When state officials find businesses operating inflatables without permits, they are likely to shut them down on the spot if they don’t comply, or issue a sternly worded violation letter. If officials find they continue to operate, they issue additional verbal or written warnings. But punishment often stops there.New Jersey is among the strictest.

In 2010, an estimated 51,000 Kenyans died from AIDS, but that number has declined steadily to 36,000 in 2016. Kenya is now considered an HIV success story. The same is true in many other countries.But now a new epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising in low- and middle-income countries just as the world is starting to get a handle on communicable diseases, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The institute reports that the largest contributors to the loss of healthy life are now high blood pressure, smoking, high blood sugar and excess body weight.Dr. Samuel Mwenda, who knows a thing or two about both epidemics, believes there are lessons we have learned in the fight against communicable diseases that can be applied to NCDs. Mwenda is general secretary and CEO of the Christian Health Association of Kenya (CHAK), a network of Protestant health facilities in Kenya. CHAK supports 46,000 people living with HIV with antiretroviral therapy, representing about 9 percent of the total number of patients nationally.In 2015, CHAK turned its attention to NCDs: With the support of Novartis Access, it began offering a portfolio of 15 products to treat cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and breast cancer at a price to governments, NGOs and other institutional customers not to exceed $1 per treatment per month. Since then, Novartis Access has also started working in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Rwanda and Uganda.Here are 10 of the lessons Mwenda says CHAK and other organizations have learned from communicable disease that can also be applied to NCDs:1) Create partnerships: Partnerships are key. CHAK works with national and local governments, the private sector, academia, professional bodies and supply chain organizations.2) Mobilize people and increase awareness: We must highlight lifestyle issues such as exposure to smoking and poor diet just like we did with HIV, TB and malaria. Once people are aware, we must provide screening to identify those with high blood pressure and abnormal blood sugars.3) Refer patients: Once you have flagged people at risk, they have to be linked with health facilities where they can get further assessment, diagnosis and care and treatment.4) Make treatment available: It’s imperative to have a reliable source of treatment. People will come to facilities when they know there is good quality medication available.5) Foster psycho-social support: In diabetes, CHAK works with the Kenya Defeat Diabetes Association to mobilize people living with diabetes, helping them form groups for education, encouragement and advocacy.6) Work with faith groups and communities: In rolling out screening, CHAK links health facilities with churches and communities. This has helped CHAK reach many people at very little cost.7) Understand it’s a lifelong commitment: We need to commit to taking care of people their entire lives to ensure retention. As in HIV, this requires a lot of hard work in terms of following up to ensure that people come back for treatment.8) Train health providers: Lower level health cadres like nurses and clinical officers must be trained so they are able to handle diagnosis and treatment of NCDs.9) Emphasize integration: Those with communicable diseases are also more vulnerable to NCDs. For example, we have begun to screen for hypertension and cervical cancer in HIV programs.10) Prioritize data: It’s very important to maintain data so we can track the magnitude of the burden and also inform policy and advocate for allocation of resources.Similarly, Novartis’s work in malaria prompted the company to go into NCDs. “Our work in malaria gave us the experience where we could build on the lessons learned,” says Dr. Nathan Mulure, cluster head for Novartis Social Business for East and Southern Africa. “We brought out a product that was only reaching 100,000 treatments per year and increased that to 100 million treatments. We figured that kind of scaling gave us the experience we needed to try the same thing with NCDs.”“At ministries of health, I am often asked ‘Why are you doing this? What’s in it for Novartis? Are you sure you’re not hiding anything?’ and I always tell them ’There is nothing hidden. This is a social business model, with low profit, but high turnover, which will help the program to sustain itself over the long term. We hope that if it catches fire, then many more patients will be able to access high quality medicines at prices they can afford.”NOTE: This article was developed from a session at the 2017 Conference of Christian Connections for International Health on “Lessons from HIV and Malaria for Faith-Based Organizations in Africa’s Transition to Managing NCDs.”"

However, female spectators will likely be relegated to a “family” section that’s separate from male-only seating areas, The Associated Press reports.Women were allowed to enter the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh for the first time last month, for a one-off event celebrating the anniversary of the country’s founding, reports Reuters. They entered the stadium through a separate gate.“It is the first time I have come to the stadium and I feel like more of a Saudi citizen,” 25-year-old Sultana, who did not provide her last name, told Reuters at the event. “God willing, tomorrow women will be permitted bigger and better things like driving and travel.”Shortly after the anniversary event, the kingdom announced plans to lift its ban on female drivers, effective next June.“I’m just trying to hold back the tears,” 26-year-old Sara Althari told HuffPost last month after the announcement. “It’s been a long time coming. ... I’m full of hope and optimism and joy and very proud today to be a Saudi woman.”Under Saudi law, women still cannot mix freely with men, obtain a passport or leave the country without a male guardian’s permission. They also have to wear an abaya that covers their bodies down to their feet, among other rules.Prince Muhammed bin Salman has recently pushed to modernize Saudi Arabia and improve its image abroad, reports HuffPost’s Akbar Shahid Ahmed. Last week, critics of the country’s policies toward women expressed outrage after a robot named Sophia was granted Saudi citizenship, which awarded it more rights than women currently have, they said.“Saudi law doesn’t allow non-Muslims to get citizenship. Did Sophia convert to Islam?” Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, told Newsweek of the robot. “What is the religion of this Sophia and why isn’t she wearing hijab? If she applied for citizenship as a human she wouldn’t get it.”"
16,POLITICS,Obama's Overtime Reforms Aren't Dead Yet,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/overtime-reform-trump_us_59f7561ce4b09b5c256772ce,"Trump might make more workers eligible for overtime pay, just not as many as Obama envisioned.",2017-10-30,The Trump Justice Department suggested some overtime reform might still be on the table.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f75698180000051bdfcdb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Salaried employees who work crazy hours may get some relief from the Trump administration after all. The question is how many of them.On Monday, the Justice Department said it intends to appeal the decision that struck down President Barack Obama’s update to overtime regulations. The Trump administration plans to ask the court to sit on the case while the Labor Department “undertakes further rulemaking.” The move suggests that President Donald Trump, like his predecessor, may try to extend overtime protections to more workers ― but given the usual Republican wariness about boosting workers’ pay by government fiat, probably not nearly as many as Obama had in mind.Workers who are covered by overtime law must be paid time-and-a-half for any hours they work beyond 40 in a week. Over the decades, as nominal salaries rose, the percentage of Americans covered by overtime protections fell drastically. The Obama administration tried to reform the regulations so that an estimated 4 million additional salaried workers would be protected. Business groups sued, and the rules got bottled up in court.Trump’s election last year appeared to signal the death knell for overtime reform, leaving retail outlets, among others, free to order managers and other salaried workers to log very long hours for no extra pay. In its appeal, however, the Trump administration is trying to preserve the right to update the law the same way that Obama did ― by raising the “salary threshold,” the level below which all salaried workers are entitled to overtime pay, regardless of their job duties.Obama wanted to essentially double the threshold, from its current $23,660 per year to $47,476. It was an aggressive move: Millions of workers have salaries that fall between those two numbers. That’s why employers and their Republican allies were so fiercely opposed to Obama’s reforms.If Trump did try to raise the salary threshold, he would likely propose a number that is far more palatable to the business lobby than $47,476. During his confirmation hearing, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta floated the idea of $33,000. That would impact far fewer workers than Obama’s proposal, but the changes to the paychecks and schedules of those it did help could be significant.Unlike hourly workers, very few salaried employees in the U.S. currently receive overtime pay. It wasn’t always like that. In 1975, roughly 62 percent of salaried workers were guaranteed time-and-a-half when they worked more than 40 hours. Because the regulations haven’t been updated much over the years, that share has plummeted all the way to around 8 percent. And that makes it much cheaper for employers to heap extra demands on their salaried employees.But if the salary threshold were updated, those employers would have some tough decisions to make: either start paying certain workers more money or start keeping their hours in check. In theory, the workers would win either way, with bigger paychecks or more leisure time.Earlier this year, HuffPost spoke to Katie Donley, a restaurant manager in Ohio who regularly clocked 60 hours a week for a salary in the mid-$30,000s. As her bosses prepared for Obama’s reforms to go into effect, they had stopped requiring Donley to work late, which gave her more time with her children. But once the reforms were thrown into limbo, her hours started creeping back up.“I was never able to pick up my kids from school before,” Donley said. “It made a big difference to me. I don’t know how to describe it.”Trump could still ease her situation. It all depends on how many workers the president wants to help and how many employers he’s willing to inconvenience."

I always had this romantic vision of being one with the liquid nature of life’s changes. I took pride in being untethered, anchorless, a free spirit. A gypsy.I used to change jobs, a lot. If I was working in a town, and things got too heavy I would throw everything I had in my duffle bag and hitchhike somewhere else. This was back when hitchhiking was not so suicidal, or at least the danger was not so well documented. It was just an inexpensive way to travel, and a great way to meet people. Sometimes fantastic people, sometimes lonely people, sometimes strange people. Only once was it a troubling person. But, he was the exception, and probably not even dangerous, just friendless, and desperate for somebody to talk to, someone to listen.Even after we got married and had kids I changed jobs. We stayed in the same house, but when things got too strange, too tense, or too difficult, I found a new job. Finally, one day, my wife said, “You are an adult, you need to decide what you are going to do, and stick with it. Nobody expects you to be perfect.” She was right, I was almost forty years old, and I needed to stick with something. And she was right that most of my problem was the fear of failure.What if I couldn’t do the job? It was a question that always hung over me, haunted me. I don’t know if it was the fear of failing, or the fear of seeing all my co-workers look at me with such pained disappointment. “He just didn’t have what it took,” they would say, as they tossed a bouquet of flowers on my vocational grave. Their silent disapproval falling on the freshly turned dirt.People fail all the time. I was never perfect, never even close. Why did I spend so much time thinking of the worst thing that could happen? I guess there is a lot of comfort if you expect awful and end up with uncomfortable. “Well, it could be worse,” you can tell yourself, with a slight trace of sympathy, maybe even offer yourself a little encouragement. “You did well, considering.” Without considering anything. What does self-pitying sympathetic encouragement know about facts?Until recently I never bothered to think it might have been better. Now, I look back and realize all that time, all that running away, avoiding, and trying to escape was all an effort to avoid being who I was, what I was. I was never happy with me. What if, just once, I had stuck with something, had faced the difficult possibility that problems were part of life?I have had the same job for almost twenty years now. And make mistakes, a lot, and live through it. Everybody I work with makes mistakes, and we all get through it together. What if I had thought of this earlier? For the most part I do a good job, and have earned the respect of my co-workers.Writing is like that. I always wanted to write, but it is a painful thing, pouring your soul out and being ignored. Or even worse trying to be funny and falling flat. Being ignored is the ultimate insult to people who try to create. Nick Cave once sang “I thought of my friends who had died of exposure and remembered other ones who died from the lack of it.” And as a person who spends so much time writing and telling people about his writing and spreading the word about his writing, that little bit of lyrical knowledge is particularly haunting.But I have had some good times looking at things with my name attached, and it is a source of pride.Recently, I have been visited by the most troubling spirit of all. What if all that time, through all that running, all those evasive maneuvers, it wasn’t failure I was worried about, it was success? What if I couldn’t handle accomplishment? Who do you see about that?The Ozark Mountain Daredevils once sang “It don’t matter what is said, we can wake up from the dead and roll away the stone.” You can change, you can start over, you can reinvent yourself. While I am still learning to handle inclusion, still dealing with the perils of acceptance, I think it isn’t so bad. Life is still fluid. The motion mostly passes me by, I am not a rock, by any means, but I can bend without breaking. I can stay in one place, even if it gets a little uncomfortable.Today, I stand, an incomplete man, but a better person. I still have my ghosts, and I still worry about failure, and success. But I roll the dice and I face uncertainty, not bravely, but mostly upright. My life is not perfect, and if I had not spent so much time running from the realities everybody else faces routinely I would still only be me, a slightly different version probably, but I am happy with who I am. And I guess that is probably good enough.Since we have included so many musical references it only seems fitting to end with one. Here is a quote from the back of a Mothers of Invention album; “In twenty years we will probably all sit around and laugh about this. If there is anything left to set on.” I guess that about says it all, since my wife just bought me a new chair to write in.Previously published as ‘The Spectres of Failure and Success’ in Tim’s HEAD ABOVE WATER column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor some more great Wild Word essays see:On Speaking Our #MeToo Truths by Annie Mark-WestfallWhy Young Irish Women Are Marching for Choice by Lorna O’HaraThe Dirty Little Secrets of Parenting by Jami Ingledue"

The Lower Ninth Ward was devastated by the storm and remains a shadow of its former self. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f74c881800000706dfcd75.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Darryl Lorenzo WellingtonI remember.I remember because I will always love New Orleans. All the residents of the Gulf Coast, or anyone who loved New Orleans – and who was old enough to remember August 29th, 2005 – has mourned the day ever since. We remember the day Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Louisiana, creating untold calamity. Weeks afterward, images of black families screaming on rooftops filled television screens, as rising floodwaters threatened a watery death below.Katrina took the lives of almost 2,000 people, many poor and black.It is because the worst harm is always suffered by those struggling the most that makes Donald Trump’s statements and behavior after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico so unconscionable. Trump has displayed a mindboggling level of disrespect and lack of empathy toward poor Americans facing life-threatening hardships. Insofar as Trump feels frustrated because relief efforts in Puerto Rico failed to meet his expectation, his appropriate response as the President should have been deep sympathy and concern for the sufferers. Instead, his attitude since the category 4 hurricane struck Puerto Rico in mid- September has been to display annoyance –more than concern. His tweets and his language truly call into question his basic understanding of human decency. The majority of Puerto Ricans still lack electricity. Forty percent lack running water.  Health care and telephone and internet services are almost non-existent.Did Trump respond to the crisis in way that would lift spirits, during a time in which millions of the disenfranchised needed hope most of all? No. Trump lashed out against Puerto Rican political officials who issued pleas for expedited humanitarian assistance. It appeared that Trump’s disconnect from the suffering of the people couldn’t grow worse. Yet it did. When Trump finally visited the devastated island, his first public comments appeared disjointed. He ramblingly downplayed the death toll. “What is your death count so far? Seventeen?” he said, and he complained that the cost of the relief mission was throwing the national budget “out of whack.”Trumps’ lack of decorum led a former Puerto Rican Governor, Anibal Acevido, to lament “ He was laughing at us.” It is hard to know whether or not the president was “laughing” at Puerto Ricans when during the same press conference he scoffed that Hurricane Maria didn’t compare with “ a real catastrophe” like Katrina.Nobody who had personally experienced Katrina would downplay the terrible impact of any hurricane. The stories emerging from Puerto Rico sadly resemble the most horrific post-Katrina narrativesNew Orleans residents spent months grappling with the fact that the city lacked an adequate healthcare infrastructure after Katrina. Today Puerto Rico faces the same stressful and cruel situation. Heartbreaking stories show how residents struggle to find the care they desperately need, stories like that of  Jose L Cruz, who needs regular dialysis treatments. Hospital patients, such as Cruz, have had their treatment hours drastically reduced because of the electricity shortage. Hospitals in Puerto Rico have been described as operating on a “revolving door” policy.Trump’s words and attitude encouraged indifference by implying that life on the island right now “isn’t that bad.” Trump could at the very least have devoted his speech, and his actions to the single-minded goal of keeping the death toll as low as he claimed it was. He has not commented on the reality, that the death toll in Puerto Rico has risen. It now stands officially at 48 dead.The insinuation that impoverished people of color “want everything done for them” is a classic racist trope. We heard it during Katrina and we hear it now from white supremacist leaders who only seek to divide Americans from each other.Trump cavalierly brings up Katrina to suit his own convenience. But he doesn’t mention that Katrina was a man-made tragedy, where the death toll was extraordinary high because of the failure of the Gulf Coast levee system that was shoddily maintained by the federal government.Like any lover of New Orleans who remembers Katrina, I know that the hurricane displaced thousands who suffered losses so great they never recovered. Many were never able to return to the city.Puerto Rico faces similar challenges with infrastructe damages estimated at 40 billion dollars. The hurricane will probably gut the Puerto Rican economy, which was already struggling.No hurricane should be an opportunity to mock the poor. It is a sad moment when the President of the United States blatantly engages in poverty shaming, cynically directed against people of color.Darryl Lorenzo Wellington is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

It was special for us to come out on top.”Each team had their left-handed aces on the mound to start the pivotal fifth game of the best-of-seven series but both the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw and Astros’ Dallas Keuchel failed to produce the pitchers’ duel many had expected.By the time the final out was recorded in a game that had it all and kept the capacity crowd on their feet most of the way, the Dodgers and Astros had combined for a whopping seven home runs, including a trio of three-run blasts.The Astros, who lead the series 3-2, now have two chances in Los Angeles to win their first World Series championship since the inception of the franchise 55 years ago.“We knew going into this series, this is the best offensive ballclub that we were going to see all year. And they can slug you. They spoil pitches. They’re athletic. And credit to them,” said Dodges manager Dave Roberts. “But our guys did the same thing. They just got the hit when they needed.”After rallying back from four, three and one-run deficits, Houston finally pulled in front when Jose Altuve’s run-scoring double made it 9-8 just two batters after George Springer tied the game with a solo shot.Carlos Correa’s two-run homer before the inning was over stretched the Astros lead to three but Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager doubled in a run in the top of the eighth to pull his team to within 11-9.On a night when no lead was safe, the Astros fans remained a tense bunch even after Brian McCann’s eighth-inning homer gave the Astros their biggest lead of the night, 12-9.But the drama was only getting started as the Dodgers stormed back in the ninth compliments of Yasiel Puig’s two-run shot and a run-scoring single from Chris Taylor before sending it to extra innings.Kershaw, who enjoyed a pitching masterclass in the series opener, was locked in early but the wheels came off and by the time he left the game had allowed six runs and four hits with two strikeouts and three walks over 4-2/3 innings.Keuchel also had a rough night as he loaded the bases in the first before a Logan Forsythe single scored a pair. The Dodgers added another before the frame was done and Keuchel left the game after allowing four runs on five hits through 3-2/3 innings.“It’s hard to put into words all the twists and turns in that game, the emotion, doing it at home, in front of our home crowd,” said Astros manager A.J. Hinch.“Just exactly what you expect to come to the park with Keuchel and Kershaw pitching. Just a perfect setup game for a bunch of runs,” he added jokingly.Game Six is scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles where the Dodgers will send Rich Hill to the mound while the Astros will counter with Justin Verlander."
22,POLITICS,Manufacturing Lies,"Robert Kuttner, ColumnistColumnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/manufacturing-lies_us_59f69b43e4b03cd20b82792a,Donald Trump promises to make American manufacturing great again. Yet all of his policies would do just the opposite. America,2017-10-30,"The remnants of buildings stand on the grounds of the former U.S. Steel McDonald Works steel mill near Youngstown in Campbell, Ohio, U.S., on Tuesday, Dec. 1, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f69ee4140000ae528ca424.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump promises to make American manufacturing great again. Yet all of his policies would do just the opposite.America was going to get tough on NAFTA, right? The goal was to “rebalance” trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Well, a parade of corporate lobbyists demanding that we keep NAFTA has caused the administration to put off negotiations. If NAFTA is renegotiated, the changes will be mostly cosmetic. And anyway, NAFTA is only a small part of American manufacturing woes.If we were serious about restoring good blue-collar manufacturing jobs, what would it take? For starters, we’d need an industrial policy, something that both political parties have rejected as meddling with the market.One place where we actually have a modest industrial policy is at the Energy Department, where government spends $300 million a year supporting new technologies to help American companies compete in emerging industries such as solar energy and wind turbines. Oops, the Trump administration proposes to shut all of that down — too associated with Obama and who needs green industries when we have coal?If we were serious about manufacturing, we’d take a much harder line with China’s strategy of luring American industry to move to China with a combination of subsidized factories and cheap labor, with the proviso that U.S. companies share their trade secrets with Chinese “partners.” Where’s Trump on that? Nowhere — he foolishly thinks that if we tread lightly with China on trade issues, Beijing will help restrain the North Koreans.And if the U.S. were truly committed to state-of-the-art manufacturing, we would have a large-scale commitment to rebuild our out-of-date infrastructure. That would generate new technologies, as well as millions of made-in-America jobs.Trump has talked a good game on infrastructure, but no program has emerged. Why not? One reason is that Trump and the Republican Congress would rather give away on tax breaks for corporations and rich individuals the trillions that we need to modernize antiquated public systems.Trump’s sometimes adviser and sometimes nemesis Steve Bannon speaks of a new economic nationalism that would help bring good jobs back to America. He is recruiting challengers to contest the senate seats of Republicans who Bannon considers too corporate.But when you get down below the level of slogan, not a single one of the candidates who Bannon has talked about recruiting is serious about an industrial policy for America. All of them would prefer tax breaks for the rich to large scale spending on infrastructure. Even on NAFTA, where there are a handful of hawkish Republicans, the odds are that in the end the corporate wing of the Republican Party will prevail. A key question going forward is whether, and when, the people who voted for Trump will wake up and realize that he is screwing them. Scarcely a day goes by without a story that illustrates the disconnect between Trump’s policies and the interests of the people who support him. Last week, the Senate voted 51-to-50, with Vice President Pence breaking a tie, to overturn a consumer protection rule that prohibited binding arbitration in cases of a wide range of corporate consumer abuses, denying aggrieved citizens access to the courts. Nearly every Republican voted on the corporate side.Mark Twain famously observed that it’s easier to fool a person than to convince him that he’s been fooled. The next time Trump promises to restore the greatness of American manufacturing, take a close look at the details. If you still believe him, I have a (crumbling) bridge to sell you.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University’s Heller School.

Then it overtook a female cyclist, wearing a white top and cycling helmet, who responded by giving the middle finger. “The motorcade had to slow and the cyclist caught up, still offering the finger, before turning off in a different direction.”It’s unknown if Trump saw the cyclist.Last week, a man standing along the street in Washington when the Trump motorcade passed turned his back and dropped his drawers to offer a full “moon” salute to the president.It could be a trend. Trump’s approval rating has dropped 5 points since September to 38 percent, according to the latest poll by The Wall Street Journal-NBC News. That’s the lowest of his presidency and the worst for any modern president at this point. The survey found that 58 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s performance.Eight out of 10 Republicans still approve of Trump’s job performance, but his support from independents and even some of his core supporters is falling, the poll found.Trump performed best on his handling of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, with nearly 50 percent of those polled approving of his performance. Forty-two percent approve of how he’s handling the economy, according to the poll.As for the lone cyclist, her approval rating appears to be up. She was called a “she-ro” in one tweet.A Reddit user noted that heroes can come in many different guises — like a bike helmet."

At least we once did, before an incident involving Moore changed both my opinion of him and the direction of my life and career.On June 12, 2007, I flew across the country on a Michael Moore spy mission. My destination: Sacramento, California. That night, in the back row of a theater a few blocks from the state capitol, I watched the first U.S. screening of Moore’s latest movie, SiCKO. My assignment was to report back to my colleagues in Philadelphia about just how roughly Moore had treated our company, a big health insurer, in the film.It was worse than I had anticipated. Several of our customers told about being denied coverage for care they needed. I remember thinking that refuting their stories would not be easy. It was clear Moore had done his homework in a movie that, as Moore always does, takes the side of the “little guy.” And I knew from experience that the stories in SiCKO were legitimate.No one in the insurance industry knew before SiCKO’s world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival a few weeks earlier that we would be in Moore’s crosshairs. There were rumors for a while that SiCKO would be about the pharmaceutical industry. For my own sake, I hoped the rumors were true, but I couldn’t take any chances.In the months before Moore wrapped up filming, and long before SiCKO would open at more than 3,000 American theaters, my corporate communications team and I had prepared for an unannounced visit by Moore and his film crew. I conducted numerous media-training sessions with our CEO and other company officials. I was prepping them for a Moore specialty — the ambush interview. I supplied them with a couple of lines to use if they were ambushed, one I hoped would make it less likely they’d have a starring role in SiCKO: “Oh, you’re the Hollywood entertainer Michael Moore, aren’t you? I can’t talk to you because I’m running late for a meeting, but our spokesman can help you. Give Wendell Potter a call.”Between the Cannes and Sacramento screenings of SiCKO, several of my industry peers and I met in a day-long closed-door meeting in Philadelphia to finalize the details of a campaign our trade association and PR firm had developed to attack both Moore’s credibility and his patriotism. We wanted conservatives in particular to believe Moore was out of step with American values, and we wanted Democratic lawmakers to distance themselves from him.The timing of SiCKO’s release couldn’t have been worse for our industry. Our pollster had recently told us that a majority of Americans now believed the government should take on the responsibility of controlling the cost of health care and making sure everybody had access to it. There had been a significant shift in public opinion since his last poll. Insurers had never been popular, but most people had always assumed we were necessary. Now they were questioning that assumption. SiCKO, we worried, would lead to growing and widespread support for a single-payer health care system.At the Philadelphia meeting, my peers and I signed off on the campaign tactics we would use against Moore, one of which was the activation of an industry-funded front group that would be run out of the PR firm’s Washington office. The goal of the campaign was to not only to do harm to Moore’s reputation but to restore a specific fear that the American Medical Association, drug companies and insurers had instilled among Americans over many years. We needed to rekindle Americans’ fear of “government-run health care.”Sure enough, the day after the Sacramento screening and a rally held by single-payer advocates just before it, our PR firm activated the front group. This was its opening salvo:Health Care America, a non-partisan, nonprofit health care advocacy organization, released the following statement in response to a California rally held by Michael Moore and a variety of advocates in support of a government takeover of our health care system. The reality is that government-run health systems around the world are failing patients—forcing them to forgo treatments or seek out-of-pocket care in other countries.Another part of our strategy was focused on the Democrats in Congress that our industry had supported with campaign contributions. The message to them, to be delivered discretely by our lobbyists, was a warning: if you support Michael Moore, the industry will back your opponent next time.My involvement in that campaign contributed to what became a crisis of conscience. As I think back on it, there was one comment in particular at that Philadelphia meeting that triggered it. If we have to, the strategy leader said, “We’ll push Moore off the cliff.”That single sentence woke me up. It made me realize exactly what we were doing, and I was disgusted, especially with myself. I had been a journalist in my first career. I had always tried to be honest and truthful. I had never intentionally or maliciously slandered anyone. But here I was, part of a well-financed plan that might be doing exactly that. And we all agreed it was perfectly OK.After several months of soul searching I finally found the courage to tell my boss it was time for me to go. But I soon became convinced that quitting wasn’t all I needed to do. I felt compelled to try to make amends for all the times I was involved in efforts to mislead people to protect a profitable status quo.I testified before Congress several times during the debate on health care reform the following year. Then I decided to return to journalism to explain how corporations and other moneyed interests manipulate public opinion and influence both elections and public policy. As part of my amends-making, I even apologized to Moore during a live TV interview.Tarbell.org, the new journalism nonprofit my team and I are launching with a crowdfunding campaign, is, to a large extent, the latest of my amends-making efforts. It is without a doubt the biggest and boldest. Tarbell will expose corporate wrongdoing, spotlight solutions and, just as important, help people regain the power that a few others with far more money — and the influence it can buy — have stolen from them.In our own fair but pull-no-punches way, we at Tarbell will be doing what makes powerful people so mad at people like Michael Moore: speaking truth to their power. As our namesake, investigative reporter Ida Tarbell, did more than a century ago, we’ll aim to hold powerful corporations, which all too often now call the shots in Washington and our state capitals, much more accountable."

26,POLITICS,Kellyanne Conway Rips Campaigns That Seek Oppo Research From 'Foreign Nationals',Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kellyanne-conway-foreign-nationals_us_59f715fae4b07fdc5fbf6dc6,The White House counselor might want to have a chat with Donald Trump Jr.,2017-10-30,"Campaigns don't usually ""dig around with foreign nationals"" for oppo research, Kellyanne Conway said on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f768c61800003400d5a1f0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kellyanne Conway bashed political campaigns on Monday that “dig around with foreign nationals” to uncover dirt on their opponents. But three months ago, reports revealed President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign did just that.During an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” the White House counselor accused Hillary Clinton’s campaign of directly financing a secret dossier containing so far unverified allegations about Trump’s connections to Russia.When asked by Fox News’ Steve Doocy whether Trump’s campaign had financed opposition research during the 2016 election, Conway faltered.“Uh, so that’s very typical,” Conway said. “But let me just tell you something: You usually get that from publicly available information. You don’t go and dig around with foreign nationals.”Conway appeared to have forgotten all about that June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York between several members of Trump’s campaign and a Russian lawyer with ties to Kremlin officials.Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., set up the meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya under the impression he would receive damning information about Clinton.The younger Trump was told in an email from a “trusted intermediary” that Veselnitskaya would provide documents that “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” The information promised to be “very high level” and “part of Russia and its government’s support” of his father, the emailed noted.“If it’s what you say I love it,” Trump Jr. replied within minutes, “especially later in the summer.”Trump Jr. stood by his decision to agree to the meeting, which was also attended by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman at the time. (Manafort on Monday was indicted on several charges stemming from his close ties to pro-Russian officials in Ukraine, including “conspiracy against the U.S.”) “The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research,” Trump Jr. said in a statement the same day the Times published its report on the email exchange.“The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,” he continued, “And, as we have said, she had no information to provide ... To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue.”Trump defended his eldest son’s decision, calling Trump Jr. a “good boy” a few days later.But Conway apparently doesn’t see how any of this was relevant, since Trump Jr.’s meeting didn’t come up during her TV spot on Monday. She focused instead on Clinton’s alleged link to the Russia dossier, though she claimed she’s ready and willing to move onto other topics.She noted that Clinton has stayed in the news in part because of her book about the presidential campaign, “What Happened,” which Conway said is getting covered as if it’s “not fiction.”“Look, we would be happy to stop talking about Hillary Clinton and the campaign,” she said. “We dispensed with her a year ago, but she just won’t go away.”She might want to relay the message to her boss, who has tweeted about Clinton at least a dozen times this month alone."

The White House response is tried and untrue.,2017-10-30,"White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders walks from the lectern after Monday's White House press briefing, in which she said new indictments had nothing to do with the president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f7a2c9180000360ddfcee0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Mired by compromised credibility and reeling from newly revealed indictments, President Donald Trump and his White House reverted to form Monday, falsely claiming that the alleged criminal actions were completely unrelated to him.“Today’s announcement has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the president’s campaign or campaign activity,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.Republican media relations professionals were baffled by the approach.“The White House’s strategy is shameless, bald-faced, indefensible lies,” said Tim Miller, who ran communications for Jeb Bush’s Republican presidential campaign last year. “Lie about everything, admit nothing.”Rick Tyler, who worked for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in that GOP primary race, said he suspected Sanders was simply “reciting the answers” as she had been instructed. “It’s really amazing the degree to which they think everybody else is an idiot.”Sanders’ remarks came during the daily White House press briefing just hours after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and deputy campaign chairman Richard Gates were indicted on charges including money laundering.Trump quickly responded to that revelation with a statement issued via Twitter: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus????? Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”Yet both of his arguments were refuted within minutes when a guilty plea from a former campaign foreign policy adviser was revealed. In a 14-page document, George Papadopoulos admitted that he was in touch with Russians offering thousands of emails hacked from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign.In fact, those emails were stolen by Russian intelligence and distributed through the allied WikiLeaks group, according to a declassified report released in January by the U.S. intelligence community.Nevertheless, Sanders continued a pattern she and other White House allies stepped up a few weeks ago of claiming Trump was not working with Russians at all, rather that it was Clinton and the Democratic Party doing the colluding.Sanders’ proof: a “dossier” compiled by a former British spy on contract to an opposition research firm. Fusion GPS had initially been hired by a conservative website, but the work was continued after the GOP primaries ended, thanks to payments from Democrats.“There’s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence the election,” Sanders said.That Democrats paid for that research, though, does not prove that they were “colluding” with Russians. Further, while some of the more salacious material in the dossier, accusing Trump of unusual sexual behavior on a visit to Moscow, has not been verified, other parts of it have proved correct.Sanders’ falsehoods are the latest in a pattern of untruths from Trump and his White House that started on the day after his inauguration, when then-press secretary Sean Spicer berated the press corps for reporting accurately that the crowd gathered for Trump’s inauguration was significantly smaller than the one that witnessed President Barack Obama’s ceremony eight years earlier.Trump has also falsely claimed that Obama had been “wiretapping” him, that he had passed more legislation than just about any previous president and that the United States is the highest taxed nation in the world. Over the weekend, Trump claimed that the release of files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 had taken place “long ahead of schedule.” In fact, the deadline had been set by a law passed by Congress in 1992, and Trump actually wound up missing it by two days.Trump was never considered particularly honest by the electorate, but the string of repeated and easily disproved falsehoods appears to have taken its toll. A new Fox News survey found only 33 percent of Americans believe Trump to be honest and trustworthy, while 63 percent said he is not. And Monday’s Gallup daily tracking poll, released just as the news of the formal charges broke, showed Trump at 33 percent approval ― his lowest rating since taking office.Tyler said he cannot see how Trump and his team can now build trust, given how special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation is likely to get only more damaging to Trump. “I don’t know how they get themselves out of this. These are real indictments.”Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo, though, defended Sanders and said that the Clinton campaign’s role in pursuing the dossier was being suppressed by the media. “Sarah Sanders is doing a great job keeping the wolves at bay. I see the press as wolves,” Caputo said."

The sixth season will air in 2018.The news comes a day after “Star Trek: Discovery” actor Anthony Rapp accused “House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey of sexually harassing him at a party in 1986 when he was 14 years old and Spacey was 26.TVLine reports that the decision to cancel the show was made several months ago, however.Netflix and Media Rights Capital, which produces the series, released a joint statement on Monday regarding Spacey.“Media Rights Capital and Netflix are deeply troubled by last night’s news concerning Kevin Spacey,” the statement, provided to HuffPost, reads. “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”On Monday, Spacey responded to Rapp’s accusation with a statement on Twitter where he also came out as gay.Spacey also said in his statement that he did not recall the incident — citing time and alcohol as the reason — but offered an apology.“I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago,” Spacey wrote. “But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”Spacey has since been criticized for his statement, with many accusing him of using coming out as a “PR smokescreen,” and celebrities including George Takei speaking out.“Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight — that is a deflection,” Takei told The Hollywood Reporter. “They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.” "

For their first Halloween together, the parents and twins channeled the cast of “The Wizard of Oz” with costumes that included store-bought parts and homemade parts thrown together. “I dreamt this picture and it came out exactly as my dream,” Manny, who also edits the photos, told HuffPost. In 2016, the family took on “Game of Thrones.” Adelaide portrayed Daenerys Targaryen, and her dads and brother were her dragons. Manny explained why he enjoys having Adelaide as the main character of the group costumes. “I always want to make Adelaide the main character since she is the girl of the house so every year we think of our costumes around a strong female lead,” he said.Manny and Paul bought Augustus’ dragon costume and their dragon heads, but made the rest of the costumes, including their scaly outfits and Adelaide’s dress.“It took me about three months to make these costumes because I had to hand paint the dragons and let the paint dry so I could move onto the next body part,” Manny said. This Halloween, the family are taking it back a couple decades with costumes from “The Fifth Element.” Adelaide portrays Leeloo, while Manny and Paul are Diva Plavalaguna and Ruby Rhod, respectively. Augustus is Korben Dallas.Manny told HuffPost the costumes took about two months to put together and that specifically his Diva getup took “a lot of work and a lot of fail patterns.”“We made pretty much everything with the exception of Paul’s costume, which we pieced together from purchased components,” he said. “This was a very ambitious project since I didn’t have a clue how to make the costumes and have limited sewing experience.”Both Manny, who is a graphic designer, and Paul, who works in finance, had little experience with making clothes and other accessories before creating these costumes. Manny has learned through sewing tutorials and has relied on his creativity. Paul helps come up with ideas on how to construct certain pieces. “On my costume this year, he suggested to use tubes that are used to insulate air conditioners’ pipes and it actually worked,” Manny said. Because the kids are still young, they haven’t completely caught on to the intense costumes their dads put together. “I am going to milk this for as long as I can,” Manny joked. This year, though, the twins seemed a bit more interested during their annual Halloween photo shoot. “This year they were actually cooperating with the photo shoot,” Manny said. “Augustus was directing Adelaide how to pose. It was so cute.”"

37,WOMEN,Thousands Went To The Women’s Convention. And It Was Just What They Needed.,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thousands-went-to-the-womens-convention-and-it-was-just-what-they-needed_us_59f73167e4b077d8dfcb0db2,"The gathering was cause for celebration, sisterhood and a focus on 2018.",2017-10-30,"The convention included an ""art gallery"" with pieces curated by the design lab Amplifier. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f755d7140000610d8ca52b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DETROIT— The day after President Donald J. Trump took office last January, millions of people joined women’s marches around the world, setting attendance records and elevating expectations about what organized resistance to the ideals that gave rise to the 45th president could look like.Nine months later, the crowd gathered in Detroit for the inaugural Women’s Convention — which was put together by the same organizers — was a fraction of the size, but for the reported 4,000 attendees, that same energy was still there.“I was like, this is something I have to be a part of. This is somewhere I need to be,” Jennifer Onwenu, a 25-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, told HuffPost. “The women that I have met, the lessons I have learned to take back to my community as far as organizing and mobilizing people, have been so useful.”“It’s a national women’s conference in Detroit. Why wouldn’t I be here?” echoed Deborah Bunklay, 63, also from Detroit. Bunklay received a scholarship to the convention, covering the nearly $300 cost of a three-day ticket. She and her friend, Cheryl Bukoff, 72, said they were particularly struck by the diversity of the gathering. A heterogenous crowd of women — and a few men — networked under soaring banners that declared they were “reclaiming our time.” “One of the the things I think is most important is that there are many younger women here, and that for many of us have been active for a long time, we know we need to have the young women taking leadership,” Bukoff said. “I’d be glad to support any of them.”Over three days, attendees listened to panels like, “94 percent voted against Trump: following black women in 2018” and “How to organize a protest/rally in less than 24 hours!” EMILY’s List, the group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, hosted a free half-day training for those interested in running for local elections. Indeed, much of the convention focused on the goal of Democrats gaining ground in the 2018 midterm elections.There were also addresses from public figures such as Rose McGowan, who spoke publicly for the first time since accusing Harvey Weinstein of rape, and fiery speeches from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), both of whom have been floated as potential presidential candidates. Both Congresswomen were met with standing ovations and raucous cheers. On Saturday, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) led an enthusiastic crowd in chants of “Impeach 45!” and told cheering attendees how thrilled she had been to march with them last winter.But several women HuffPost spoke to said they had not marched. They felt driven to go to the Women’s Convention because they wanted to join what organizers have taken pains to paint as an ongoing movement, rather than a one-time event.“I feel like I really missed a lot,” said Zitlatlli Roman, 27, from Illinois who was sponsored to go to the convention. “It’s just very inspirational to be able to be a part of it from now on.”Another attendee wore a Wonder Woman T-shirt and a pink “pussy hat” covered in feminist pins that she’d made specifically for warmer weather. Her “winter pussy hat” was too warm.Whether or not the convention is considered a success is largely a matter of spin and perspective. News outlets have called it a “test” of the movement that grew out of last winter’s marches, and it is not certain whether organizers met the ticket sales goals they’d initially set forth.But at the Cobo Center, where the mood was frequently jubilant, it was clear that many attendees got exactly the kind of camaraderie they had come for. “Overwhelmingly what I heard was, ‘Your voice counts,’” said Susan Slattery, 68, of Detroit. “After everything that’s happened, it still counts and we still have to keep fighting.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized who sponsored Roman’s attendance.

The new comes just days after a CNN report Wednesday detailed five women’s sexual harassment allegations against Halperin during his time at ABC News over 20 years ago.The women’s accounts ranged from Halperin propositioning them for sex to nonconsensual groping. At least 7 other women have come forward with harassment or assault allegations against him since Wednesday.Halperin, 52, apologized Friday for the “pain and anguish” caused by any of his past actions in a statement posted to Twitter.“The world is now publicly acknowledging what so many have long known: Men harm women in the workplace,” Halperin said in his statement. “For a long time at ABC News, I was part of the problem. ”Halperin worked at ABC News for almost two decades, becoming the political director in 1997 before leaving the network as a political analyst in 2007. He worked as an editor at large for Time magazine for a few years before being hired by MSNBC as a senior political analyst in 2011. He also worked for Bloomberg News during the 2016 presidential campaign.In 2010, he co-wrote the best-seller Game Change about the 2008 presidential election, which was made into an HBO movie. Penguin Press announced on Thursday that it had cancelled plans to publish a book Halperin was co-authoring on last year’s race. HBO also dropped plans to pursue a miniseries tied to the new book.Halperin was a frequent contributor on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Co-host Mika Brzezinski addressed the sexual harassment allegations against Halperin on Friday.“We want to know more about these disturbing allegations,” said Brzezinski, who co-hosts the show with fiancee Joe Scarborough. “We want to know the stories. We need to know what happened. And we’re not going to avoid the story just because he is our friend.”“We are at a pivotal moment in history where unacceptable harassing behavior toward women will no longer be swept under the rug,” she said.This article has been updated with background on Halperin and comments by Brzezinski."
39,POLITICS,Progressive Canadian Leader: Justin Trudeau Should ‘Stand Up’ To Donald Trump,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jagmeet-singh-justin-trudeau-should-stand-up-to-donald-trump_us_59f63f4fe4b07fdc5fbecde8,"Jagmeet Singh, leader of Canada's New Democratic Party, achieved international fame for how he handled a racist heckler at a town hall.",2017-10-29,Jagmeet Singh celebrates his win as leader of the New Democratic Party on Oct. 1. 2017.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f6413b140000ae528ca3ab.jpeg?cache=Hhp9FPugAz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TORONTO ― The leader of Canada’s most left-wing political party vowed to stand up to President Donald Trump if elected prime minister and called on current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to do the same.“I believe that you have to stand up to a bully. You can’t back down from a bully ― that’s what they want you to do,” Jagmeet Singh, the recently elected leader of the New Democratic Party told HuffPost following Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ speech on health care at the University of Toronto.Asked whether he believes that Prime Minister Trudeau, leader of the center-left Liberal Party, has done an adequate job standing up to Trump, Singh said, “I don’t think so.”“He could be stronger. He could stand up,” Singh said.Trudeau has developed a close working relationship with the U.S. president since Trump took office in January, notwithstanding their major disagreements on issues like trade and immigrant rights. Trump appeared to get along well with Trudeau during the prime minister’s first visit to Washington, D.C., under the new presidency in February. Trudeau returned for renegotiation talks earlier this month among the U.S., Canada and Mexico on the North American Free Trade Agreement.Trudeau praised Trump in June as someone who “knows how to interact socially on a very effective level.”“I’ve always found that whenever he has made an engagement to me or a commitment to me on the phone or in person, he has followed through on that,” Trudeau said. “And that’s someone you can work with.”Singh was elected head of the New Democratic Party, or NDP, Canada’s most left-wing major party, on Oct. 1. If Singh remains leader of his party in two years, he will run for prime minister against Trudeau and the Conservative Party leader, a post currently held by Andrew Scheer. The next national elections are on Oct. 21, 2019.Singh, a 38-year-old criminal defense attorney and member of Ontario’s provincial parliament, rose to international fame thanks to a viral video capturing him patiently reasoning with a xenophobic heckler at a town hall meeting. In September, Singh, who is a practicing Sikh, was holding one of his “JagMeet and Greet” community forums in the Toronto suburb of Brampton when a woman began interrupting the event with anti-Muslim vitriol directed at Singh. (Practicing Sikh men, who typically wear turbans and grow large beards, are often subject to Islamophobic hate crimes and other prejudice based on the uninformed perception that they are Muslim.) Singh encouraged the audience to chant “love and courage” to drown out her yells.“We welcome you. We love you. We support you, and we love you,” he told the woman. Even as he declared Sunday that he would adopt a confrontational stance toward Trump as prime minister, Singh advised Americans concerned about rising xenophobia and other forms of bias under Trump’s leadership to emulate the high-road approach he modeled at the town hall. “We all need love and courage to tackle the issues of the day, to keep that love in your heart, that we’re all connected, we’re all in this together, and it requires courage for us to demand better, dream bigger and fight for a better world,” he told HuffPost. “That love and courage is a big part of why I do what I do, and I think that will motivate other people as well.”Sen. Sanders arrived in Toronto on Saturday for a two-day tour of Canada’s publicly financed health care system. The trip was aimed at learning about its successes and challenges as he continues his push for the United States to adopt a similar system. On Saturday, Sanders visited several hospitals in downtown Toronto alongside Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne of the Liberal Party, several American medical professionals and Canadian physicians and health care advocates. Wynne introduced Sanders on Sunday ahead of his speech to an audience of over 1,000 people, most of them University of Toronto students.But in keeping with its role as the most ardent proponent of universal health care in Canadian history, the NDP got its fair share of the limelight.In his speech, Sanders sang the praises of Tommy Douglas, who was the first leader of the NDP and is credited as the forefather of Canada’s national health care system. The party is now fighting for universal coverage of pharmaceutical drugs, which the government does not guarantee across the board, as well as dental care, which is entirely private. (Wynne said she also supports universal pharmaceutical coverage, and has overseen the expansion of Ontario’s health insurance program to cover pharmaceutical drugs for all provincial residents from birth through age 24, which will take effect in January.)And aside from Sanders, Singh was clearly a crowd favorite, drawing raucous applause when he entered the room and took his seat in the front row. Speaking after Sanders, Ed Broadbent, who led the NDP from 1975 to 1989, gave Singh a shout-out.A bill the NDP introduced in parliament that would provide universal pharmaceutical coverage, Broadbent noted, “didn’t pass, but I can tell you the struggle for it will continue.”“And I also want you to know that it pleases me a lot that the man who will lead that battle is Jagmeet Singh,” he added. The applause at the mention of Singh’s name was so loud that he stood up and waved to acknowledge the ovation.Singh met with Sanders on Sunday morning prior to his speech, a conversation Singh described as “awesome.” He asked Sanders what motivated him to fight so hard for universal health care.“He just said, ‘It makes sense.’ Health should be a human right,” Singh recalled. “And I was really touched by that. I think it’s absolutely true. It’s something that the New Democrats believe as well. It’s something I really believe in.”Correction: An earlier version of this story referred to the New Democratic Party as the National Democratic Party."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f5f6fd140000610d8ca34d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BARCELONA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain filled Barcelona’s streets on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country’s worst political crisis in four decades.Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.Spain’s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly’s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties.The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing “Viva España”, protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis ― underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.“I’m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,” said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.“Knowing that in the end there won’t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they’ve driven through Catalan society.”SLIGHT UNIONIST LEADThe poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo, which opposes independence, showed anti-independence parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia.Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the Dec. 21 election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.DAMAGE TO CATALONIAPuigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d’Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would.With weeks still to go before that date, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two parties would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed.In a speech at Sunday’s unity rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for voters to turn out en masse in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.“Maybe we’re here because many of us during elections didn’t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,” Borrell said to cheering crowds.DAMAGE TO CATALONIAPuigdemont, speaking from the Catalan nationalist stronghold of Girona on Saturday, called for peaceful opposition to Madrid’s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control.European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain’s unity.But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d’Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday.But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos’ chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted.The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central government and to mount “peaceful resistance”, while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike.Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation.The chaos has also prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments.European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

Some MPs were barricaded in their offices on Sunday evening.In a televised address, his first since Iraqi forces launched a surprise offensive to recapture Kurdish-held territory on Oct. 16, Barzani confirmed that he would not extend his presidential term after Nov. 1 “under any conditions”.“I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence,” said Barzani, who has campaigned for Kurdish self-determination for nearly four decades.The address followed a letter he sent to parliament in which he asked members to take measures to fill the resulting power vacuum.The region’s parliament met in the Kurdish capital Erbil on Sunday to discuss the letter. A majority of 70 Kurdish MPs voted to accept Barzani’s request and 23 opposed it, Kurdish TV channels Rudaw and Kurdistan 24 said.Demonstrators, some carrying clubs and guns, stormed the parliament building as the session was in progress.Gunshots were heard. Some protesters outside the building said they wanted to “punish” MPs who they said had “insulted” Barzani. Some attacked journalists at the scene.A Kurdish official had told Reuters on Saturday that Barzani had decided to hand over the presidency without waiting for elections that had been set for Nov. 1 but which have now been delayed by eight months.The region, which had enjoyed unprecedented autonomy for years, has been in turmoil since the independence referendum a month ago prompted military and economic retaliation from Iraq’s central government in Baghdad.In his address, Barzani vigorously defended his decision to hold the Sept. 25 referendum, the results of which “can never be erased”, he said. The vote was overwhelmingly for independence and triggered the military action by the Baghdad government and threats from neighbouring Turkey and Iran.He added that the Iraqi attack on Kirkuk and other Kurdish held territory vindicated his postion that Baghdad no longer believed in federalism and instead wanted to curtail Kurdish rights.U.S. CONDEMNEDBarzani condemned the United States for failing to back the Kurds. “We tried to stop bloodshed but the Iraqi forces and Popular Mobilization Front (Shi’ite militias) kept advancing, using U.S. weapons,” he said.“Our people should now question, whether the U.S. was aware of Iraq’s attack and why they did not prevent it.”Barzani has been criticised by Kurdish opponents for the loss of the city of Kirkuk, oil-rich and considered by many Kurds to be their spiritual home.His resignation could help facilitate a reconciliation between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Iraq’s central government, whose retaliatory measures since the referendum have transformed the balance of power in the north.Barzani has led the KRG since it was established in 2005. His second term expired in 2013 but was extended without elections being held as Islamic State militants swept across vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State but the alliance has faltered since the militants were largely defeated in the country.After the Kurdish vote, Iraqi troops were ordered by the country’s prime minister Haider al-Abadi to take control of areas claimed by both Baghdad and the KRG.Abadi also wants to take control of the border crossings between the Kurdish region and Turkey, Iran and Syria, including one through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.The fall of Kirkuk - a multi-ethnic city which lies outside the KRG’s official boundaries - to Iraqi forces on Oct. 16 was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurds’ independence drive because it halved the region’s oil export revenue.Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga started a second round of talks on Sunday to resolve a conflict over control of the Kurdistan region’s border crossings, Iraqi state TV said.A first round was held on Friday and Saturday, with Abadi ordering a 24-hour suspension on Friday of military operations against Kurdish forces.He demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks, saying in a statement: “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution.” (Reporting by Maher Chmaytelli and Raya Jalabi; Editing by Andrew Roche)"

The Judicial Branch is the nonpartisan backstop central to the checks and balances put in place to guard against Constitution-busting Executive and Legislative Branch actions.Led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate is set to vote on four troubling Trump nominees to lifetime seats on the federal appeals courts. Eager to show that the Senate is delivering on at least one piece of the Trump agenda, McConnell with the help of Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been moving the confirmation process at the political equivalence of ‘break-neck speed.’The court-packing began even before Donald Trump’s election when Sen. McConnell led a concerted campaign of obstruction to maintain the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. By blocking even a hearing for President Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, McConnell handed the new Republican president a ready-to-fill seat on the highest court.Anticipating this, then-candidate Trump released a list of 21 potential nominees, closely vetted for ideological correctness by the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation. From this list, it was Neil Gorsuch who got the nod. Now a member of the highest court, he has quickly validated the right-wing’s faith in him.Turning back to his list, Trump has plucked some of the youngest and most extreme individuals for subsequent vacancies on the federal bench, including two of four nominees set for serial confirmation votes this coming week: Joan Larsen and Allison Eid. Amy Coney Barrett is also among the four as is Stephanos Bibas who was only just approved days ago on a party-line vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Given that this list included Trump’s picks for the Supreme Court vacancy, it’s not out of the question that an elevation to the appeals court could pave the way for Larsen or Eid to fill the next opening on the high court. Here’s a closer look at these four nominees.Amy Coney Barrett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School, hasn’t said much as a lawyer in front of a judge, but she has had lots to say about judges.By her own admission, she’s never been “first chair” for a trial, never argued an appeal, or been counsel of record on an appeal. But she has written that judges need not be ruled by legal precedent if they disagree with it. Barrett has written about the duty of Catholic judges to put their faith above the law explicitly with respect to abortion and the death penalty. (When Senators Feinstein and Durbin asked her about this at her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, they were excoriated for raising her religion.)Coney Barrett has criticized Roe v Wade and believes that life begins at conception. She has also criticized the accommodation for birth control coverage in the Affordable Care Act, among other out-of-the-mainstream views.Based on her writings, it is safe to assume that she won’t disappoint the right-wing once the Republican majority confirms her to a lifetime seat on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals—a likely outcome.Joan Larsen of Michigan, from the Heritage Foundation/Federalist Society list, is up for a seat on the Sixth Circuit. Currently a justice on the Michigan Supreme Court, Larsen has raised an alarm among the LGBTQ community and their allies.She had harsh words for the landmark Supreme Court Lawrence v. Texas case which stuck down the state’s sodomy laws and paved the way for LGBTQ rights. She sided with those who refused to hear a parental rights case involving a same-sex couple – an issue that other states, in the aftermath of the Obergefell v. Hodges marriage equality decision, had taken up.For anyone, including several Republicans, worried about an out-of-control Executive, Larsen’s record shows she may not be the independent judge needed in these times. The Alliance for Justice in its research report on Joan Larsen has quite a few examples. Time and again, she has shown a bias toward presidential power which should give many on both sides of the Senate aisle pause in this era of Donald Trump.Allison Eid, a Colorado State Supreme Court judge, is up to fill Neil Gorsuch’s seat on the Tenth Circuit and, a look at her record, indicates that she’d unfortunately follow in his footsteps. In her writings she has praised the Supreme Court’s decision to invalidate the Gun-Free School Act as well as their decision to throw out part of the Violence against Women Act.On the state court, she sided with those judges who would thwart public education in several cases involving school funding. She opposed the use of eminent domain to help create a park but supported it to help private companies construct a pipeline, raising concerns about her views on the environment. Add to this troubling dissents from decisions on money in politics restrictions and redistricting, among other issues, and it is obvious how she made the list of 21.Stephanos Bibas, an academic up for a seat on the Third Circuit, has less of a record on social issues such as LGBTQ or reproductive rights but raises eyebrows when it comes to some of his writing on mass incarceration, drug addiction and Title IX. There wasn’t much time to explore his record given the rushed hearing, committee vote, and quick appearance on the Senate calendar for a final vote. Next week, the Senate will vote on whether to elevate these nominees to lifetime seats on extremely influential appellate courts.In the face of these “not-normal,” disturbing times, the last thing we need are partisan, biased, close-minded judges hand-picked for their loyalty to Donald Trump and his politics.If we are to preserve the independence of the Judicial Branch as a fair and honest check on the Executive and Legislative Branches, senators—and those of us who elected them—must vote based on what is best for the country rather than what will appease their party and the president.Last week, in a much-lauded speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) asserted, “It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end.” He’s right. Next week’s judicial confirmation votes provide the perfect opportunity for Flake and his colleagues."

He linked to an article he wrote for his Five ThirtyEight website in May that said Clinton would “probably be president” had Comey chosen to not send the letter.Clinton responded to Silver’s tweet two hours later, feigning nonchalance:Her tweet has been liked more than 100,000 times and retweeted by more than 20,000 people.It’s certainly unlikely that Clinton had forgotten the fateful date of Comey’s letter, which, Silver said in his article, “upended the news cycle and soon halved” her lead in the polls, “imperiling her position in the Electoral College.” Days later, Comey issued another letter saying the agency had not found anything new that would warrant charges against Clinton, but the political damage had been done with the election looming. Clinton has repeatedly asserted her belief that Comey’s Oct. 28 letter cost her the presidency. “If the election had been on Oct. 27, I’d be your president,” Clinton said at an event in May.Earlier this month, she told CNN that she “would have won but for Jim Comey’s letter on Oct. 28.”“I think every day that goes by, the evidence of that becomes clearer,” she said.

ESPN estimates that approximately 10 of the 50-plus-member team remained standing. Across the NFL this season, players protesting racism and police brutality have chosen to kneel during pre-game national anthems instead of standing in salute to the flag. The ongoing protest has set off a flurry of conservative criticism, notably from President Donald Trump. The protests, initiated by then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last year, recently escalated after Trump characterized any player who kneeled during the anthem as a “son of a bitch” during a September speech in Alabama. But recent comments from Texans owner Bob McNair appear to have struck a chord.“We can’t have the inmates running the prison,” McNair, who’s donated millions to the Trump campaign, said of the anthem protests in an ESPN article published Friday. McNair’s comments, made during a closed-door meeting earlier this month, reportedly stunned others in the room. After the comment was published, the team released a statement in which McNair said his comments were “a figure of a speech.”“I never meant to offend anyone and I was not referring to our players,” the statement reads. “I could never characterize our players or our league that way and I apologize to anyone who was offended by it.” A team-wide walkout from practice that day was narrowly avoided, ESPN later reported. However, practice started about half an hour late, and ten players did not attend. Texans players took McNair to task over his comments. “This is how you view us?” All-Pro left tackle Duane Brown said of McNair while speaking to reporters in the locker room after Friday’s practice. “You’re an inmate. We can’t let you get out of line. We can’t let you speak for yourself. We can’t let you have your own beliefs. That’s what it feels like, it’s a bad situation.” This article has been updated with past comments from Texans players, McNair and Trump. "

Clouse, On Assignment For HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-power-outages-superstorm-sandy_us_59f37004e4b07fdc5fbdf009,"But the city has its sights set on a stronger, greener grid.",2017-10-29,"A rare convergence of tropical and nontropical weather events merged to create Sandy, the ""superstorm"" that struck the Northeast at the end of October 2012.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f3711f180000360ddfc974.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Five years ago, Superstorm Sandy pummeled the New York metropolitan area, knocking out electricity and heat for 750,000 residents as temperatures plunged. When it was over, the effects of the mammoth weather system could be seen as far west as the Great Lakes. More than 8.5 million people in 21 states had no power, making it the worst storm in U.S. history in terms of outages (until Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico this October).In the years since Sandy, there have been a few signs that New York City’s grid is evolving, becoming cleaner and more resilient. But the threat of widespread outages remains.The city relies on one giant power grid run by a single supplier, Con Edison, that provides electricity for nearly everyone in the metropolitan area. This centralized method of delivering power is common all over the country and is as old as the nation’s energy infrastructure itself. But as we’ve seen with Maria and the recent hurricanes in Florida and Texas, this type of energy system is vulnerable to outages caused by extreme weather.Climate scientists warn that we’ll see harsher weather as the planet warms. And in New York, residents of areas with aboveground power lines ― like many people in Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn ― are especially susceptible to outages, as winds take down trees and the lines with them. Energy experts say that clean, efficient, decentralized energy is key to alleviating the aftermath of potentially catastrophic power failures. Rooftop solar, coupled with battery storage, can keep the power on in single-family homes and small businesses. And microgrids ― energy systems that can function on their own in the event of damage to the larger grid ― can incorporate renewables and battery storage to do the same for larger buildings or even groups of buildings. But weaving clean, resilient energy systems into NYC’s existing grid will take time, and we’re still in the very early stages. It’s a tricky thing, reimagining energy within the confines of an aging city with limited space, strict building safety regulations and 8.5 million people who need power.“It’s a bit like trying to build a bridge and drive across it at the same time,” said Nilda Mesa of the Urban Design Lab at Columbia University, who previously served as the director of sustainability for the New York mayor’s office.Still, this year in particular, progress has begun to pick up, with a number of renewable-based projects completed or in the works. A microgrid and a “virtual microgrid” are up and running in Brooklyn. Three more microgrid projects, including one at a hospital complex in the Bronx, are being tested. And the city is developing 15 solar-plus-battery-storage projects on city-owned buildings ― firehouses, schools, homeless shelters ― intended to provide essential services and shelter in flood-prone areas of the city’s outer boroughs.Keeping electricity on at hospitals and other health care facilities is especially crucial. Some of the most harrowing stories from Sandy and this year’s hurricanes involve doctors and nurses carrying patients down dark flights of stairs or performing surgery by cellphone light. In Hollywood, Florida, eight residents at a nursing home died after a backup generator failed, leaving no air conditioning.In the wake of Sandy, the city’s public hospital system, the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation, was forced to evacuate patients from its Bellevue and Coney Island facilities after diesel-fueled backup power failures. HHC is now a finalist in a state-funded renewables-based microgrid contest. Each of the 11 microgrid projects, including three in NYC, received $1 million earlier this year to do feasibility studies. Those that advance to the final round will vie for an additional $20 million in funding. “We want to have a form of energy that is reliable, clean, economical and not connected to the grid,” said Cyril Toussaint, the director of energy management and sustainability for HHC. HHC’s microgrid is designed to use solar power, battery storage and natural gas-fueled generation. Natural gas does emit carbon dioxide, but it’s cleaner than the diesel fuel that hospital generators typically run on. And most microgrid projects still use it for at least part of their power. This is because generating enough onsite renewable energy for large projects takes a lot of space ― the kind of space required for a solar or wind farm ― whereas a natural gas generator doesn’t. It’s also cheap. And while the costs of both solar and battery storage have fallen considerably over the last few years, the amount of storage necessary to back up a solar farm still costs more than most microgrid owners want to pay.Battery storage is key to the growth of renewables, experts say, because the intermittent nature of solar and wind means they need backup for power to stay constant. NYC recently announced a goal that would take the city from close to zero to 100 megawatt-hours of battery storage capacity by 2020.Solar also has its limits in a dense urban environment. It gets especially challenging in the parts of Manhattan where skyscrapers cast long shadows.NYC owes much of its ability to make its energy systems greener and stronger to New York state, which regulates utilities through the Public Service Commission.Immediately after Sandy, New York state gave Con Edison $900 million to fortify the existing grid ― doing things like building flood walls and hoisting equipment to higher ground ― and this work should go a long way toward preventing similar catastrophes. This is especially true for Manhattan, where the flooding of a single substation caused an explosion that knocked out power for just about everyone below 39th Street. (As for the aboveground power lines in the outer boroughs, moving them underground is especially expensive and tricky ― which is why it hasn’t been done.)The state then overhauled utility regulations and in 2014 launched Reforming the Energy Vision, which is lauded as the most progressive plan in the country in terms of rethinking how utilities do business. Its ultimate goal is to allow third-party businesses ― namely, providers of clean energy and related technologies ― to develop and operate renewable projects so utilities don’t have to build new fossil fuel-based substations.“That’s really the reason that we’re in New York,” said Scott Kessler of LO3 Energy, the startup behind the high-tech virtual Brooklyn Microgrid, which involves dozens of rooftop solar systems in one of the borough’s brownstone neighborhoods. “As far as reinventing the grid goes, I would say New York state is at the top of the list.”Still, Kessler acknowledges that progress can be slow. “The expectations have been for emerging technology to disrupt an industry in two to five years,” he said. “But what folks are finding is that things take longer in the energy industry. You can’t just come in and take a sledgehammer to the electric grid, the public won’t accept that.”Brooklyn Microgrid is not yet a microgrid in the true sense of the word — it’s a virtual solar power trading platform that allows the homeowners to buy and sell electricity credits among themselves. But LO3 does plan to build a physical microgrid, with battery storage, to maintain power in parts of the area.Meanwhile, in June, the first renewables-based microgrid at an NYC affordable housing complex began churning out energy for the 625-unit Marcus Garvey Village in Brooklyn’s Brownsville neighborhood. This microgrid ― a $4 million project financed with both private money and government funds and tax breaks ― uses rooftop solar, battery storage and a natural gas-powered fuel cell.The project is part of an effort to help ease electricity demand in what has historically been a trouble spot for Con Edison. Reducing demand is an important part of avoiding blackouts and brownouts, which generally happen during heat waves, when everyone cranks their air conditioning at the same time. In fact, simply installing rooftop solar ― which is growing in New York City ― helps reduce demand for electricity.Additionally, if a storm or other emergency knocks the grid out, the Marcus Garvey system can produce enough energy to keep the power on in the complex’s main office, security office and community room.“The idea is that you give the local community a place to come that has heat, a refrigerator to store medications, a place where they can charge their phones,” said Doug Staker, co-founder of Demand Energy, the company that developed and operates the microgrid."

It gets especially challenging in the parts of Manhattan where skyscrapers cast long shadows.NYC owes much of its ability to make its energy systems greener and stronger to New York state, which regulates utilities through the Public Service Commission.Immediately after Sandy, New York state gave Con Edison $900 million to fortify the existing grid ― doing things like building flood walls and hoisting equipment to higher ground ― and this work should go a long way toward preventing similar catastrophes. This is especially true for Manhattan, where the flooding of a single substation caused an explosion that knocked out power for just about everyone below 39th Street. (As for the aboveground power lines in the outer boroughs, moving them underground is especially expensive and tricky ― which is why it hasn’t been done.)The state then overhauled utility regulations and in 2014 launched Reforming the Energy Vision, which is lauded as the most progressive plan in the country in terms of rethinking how utilities do business. Its ultimate goal is to allow third-party businesses ― namely, providers of clean energy and related technologies ― to develop and operate renewable projects so utilities don’t have to build new fossil fuel-based substations.“That’s really the reason that we’re in New York,” said Scott Kessler of LO3 Energy, the startup behind the high-tech virtual Brooklyn Microgrid, which involves dozens of rooftop solar systems in one of the borough’s brownstone neighborhoods. “As far as reinventing the grid goes, I would say New York state is at the top of the list.”Still, Kessler acknowledges that progress can be slow. “The expectations have been for emerging technology to disrupt an industry in two to five years,” he said. “But what folks are finding is that things take longer in the energy industry. You can’t just come in and take a sledgehammer to the electric grid, the public won’t accept that.”Brooklyn Microgrid is not yet a microgrid in the true sense of the word — it’s a virtual solar power trading platform that allows the homeowners to buy and sell electricity credits among themselves. But LO3 does plan to build a physical microgrid, with battery storage, to maintain power in parts of the area.Meanwhile, in June, the first renewables-based microgrid at an NYC affordable housing complex began churning out energy for the 625-unit Marcus Garvey Village in Brooklyn’s Brownsville neighborhood. This microgrid ― a $4 million project financed with both private money and government funds and tax breaks ― uses rooftop solar, battery storage and a natural gas-powered fuel cell.The project is part of an effort to help ease electricity demand in what has historically been a trouble spot for Con Edison. Reducing demand is an important part of avoiding blackouts and brownouts, which generally happen during heat waves, when everyone cranks their air conditioning at the same time. In fact, simply installing rooftop solar ― which is growing in New York City ― helps reduce demand for electricity.Additionally, if a storm or other emergency knocks the grid out, the Marcus Garvey system can produce enough energy to keep the power on in the complex’s main office, security office and community room.“The idea is that you give the local community a place to come that has heat, a refrigerator to store medications, a place where they can charge their phones,” said Doug Staker, co-founder of Demand Energy, the company that developed and operates the microgrid."
57,IMPACT,"5 Years After Superstorm Sandy, New York's Still Vulnerable To Widespread Power Outages","Carol J. Clouse, On Assignment For HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-power-outages-superstorm-sandy_us_59f37004e4b07fdc5fbdf009,"But the city has its sights set on a stronger, greener grid.",2017-10-29,A renovated apartment building with solar panels and a wind-powered generator on New York City's Lower East Side.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f37d28180000360ddfc9b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Five years ago, Superstorm Sandy pummeled the New York metropolitan area, knocking out electricity and heat for 750,000 residents as temperatures plunged. When it was over, the effects of the mammoth weather system could be seen as far west as the Great Lakes. More than 8.5 million people in 21 states had no power, making it the worst storm in U.S. history in terms of outages (until Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico this October).In the years since Sandy, there have been a few signs that New York City’s grid is evolving, becoming cleaner and more resilient. But the threat of widespread outages remains.The city relies on one giant power grid run by a single supplier, Con Edison, that provides electricity for nearly everyone in the metropolitan area. This centralized method of delivering power is common all over the country and is as old as the nation’s energy infrastructure itself. But as we’ve seen with Maria and the recent hurricanes in Florida and Texas, this type of energy system is vulnerable to outages caused by extreme weather.Climate scientists warn that we’ll see harsher weather as the planet warms. And in New York, residents of areas with aboveground power lines ― like many people in Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn ― are especially susceptible to outages, as winds take down trees and the lines with them. Energy experts say that clean, efficient, decentralized energy is key to alleviating the aftermath of potentially catastrophic power failures. Rooftop solar, coupled with battery storage, can keep the power on in single-family homes and small businesses. And microgrids ― energy systems that can function on their own in the event of damage to the larger grid ― can incorporate renewables and battery storage to do the same for larger buildings or even groups of buildings. But weaving clean, resilient energy systems into NYC’s existing grid will take time, and we’re still in the very early stages. It’s a tricky thing, reimagining energy within the confines of an aging city with limited space, strict building safety regulations and 8.5 million people who need power.“It’s a bit like trying to build a bridge and drive across it at the same time,” said Nilda Mesa of the Urban Design Lab at Columbia University, who previously served as the director of sustainability for the New York mayor’s office.Still, this year in particular, progress has begun to pick up, with a number of renewable-based projects completed or in the works. A microgrid and a “virtual microgrid” are up and running in Brooklyn. Three more microgrid projects, including one at a hospital complex in the Bronx, are being tested. And the city is developing 15 solar-plus-battery-storage projects on city-owned buildings ― firehouses, schools, homeless shelters ― intended to provide essential services and shelter in flood-prone areas of the city’s outer boroughs.Keeping electricity on at hospitals and other health care facilities is especially crucial. Some of the most harrowing stories from Sandy and this year’s hurricanes involve doctors and nurses carrying patients down dark flights of stairs or performing surgery by cellphone light. In Hollywood, Florida, eight residents at a nursing home died after a backup generator failed, leaving no air conditioning.In the wake of Sandy, the city’s public hospital system, the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation, was forced to evacuate patients from its Bellevue and Coney Island facilities after diesel-fueled backup power failures. HHC is now a finalist in a state-funded renewables-based microgrid contest. Each of the 11 microgrid projects, including three in NYC, received $1 million earlier this year to do feasibility studies. Those that advance to the final round will vie for an additional $20 million in funding. “We want to have a form of energy that is reliable, clean, economical and not connected to the grid,” said Cyril Toussaint, the director of energy management and sustainability for HHC. HHC’s microgrid is designed to use solar power, battery storage and natural gas-fueled generation. Natural gas does emit carbon dioxide, but it’s cleaner than the diesel fuel that hospital generators typically run on. And most microgrid projects still use it for at least part of their power. This is because generating enough onsite renewable energy for large projects takes a lot of space ― the kind of space required for a solar or wind farm ― whereas a natural gas generator doesn’t. It’s also cheap. And while the costs of both solar and battery storage have fallen considerably over the last few years, the amount of storage necessary to back up a solar farm still costs more than most microgrid owners want to pay.Battery storage is key to the growth of renewables, experts say, because the intermittent nature of solar and wind means they need backup for power to stay constant.

58,POLITICS,It’s Been One Month Since The Las Vegas Shooting And Bump Stocks Are Still Legal,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bump-stocks-congress-las-vegas_us_59f5e721e4b07fdc5fbeb7fa,The push for a ban on the devices has stalled in Congress.,2017-10-29,"A bump stock device (left) fits on a semi-automatic rifle to increase the firing speed, making it similar to a fully automatic rifle.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f5ed3c1800003400d59fbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It’s been one month since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history and momentum for a ban on bump stocks, the devices used by the Las Vegas shooter to kill 58 people and injure over 500 others, appears to have stalled.With congressional Republicans focused on tax reform for the foreseeable future, and given their inability to offer little more than “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of a mass shooting, the push for a legislative ban on bump stocks is likely dead entirely.“I’ve been through this so many times,” a crestfallen Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost this week. “At first there’s just grief, commiseration, outrage ― and then silence. We can’t bring measures to the floor as we want. It depends on the leadership in Congress, and currently, they don’t want these issues to be brought up.”In the days following the Oct. 1 attack, hope rose among gun control advocates that Congress would finally act to pass a commonsense law banning the firearm modifications, which make semi-automatic weapons function like machine guns. Spurred by receptive comments from GOP lawmakers, many of whom had never heard of bump stocks, several bills were introduced aiming to outlaw them.But momentum for a legislative fix was soon ― and some gun control advocates argue deliberately ― kneecapped when the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby, issued a statement urging the administration to address the matter via existing regulations and not law. Under such a scenario, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or the ATF, would close the loophole via a regulatory change.“We think the regulatory fix is the smartest, quickest fix,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said a few days later, pouring further cold water over the prospect of a legislative fix.Democrats, however, argue that congressional action is needed to codify a ban on bump stocks because a regulation can easily be overturned by a different administration. They also note the ATF previously issued memos in 2011 and 2013 which said that existing gun laws do not provide sufficient authority to deem bump stocks illegal.“The ATF does NOT have the authority to address bump-fire stocks — and has made this point clear to Congress MULTIPLE times,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has authored a bill in the Senate banning bump stocks, tweeted earlier this month.Feinstein proposed a similar ban in 2013 that would have outlawed detachable stocks on semi-automatic weapons, but the measure never received a vote due to bipartisan opposition.Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said earlier week that his bill banning bump stocks, which he introduced alongside Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), would receive a second look because he “highly” doubts the ATF will be able to “change their regulations in a credible way.”Asked whether the agency had the authority to regulate bump stocks, ATF spokeswoman Amanda Hils told HuffPost that the matter was currently under review by the Justice Department.“Whether a part or accessory is, in fact, a machinegun requires an application of statutory terms – the law – to the technical and functional characteristics of the device. This analysis requires both technical and legal expertise,” Hils said.If the ATF finds that it does not have the authority to regulate bump stocks, the onus will be on Congress to act. Any attempt at gun legislation, however, faces tough odds in a Republican-controlled Congress. Second Amendment advocates oppose any attempts at gun control, with some even going so far as to call mass shootings the “price of freedom.”Still, some GOP senators say they’d consider legislation if the ATF can’t act unilaterally.“If they really do believe that the rules can’t be amended without statutory changes, then I’m open to that discussion,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told HuffPost this week.It’s unclear whether the issue of bump stocks ― which many lawmakers said they were unfamiliar with and needed time to study in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting ― even will receive a congressional hearing.A Senate Judiciary Committee spokesman for Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said the committee was recently briefed on “various regulatory and technical issues involving bump stocks and is evaluating potential regulatory and legislative proposals to restrict” them.“The Judiciary committee is also considering a hearing on bump stocks and the Las Vegas shooting when more complete facts are available from the investigation,” the spokesman, Taylor Foy, added in a statement.Democrats are pressing ahead with broader gun control measures despite the lack of action on bump stocks, arguing it is important for advocates to have something to rally around ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a top gun control advocate, introduced legislation this week strengthening background checks on gun purchases, a measure that is widely popular with gun owners and the general public. It’s the third such attempt to do so since the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in his home state.While such a law would not have stopped the Las Vegas shooter from obtaining a weapon, Murphy argues it is needed to stem the tide of gun violence. Since the Las Vegas shooting, for example, more than 2,738 people have been shot in the U.S., according to data collected by the Gun Violence Archive. A reported 840 of them died. Murphy said he wants to rekindle the conversation around gun control because the NRA was using the bump stock issue evade the issue of background checks.“The gun lobby wants you to only be able to talk about gun laws that would have addressed the last high-profile shooting,” he told HuffPost this week. “They do that because they want us to take the eye off the ball of background checks. They know this would be the most meaningful change, and they don’t want us to talk about this because they know that ultimately this will make the biggest difference.”"

Ricardo Rosselló’s Sunday morning request to terminate the business deal, which has raised questions from several lawmakers and government agencies.“I want to clarify, so it’s very clear, that the cancellation of this contract does not respond to an acceptance that there was something outside of the law or out of line with [PREPA’s] procedures of emergency contracts,” Ramos said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday that it had “significant concerns” over PREPA’s decision to award Whitefish the contract earlier this month and would be conducting a review.Whitefish, a two-year-old firm based in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s Montana hometown and financially backed in part by a major donor to President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, had just two full-time employees when Hurricane Maria hit the island more than a month ago. Language in the contract ― a full copy is here ― appeared to give Whitefish a sweetheart deal as the people of Puerto Rico struggle to recover from the devastation of the hurricane.The contract stated that, “In no event shall [government bodies] have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements.” That gave Whitefish wide discretion and privacy over how it used $300 million in U.S. taxpayer money.It also waived “any claim against Contractor related to delayed completion of the work,” which means the government couldn’t do much if Whitefish dragged out its job restoring electricity to the 3.4 million Americans living on the island.Ramos said Sunday that $300 million was the maximum amount of money Whitefish could have been paid for its completed services and denied that PREPA had already committed to paying the full amount.So far, PREPA has paid or been billed for over $20 million by Whitefish, according to Ramos. He said there wouldn’t be a penalty for canceling the contract, but that PREPA would have to pay for Whitefish to remove their equipment from the island as well as whatever work they complete by mid-November, which he expected to total at least an additional $10.9 million.The contract’s cancellation, which won’t go into effect for 30 days per the contract’s terms, isn’t expected to stop any work the company currently has in progress. But it could delay other grid restoration efforts by 10 to 12 weeks, Ramos said.“The controversy that the contract has generated is truly immense,” said Ramos, adding that he had been summoned by Congress to answer questions. “It’s a huge distraction. So as I understand it, it’s the better of two evils to cancel the contract.”Whitefish said it would finish any work that PREPA asks them to complete before leaving the U.S. territory, according to a statement the company emailed to HuffPost on Sunday.“We are very disappointed in the decision by Governor Rosselló to ask PREPA to cancel the contract which led to PREPA’s announcement this afternoon,” reads the statement. “We only wish the best for the great people of Puerto Rico. We are very proud of our contributions to the island’s recovery and proud of the tremendous work that our team has done under very challenging conditions.It’s been more than a month since the hurricane destroyed Puerto Rico’s infrastructure and nearly 70 percent of people still have no power ― a particularly precarious situation for hospitals that have been relying on temporary generators to keep people alive.HuffPost reached out to experts in government contracting to see if this was as bad a deal for Puerto Rico as it sounded. The answer was a resounding yes.“Outrageous,” said Charles Tiefer, a professor of government contracting at the University of Baltimore law school.“The clause that shields the contractor from audit or review is a red flag of overcharging,” said Tiefer. “The contractor works for PREPA, not the other way around. I can’t imagine how any responsible government official could put such an anti-audit clause into a government contract.”Anthony Varona, a professor and vice dean at American University’s Washington College of Law and an expert in contracts law, said it was “entirely inappropriate” for a private contractor to prevent the government from auditing how taxpayer money was spent.“The prohibition as written in this agreement is a blatant attempt to blindfold and tie the hands of the government officials responsible for overseeing the contract’s performance,” said Varona. “It strikes me as an open invitation for fraud and abuse.”There were other concerning details in the contract, like the high rates Whitefish was charging for labor. The company was paying $240 an hour for a general foreman and $227 for a lineman. For some context, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said first-line supervisors of construction sites make about $43 an hour and construction laborers make about $23 an hour.Whitefish was also paying for expensive food and lodging for its employees. The contract stated that each person could spend nearly $80 a day for meals and $332 a day for lodging. Flights for employees were being billed at $1,000 each way.Neither PREPA nor Whitefish responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment on the contents of the contract.Ramos emphasized that it was “tabloid” reports ― not any wrongdoing on the part of the company ― that prompted Rosselló’s request to cancel the contract on Sunday.“Certainly, if the situation that is going on in the U.S. with the media was not happening ... there [would be] no need for the cancellation of the contract,” Ramos said. “We’re managing risks. There is a perception risk, a reputational risk, and a delay risk in continuing with the contract.”Steve Schooner, a former high-ranking government contracting official who is now a law professor at George Washington University, said the Whitefish contract has given him great material for his classes because there are so many problems with it.“The contract ― both the process and the content ― rivals, and in some ways exceeds, some of the best final exams I’ve written for my students over the last two decades,” he said.Not everyone said the contract was stunningly out of the ordinary. Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project On Government Oversight, wrote a blog post about why he thinks the contract raised concerns but was mostly normal, given bigger problems surrounding many federal contracts.Still, Amey told HuffPost that it’s “odd” that the contract gave Whitefish the ability to delay its work without any accountability. He said that clause allowed the company to potentially prolong its work so it got paid the entire $300 million ― and then push to extend the contract for even more money.“Damage provisions often are included to incentivize the work’s completion,” he said. “Waiving claims could jeopardize the completion of the work in the agreed on one-year term.”As fishy as it has looked that a tiny company in the Montana hometown of the U.S. interior secretary landed such a big contract, Zinke has insisted he had nothing to do with it.Tiefer said while all the facts aren’t out yet, it’s clear that something “went very wrong” with the way the contract was awarded.“Let’s put it this way,” he said. “Whitefish didn’t make the shortlist because of a world-class reputation.”Carolina Moreno contributed reporting.This entry has been updated with information about PREPA’s decision to cancel the Whitefish contract."

The president may have already stopped them.,2017-10-29,Yale University is one of several Ivy League schools fighting union campaigns by graduate students.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f393a1180000051bdfca00.jpeg?cache=RaxwV7hF8d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At first glance, Yale University doesn’t seem like a school with much love for the current president.When Donald Trump first issued his anti-Muslim travel ban in January, Yale’s administration said it was alarmed by the move. When Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord in June, Yale said it would do everything it could to combat global warming. And when Trump announced an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September, Yale’s president told the student body how disappointed he was.But you won’t find Yale administrators at the vanguard of the resistance when it comes to Trump’s labor policies.Despite its liberal reputation, the Ivy League school has waged a bitter years-long fight to prevent its graduate students from joining a union, arguing that the students shouldn’t be recognized as employees under federal law. Trump may have finally taken care of the university’s big headache.“They are absolutely counting on Donald Trump,” said D. Taylor, president of Unite Here, the 270,000-member hospitality union leading the Yale graduate student organizing campaign. “Yale, like all these quote-unquote liberal Ivy League schools, is fighting [unionization] viciously. The hypocrisy is beyond belief.”Trump has already reshaped the federal agency that referees labor disputes so that it’s more friendly to employers. His two picks for the National Labor Relations Board ― Republicans Marvin Kaplan, a former GOP Hill staffer, and William Emanuel, a former management-side lawyer ― have flipped the five-member board from liberal to conservative for the first time in years. The new board is expected to reverse current legal precedent and say that graduate students at Yale and other private schools are not eligible to join unions.That would mark a significant blow to union organizing campaigns on college campuses around the country. Graduate students like Ruby Oram, a doctoral candidate at Loyola University Chicago, think their schools stand to benefit from Trump’s presidency, even as the same schools criticize much of his agenda.“I think it’s disgusting,” said Oram, who teaches in Loyola’s history department. “Waiting for the law to change is unjust and really disappointing in a school that prides itself on social justice.”The legal question of whether graduate students who teach classes qualify as “employees” eligible to unionize has been a controversial one for decades. While many states have paved the way for collective bargaining at public universities, federal policy covering private schools has gone back and forth. Various iterations of the NLRB have ruled one way on the graduate student question, only to see their rulings reversed by a subsequent board of a different political makeup.As it stands, New York University is the only private university where graduate students have a union contract. It appeared that would change last year when the then-Democratic majority on the NLRB ruled that graduate students at Columbia University were employees under the law. That decision led to a burst of union elections on college campuses ― some successful, some not.But thanks to Trump’s quick reshaping of the NLRB, the August 2016 precedent probably won’t last long.Labor lawyers expect that the newly conservative board will, sooner or later, take up the grad student issue once again. That would be a boon to elite schools that have been trying to stifle graduate student organizing, including the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago and Cornell University.In the end, those schools may not even need a ruling that reverses the current precedent ― merely the specter of one. Wilma Liebman, a former Democratic chairwoman of the NLRB, said a union organizing campaign facing a university challenge would now have to consider whether it wants a Republican board to rule on the dispute at all, given the danger that an adverse decision would set new precedent.“These are strategic choices,” Liebman said. “They have to weigh the very real possibility it will be reversed. I guess they might say to themselves, ‘What do we gain by having a reversal of precedent?’ Maybe [instead] they engage in pressure ― economic, political, whatever leverage they have ― on the university to move the ball along without risking a change in the law.”In 2000, Liebman was one of three NLRB members who first ruled that graduate students ― in that case, those at New York University ― had the right to form a union. In the U.S., collective bargaining rights are only afforded to those deemed employees under the law. The board reasoned the NYU students were employees because they performed work ― teaching undergraduate students ― in exchange for pay ― financial aid.Then-board member Peter Hurtgen also ruled in the students’ favor, even though he was a Republican sympathetic to the school administration’s concerns. In a concurring opinion, Hurtgen clarified that he believed the NYU students were eligible to unionize because their teaching duties were not a necessary part of their education. Now in private legal practice, he said he wasn’t surprised that the graduate student question still isn’t settled 17 years later and may soon be litigated again.“There’s a strong ideological problem there that is not easily bridged,” Hurtgen said. “That is, if these graduate teaching assistants are employees, then all the rights and trappings of the statute and collective bargaining would seem to follow them in their graduate program. The colleges and universities are wisely concerned that that poses a very difficult issue to deal with.”People go to graduate school to learn, although they also perform work there, including doing research for faculty members and teaching undergrads. Universities argue that collective bargaining by graduate students could disrupt their education and even infringe on academic freedom. But they rarely bring up their economic concerns with unionization, like having to pay larger stipends or improve students’ health care plans.Some schools have made a convincing case to their graduate students. Votes at both Harvard and Cornell earlier this year were too close to be conclusive, and Duke graduate students withdrew their union petition after a preliminary vote went strongly against it.Ivy League schools in particular ― which conservatives often ridicule as hotbeds of radical liberalism ― have been at the center of higher education’s fight against collective bargaining for grad students. In 2004, a conservative NLRB under President George W. Bush undid the NYU decision, ruling that graduate students at Brown University were not employees and therefore could not unionize. The Brown precedent prevailed until last year’s ruling in the Columbia case, which reached the opposite conclusion.Given the legal flip-flops at the labor board, many graduate student unionizing campaigns have gone on for years, decades even, waiting for an opening to hold an election. At Yale, the campaign stretches back to the 1990s. The graduate teaching assistants decided to file for an election after the board ruled against Columbia. They held a series of votes earlier this year.The union Unite Here won eight of nine elections held within individual academic departments at Yale in February. In addition to challenging the premise that graduate students are employees, Yale has appealed the election results on the grounds that Unite Here cherry-picked departments to obtain favorable results. The school has said it would prefer that all graduate students vote in a single election. Its appeal now sits before the NLRB. In an email, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said the departmental elections ― a format approved by an NLRB regional office ― “denied over 90% of Yale doctoral students the right to vote.” He also charged that the union and its tactics “have not garnered strong support at Yale,” noting that even the graduate student assembly objected to the department-by-department elections.Conroy said the school has good relationships with its already unionized employees, including clerical workers, who are also represented by Unite Here. “But Yale and other universities consistently have believed that their graduate students who assist faculty with teaching as part of their education should not be considered employees under federal labor law,” he said. “Over the course of six years at Yale, doctoral students’ required teaching takes up less than one-sixth of their time.”Lena Eckert-Erdheim, who’s pursuing a doctorate in history at Yale, helped in the organizing effort as she waited five years to cast her ballot. She wants a union for many of the same reasons that a nurse or factory worker would want one: consistent raises, better health care coverage and a grievance procedure, particularly as it relates to sexual harassment by faculty members.Eckert-Erdheim said she’s disappointed in the school’s insistence that she is not an employee and that what she does is not technically work.“When I teach, I get a paycheck. My taxes are withheld. I get a W2 like in any other job,” she said. “I love teaching, but it is certainly work.”At other schools, the legal uncertainties created by Trump’s election have brought a sense of urgency to union organizing. Last week, graduate students at the University of Chicago voted overwhelmingly to form a union, 1,103 to 479, leading to tears of joy from pro-union students. The school’s administration had created a website with the sort of anti-union talking points typically crafted by consultants for corporate employers. Like Yale, the University of Chicago is challenging the election results on the grounds that the students are not employees.At the University of Pennsylvania ― the Ivy League school Trump graduated from ― graduate students began rounding up signatures for support shortly after Trump won the presidency, in order to file for an election as quickly as possible.“We talked about it as a race against the Trump clock,” said Miranda Weinberg, a doctoral candidate in education at Penn. “We assumed that the university administration would use the Trump appointees on the board to try to take away the right of graduate workers to unionize.”The NLRB has not yet granted permission for an election at Penn. Even if it does, a broader, subsequent board ruling against graduate students could render the results irrelevant. But whatever happens afterward, Zachary Smith, a graduate student in Penn’s political science department, said an election would finally make clear whether a majority of the graduate students want union representation ― and would force the school to either honor or disregard their will.“We’re always going to be reaching out to Penn to ask them to allow graduate workers to respect the results of the election and the bargaining unit as it’s constituted,” Smith said. “And we hope Penn will accept the results of the election. That’s pretty much all we can say.”In a statement, Penn’s administration said it was “extremely proud of our graduate students’ accomplishments” but felt they were better off without collective bargaining. “At Penn, we view graduate students as students and our future colleagues rather than employees, and believe we can better support them without the intervention of a labor union,” the school said.Not all colleges have challenged the validity of graduate student unionizing. Tufts University said it was disappointed when an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union won an election there earlier this year. But the school has agreed to bargain with the grad student union rather than dispute its legitimacy. When grad students at Brandeis University voted in favor of a union in the spring, the school said it would begin negotiating immediately.If more schools choose to honor union election results, it will become more difficult for Yale, Columbia, Penn, Chicago and others to hold out, particularly if their anti-union stances yoke them to Trump. Many pro-union graduate students vow to continue their campaigns for years if necessary, and they plan to function as unions regardless of whether their school recognizes them.“I think the outcome of the election demonstrated very clearly to us ― and it should to the administration ― that Yale graduate employees want a union,” Eckert-Erdheim said. “We really hope they won’t continue relying on Donald Trump to avoid negotiating with us.”"

On Saturday Griffin posted to Twitter a 17-minute video called “A Hell of A Story,” ripping Cohen and Harvey Levin ― TMZ’s founder and guiding force ― in the rant.She accused Cohen of offering her cocaine in professional contexts and mistreating women in his workplace. “People like Andy Cohen and Harvey Levin,” she said, “they honestly live just to take women down.”Cohen responded to Griffin’s attack on Twitter, saying: “I am completely stunned by this story. It is 100% false and totally made up.”Griffin plays a voicemail that Levin left on her phone in which he provides his personal phone number.“I don’t have a minute to call him,” she said in the video, “but maybe you do.”Griffin accused Levin of fueling the harassment she faced after she posed with a replica of Donald Trump’s bloody, severed head. “My mom got death threats at her retirement village and my sister, while she was dying of cancer, got death threats at her apartment,” she said.She blamed TMZ for the intensity of the backlash. “They have done hit pieces on me to the point where it’s actually affected my career,” she said. “Harvey Levin, have you ever done anything honorable, ever?”A representative for Levin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The bad blood between Griffin and Cohen began after he was chosen to replace Griffin in her longtime gig hosting the CNN New Year’s Eve special alongside Anderson Cooper. Griffin lost the job amid the controversy over the Trump severed head. For years, Griffin and Cohen worked together at Bravo. Griffin appeared on Cohen’s late-night show on the cable network. Cohen also produced Griffin’s now-cancelled Bravo series, “My Life on the D-List.”In her tirade, Griffin refers to him as a “miserable boss.” "

His family also owns an $8.1 million home in Washington, D.C., where they currently reside.“Obviously we will make certain that he has all the accoutrements that accompany a former president,” Evans said. “His safety will be uppermost in our minds.”It’s not known which courthouse Obama has been summoned to ― nor the exact date. Despite his reported willingness to serve, The Hill notes that he’s “unlikely to be selected” to actually sit on a jury.Obama has yet to comment.Court officials in Cook County previously summoned Obama in late 2009 for jury duty. As The Guardian notes, however, he did not attend due to the small matter of running the country.Should Obama attend, he’d follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, George W. Bush, in performing the duty following his departure from the White House.Bush was pictured wearing a “Juror” badge in Dallas in 2015:Obama would also join talk-show host and philanthropist Oprah Winfrey as one of Cook County’s most famous jurors. She served on a jury in 2004 that convicted a man of first-degree murder.“A-Team” actor Mr T, born Lawrence Tureaud, was another celebrity to show up for jury service in the county. He told reporters “I pity the criminals today” in August 2014 while waiting to be selected, but did not end up serving on a jury."

This should be par for the course in politics because Rubio and Martinez are both high-profile Republicans. Politicians are expected to campaign for candidates who belong to their party. For instance, Senator Kamala Harris is also campaigning for Gillespie’s opponent, Democrat Ralph Northam. But in a campaign where Gillespie is running a barrage of racist ads that attack Latino and immigrant communities, Rubio’s and Martinez’s support reeks of betrayal.As Latinos and descendants of immigrants, Rubio and Martinez should not be supportive of Ed Gillespie’s attacks against Latinos. They should be outraged. They should take notes from Republican Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain, who have shown that you can be a Republican and have the courage to denounce Trumpian-style divisiveness and race-baiting. Flake and McCain demonstrated that during these trying times in American politics, it’s possible for elected officials to choose to put the well-being of the public before partisan politics. Rubio and Martinez chose the opposite.Gillespie’s racist campaign ad tactic was ripped from President Donald Trump’s playbook. It mirrors Trump’s vile “bloodstained killing fields” speech in Long Island, where he used the dangerous MS-13 gang to paint the Latino and immigrant communities in a sickening light. “They shouldn’t be here... they’re animals,” he said of MS-13 during a speech that could easily muddy the vast difference between criminal gangs and undocumented immigrants and Latinos. In one of Gillespie’s television ads, the words “Kill, Rape, Control” flash in bold letters on the screen, showing photographs of Latino men who happen to be members of the MS-13, posing a danger to Virginia. (It was later discovered that the photos were of a different gang and were taken in a prison in Central America, not in Virginia.) It’s the same disturbing tactic that dehumanizes Latinos and immigrants, making us targets of hate and discrimination. The message is an affront to the hard-working Latino and immigrant families who live in Virginia and who contribute to the state’s vibrant communities.By supporting and campaigning for Ed Gillespie, Martinez and Rubio are validating his racist attacks against Latinos. Anyone who is on the fence about voting for Gillespie can be swayed into thinking that his campaign ads are not dangerous to Latinos because two prominent Latinos are supporting him. Latinos who may not be familiar with Gillespie’s campaign ads and who hear Rubio and Martinez praising him on the campaign trail can easily vote against their own interests. In addition to validating racist attacks, Rubio and Martinez are helping elect a candidate whose policies will have a negative effect on the everyday lives of Latino and immigrant communities. Gillespie is an extremist who is already using Trump’s brand of fear-mongering and race-baiting to win the election. If he is elected governor, he will divide the state of Virginia and propose legislation that will hurt Latinos and immigrants in the same way Trump has done since he took office.When Rubio and Martinez speak kind words of Gillespie, when they urge Virginians ―including many Latinos ― to vote for him, they will contribute to the Latino community’s oppression. They will be complicit in a divisive, race-baiting tactic that hurts Latinos, their very own people, in Virginia and in the entire country. While one can argue that Rubio and Martinez are Republicans and that they have the duty to support their party, one would have also hoped that they would have chosen to call out racism and bigotry when they encountered it. They didn’t. Instead, they chose silence and complacency. They chose to run toward the fire instead of away from it, and they chose not to help put it out, but to fan the flames even more."

Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.), told a crowded conference room in the Cobo Center on Saturday, to loud applause. Some 4,000 women had traveled to Detroit for three days of panels, training sessions and marquee speeches — all part of the first major women’s convention in the United States in 40 years.Sanders, who has spoken about her own experiences with discrimination on the campaign trail, led a panel called, “94 percent voted against Trump: following black women in 2018.”The message was clear: For Democrats and progressives to win future elections, white women must do better.Fifty-three percent of white women who voted in the 2016 presidential election voted for Donald Trump. Meanwhile, 94 percent of black women who voted chose Hillary Clinton. “So many times when I look for sisterhood from white women, I don’t find it,” said panelist Brittany Packnett, an activist and vice president of National Community Alliances with Teach for America. “It wasn’t just missing on Nov. 8.”Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, praised the racial mix of the women who’d opted to attend the panel on Saturday morning. There was a fairly even split between white women and women of color.But while the mood in the room was warm and enthusiastic, with attendees frequently breaking out in cheers, Campbell argued the white women present couldn’t simply pat themselves on the back if they did not vote for President Trump.“You may not have,” she said. “But did your cousin?” Campbell urged them to have those conversations, and to continue having them no matter how uncomfortable they become.“I thought it was really interesting and informative and I learned so many things that I feel like I can take forward in my own work,” Natalie Welland, 25, who had come to the convention from Canada, said after the panel. Welland, who is white, said she appreciated the message that white women do not have to apologize for their privilege, but they must use it.“It’s about, ‘just do the work,’” she said. “It was important for me to go to that [panel] because I wanted to make sure that white women understand why we are upset,” said Erica Fuller, who is a black 25-year-old, from Portland, Oregon.“These are the types of conversations I’ve been having for years,” she continued. “But one of the things that feels new this year is that because we actually have statistics showing how white women voted for Trump, it’s clear that we’re not pulling this out of our behinds.”Several sessions at the convention took direct aim at the role white women play in propping up white privilege. On Friday, some 200 women took part in a discussion called “Confronting White Womanhood,” in which they were urged to “unpack the ways white women uphold and benefit from white supremacy.” At the panel on Saturday morning, the wide-ranging discussion frequently turned to criticism of the Democratic party, and how it can better support black women voters and black women candidates. Panelists called the party “out of touch” and said it would not be enough to simply replace white male legislators with white women.“The Democratic party is too male,” said Letitia James, public advocate for the City of New York and the first woman of color to hold citywide office in the city. “It’s too pale and too stale.”"

The individual runs from the area after Mitchell is shot. Police uploaded the video Thursday and have referred to the person of interest as a man, but it’s impossible to know for certain from the footage the person’s gender or age.Police believe either the person was involved in the shooting or may have witnessed something that could be valuable to investigators, Tampa Police Interim Chief Brian Dugan told WFTS-TV. Even the individual’s apparent habit of flipping a cell phone might be a clue to the person’s identity, Dugan told CNN.Police believe Mitchell, 32-year-old Monica Hoffa, and 20-year-old Anthony Naiboa may have been targeted at random by a serial killer because they didn’t know each, weren’t killed during robberies, and were all shot within a mile radius near bus stops in Tampa’s Seminole Heights neighborhood. Officials are determined to find the killer and end the shootings. “Bring his head to me,” Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn told police earlier this week, according to the Orlando Sentinel. “Let’s get this done.”Police released other surveillance footage of the same person earlier this month. The video clips all show a person walking with a very straight back but with a casual gait, flicking a cell phone. The new footage shows the person running with long, effortless strides after Mitchell was shot."

They were having a potluck for Memorial Day, and about a dozen neighbors were gathered around, cold beer in one hand and camera in the other. That’s how it used to be here, before the storm. Five years after Superstorm Sandy, Wren’s family is one of the few left in this windswept fishing village on the Delaware Bay. Homes along the Nantuxent Creek side, where Wren has lived in a weathered two-story house since 1997, were spared much of the worst damage.But houses facing the bay ― many of them weekend or summer cottages for folks who live in Philadelphia, about 60 miles north ― took a beating and now sit abandoned, the boardwalks to their doors rotten and cement septic tanks sitting in the open. “The thing that’s most different, most changed post-Sandy, is the camaraderie of the weekenders and summer people coming down to enjoy the place,” Wren told HuffPost on Thursday afternoon from a picnic table in her front yard, looking out toward the dock where the eagle landed. “It’s a beautiful place to be. But it doesn’t feel like a neighborhood of people enjoying it anymore.”The $1.8 billion in federal grants promised to New Jersey for relief after the storm went to the nine worst-hit counties. Cumberland County, where Money Island is located, didn’t meet the threshold for damage to qualify. The county received nothing from state funds such as the Stronger NJ revitalization program, Stronger NJ Business grants or the Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Elevation funds. In October 2013, Gov. Chris Christie’s administration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced plans to build 32 new beach and dune construction projects along 44 miles of the state’s coastline ― none of them along the Delaware Bay, The Star-Ledger reported at the time. Part of the problem is that Cumberland came up just short of the the federal threshold of 1 percent tax assessment losses, even though at least four of the county’s townships lost 8 percent to 10 percent. Wren, who now leads an effort to petition the state for more funding, said Money Island lost 10 percent. The bulk of Cumberland’s population lives inland, in towns like Millville, Bridgeton and Vineland, skewing the damage statistics against places like Money Island. By contrast, New Jersey’s wealthier Atlantic shore, where many high-priced waterfront properties proliferated over the past century, saw tremendous and statistically significant destruction. In Toms River, for example, roughly 10,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. In 2015, the Federal Emergency Management Agency boasted that most of the boardwalks on New Jersey’s storm-ravaged Atlantic shore had been rebuilt with more than $115 million in recovery spending. In Toms River, where roughly 10,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, more than 2,000 homes have been demolished and are being rebuilt, and an additional 1,200 are being elevated, according to The New York Times.The debate over which communities get to rebuild and which are forced to retreat as climate change causes seas to rise and violent storms to become more frequent appears to have reached a conclusion before places like Money Island ever got to voice their say. “It seems pretty clear that the official stance of the Christie administration on the Bayshore communities is that they’re eventually going to have to be abandoned,” Nate Kleinman, a political organizer who worked with Occupy Sandy after the storm, told HuffPost. “They don’t want to put any more money in them than they absolutely have to.”The state of New Jersey has offered to buy 28 of roughly 40 homes on Money Island, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer, with plans to demolish them and let the area return to its natural, pre-development state. The Nature Conservancy has a big presence in the area, tracking more than 100 species of birds and 200 species of fish. But Wren said responsible stewardship has long included people living nearby. Bird watchers, for instance, might want to enjoy some coffee or lunch, or stay in a nearby hotel, she said. The Money Island Marina has been exploring other business ventures to account for the drop in fishermen visiting during the summer. Bruce Muenker, who manages the shop, told HuffPost he’s begun raising soft-shell crabs and shipping cooked crabs to restaurants in the region.“We need to branch off,” he said. The destroyed homes come with their own problems for the area. The unearthed septic tanks, some of which sit cocked to one side, half buried in sand at low tide, put the $23 million annual shellfish harvesting industry at risk, according to a 2014 study by the state Department of Environmental Protection. On Thursday, oystermen could be seen hauling fresh catches from their ships with cranes near Wren’s home. To be sure, the pain left by the storm lingers beyond the neglected Bayshore. A year ago, the New Jersey Resource Project, a bipartisan group founded by Sandy survivors, kicked off a months-long effort to document the ongoing recovery in areas of New Jersey hit hardest by the storm, including Atlantic City, Little Egg Harbor and Manahawkin.“We came across a lot of heartache and pain,” Amanda Devecka-Rinear, the group’s founder, told HuffPost.The results are compiled in a lengthy report released this month and titled “The Long Road Home.” Of the nearly 500 households surveyed, 56 percent reported having trouble paying bills or affording food and gas in the wake of the storm. Seventy-seven percent did not have sufficient funds to rebuild their homes, with many being forced to borrow against retirement savings. Household incomes suffered. People fell behind on mortgage payments. And 67 percent of those with high school- or college-aged children said college plans have been scaled back.Perhaps most concerning, 18 percent of respondents had yet to return home at the time of the survey, according to the findings.Along with triggering financial troubles, the disaster appears to have taken a toll on human health. More than 70 percent of those surveyed claimed to suffer from new or worsening physical or mental health issues, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. And 19 percent said they have developed new or increased dependence on drugs or alcohol.As extreme weather and flooding become more frequent and devastating, Devecka-Rinear said, “there’s going to be an overlap between the fallout of these disasters and other disasters we face as a society.” But she — and 57 percent of those surveyed — is not convinced the country is better prepared for natural disasters.“You never know when a disaster like this is going to come for you,” she said. “We all have a stake in making sure that recovery programs work for families — not contractors, not big insurance corporations. That we don’t hurt folks on the long road home, which is what’s been happening.”"

The Martino brothers played by James Franco, meanwhile, have largely moved the other sex workers of Times Square yore off the streets; instead, they’ve taken up at indoor parlors operating under the eye of a corrupt police force.Among those women is Darlene (Dominique Fishback), who is also realizing she may have erred in bringing another girl, Bernice, back with her from the small-town South. Bernice (Andrea-Rachel Parker) is not adjusting well to Darlene’s lifestyle, in large part because Darlene had told her she worked as a model, not in the sex industry. Speaking to HuffPost, Fishback stressed that sort of thing actually happens in real life ― even if fans weren’t happy about seeing it on screen.“A lot of times there are young women who bring other young girls into the life. That’s a huge part,” the actress said, adding, “There’s a psychology of it all.”“I even put on my Instagram a picture ― because people were so upset with Darlene ― I put up a picture and said, ‘Let’s talk about it. How are you feeling about it?’ So it kind of started up a discussion, which I really liked. That’s what I love about art.”Fishback thinks the situation with Bernice will make Darlene reconsider her own outlook on the lifestyle. “She has to have a tougher exterior,” Fishback said. “She’s a caring person. But I think that she likes it better when it’s every man or every woman for themselves. She’s been doing all right, in her mind, and then she brings this girl, and people are thinking she’s responsible for her well-being. Darlene never thought that when she brought her back. She thought it was going to be like, ‘You come here, you do a job, and that’s it.’ I think she also didn’t consider the fact that everybody is not built the same way. She’s like, ‘I know I come from a small town, but if I’m able to survive in the city, then she could be able to do it, too.’” Read on for more from Fishback about Darlene’s evolution, her relationship with pimp Larry Brown (Gbenga Akinnagbe) and why she moved up north in the first place.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.So creator David Simon approached you specifically about this project. What did you do to prepare for it?I read a book. They gave us a book called Gentlemen of Leisure: A Year in the Life of a Pimp, a chronological story of a year with a pimp and four of his women. They all had different perspectives; they all had different relationships with him. I was able to really get into the mind and the experience. You know, I was wondering: Do they love their pimp? Are they in love with them? Do they just love them as family? Are they just friends? What is keeping them so hooked in this situation I didn’t understand?I also watched a documentary called “Iceberg Slim,” which is from the perspective of a pimp. The book was more from the women, but knowing what the pimp thought and how he would manipulate women and get them was really good insight for me as an actress. Not for Darlene to know but for me to know as an actress.And then I would also give music to each scene that would get me in an emotional state that I needed to be in, especially when there are so many things going on.I heard you say that women who are or were in the sex industry have been reaching out. How does that affect you?It just reassures me why I’m doing what I do, and why I’m supposed to do a role like this. It’s not very easy to say, “Yeah, I’m gonna do this.” You don’t know how people are going to respond to it. You don’t know how the season is going to carry on. I’m just glad that I trust David Simon and George Pelecanos and Nina Noble to give full characters and stories, so that made it easier for me to do, but for someone to tell me that my art has affected them, or they could hear their voice through the characters, that’s pretty much all I really wanted to do.I wanted to use my instrument to tell stories that really matter, and to give voice to people who don’t often get it. In a lot of my art ― I have a one-woman show and I wrote a screenplay ― that aspect of who I am as an artist is so important. So when people realize it or appreciate it, it just makes me feel good and I want to continue in that direction.Have you gotten any feedback, as an actress, from them?I haven’t gotten any feedback. They’ve just said thank you for bringing humanity to [Darlene]. One woman said, “In the work that I do, I care a lot.” And so when [Darlene] shows care for another person, whether it’s the john or not, she just understands that so well and is glad that it’s shown on TV that there’s love and care and kindness, as well, from their perspective. We see the imbalance of power between pimps and sex workers play out through the show. How would you characterize the relationship between Darlene and the pimp Larry?I would say that it’s a growing and evolving relationship, just like any relationship. In the beginning, you see them, and you think that he has all this power and this control, and she believes that, as well. But as the season goes on, you see her knowing that she’s getting away with things that she never thought she would. When she’s truthful and honest, she’s been able to avoid any consequences that she thought she’d have.So, from watching the movie with the john and just confessing, like, “Yeah, I fell asleep. So whatever you need to do.” That turned it around for him, and he went, “Well, I’m not going to [punish her] now.” She realizes slowly that she’s gaining more control, and then when she goes to bring a girl back, and she lies about [her job in New York], you see how it backfires for her?Yeah, badly.It’s so crazy, because I’ve been watching and she’s really so honest. She’s been honest with Louis [a client of Darlene’s] about needing more money, she’s been honest for the most part all around. And then all of a sudden, she chooses to lie and say she’s a model. So now, I’m like, OK, what is this. It’s not normal for her character to do this, but it backfires completely and now she’s wishing she hadn’t. So maybe she’ll continue to be honest. You made up your own backstory for Darlene ― could you explain what that is, and why she moved to New York in the first place?Sure, so obviously, the writers didn’t give us the backstories.But later we see how she’s from a small town.Yeah, but even from the beginning I never knew that! I only knew that she was from the South, you know? And then it kind of played out that way, where she was bored and just trying to play with the hands that she was dealt, but couldn’t survive that way. She felt smothered and suffocated and knew that she had to express herself in a different way. So she moves to New York, and I think that she wanted to be an actress, and that’s why she watches old films with one of her johns, and why she’s reading the book from the film, and then she role-plays with another john. That really lends itself to her wanting to be an actress.As I know as an actress, it’s not that easy to have your dreams come true always in the way that you want them to. I’ve been fortunate enough that mine has panned out great, so I’m thankful. But it’s not always like that. So I think that she just kind of got deterred from what she originally wanted to do, and Larry ― just like how C.C.

The Martino brothers played by James Franco, meanwhile, have largely moved the other sex workers of Times Square yore off the streets; instead, they’ve taken up at indoor parlors operating under the eye of a corrupt police force.Among those women is Darlene (Dominique Fishback), who is also realizing she may have erred in bringing another girl, Bernice, back with her from the small-town South. Bernice (Andrea-Rachel Parker) is not adjusting well to Darlene’s lifestyle, in large part because Darlene had told her she worked as a model, not in the sex industry. Speaking to HuffPost, Fishback stressed that sort of thing actually happens in real life ― even if fans weren’t happy about seeing it on screen.“A lot of times there are young women who bring other young girls into the life. That’s a huge part,” the actress said, adding, “There’s a psychology of it all.”“I even put on my Instagram a picture ― because people were so upset with Darlene ― I put up a picture and said, ‘Let’s talk about it. How are you feeling about it?’ So it kind of started up a discussion, which I really liked. That’s what I love about art.”Fishback thinks the situation with Bernice will make Darlene reconsider her own outlook on the lifestyle. “She has to have a tougher exterior,” Fishback said. “She’s a caring person. But I think that she likes it better when it’s every man or every woman for themselves. She’s been doing all right, in her mind, and then she brings this girl, and people are thinking she’s responsible for her well-being. Darlene never thought that when she brought her back. She thought it was going to be like, ‘You come here, you do a job, and that’s it.’ I think she also didn’t consider the fact that everybody is not built the same way. She’s like, ‘I know I come from a small town, but if I’m able to survive in the city, then she could be able to do it, too.’” Read on for more from Fishback about Darlene’s evolution, her relationship with pimp Larry Brown (Gbenga Akinnagbe) and why she moved up north in the first place.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.So creator David Simon approached you specifically about this project. What did you do to prepare for it?I read a book. They gave us a book called Gentlemen of Leisure: A Year in the Life of a Pimp, a chronological story of a year with a pimp and four of his women. They all had different perspectives; they all had different relationships with him. I was able to really get into the mind and the experience. You know, I was wondering: Do they love their pimp? Are they in love with them? Do they just love them as family? Are they just friends? What is keeping them so hooked in this situation I didn’t understand?I also watched a documentary called “Iceberg Slim,” which is from the perspective of a pimp. The book was more from the women, but knowing what the pimp thought and how he would manipulate women and get them was really good insight for me as an actress. Not for Darlene to know but for me to know as an actress.And then I would also give music to each scene that would get me in an emotional state that I needed to be in, especially when there are so many things going on.I heard you say that women who are or were in the sex industry have been reaching out. How does that affect you?It just reassures me why I’m doing what I do, and why I’m supposed to do a role like this. It’s not very easy to say, “Yeah, I’m gonna do this.” You don’t know how people are going to respond to it. You don’t know how the season is going to carry on. I’m just glad that I trust David Simon and George Pelecanos and Nina Noble to give full characters and stories, so that made it easier for me to do, but for someone to tell me that my art has affected them, or they could hear their voice through the characters, that’s pretty much all I really wanted to do.I wanted to use my instrument to tell stories that really matter, and to give voice to people who don’t often get it. In a lot of my art ― I have a one-woman show and I wrote a screenplay ― that aspect of who I am as an artist is so important. So when people realize it or appreciate it, it just makes me feel good and I want to continue in that direction.Have you gotten any feedback, as an actress, from them?I haven’t gotten any feedback. They’ve just said thank you for bringing humanity to [Darlene]. One woman said, “In the work that I do, I care a lot.” And so when [Darlene] shows care for another person, whether it’s the john or not, she just understands that so well and is glad that it’s shown on TV that there’s love and care and kindness, as well, from their perspective.

73,POLITICS,Why Nazis And White Supremacists Are Putting The Fear In Middle Tennessee This Weekend,Luke O'Brien,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazis-white-supremacists-fear-in-middle-tennessee_us_59f3f2f5e4b07fdc5fbe585c,"""So... what brings you to town?""",2017-10-28,"Matthew Heimbach, seen here after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is head of the Traditionalist Worker Party.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f3fe17150000ad52747d6b.jpeg?cache=I6ii5kiwvl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MURFREESBORO, Tenn. ― In post-Charlottesville America, any large gathering of racists and fascists becomes both spectacle and specter. The threat of violence is omnipresent. Locals must “brace” themselves for “chaos and bloodshed.” Everyone dreads “another Charlottesville.” Dread is what Nazis want.In two small cities near Nashville in Middle Tennessee, the fear was palpable ahead of two “White Lives Matter” rallies here on Saturday.“So ... what brings you to town?” a wary clerk asked guests as they checked into a hotel in Murfreesboro, home to Middle Tennessee State University and 132,000 residents, where one rally will be held Saturday afternoon outside the Rutherford County Courthouse. I heard some version of this question three times before I’d even found my room.In nearby Shelbyville, a town of 21,000 south of Murfreesboro in Tennessee horse country, another rally ― organized by the same racists and fascists ― is scheduled for Saturday morning. Many Shelbyville residents will stay indoors or clear out altogether, according to local police.The concern is well-founded. Among the groups assembling in Tennessee this weekend is the League of the South, a Southern separatist organization involved in some of the more garish violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. There, one of the group’s leaders, Michael Tubbs, a hulking former Green Beret who did a prison stint for plotting to bomb Jewish and black-owned businesses, led a charge of his followers toward peaceful clergy members.The National Socialist Movement is also here, with their refashioned flags. (In an attempt to appeal to a broader audience, the flag’s swastika has been replaced with the Elder Futhark Odal rune.) So is the Traditionalist Worker Party, which often collaborates with both the NSM and the League of the South and is led by Matt Heimbach, whose declared strategy is to do food giveaways and coat drives to win the hearts and minds of what he considers downtrodden white America in the hope of eventually running his own political candidates in Appalachia and other redoubts of Herrenvolk (master race) welfare-statism. Vanguard America will be here, too, according to rally organizers. That’s the group James A. Fields Jr. was with on the day he drove his car into a crowd in Charlottesville and killed Heather Heyer.These are hardly the happy travelers who prompt towns to throw wide their doors. “It’s supposed to be cold and rainy,” said a woman with the Shelbyville Police Department who did not wish to be named. “A lot of these people will just melt away, hopefully.”But that was unlikely. One reason white supremacists exercise their First Amendment rights in places where they’re not wanted is because provocation is just as much their goal as hateful proclamation. Even the potential for violence attracts attention, which is also what Nazis want. Fox, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and many other media outlets had contacted the Shelbyville police ahead of Saturday’s rally. Even ABC Australia had been in touch. I heard a video team from TV Asahi in Japan was roaming around Murfreesboro. And in a Panera near my hotel, I found myself seated near a film crew talking about Charlottesville and “Wolfenstein II,” a counterfactual video game set in 1961 in which the user battles a Nazi regime that conquered the United States in World War II.But discerning the motives of far-right extremists and the danger they pose can be difficult. The rally in Shelbyville, which will take place on a sidewalk in a location that can be easily secured, is an opportunity for them to hold forth on white grievance. Murfreesboro is where they might try to pick a fight.“Shelbyville is where we want to get our message out to working-class white constituents about the opioid epidemic and refugee resettlement and how capitalism has failed them,” Heimbach said. “Murfreesboro is a different environment with a college. I’m going to focus on how the far left is being used by the capitalist system.”Shelbyville has been depicted in some far-right media outlets as being overrun by Shariah-practicing Somali refugees, evoking one of the great demographic boogeymen fabricated by white supremacists to stoke bias and hate. “Southern demographic displacement” was the theme of League of the South rallies held in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro in 2013. On Saturday, the racists will be back, harping on the same issue.“You have mosques and businesses going up that don’t reflect the general culture. It’s redefining the community,” Heimbach said. “That’s not what Middle Tennessee needs or wants.”The area has experienced some demographic change. Mexicans work in the horse industry. Somalis work at the nearby Tyson Foods chicken processing plant. And a mosque outside Murfreesboro opened in 2012, after several threats and much Republican dog-whistling. In July, two men defaced the building with graffiti and profanity written with strips of raw bacon.The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has decided to cancel services and religious classes at the mosque this weekend due to the White Lives Matter rally. The members here are concerned about violence, especially after witnessing what happened in Charlottesville.“It’s that you are living like a hostage in your own town and city that you’ve lived in and loved so many years,” Dr. Saleh M. Sbenaty, a professor at Middle Tennessee State University who is a member of the mosque, told HuffPost. “This is not the U.S. we know of, and I hope this is not the way from now on. It’s unbelievable.”Despite the racial anxieties stoked by the likes of Heimbach, Middle Tennessee is hardly turning into the Horn of Africa. Over the last 15 years, Shelbyville has taken in just 51 refugees, 47 of them Somali, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center. In recent years, the Somali refugee population in Shelbyville has actually declined, according to Shelbyville Police Chief Jan Phillips.The White Lives Matter rally organizers either are unaware of the demographic data or don’t care. They need little pretext to invade communities with their gripes, another of which has to do with a deadly church shooting in September in Antioch, also near Nashville, carried out by a black man.On Friday evening, Jeff Schoep, the head of NSM, met HuffPost at a hotel parking lot in the Nashville area. Three other NSM members, two of them armed, stood by his side. Schoep said he was upset that the shooting at the church in Antioch, which killed one person, didn’t get as much national media attention as the far deadlier mass shooting in 2015 at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine people. Schoep was in a hurry. He had a “meeting” at 6 p.m., but wouldn’t tell HuffPost who was attending the meeting or what it was about.Rumors were circulating earlier in the week about a tiki torch march Friday night, perhaps targeting Middle Tennessee State University, where a building named after Nathaniel Bedford Forrest, a Confederate Army general and early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, has sparked controversy. (Shelbyville, as it so happens, is in Bedford County, which will be harder to rebrand.) Local anti-fascist organizations were prepared to confront the white supremacists there and in the public square the next day.But Nazis can be crafty. When they have a stage from which to preach, they try to attract as much attention as possible. When they want to be subversive, they take great pains to conceal their plans.“I think Murfreesboro is going to be the hot spot,” said Corey Lemley, a member of Nashville Anti-Racist Action, who noted that white supremacists blew up his mailbox with a small explosive a few months ago. “It’s going to be a heavy, heavy turnout to counter them.”Roads will be closed in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro on Saturday for the rallies. No weapons, masks or bags will be allowed in the rally areas. According to the sister of one Murfreesboro police officer, it is an all-hands-on-deck situation for the city’s police department and the county sheriff, who have partnered with federal and state law enforcement agencies, including the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, to guard against a repeat of the violence in Charlottesville.It used to be that you could ignore white supremacists until they went away. In 2013, the League of the South could muster only 30 racists at its Shelbyville rally.“They were here for about an hour and then they left,” said the woman with the local police department who did not wish to be named. But things are different now when the Nazis come to town.About 200 miles north of here in March 2016, Heimbach, wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat, shoved a black protester at a campaign rally for Donald Trump, drawing an assault charge for his trouble. Heimbach was giddy for Trump back then, contending that a Manhattan oligarch might somehow be a populist answer for the country.Now Heimbach has pivoted. “Donald Trump is not one of us,” he says. “We can’t trust a New York billionaire to bring social and economic justice to poor folks.”But why, aside from racism, would a poor white person trust a 20-something outsider whose broken political judgment had led him to go all stormtrooper for a plutocrat who stiffs small-business owners? Heimbach didn’t have a good answer: “We’re here to present an alternative. There’s Republican and Democrat and we want to be another option.”It’s not an option Middle Tennessee appears to want.Christopher Mathias contributed reporting from Murfreesboro. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

The actress has posted breast pump photos, pushed back against breastfeeding shamers and shared a hilarious story about skipping pumping for a role.While promoting “A Bad Moms Christmas” on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Bell and her co-stars shared another nursing story. Mila Kunis explained that during their first table read for the movie, Bell was at her home in Los Angeles and called in via Skype.“K-Bell’s just on a giant screen Skyped in,” Kunis recalled. “And as we’re reading the script, you see her face just getting closer and closer into the screen, and the rest of her body just keeps kind of getting out of the screen ... just a giant face!”“And then you hear this,” Kunis added, launching into an impression of the sound of a breast pump. “I didn’t know I was on a movie projector. I would have loved a heads-up,” Bell chimed in. “And I was home because I wasn’t going early because I still had a little one, and I needed to pump. I’m sorry. When you gotta do it, you gotta do it.”Apparently Kunis and her other co-star Kathryn Hahn knew exactly what was going on. “The boys in the room were like, ‘There’s static on that, can we check that call line?’ Mila and Kathryn were like ‘She’s fine, it’s fine! Let’s just keep rehearsing.’” Bell recalled. “They were covering for me!”Bell wasn’t the only “A Bad Moms Christmas” star to share a funny parenting anecdote on the show.Hahn shared her “bad mom confessions” ― including a close call with a hair tourniquet (“Almost castrated my son!”) and a lavender bath gone wrong (“Literally grabbing frozen washcloths!”).Keep it real, ladies.

Dr. Ali died this week at the absurd age of 42 only a few months after what at first seemed an innocent irritation in the chest proved to be a cancer that defied all treatments. I am sharing shock and sadness and a sense of something like dizziness with many of the best people I know as we figure out how to react to this hole torn in the world.Many of you, of course, won’t know Dr. Ali, but he’s important to you just the same. He represents the very best of what modern medicine could, and should be. The credential most prominently associated with Ather is the ND degree, a doctoral degree in natural medicine, or naturopathy. In certain quarters, that evokes a warm glow of appreciation, but as I know well- it evokes something else entirely among the more staunchly conventional. The concern espoused there is that an emphasis on natural medicine pulls us away from science and evidence.To be fair, those critics are not always wrong; there are misguided excesses in either direction. Some practitioners subordinate evidence to personal belief or preference, just as some subordinate the human art of medicine to unduly rigid interpretations of science applied to the uncertainties of clinical care.Ather was neither of these. He had an undergraduate degree in psychobiology (the biological basis for psychology, essentially neuroscience) from UCLA, and two masters degrees, both from Yale. One of these was in chronic disease epidemiology, the other in patient-oriented research.So, yes, Ather was devoted to kinder, gentler, and more holistic treatment options whenever possible, but never without regard for scientific evidence. Over the currents of modern healthcare’s troubled waters, where the competing priorities of art and science, reductionism and holism, evidence and empathy roil- Ather was the bridge.We met nearly a decade and a half ago, shortly after Ather completed his training in naturopathic medicine (a 4-year program) at Bastyr University. He was at first my resident in one of the nation’s few post-graduate training programs in integrative medicine, ours specifically in evidence-based integrative medicine, and exclusively for naturopathic physicians. The rather famous program long overseen by Dr. Andrew Weil at the University of Arizona trains conventional health practitioners in the various approaches to natural medicine. Our intent was to come at this issue from the other direction, training naturopaths to appreciate conventional, modern approaches, and the underlying evidence.In both cases, the goal was and is to offer patients a wider spectrum of responsible options, and to help more people get better.Ather epitomized the possibilities in this still rarefied space, and with credentials even those most inclined to consign all but the most orthodox of conventional practices to the realm they derisively call “woo,” would find hard to disparage. We published our first peer-reviewed paper together more than a decade ago. Ather went on to publish dozens of peer-reviewed papers, playing a lead role in NIH-funded research demonstrating the effectiveness of massage therapy for osteoarthritis. He secured a coveted K Award from the National Institutes of Health, funding dedicated to his personal development as a clinical researcher. Just a month ago, Dr. Ali and colleagues published results of an important study of individualized diets for irritable bowel syndrome, which garnered high profile, and well-deserved media attention.Among the many roles he was playing at Yale at the time of his death (I confess, I have trouble even typing that), Ather was Medical Director of Integrative Medicine at the renowned Smilow Cancer Hospital. Ironically, and seemingly in the blink of an eye, he became a patient in the very program he helped establish, and oversaw.Why tell of this to those of you not privileged to know Dr. Ali? For two reasons.First, when a genuine trailblazer falls, in the fullness of time or long before their full measure of it as in this case, it falls to the rest of us to keep the trail open. Ather worked tirelessly to renounce the false choice between responsible use of evidence, and responsiveness to every need of the patient. He worked to broaden the spectrum of treatment options, while resisting the inclination to fall fatuously in love with any. He worked hard at the intricacies of science, and to be consummately gentle in all the intimacies of patient care. The trail is still there. It falls to us to tend it.The other, general message in this tale of both triumph and disaster has to do with the probabilities of prevention, and the potential primacy of outrageous fortune. I routinely write about the incredible power of lifestyle over our medical destinies, the potential to add years to our lives and life to our years. I write about our capacity to use what we know to prevent some 80% of all chronic disease and premature death, to slash our personal risk of the same. All of this is true. I am board certified in my convictions in the power of prevention.But that power is not absolute. Dr. Ali and I were friends. I know that he never smoked, and did not drink. He ate a wholesome diet. He exercised routinely. He was quite expert at stress reduction methods, and natively peaceful. He gave sleep the respect it warrants, and had a large, strong, diverse network of friends and a loving family- his beautiful wife and two children. He did everything right, and got the wrong outcome anyway.This is a reminder and a reality check for us all. Prevention is powerful, but imperfectly so. Health outcomes are not merit-based. We are reminded not to blame the victims of calamity, not to think people get what they “deserve.” We are reminded to be humble, to respect our ineluctable fragility. Prevention, and lifestyle as medicine, are ultimately arbiters of probability, not certainty. We should not forsake their power, for most of us will be beneficiaries of it. But no one of us will ever get a guarantee.Perhaps that tells of the need to strike the right balance between protecting tomorrow, and relishing today. In the turbulence of strong emotion, I am still seeking for lessons and meaning.All I know for sure right now is that too soon, too young, a bright light has been extinguished from the world. The rest of us must strive for the light of meaning in it, to defend against the darkness.-finDavid L.

Coverage with the first of two required doses of measles vaccine has stalled around 85 percent since 2009, it said, short of the 95 percent needed. Coverage with the second dose was only 64 percent in 2016.“We must strive to reach zero measles cases,” said Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, the director of the WHO’s immunisation department. “Measles elimination will only be reached if measles vaccines reach every child, everywhere.”M&RI is a partnership of the American Red Cross, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Foundation, the UNICEF children’s fund, and the WHO.Its report said that since 2000, an estimated 5.5 billion doses of measles vaccine have been provided to children in routine immunisation services and mass vaccination campaigns.It added, however, that some 20.8 million children are still missing their first measles vaccine dose.More than half of these unvaccinated children live in six countries: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.It said large outbreaks of measles continue to occur in those countries as well as others in Europe and North America, putting children at risk of severe health complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, encephalitis, blindness, and death.Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI global vaccine alliance, welcomed the decline in measles deaths.But he added: “We cannot afford to be complacent. Too many children are still missing out on lifesaving vaccines. To reach these children and set ourselves on a realistic road to measles elimination we need to dramatically improve routine immunization backed by strong health systems.”(Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Larry King)"

Immediately after news of the Catalan vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil.The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.The independence push has caused deep resentment around Spain. The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from Catalonia and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy.

Immediately after news of the Catalan vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil.The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.The independence push has caused deep resentment around Spain. The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from Catalonia and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed.In Barcelona, Jordi Cases, 52, a farmer from Lleida province who had driven down with his family for the protest, said he was excited but worried about what came next.“Now the repression is going to be terrible but we have to take what we can.
