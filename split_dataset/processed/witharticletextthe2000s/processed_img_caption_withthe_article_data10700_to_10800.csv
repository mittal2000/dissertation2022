Webb also participated in a plea deal with U.S. authorities. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fe4d741400001f00a9b8af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The organization that governs soccer in much of the Americas has slapped its former leaders with a $20 million lawsuit for fraud.The Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football, or CONCACAF — which sends teams from that region to compete in the World Cup — named its former general secretary, Chuck Blazer, and its former president, Jack Warner, in a suit filed last week in the U.S. Eastern District of New York. The suit also names some of Blazer’s shell companies.“There can be no doubt that Warner and Blazer victimized CONCACAF, stealing and defrauding it out of tens of millions of dollars in brazen acts of corruption for their own personal benefit,” the suit states. “The defendants sought to pillage CONCACAF from the inside, seeking endless ways to embezzle funds from the organization.”The charges come in the wake of a major Department of Justice investigation into years of corruption in international soccer.Blazer pleaded guilty in 2013 to racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud and tax evasion ― all linked to kickbacks he received in exchange for media rights and tournament marketing contracts, as well as bribes involving the 1998 and 2010 World Cups and several Gold Cup tournaments. In 2015, Warner was named in a massive Justice Department indictment against members of the global soccer body FIFA, sports marketing executives and leaders of national soccer organizations. He is fighting extradition from Trinidad and Tobago to face U.S. charges of criminal racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering, among other offenses.The CONCACAF lawsuit says it aims to recoup the bribes and the “millions of dollars in commissions and fees through marketing and broadcast deals that CONCACAF’s executive committee did not authorize.”After becoming general secretary in 1990, Blazer moved CONCACAF’s headquarters from the Caribbean to the 11th floor of Trump Tower in New York City until he was ejected from his post in 2011 as officials became suspicious of his activities. He also lived in Trump Tower at the time, and allegedly added an adjoining apartment there for his cats. Once the FBI and IRS nabbed Blazer in 2011, he agreed to cooperate with the feds as part of his plea negotiations. Intelligence agencies tapped phone calls to Blazer’s home to glean information for later criminal indictments related to corruption in international soccer.The recent CONCACAF lawsuit accuses Blazer of using the organization’s funds to cover his Trump Tower rent and to buy two condos in Miami Beach and another in the Bahamas. Such funds were “intended for the development programs for football, not to support Blazer’s luxurious personal lifestyle,” the suit states.Warner “aided and abetted” Blazer’s schemes, according to the lawsuit. Blazer has admitted in court that he “and others” agreed to accept a $10 million bribe for voting in favor of holding the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. At the time, both men were on FIFA’s executive committee, which determined where future World Cups would be held.It’s unclear whether Warner will ever be brought to the U.S. to face charges. In 2015, he recaptured media attention when he took out a Trinidadian television ad to denounce John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” segment about him, mistaking it for a serious news program (and giving Oliver even more fodder).Blazer, who is reportedly now in hospice care, agreed to forfeit at least $2 million as part of his guilty plea and still faces additional penalties. His testimony or recordings of his wiretapped conversations could be part of future trials involving former soccer and sports marketing officials.Neither Blazer nor Warner could be reached for comment.

1,POLITICS,EPA Quietly Asked The Public Which Clean Air Rules To Cut. Industry Answered Loudest.,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-clean-air-public-comment_us_58fe2c1be4b00fa7de1665cb,How many working people are able to sit through a three-hour call on a Monday morning?,2017-04-24,"President Donald Trump, left, is greeted by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, right, prior to signing an Energy Independence Executive Order on March 28, 2017. The order reverses the Obama-era climate change policies.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fe2d142600004500c475dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A utility lobbyist called on regulators to do less work monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. An oil and gas lobbyist praised the Trump administration’s retreat from safeguards and urged federal rulemakers to limit regulations on carbon emissions and smog. A lobbyist for wood-product manufacturers complained about the “ever-tightening” public health standards for ozone pollution and asked regulators to change the permitting process. Those were just some of the requests made by industry advocates during a conference call Monday, when the Environmental Protection Agency held the first of several sessions to ask the public which rules should be eliminated under President Donald Trump’s executive order instructing agencies to slash regulations. The three-hour call, held by the Office of Air and Radiation, focused on clean air and ozone pollution rules.In March, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced plans to hold the public hearings, but environmental advocates say the agency scheduled the events with little notice, in some cases just days in advance.“New meetings appear on a website that the EPA has set up to coordinate the process, so unless you check it every day, it is easy to miss when a new hearing is announced,” Andrew Wetzler, deputy chief program officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote in a blog post ahead of Monday’s call. “All of this is made worse by the fact that EPA staff are offering only limited slots for in-person comments. In fact, some of the meetings aren’t public at all.”The EPA’s Office of Water, Wetzler noted, is offering an in-person meeting with local water agencies, but only offering a “virtual listening session” over the phone to the public.“And the deadline for the public to comment on rolling back all these crucial safeguards?” he added. “It ends in a mere three weeks.”The EPA has already taken drastic steps to gut a host of rules, claiming they hold back businesses and stymie job growth. In March, the agency scrapped a rule requiring oil and gas drillers to report methane emissions, a greenhouse gas up to 86 times more heat-trapping than carbon dioxide. A week later, the White House shredded an Obama-era EPA assessment of fuel efficiency standards, a move celebrated by automakers that claimed complying with the regulation cost too much. By the end of the month, Trump signed an executive order instructing the EPA to rewrite the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s embattled rule to reduce emissions from electrical utilities.“Regulations ought to make things regular,” Pruitt said in his first speech as EPA chief in February. “Regulations exist to give certainty to those they regulate. Those we regulate ought to know what’s expected of them so they can place and allocate resources to comply.”“Out of that process came a very robust and very responsible regulation and now we’re being asked to roll it back,” he said. “These are people’s lives. These are my children’s lives. This is the future of the planet. We cannot move backward on that. We need to have a strong, robust process, at least as robust as what we had in the past.”Another man slammed the agency for limiting the opportunities for public comment to a mere phone call on a weekday morning.“This process today has been extremely enlightening in how the new administration is completely curtailing and cutting out public comment by reducing this to a three-hour conference call on Monday, that no working person would be able to attend reasonably without being an activist in the space or a representative of a major corporate interest,” the man said, adding that his background is in economics. “This is not really fair and should be outright illegal.” “I’m horrified, absolutely horrified, at the degenerate level of contribution we’ve seen from representatives from industry who have seemingly no concern for the massive, sweeping deleterious effects that are about to be suffered nationwide, should this repeal happen the way it is about to happen,” he added. The operator promptly moved on to the next caller. "

Though UC Berkeley promises its students an environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, it had breached this promise through the repressive actions of University administrators and campus police, who have systematically and intentionally suppressed constitutionally-protected expression by Plaintiffs (and the many UC Berkeley students whose political viewpoints align with Plaintiffs), simply because that expression may anger or offend students, UC Berkeley administrators, and/or community members who do not share Plaintiffs’ viewpoints.The lawsuit uses the cancellation of Milo Yiannopoulos’ speaking engagement on the campus earlier this year as a reference point for the sort of speech the university is limiting. That event was canceled because of violent protests.You can read the entire filing here.As per Monday afternoon, UC Berkeley issued the following statement about the lawsuit: The University of California welcomes speakers of all political viewpoints and is committed to providing a forum to enable Ann Coulter to speak on the Berkeley campus. The allegation contained in the complaint filed by Young America’s Foundation that Ms. Coulter is being prohibited from speaking because of her conservative views is untrue. As the complaint itself notes, Young America’s Foundation has sponsored many other speaking events at UC Berkeley in past years, including that of conservative political commentator and author Ben Shapiro, and the organization’s efforts have led many notable conservatives to share their viewpoints with students and the public on campus. UC Berkeley has been working to accommodate a mutually agreeable time for Ms. Coulter’s visit – which has not yet been scheduled – and remains committed to doing so. The campus seeks to ensure that all members of the Berkeley and larger community – including Ms. Coulter herself – remain safe during such an event.This post has been updated."
3,MEDIA,Bill O'Reilly Promises Podcast Listeners They'll Be 'Shaken' By New Information,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-first-podcast_us_58fe4e6fe4b00fa7de16b068,"""I’m very confident the truth will come out.""",2017-04-24,Disgraced former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly returned to the public eye Monday with a new episode of his podcast. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fe78932600003596c47790.jpeg?cache=U5vPQZwxw7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his first time speaking publicly since he was unceremoniously ousted from Fox News last week, Bill O’Reilly resumed hosting duties on his nightly podcast Monday.O’Reilly opened his “No Spin News” podcast by promising his listeners that new details ― presumably ones redeeming him in his sexual harassment scandal ― are forthcoming.“I am sad that I’m not on television anymore,” he said. “I was very surprised how it all turned out. I can’t say a lot, because there’s much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I’m very confident the truth will come out, and when it does, I don’t know if you’re going to be surprised, but I think you’re going to be shaken, as I am. There’s a lot of stuff involved here.”He also introduced a new plan for the episodes, which had typically been around four minutes long. Going forward, O’Reilly said, the show will have about 12 to 15 minutes of news discussion and will eventually include on-air guests, becoming “longer and longer and longer, into a genuine news program.”O’Reilly spent the rest of the episode discussing President Donald Trump’s approval ratings, the French election, former President Barack Obama’s return to public life and the dustup over Ann Coulter’s speaking engagement at the University of California, Berkeley. The show, which is free this week but available only to paying subscribers starting May 1, last aired April 11, just days after an explosive New York Times report found that O’Reilly and Fox News had paid about $13 million in settlements to address complaints brought by five of his female former colleagues. The revelations led to a mass exodus of advertisers, protests outside Fox News headquarters and, ultimately, the network’s decision to cut ties with O’Reilly last Wednesday and ax his top-rated show, “The O’Reilly Factor.” O’Reilly categorically denied the accusations made in the Times’ story and lamented his ouster as the price of fame. “It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,” he said in statements last week. “But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today.”He walked away with a $25 million payout as part of his settlement to leave the network.In addition to continuing his podcast, O’Reilly has a speaking tour scheduled to start in June with Fox News personality Jesse Watters and comedian and political commentator Dennis Miller.Similar to complaints lodged against advertisers on “The O’Reilly Factor,” his “The Spin Stops Here” tour has been the subject of public outcry. More than 26,000 people have signed a petition urging the speaking venues in Anaheim, California; Westbury, New York; Tampa, Florida; Baltimore; and Las Vegas to cancel his appearances. "

5,POLITICS,Texas Republicans Try To Do To LGBTQ Rights What They Did To Abortion Access,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-republicans-try-to-do-to-lgbtq-rights-what-they-did-to-abortion-access_us_58fe67a4e4b018a9ce5dd464,"And ""often, the far-right strategies in Texas are exported to other states,"" one activist says.",2017-04-24,Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has argued LGBTQ-friendly bathroom laws could lead to increased assaults in bathrooms.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fe68421400002000a9b932.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Texas lawmakers have a history of finding ways to get around landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions. They tested Roe v. Wade by dramatically restricting abortion rights in the state, shuttering abortion clinics and forcing women to drive hundreds of miles to reach an abortion provider. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of marriage equality, Texas Republicans are trying a similar strategy to chip away at LGBTQ rights. This legislative session, they’ve introduced at least two dozen bills that advocates say target LGBTQ people for discrimination. And what happens in Texas doesn’t always stay in Texas. “Often, the far-right strategies in Texas are exported to other states,” Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, a progressive activist group, told reporters on Monday. “We’re kind of a testing ground or a petri dish for extremist political strategies.” That’s a grim forecast for progressives who have watched conservatives rewrite abortion laws across the United States, effectively winning what activists call the “war on women.” The Supreme Court struck down abortion restrictions in Texas last year —but that didn’t stop state lawmakers from introducing dozens of new anti-abortion bills this session. The wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation also covers a lot of ground. One bill would permit wedding photographers, caterers and DJs to deny services to same-sex couples. Another would allow student clubs at public universities to deny membership to LGBTQ people. Other bills protect faith-based groups that use taxpayer dollars and discriminate against LGBTQ couples when providing foster care services. The 85th legislative session has “chosen to declare war on transgender Texans,” Lauryn Farris, Alamo regional coordinator for the Transgender Education Network of Texas, told reporters on Monday. “As a result, all of us feel threatened by the very people we elected to protected us.” Texas Republicans claim their bills are about protecting religious freedom. And in the same way some anti-abortion bills are packaged as a way to protect women’s health, Texas conservatives have cited women’s safety as a reason to push legislation banning transgender people from using some bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. “If laws ... allow men to go into a bathroom because of the way they feel, we will not be able to stop sexual predators from taking advantage of that law, like sexual predators take advantage of the internet,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) has argued. (CNN surveyed 20 law enforcement agencies in states that had anti-discrimination policies covering gender identity; none of those that replied reported subsequent bathroom assaults.) The anti-transgender bill that Patrick calls the “women’s privacy act” — and which followed in the footsteps of the “bathroom bill” that sparked political backlash in North Carolina — has been a cause of concern for businesses. The NFL warned earlier this year that such a proposal could influence whether it decides to host future sporting events in Texas. And a study commissioned by Visit San Antonio and the San Antonio Area Tourism Council found that bathroom bills could cost the state $3.3 billion in annual tourism and more than 35,600 full-time jobs. Another Texas bill introduced in March — which House Republicans hope will be more palatable to corporations — would ban local anti-discrimination protections, including voiding those that already exist. That language could apply to protections for veterans or pregnant women, The Dallas Morning News pointed out. A revised version laid out before the House Committee on State Affairs last week, which was obtained by HuffPost, specifically bans “political subdivisions,” including public school districts, from enforcing an anti-discrimination ordinance that regulates access to restrooms, showers or changing facilities. Texas Rep. Ron Simmons (R), who authored the bill, could not immediately be reached to comment on LGBTQ advocates’ concerns. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has called Simmons’ bill “a thoughtful proposal to make sure our children maintain privacy.” But opponents of the bill include people like Rachel Gonzales, an activist and mother of a 7-year-old transgender girl. “My daughter has been surrounded by love and acceptance in both her home and school lives,” she told reporters on Monday. But she fears the bill will “remove my daughter’s school’s ability to keep her safe.” She added, “These extremists are continuing to go after transgender people for political gain. We are tired of it and it is wrong.” Cathryn Oakley, senior legislative counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ rights, added that “none of these bills are actually about bathrooms, they’re all about prejudice.” "

The archaic provision guarantees that sexual predators can avoid prison time if they wed their victims and stay married for at least five years. Final approval from Parliament and King Abdullah II is all but guaranteed, according to Suad Abu-Dayyeh, Middle East and North Africa consultant for human rights organization Equality Now.Abu-Dayyeh called the repeal movement a “collective effort” and praised women’s advocacy groups and parliamentarians for years of activism.“People have really started to understand the negative impact this article has on women and girls,” Abu-Dayyeh told The Huffington Post on Monday. “Having this law in the penal code is a really big problem.”Jordan’s lawmakers amended the law last year to restrict its application to rapists if their victims were aged 15 to 18, and if the assault was deemed “consensual.” But mounting public backlash prompted Jordan’s royal committee to recommend abandoning the law completely in February.Supporters of Article 308 have claimed it allows victims to maintain their reputation and protects them from honor killings.This region “can concentrate so much on a woman’s virginity,” Abu-Dayyeh said. “They feel it creates dishonor if a girl or woman is raped. ... But people have to understand that a girl who has been raped is a victim, and she needs the support of her family and also the government.”Egypt repealed a similar measure in 1999, and Morocco followed in 2014. Still, similar rape laws still exist in other parts of the Middle East and Africa. Abu-Dayyeh said she hopes Jordan’s move to repeal the loophole will inspire other countries, such as Bahrain, to take similar actions.Lebanese activists protested their country’s version of the rule Saturday by hanging 31 paper wedding dresses from nooses on Beirut’s seaside promenade. Jean Oghassabian, Lebanon’s minister for women’s affairs, said the country’s Article 522 is from the “stone age.”“It’s not acceptable for people to talk about it anymore,” Oghassabian told Agence France-Presse. “How is it reasonable for a woman to be raped and then sold into a prison?”The Lebanese Parliamentary Administration and Justice Committee approved repealing the law in December. The country’s parliament can make a final decision at any time.“I really hope that Jordan and Lebanon will be good examples of Arab governments [working] to revoke all remaining discriminatory laws toward women and girls,” Abu-Dayyeh said."

Final approval from Parliament and King Abdullah II is all but guaranteed, according to Suad Abu-Dayyeh, Middle East and North Africa consultant for human rights organization Equality Now.Abu-Dayyeh called the repeal movement a “collective effort” and praised women’s advocacy groups and parliamentarians for years of activism.“People have really started to understand the negative impact this article has on women and girls,” Abu-Dayyeh told The Huffington Post on Monday. “Having this law in the penal code is a really big problem.”Jordan’s lawmakers amended the law last year to restrict its application to rapists if their victims were aged 15 to 18, and if the assault was deemed “consensual.” But mounting public backlash prompted Jordan’s royal committee to recommend abandoning the law completely in February.Supporters of Article 308 have claimed it allows victims to maintain their reputation and protects them from honor killings.This region “can concentrate so much on a woman’s virginity,” Abu-Dayyeh said. “They feel it creates dishonor if a girl or woman is raped. ... But people have to understand that a girl who has been raped is a victim, and she needs the support of her family and also the government.”Egypt repealed a similar measure in 1999, and Morocco followed in 2014. Still, similar rape laws still exist in other parts of the Middle East and Africa. Abu-Dayyeh said she hopes Jordan’s move to repeal the loophole will inspire other countries, such as Bahrain, to take similar actions.Lebanese activists protested their country’s version of the rule Saturday by hanging 31 paper wedding dresses from nooses on Beirut’s seaside promenade. Jean Oghassabian, Lebanon’s minister for women’s affairs, said the country’s Article 522 is from the “stone age.”“It’s not acceptable for people to talk about it anymore,” Oghassabian told Agence France-Presse. “How is it reasonable for a woman to be raped and then sold into a prison?”The Lebanese Parliamentary Administration and Justice Committee approved repealing the law in December. The country’s parliament can make a final decision at any time.“I really hope that Jordan and Lebanon will be good examples of Arab governments [working] to revoke all remaining discriminatory laws toward women and girls,” Abu-Dayyeh said."

Police say more than 100 tombstones were vandalized a week after a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis was desecrated.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fc40341c00002600e812c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Harassment, vandalism and other hostile acts against Jewish people and sites in the U.S. increased by 34 percent last year and are up 86 percent through the first three months of 2017, according to data released on Monday.A spate of bomb threats against Jewish community centers and schools, and vandalism at Jewish cemeteries in the U.S. this year have contributed to the surge, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s report.There have been more than 100 bomb threats against 75 Jewish community centers and eight Jewish day schools around the country this year through early March. Vandals have toppled headstones and inflicted other damage at Jewish graveyards in St. Louis, Philadelphia and other cities this year. A swastika made from feces besmirched an art school bathroom in Rhode Island. “What the data tells us is incontrovertible and why the Jewish community describes such heightened anxiety,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt told The Huffington Post. “There’s no doubt that there’s a high degree of anxiety.”Greenblatt added that his organization’s report, which was released on Holocaust Remembrance Day, shows that public officials must do more to denounce anti-Semitism and find ways to make Jewish-Americans feel secure.In all, the ADL documented 1,266 incidents in 2016 and 541 since the beginning of this year until March. That’s a sharp increase since 2013, when the ADL recorded 751 incidents, the fewest number since record keeping began in 1979, a spokesman said. For comparison, anti-Semitic incidents peaked in 1994 when there were more than 2,000 incidents reported for the first and only time.The ADL’s analysis excluded most bigoted acts on social media. However, it included the harassment of Jewish residents in Whitefish, Montana, because the coordinated abuse rose above typical taunting and hate speech online, an ADL spokesman said. Supporters of alt-right figurehead Richard Spencer targeted town activists and Jewish residents after Spencer’s mother, a Whitefish business owner, said she was harassed because of her son’s politics. While forms of harassment and vandalism have jumped since 2015, the ADL said that physical assaults fell 36 percent in 2016 and are down 40 percent this year. Listen below to a recording of one of the bomb threats obtained by the Jewish Telegraph Agency:The first significant growth in anti-Semitism occurred in March 2016, based on the ADL’s tally. Monthly records peaked in November last year and have remained elevated through March. Massachusetts and Colorado witnessed some of the sharpest increases in rates of incidents among U.S. states. The ADL counted 125 cases in Massachusetts last year, compared to 50 in 2015 while they climbed from 18 to 45 in Colorado. Florida, with a large Jewish population, experienced 137 incidents, a 50 percent increase. California had 211 cases, the most of any state in 2016, while New York is on pace to have nearly 400 this year.Despite the clear increase in incidents, it’s difficult to explain what’s causing the upswing. Greenblatt said the ADL has tracked a resurgence of neo-Nazi and other hate groups in recent years and noticed that extremists felt emboldened during the presidential election. Trolls on social media, for instance, relentlessly battered Jewish journalists. In many bigoted incidents since the Election Day, alleged perpetrators have mentioned Donald Trump. “Anti-Semitism is horrible, and it’s going to stop and has to stop,” Trump said in January after pressure mounted for him to address the rising tide of acts targeting Jewish people.“As so often before, rising antisemitism is a symptom of a much larger social pathology,” said Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, in an email to HuffPost. “Leaders model behavior for the general public, and therefore when our leaders speak insensitively, when they seem to generalize about religious and racial groups, when they ignore or brush aside hate speech, it comes as no surprise that members of the public follow their example.”The unease felt by in Jewish communities perhaps could relent if recent law enforcement investigations prove to have rooted out the culprits. Authorities charged a Jewish teenager in Israel on Thursday for allegedly making an unspecified number of bomb threats against sites in the U.S. A former journalist was accused last month of threatening eight Jewish institutions. The uptick in anti-Jewish incidents fits into a pattern of increased hostility towards other minorities in the U.S. The FBI found that there had been a 67 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims in 2015, the most recent year that data is available. Hate crimes against African-Americans, who are most frequently the victims of such crimes according to the FBI’s report, rose by 7.6 percent that year. More recent FBI stats aren’t available but there have been a series of high-profile crimes against minorities this year. A man in a Kansas bar shot two Indian men, one fatally, after yelling “Get out of my country.” There have been 35 threats against mosques this year, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, and arsonists started fires at three Islamic places of worship."

As he approaches her, she begins to move.“Typically, in EMS, we’re not supposed to move the patient unless they’re in a pretty dangerous situation. And because she was on the state highway there in Harrison, Arkansas, it was grounds to get her out of there,” he said.Ciampoli carefully picked the girl up and out of the way of any oncoming traffic. Once out of the road, he said, her “shock kicked in.”“She started kicking and screaming and ‘Where’s my mommy?’ and things like that. Stuff like that is really heartbreaking,” he told 40/29 News.The little girl was hospitalized with a broken jaw, which will reportedly require surgery.Harrison police told CNN on Monday that the driver of the bus, which belongs to a church, is not expected to face charges.As for how this all happened, children told police that the girl went and opened the door on her own. After seeing her fall, they alerted the driver, who pulled over, police told CNN.Police Chief Paul Woodruff called the ordeal a “tragic accident.”"

The Portuguese version, published on Sunday 23 April, can be accessed here. The referendum on 16 April to enhance presidential powers has been the most unfair and controversial election that Turkey held since 1950. The playing field was highly unequal, with the ‘yes’ side taking full advantage of state resources and controlling almost all of the mainstream media. The campaign and voting took place under a state of emergency, in place since last July’s coup attempt, at a time when many critical journalists and opposition MPs were in jail. The ‘no’ side was frequently attacked and harassed, and generally prevented from campaigning freely. The voting day also brought up evidence of wrongdoing. Most notably, the Supreme Election Council, the body regulating and overseeing elections, issued an unprecedented decision in the middle of the voting process, announcing that ballots without official stamps would also be counted in the tally, effectively violating the law and undermining the legitimacy of the election. Particularly in the Kurdish southeast, there were hundreds of cases of “block voting”, where one person voted ‘yes’ on behalf of an entire village or town. The reports of the OSCE, whose observers were in Turkey for the referendum, and the EU Commission reflected the view that the referendum had failed to meet international standards. The two opposition parties, the CHP and the HDP, have filed formal complaints, demanding (and being refused) a recount or a repeat of the referendum. There are some street protests going on, defying the emergency laws. The government has ignored these protests, with President Erdoğan declaring the result – 51% for ‘yes’ – a fait accompli and comparing the election to a football match where “a win is a win”. Characteristically, he also lambasted western observers for meddling in Turkey’s affairs. But the process and the contested outcome will further polarize Turkey’s society and erode trust in its state institutions, boding more instability in the near future. Estadão: Why is the referendum being considered the most important turning point in Turkey’s politics since the First World War?The referendum symbolizes a major turning point for Turkey. The constitutional amendments aim at changing Turkey’s system of parliamentary democracy, which goes back to the Ottoman Empire in the mid-19th century, with a strong executive presidentialism. The changes bring about an extremely powerful presidency with very weak checks and balances; a populist one-man system rather than a system of presidentialism within a liberal democratic framework. Therefore the vote was not just about system change, but also about whether Turkey would remain a flawed democracy or exit democracy completely. Some observers have called this a ‘democide’, the death of a democracy through elections.E: Is Erdoğan now more powerful although nearly half the electorate voted against him?Institutionally yes, but socio-politically no. Institutionally, his already extensive powers will now be secured by the constitution. He will be able to officially rejoin his former party and freely engage in politics; previously he was violating the constitution, which requires the president to be non-partisan. His ability to rule by decree will be enhanced. He will be able to appoint most of the senior judges and prosecutors and handpick members of the Constitutional Court. From 2019 onwards, the president will also have the power to dissolve the parliament and call for new elections. These are fundamental changes to the existing system, which will be extremely difficult to undo or reform once they are put in place.Despite these extensive powers, the referendum also showed that at least 49% of the population was against the proposed changes, including some in the government’s own conservative constituencies and a majority of the nationalist voters from the far-right MHP, who rebelled against their leadership’s decision to back the ‘yes’ campaign. It seems that Erdoğan’s strategy of ruling by tension and polarization is proving increasingly costly not just for Turkey, which is mired in ever-deepening socio-political and economic problems, but also for the AKP government as well.E: What do you think of the argument, put forward by President Erdoğan’s supporters, that given Turkey's history of coups, civil strife and failed coalition politics, a stronger executive is a necessity. Can the result be good for Turkey?The ‘yes’ campaign’s main argument for the constitutional changes is that a strong executive is necessary for an efficient government freed from the tutelage of the bureaucracy. This argument is flawed on numerous grounds. It is true that Turkey has suffered from the undemocratic guardianship of the military and there has been broad consensus in society for over a decade that this had to change. Indeed, under the AKP, the system of military tutelage had been disassembled (although in a highly contested manner and largely outside the rule of law).Conversely, what the latest changes will undo in the name of political efficiency is the democratic separation of powers and institutional checks and balances that are essential to a functioning democracy. This is a recipe for authoritarian rule, which is sure to close off avenues for public deliberation, increase socio-political tensions and lead to more (not less) civil strife. And thus it will ultimately prove more inefficient, which goes against the core argument of these changes.Let us also remember that the AKP has governed Turkey without a formal coalition and under a de facto one-man rule at least since 2011. Yet this has not prevented political crises, civil strife or even coup attempts from taking place. What Turkey needs is a constitution based on political pluralism, that safeguards civil liberties and oversees a degree of devolution of authority from the excessively powerful central government to local administrations. The changes voted in this referendum do not offer remedies to Turkey’s core problems; on the contrary, they risk making these worse.E: Does the outcome of the referendum indicate any potential changes in how Turkey deals with terrorism, such as the Kurdish insurgency and the wave of Islamic State attacks?On the Islamic State front, not much will change. Turkey’s IS problem is unfortunately just starting and it will become more acute if and when the jihadist militants are pushed out of Syria and Iraq and withdraw to Turkey, where they already have established networks, sleeper cells and a degree of societal support. The direction of the Kurdish conflict also depends to a significant extent on the dynamics in Syria; Turkey’s opposition to the Syrian Kurdish forces (YPG) in that country is fueling much of the tension inside Turkey too.Even though the support for the AKP in the Kurdish-dominated southeast of Turkey apparently rose in this referendum, this seems at least partly a result of heavy security presence, disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of voters through conflict and displacement, and possibly voting fraud. That being said, there is always some room for surprise in Erdoğan’s pragmatist approach towards the Kurdish issue. He may well initiate another unexpected “Kurdish opening”, although he is unlikely to find too many counterparts willing to work with him this time. The damage that last few years’ violence and fiercely nationalistic rhetoric has done to Erdoğan and the AKP’s standing among Turkey’s Kurds should not be underestimated.E: What’s the meaning of the ‘yes’ defeat in Turkey's largest cities, including Istanbul, where Erdoğan was once mayor? The ‘no’ vote prevailed in most of the major centres of tourism and industry in the country. This is an important indication of changing demographic and socio-political dynamics. Turkey’s two biggest cities, Istanbul and the capital Ankara were won by centre-right and Islamist political movements consistently since the early 1990s. The AKP started off as a predominantly urban-based movement, appealing in particular to lower middle class voters in the fringes of big cities, with roots in the countryside but aspirations for upwards socio-economic mobility. It has maintained support of these groups by delivering better public services as well as economic growth and opportunities for almost a decade.But Turkey’s economic and political fortunes have been fading once again in recent years and for a growing number of people in the cities the AKP is looking like a source rather than a solution to their problems. This first became clear in the general election of June 2015, where the AKP lost about 10% support. Since that election, Erdoğan has been trying to consolidate his base by appealing to nationalist, religious and populist sentiments. This is a very dangerous strategy that can deliver electoral results in the short term, but is unlikely to attract parts of the population who want better and more secure living standards in the long term. And it seems that a considerable portion of these people were not convinced that the proposed system would bring about the changes they desired.E: Does the result show that a united front against Erdoğan has a chance of providing an alternative?There is no united front against Erdoğan; this has been the chronic problem of Turkish politics. The more than 49% that voted ‘no’ in the referendum is made up of groups that can hardly stand together, represented roughly by the three opposition parties, the part-secular nationalist-part-social democrat CHP, the far-right Turkish nationalist MHP and the part-Kurdish nationalist-part leftist HDP. The inability of these parties to come together became evident when they failed even at considering to form a coalition in 2015.However, there will be a different dynamic at work for the first presidential election under the new system, which will be held in November 2019. At the moment the MHP looks more divided than ever and it is possible that the party will split into two. The opposition can have a chance to challenge Erdoğan if they can find and unite around a charismatic candidate who can appeal to both the nationalist rebels from the MHP, secularists from the CHP and the Kurdish voters from the HDP, as well as some former supporters of the AKP who are disillusioned with the government. A tall order, but two-and-a-half years is a long time.E: What are the prospects for Turkey’s association with the European Union now?Even before the referendum the EU-Turkey relationship had been at a historical low point. The pre-referendum report of the Venice Commission (the independent body of constitutional experts) stated clearly that the changes would push Turkey further down “the road to autocracy”. Turkey has never been as far as it is today from fulfilling the conditions required for membership in the EU. And the EU has never been so weak, so divided and so far from offering Turkey any meaningful prospect.During the campaign the tension between the Turkish government and various European countries boiled over. This mostly had to do with the right-wing populist discourse dominating both sides; anti-western nationalism in Turkey and anti-Turkish, Islamophobic nationalism in countries like the Netherlands and Austria. The rise of such populist discourse will only pull Turkey and Europe further apart from each other. The only thing that is holding the two sides together at the moment is the refugee deal signed between the EU and Turkey last year. The Turkish government has been using this deal as a leverage against European leaders, occasionally threatening to “open the floodgates” and let masses of destitute refugees flow into Europe.E: What’s the likelihood that the death penalty gets reinstated in Turkey and what would this mean? The death penalty was abolished in 2002, just before the AKP came to power, as part of Turkey’s accession process to the European Union. Since last July’s coup attempt, President Erdoğan has been talking about bringing it back. This would spell disaster for Turkey, given the lack of rule of law and due justice in the country at the moment. It would also mark the official end of Turkey’s long and troubled journey towards the EU. But Erdoğan doesn’t seem to care. He believes that the age of liberal democracy is coming to an end and the future belongs to strongmen like Putin and Trump. These are the leaders whom he takes seriously. Having had to contain his patriarchal tendencies in the past, he now feels free to unleash them to his heart’s desire. "

This is a recipe for authoritarian rule, which is sure to close off avenues for public deliberation, increase socio-political tensions and lead to more (not less) civil strife. And thus it will ultimately prove more inefficient, which goes against the core argument of these changes.Let us also remember that the AKP has governed Turkey without a formal coalition and under a de facto one-man rule at least since 2011. Yet this has not prevented political crises, civil strife or even coup attempts from taking place. What Turkey needs is a constitution based on political pluralism, that safeguards civil liberties and oversees a degree of devolution of authority from the excessively powerful central government to local administrations. The changes voted in this referendum do not offer remedies to Turkey’s core problems; on the contrary, they risk making these worse.E: Does the outcome of the referendum indicate any potential changes in how Turkey deals with terrorism, such as the Kurdish insurgency and the wave of Islamic State attacks?On the Islamic State front, not much will change. Turkey’s IS problem is unfortunately just starting and it will become more acute if and when the jihadist militants are pushed out of Syria and Iraq and withdraw to Turkey, where they already have established networks, sleeper cells and a degree of societal support. The direction of the Kurdish conflict also depends to a significant extent on the dynamics in Syria; Turkey’s opposition to the Syrian Kurdish forces (YPG) in that country is fueling much of the tension inside Turkey too.Even though the support for the AKP in the Kurdish-dominated southeast of Turkey apparently rose in this referendum, this seems at least partly a result of heavy security presence, disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of voters through conflict and displacement, and possibly voting fraud. That being said, there is always some room for surprise in Erdoğan’s pragmatist approach towards the Kurdish issue. He may well initiate another unexpected “Kurdish opening”, although he is unlikely to find too many counterparts willing to work with him this time. The damage that last few years’ violence and fiercely nationalistic rhetoric has done to Erdoğan and the AKP’s standing among Turkey’s Kurds should not be underestimated.E: What’s the meaning of the ‘yes’ defeat in Turkey's largest cities, including Istanbul, where Erdoğan was once mayor? The ‘no’ vote prevailed in most of the major centres of tourism and industry in the country. This is an important indication of changing demographic and socio-political dynamics. Turkey’s two biggest cities, Istanbul and the capital Ankara were won by centre-right and Islamist political movements consistently since the early 1990s. The AKP started off as a predominantly urban-based movement, appealing in particular to lower middle class voters in the fringes of big cities, with roots in the countryside but aspirations for upwards socio-economic mobility. It has maintained support of these groups by delivering better public services as well as economic growth and opportunities for almost a decade.But Turkey’s economic and political fortunes have been fading once again in recent years and for a growing number of people in the cities the AKP is looking like a source rather than a solution to their problems. This first became clear in the general election of June 2015, where the AKP lost about 10% support. Since that election, Erdoğan has been trying to consolidate his base by appealing to nationalist, religious and populist sentiments. This is a very dangerous strategy that can deliver electoral results in the short term, but is unlikely to attract parts of the population who want better and more secure living standards in the long term. And it seems that a considerable portion of these people were not convinced that the proposed system would bring about the changes they desired.E: Does the result show that a united front against Erdoğan has a chance of providing an alternative?There is no united front against Erdoğan; this has been the chronic problem of Turkish politics. The more than 49% that voted ‘no’ in the referendum is made up of groups that can hardly stand together, represented roughly by the three opposition parties, the part-secular nationalist-part-social democrat CHP, the far-right Turkish nationalist MHP and the part-Kurdish nationalist-part leftist HDP. The inability of these parties to come together became evident when they failed even at considering to form a coalition in 2015.However, there will be a different dynamic at work for the first presidential election under the new system, which will be held in November 2019. At the moment the MHP looks more divided than ever and it is possible that the party will split into two. The opposition can have a chance to challenge Erdoğan if they can find and unite around a charismatic candidate who can appeal to both the nationalist rebels from the MHP, secularists from the CHP and the Kurdish voters from the HDP, as well as some former supporters of the AKP who are disillusioned with the government. A tall order, but two-and-a-half years is a long time.E: What are the prospects for Turkey’s association with the European Union now?Even before the referendum the EU-Turkey relationship had been at a historical low point. The pre-referendum report of the Venice Commission (the independent body of constitutional experts) stated clearly that the changes would push Turkey further down “the road to autocracy”. Turkey has never been as far as it is today from fulfilling the conditions required for membership in the EU. And the EU has never been so weak, so divided and so far from offering Turkey any meaningful prospect.During the campaign the tension between the Turkish government and various European countries boiled over. This mostly had to do with the right-wing populist discourse dominating both sides; anti-western nationalism in Turkey and anti-Turkish, Islamophobic nationalism in countries like the Netherlands and Austria. The rise of such populist discourse will only pull Turkey and Europe further apart from each other. The only thing that is holding the two sides together at the moment is the refugee deal signed between the EU and Turkey last year. The Turkish government has been using this deal as a leverage against European leaders, occasionally threatening to “open the floodgates” and let masses of destitute refugees flow into Europe.E: What’s the likelihood that the death penalty gets reinstated in Turkey and what would this mean? The death penalty was abolished in 2002, just before the AKP came to power, as part of Turkey’s accession process to the European Union. Since last July’s coup attempt, President Erdoğan has been talking about bringing it back. This would spell disaster for Turkey, given the lack of rule of law and due justice in the country at the moment. It would also mark the official end of Turkey’s long and troubled journey towards the EU. But Erdoğan doesn’t seem to care. He believes that the age of liberal democracy is coming to an end and the future belongs to strongmen like Putin and Trump. These are the leaders whom he takes seriously. Having had to contain his patriarchal tendencies in the past, he now feels free to unleash them to his heart’s desire. "
17,THE WORLDPOST,Trump And China Risk Sparking Dangerous Middle East Arms Race,"James M. Dorsey, ContributorS. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Senior fellow",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-and-china-risk-sparking-dangerous-middle-east_us_58fd777ce4b0f420ad99c97e,The two world powers risk further destabilizing the region.,2017-04-24,<p>US Defense Secretary James Mattis and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fd778b2600001700c4741f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By James M. DorseyForced to acknowledge that Iran is complying with the nuclear agreement it concluded two years ago with the world’s major powers, US President Donald J. Trump appears to be groping for ways to provoke Iran to back out of the deal. If successful, Mr. Trump could spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East at a time that a Chinese agreement to build a drone manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia could initiate a similar drone race that threatens to take hostilities in the region to a whole new, more dangerous level.Mr. Trump’s strategy stems from the realization that the United States would render itself impotent if he were to unilaterally terminate the agreement with Iran. America’s European allies as well as Russia and China would condemn termination, uphold their end of the agreement, and refuse to adhere by punitive measures the United States might adopt. With other words, termination would significantly reduce the United States’ ability to influence Iran.As a result, Mr. Trump, who has described the nuclear agreement as “one of the worst deals I’ve ever seen” and vowed to “dismantle” it, has since coming to office taken steps to lower incentives for Iran to continue to adhere to the accord. The outcome of May 12 elections in Iran could play into Mr. Trump’s hands if a hardliner rather than incumbent President Hassan Rouhani were to emerge victorious.At the same time, sticking to his desire to remain unpredictable, Mr. Trump has not ruled out terminating the agreement. Asked point blank by the Associated Press whether he would stick to the deal, Mr. Trump replied: “It’s possible that we won’t.”The president, besides charging that Iran has violated the spirit rather than the letter of the agreement and ordering a 90 day review that in the words of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will “evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States,” has also aligned the United States squarely alongside Saudi Arabia, which charges that the Islamic republic is the world’s foremost source of political violence. JCPOA is the acronym for the nuclear agreement or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Re-imposing US sanctions against Iran that were lifted alongside punitive United Nations measures would stop short of a unilateral termination of the agreement, but leave Iran no choice but to respond. It could retaliate with relatively meaningless sanctions of its own, but that would unlikely satisfy hard line critics as well as a sense that the agreement has so far failed to produce economic benefits for the average Iranian. On the plus side, cooler heads would likely counsel that US punitive action would allow Iran to play the international community against the United States.US Defense Secretary James Mattis, on a visit to Riyadh last week, echoed the kingdom’s view of Iran, saying that “everywhere you look if there is trouble in the region, you find Iran.” Mr. Mattis went on to say that “it is in our interest to see a strong Saudi Arabia.”Since coming to office, Mr. Trump has stepped up military support for Saudi Arabia’s troubled intervention in Yemen with increased strikes against jihadist targets, a loosening of the US rules of engagement, and a lifting of restrictions on US arms sales to the kingdom because of the high civilian casualty rates in the conflict.“We will have to overcome Iran’s efforts to destabilise yet another country and create another militia in their image of Lebanese Hezbollah, but the bottom line is we are on the right path for it,” Mr. Mattis told the Saudis. Iran has backed Houthi rebels in Yemen whom Saudi Arabia accuses of being Iranian stooges.Ironically, the staunchest opponents of the nuclear agreement, Saudi Arabia and Israel, have since its conclusion urged the Trump administration not to scrap the deal. Both countries remain critical of the agreement, but believe that it has bought them a decade of an Islamic republic deprived of a nuclear weapons capability. That approach has been reinforced by the rise of Mr. Trump and his tougher policy towards Iran.Mr. Trump’s high stakes poker game that will likely embolden Saudi Arabia in what is for the kingdom’s ruling Al Saud family an existential battle with Iran coupled with Chinese nuclear energy and military deals with Saudi Arabia and Iran nonetheless threatens to spark a regional arms race with potentially dangerous consequences.With the United States refusing to share its most advanced drone technology, China has agreed to open its first overseas defense production facility in Saudi Arabia. State-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) will manufacture its CH-4 Caihong, or Rainbow drone as well as associated equipment in Saudi Arabia. The CH-4 is comparable to the US armed MQ-9 Reaper drone.The deal could spark an arms race in the Middle East with Iran and other states seeking to match the kingdom’s newly acquired capability to launch strikes from the comfort of a computerized, Saudi-based command-and-control centre without putting Saudi military personnel at risk.Similarly, China signed an agreement on nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia during last month’s visit by Saudi King Salman. The agreement is for a feasibility study for the construction of high-temperature gas-cooled (HTGR) nuclear power plants in the kingdom as well as cooperation in intellectual property and the development of a domestic industrial supply chain for HTGRs built in Saudi Arabia.The agreement contributes to Saudi Arabia’s effort to develop nuclear energy and potentially a nuclear weapons capability. Saudi officials have repeatedly insisted that the kingdom is developing nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes such as medicine, electricity generation, and desalination of sea water. They said Saudi Arabia is committed to putting its future facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).A recent report by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) concluded however that the nuclear agreement with Iran had “not eliminated the kingdom’s desire for nuclear weapons capabilities and even nuclear weapons… There is little reason to doubt that Saudi Arabia will more actively seek nuclear weapons capabilities, motivated by its concerns about the ending of the JCPOA’s major nuclear limitations starting after year 10 of the deal or sooner if the deal fails,” the report said.China, unlike the United States, has to balance relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran, with which it has had a far longer military relationship. To do so, China has moved cautiously to restore nuclear cooperation with Iran in the wake of the lifting of the UN sanctions. Iran’s government-controlled Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA) reported this weekend that that China had agreed to redesign Iran’s Arak nuclear reactor under US supervision.China and the United States are pursuing different objectives in the Middle East and its dominant Saudi-Iranian dispute. In doing so, the two world powers risk however further destabilizing the region rather than contributing to ending debilitating disputes, reducing volatility, and putting an end to large scale bloodshed. As a result, despite their different goals, both powers’ approaches threaten to reinforce one another in putting the Middle East at greater risk.Dr. James M. Dorsey is a senior fellow at the S.

18,EDUCATION,Flawed Voucher Plans Foreshadow Trump Administration's School 'Reforms',"Alan Singer, ContributorSocial studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of c...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flawed-voucher-plans-foreshadow-trumpdevos-school_us_58fdd34ce4b0f420ad99c9b2,"We already know what it looks like, and it does not deliver on its promises.",2017-04-24,"<p>Eve, Adam, and a dinosaur meet in the Garden of Eden according to a Creation Museum display.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fdd8891c00003c00e81451.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We already know what a school voucher program like the one championed by Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy “Amway” DeVos looks like. An experimental version was set up for Washington DC in 2004. We also already know that it does not deliver on its promises, and in many cases, makes education worse.The D.C. voucher plan was originally a Bush administration initiative intended as a five-year experiment, however, it has been allowed to continue despite no evidence that it improves student performance. A 2010 U.S. Department of Education study concluded that there was “no conclusive evidence” that students using vouchers to attend private schools had improved math and reading test scores. Under the D.C. school voucher program, the federal government pays approximately $8,000 a year for elementary school students to attend a private or religious school and $12,000 for students attending private or religious high schools.Unfortunately, in addition to Washington, DC, fourteen states already have school voucher systems in place. They include states like Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Oklahoma with some of the worst performing schools and long histories of racial and ethnic discrimination. Many of these states also offer tax credits to companies and individuals who donate money for “scholarships” to private and religious schools.The National Education Association (NEA) has repeatedly spearheaded campaigns to block Congressional reauthorization of the D.C. voucher program. The group charges the private school voucher program diverts funds from public to private schools at the same that budget cuts leave essential federal Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) severely underfunded. The private schools participating in the D.C. voucher program are not subject to the same oversight, transparency, and accountability standards as public schools and may discriminate against students based on “gender, disability, religion, economic background, national origin, academic record, English language ability, or disciplinary history.” Families of students with special needs who are eligible for vouchers often cannot use them because voucher schools do not provide the essential services these students require. In addition, vouchers often do not cover the full cost of private school tuition, so poorer families are excluded.In March, the U.S. House of Representative’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved reauthorization despite District leaders criticizing federal interference in the city. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), Washington DC’s non-voting delegate to Congress, charged “There is very limited support for private school vouchers in the Congress and in the nation. When Republicans cannot pass controversial national legislation, they instead abuse their power over a jurisdiction they view as defenseless.”In 2012, the Washington Post reported that “hundreds of students use their voucher dollars to attend schools that are unaccredited or are in unconventional settings, such as a family-run K-12 school operating out of a storefront, a Nation of Islam school based in a converted Deanwood residence, and a school built around the philosophy of a Bulgarian psychotherapist.” The fifty-two private schools enrolled in the program at that time were “subject to few quality controls and offer widely disparate experiences.” At least eight of the “schools” were not even credentialed. Over half of the 1,500 students in the D.C. voucher program attend religious schools. At some of the schools, “more than 90 percent of their students” paid tuition with federal vouchers. Parents often choose these schools for their children based on school marketing strategies, rather than on reliable data.The problem with vouchers is not just for Washington, DC schools. A study of North Carolina education policy found similar problems with their school voucher program, the North Carolina Opportunity Scholarship Act. It was established by the state legislature in 2013 to provide low-income families with up to $4,200 a year in state-funded tuition scholarships so children could attend private schools. In North Carolina, which has one of most underfunded public school systems in the country, funds for public schools was cut by $11 million to finance the voucher program.More than 400 of the private schools registered in the North Carolina program, an overwhelming majority are religiously affiliated schools. According to a study published by the Century Foundation, many of these schools “condition admission and retention on dogmatic adherence to specific religious doctrine, usually excluding those who are LGBTQ or come from non-churchgoing families.” One school, the Alamance Christian School located about twenty-five miles from Greensboro, received $121,132 in public funds in 2015–2016 while maintaining an official admissions policy barring children from families that are “Catholic, Mormon, Jehovah’s Witness, Seventh Day Adventist, Christian Science.” They maintained the policy by requiring that families “seeking admission must produce a pastoral reference.”The Fayetteville Christian School that received almost $300,000 in voucher dollars in 2015–2016 mandates:“The student and at least one parent with whom the student resides must be in agreement with the FCS Statement of Faith and have received Jesus Christ as their Savior. In addition, the parent and student must regularly fellowship in a local church. Accordingly, FCS will not admit families that belong to or express faith in religions that deny the absolute Deity/Trinity of Jesus Christ as the one and only Savior and path to salvation. Furthermore, students and families are expected to manifest a Christian lifestyle by living life according to Biblical teachings. Accordingly, FCS will not admit families that engage in illegal drug use, sexual promiscuity, homosexuality or other behaviors that Scripture defines as deviate and sin. Once admitted, if the student or parent/guardian with whom the student resides becomes involved in any of the above activities it will be grounds for dismissal of the student/family from the school.”North Carolina private schools frequently use high tuition rates and extra fees, or lack of transportation options, to keep out children from poorer families they do not want to be enrolled. The Fayetteville Christian School charges families an additional $1,000 to enroll children in its gifted program. At Liberty Christian Academy, which receives over a quarter of a million dollars in state funds a year, high school students are charged $750 per course to enroll in dual enrollment courses accredited by a local college.But maybe North Carolina students are really lucky if they are rejected by the private religious schools. A large number of the schools use science, math, and history textbooks and curriculum published by religious organizations. Bob Jones University Press history textbooks have argued that “The majority of slave holders treated their slaves well” and that the Klan tried to fight the decline in morality by using the cross, targeting “bootleggers, wife-beaters, and immoral movies.” The company’s third grade science book states that “Dinosaurs and humans were definitely on the earth at the same time and may have even lived side by side within the past few thousand years” and according to a Bob Jones Teacher resource guide, gays “have no more claims to special rights than child molesters or rapists.” Material published by A Beka Books, a company based in Pensacola, Florida, claims that “God used the Trail of Tears to bring many Indians to Christ” and that Roe v. Wade enslaves unborn children.Bob Jones University and A Beka Books curriculum and textbooks are also used at voucher schools in a number of other states including Louisiana and Mike Pence’s Indiana.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

I have some thoughts about that.This embarrassment invites many levels of analysis, but any reasonable conversation must begin with a single, simple fact: Confederate Memorial Day is an assertion of white supremacy, a direct insult (intended as humiliation) to non-whites in the South, and a middle finger pointed straight at the rest of the country. Way too many people will deny that reality. But they know the truth, and they are responsible for knowing the truth. How can we be so sure? Why not ask a Confederate Memorial Day advocate to walk up to a black person they regard as a friend and wish that person a Happy Confederate Memorial Day. They know better. It’s as clear as it can possibly be.Yes, there are other factors. Southerners still feel grief and shame over the Confederate defeat. A long history of poverty and anti-Southern animus affects how almost all white Southerners see the world. They affect me too.My Lancaster Seminary colleague Frank Stalfa taught me about complicated grief. We all would like to honor our ancestors. In the case of white Southerners, there’s a deep desire to find honor in our past. To celebrate whatever courage, dignity, and creativity was present in those ancestors. That’s a basic human desire. With respect to the Confederacy, the ability to celebrate our families’ heritage is complicated by defeat.But celebrating that heritage is also denied by morality. For almost every Southerner who supported the Confederacy, the most significant thing about their lives is this: they either enslaved other people, or they went to war to defend the enslavement of other people. One could be a devoted parent, a great philanthropist or politician, a business genius. But from a moral point of view, the most important thing about that person is their relationship to slavery. Slavery is the bottom line. With respect to our ancestors, that’s hard to accept. Apart from the Civil War, one might argue that other things are more important about Washington, Jefferson, and the others. From a moral point of view, I’m not sure. They enslaved other people.What do you do when your parent is a Mafia boss or a tenement owner? How do you acknowledge that reality in your own story?Today there is no excuse for Alabama and Mississippi. There’s no excuse for Confederate flags, t-shirts, or “days.” But there is a need for white Southerners to deal with their truth in constructive ways.I have an idea. Maybe we could commit ourselves to justice. Maybe we could go about the process of acknowledging the truth and making things right. Maybe we could begin the process of reparations. That would feel a lot better than having an embarrassing holiday."

Historically they favor incumbents and try to be friendly with members of Congress. Usually, that’s a safe bet: Incumbents won 97 percent of the time in House races and 93 percent of the time in Senate elections in 2016, numbers on par with those in past elections. But incumbents lose from time to time, and when that happens, PACs often quickly switch horses.The 2016 election was no different. In eight races, the challenger beat the incumbent and then — before the end of the year — collected contributions from PACs that had previously supported the sitting lawmaker.New Reps. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) were the biggest beneficiaries of this swing. Twenty-nine of incumbent Rep. Bob Dold’s PAC donors contributed to Schneider after the challenger prevailed on Nov. 8, combining to give him $84,000; Bacon received $75,000 from 27 PACs that had given to sitting Rep. Brad Ashford’s campaign.Democrats benefited more than Republicans from these PAC recalibrations for the simple reason that Bacon was the only winning GOP challenger in either the House or Senate in 2016. Only two winning Democratic challengers failed to benefit from PAC switching: Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who didn’t take PAC money, and Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H.), likely because she and Republican Frank Guinta have taken turns occupying this seat every cycle for the past decade.Ten PAC donors gave $10,000 or more to winning challengers after supporting losing incumbents. In total, over 70 PAC donors switched their allegiance in at least one race after Election Day. Comcast Corp was quickest on the draw, giving $15,000 to winning challengers in five races after backing the incumbents.Politicians come and go but their pragmatism remains constant. They need friends on Capitol Hill — preferably ones who will return their calls."

[AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall]</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fdfd8b1400002600a9b677.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mike SpiesSoon after the start of his first term as a black lawmaker in the fifth-whitest state in the country, State Representative Ras Smith brought his hoodie to work. For the eleventh year in a row, elected officials in Iowa were going to take up a “stand your ground” proposal, authorizing residents to use lethal means to protect themselves in certain situations. In other states, similar laws have disproportionately justified the fatal shootings of African-Americans.What was different now, in 2017, was the measure’s likely passage. In November, Republicans, who overwhelmingly support the policy, won a majority in the Iowa State Senate, giving the party control of both the Legislature and the governorship for the first time since 1998.The new composition made Smith feel that passage was close to inevitable. Yet he still hoped he might be able to stop it, by appealing to the moral imaginations of his Republican colleagues. Smith represents a portion of Waterloo, a city of 68,000 about two hours northeast of Des Moines that has the state’s largest black population. The African-American community has mainly been relegated to the city’s east side, in part a product of discriminatory housing policies from the 20th century.“Stand your ground” was just one component of a larger omnibus gun bill, which also included a provision allowing citizens to sue local government officials who enforce bans on firearms in public areas. On March 9, before the House voted on the legislation, Smith took the floor to address his fellow lawmakers. He is 29 and six feet tall, a former high-school athlete with a muscular build, close-cropped hair, and earrings. He wore a dark suit, which concealed the tattoos across his chest and biceps, including a picture of a teddy bear that symbolizes his devotion to his 4-year-old daughter. Smith recounted a story about playing football as a teenager in the rural town of Garwin, which is nearly 100 percent white.“I was called racial slurs more than 10 times, spit in my face, and told, ‘If I could kill you and get away with it, I would do that,’” he told his colleagues.Smith’s speech lasted less than four minutes. Toward the end, he reminded the other legislators that there is a history in the United States of whites committing violence against black men, out of hatred and out of irrational fear. To emphasize this point, he brought props. Smith took out his gray sweatshirt, which he pulled over his suit jacket. He flipped the hood up, and then put on a pair of large red headphones. Moments earlier, Smith had been dressed the way that ascendant politicians are expected to dress. Now he looked like Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black Florida teenager who was killed by George Zimmerman in 2012 — the boy who has come to epitomize the perils of “stand your ground.”“This is that threat you can perceive every day,” Smith declared.“My colleagues say they respect me,” he told The Trace. “So I wanted to show them what I wear on a daily basis, and to ask: Are they willing to pass legislation that could negatively impact my life?”The answer turned out to be yes. The bill passed largely along party lines, and on April 13, Governor Terry Branstad signed it into law.For four years, between 2012 and 2016, every state that tried to enact “stand your ground” legislation failed. But now the policy is again finding its way into law. Last year, Missouri became the first state to break the logjam, followed by Iowa this month. Florida is poised to strengthen its law in favor of shooters, shifting the burden of proof in pre-trial hearings to prosecutors, who would have to convince a judge that someone claiming “stand your ground” shouldn’t be immune from prosecution.Missouri, like Iowa, is now under total Republican control. The GOP has held the Legislature and governor’s office in Florida for two decades. White rural Democrats, once potential allies of minority legislators representing cities, are practically extinct. The overall decline of the party’s power has diminished the ability of black lawmakers to influence policies that directly affect their constituents.“The states that passed ‘stand your ground’ early on were low-hanging fruit,” said Christopher Mooney, the Director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois. “As Republicans gain strength in states like Missouri and Iowa, the odds of it passing go up.”It was in Florida that the “stand your ground” movement began, with the National Rifle Association successfully lobbying state lawmakers in 2005 to pass the first such legislation in the nation. Over the next seven years, 21 states followed. “Stand your ground” removes a person’s duty to retreat in the face of grave danger, granting the legal right to use deadly force if the perception of a threat is “reasonable.” (Critics refer to the statutes as “shoot first” laws.) After Martin was killed in 2012, “stand your ground” became a politically toxic phrase, and its expansion stalled.Defenders of “stand your ground” argue that all it does is enshrine the right to self-defense, ensuring that people cannot be punished for protecting themselves. They say that the law’s built-in standard for assessing a threat — that it must be “reasonable” to necessitate a violent, even deadly, response — prevents abuse.“You can’t claim the defense when it’s clear there wasn’t a threat to your life or safety,” said State Representative Matt Windschitl, a Republican from Missouri Valley and the lead sponsor of “stand your ground” in Iowa.Yet a persistent problem with the law is that one’s definition of “reasonable” is relative. Evidence suggests that there is a correlation between “stand your ground” and increased homicide rates, and that the law disproportionately protects people who shoot minorities. A 2013 study released by the Urban Institute revealed that in “stand your ground” cases, when the assailant is white and the victim is black, homicides are 281 percent more likely to be ruled justified than if the roles were reversed. Two years later, the American Bar Association published an authoritative report recommending that states repeal the statute because of its “implicit racial bias.”“If you’re white and not learning the value of minorities, then you’re reacting to your own narrow frame of reference, which is usually soundbites on TV about criminals and drug dealers,” said State Representative Ako Abdul-Samad, a Democrat from Des Moines and one of the black lawmakers who opposed the self-defense law. “If that’s all you have to go on, you will react with fear.”Across the country, African-Americans make up less than 10 percent of all state lawmakers. Marginalized by political realities they cannot control, there is little they can do to stop the resurgence of “stand your ground.” In Iowa, there are just five black state lawmakers out of 150; in Florida, there are 27 out of 160; and last year, in Missouri, the figure was 21 out of 197. Of all of these black elected officials, only two — one in Florida, and one in Missouri — are members of the GOP. They were also the only two to vote in favor of the legislation.Many African-American legislators see the persistence of “stand your ground” as a consequence of segregation. Black lawmakers say that the lack of diversity in rural and suburban areas breeds fear and ignorance, which can facilitate deadly encounters.“What a gun means to someone in North Florida is completely different than what it means to someone on the streets of Tampa,” said Representative Janet Cruz, the Democratic minority leader in the Florida House. “Although someone in a rural area may see ‘stand your ground’ as a tool to ensure they’re able to keep their family safe, for many in the urban parts of Florida, they see it as a threat to their family.”Oscar Braynon, a black Democrat who serves as Florida’s Senate minority leader and represents the Miami-area district where Trayvon Martin’s mother lives, said that the Republicans who serve alongside him aren’t interested in engaging with data that shows “stand your ground” too often protects whites who kill blacks.“These people don’t understand our struggle,” he said. “Repealing ‘stand your ground’ is one of the top two issues in my district, well before cleaning up the environment or lowering taxes. I live in the reality laid out in the data, while some of these other lawmakers seem to live in a theoretical movie.”Braynon added: “I’ve heard them argue that African-Americans are committing more crimes than anyone else. So the point of that statement is what? Maybe they need to be shot? That’s the type of thing I hear. They say you need to get control of your people.”For Representative Smith, it is the assumption whites have often made about him — and their unwillingness to examine the source of those assumptions — that makes “stand your ground” so dangerous; inherent racism distorts perception. He remembers playing basketball as a teenager in Tama, Iowa, which is less than 1 percent black. During the game, as he was preparing to take a shot from the free-throw line, a white referee approached him and said, “Pull up your pants, son. This isn’t East Waterloo.”“That was an adult asserting himself to a child in that way,” Smith said. “And I didn’t sag my shorts. The truth was opposite. I wore them John Stockton-style,” a reference to the Utah Jazz’s white former point guard, who was famous for wearing shorts that ended well above the knee.Last year, when Smith was running for office, several police officers confronted him as he finished an event at a church. He was dressed in khaki pants and a white campaign T-shirt that bore his name. The officers told him that he matched the description of someone who had just committed a robbery — a black male wearing a white T-shirt. Despite the fact that the name on his shirt matched the one on his license, he had to submit to a background check.“What would they have done if the description was white male, white T-shirt?” Smith said. “Even when I’m leaving my own campaign event, at a church, wearing my own campaign T-shirt, I’m still a threat.”In February, soon after “stand your ground” was introduced in the Iowa House, Smith was taken aback by something he heard on talk radio. At the time, more than half of Iowans supported the legislation, and as he listened to a caller discuss the issue, he realized it might be impossible to change their minds. The person on the line, a white male, said that if wearing headphones and hoodies gives off the impression of menace, then black men should leave those items at home.“That’s a pretty privileged mindset,” Smith said. “It’s different when your white son wears headphones and a hoodie. Okay. Well, I’ve had pretty negative interactions with white people dressed in camo. Does that mean white people shouldn’t wear camo?Representative Windschitl, the Iowa bill’s lead sponsor, has been the driving force behind the legislation for the last decade. Elected in his early 20s, he is a 33-year-old gunsmith and railroad conductor whose district is almost entirely white. He says he understands the concerns of his African-American colleagues, but prefers to emphasize the new legal protections the law offers his state’s black gun owners.“It’s a two-way street when we talk about ‘stand your ground,’” Windschitl said. “This law doesn’t say that if you see a person of color walk into a room you can shoot them. But if a person of color walks into a room, and a white person starts something because he feels threatened by his skin color, then that African-American person, under the law, has a right to defend himself.”He added, “This law doesn’t start a race war.”"

As we come to Holocaust Remembrance Day, it is more important than ever that we both honor those still with us and heed the lessons of the past, particularly at a moment in time where we are dangerously close to repeating them.We can only presume to understand and posit on just how actions that start as minor encroachments of rights and bigotry hold the capacity to morph into intolerance and enmity. Holocaust survivors are witness to how discrimination, resentment, and hostility can easily turn into behaviors and deeds.What must survivors ­– once banished from their homes and confronted with hopeless choices – think of the current state of the world, as television screens and papers are sated with anti-Semitic images as well as stories of millions being chased from their homes and thousands devastated by chemicals fashioned into killing machines, as the world, for the most part, stands idly byFor most people, the Holocaust lives in history books, museums and movies. For survivors and their families, however, its shadow is long, and there are some 500,000 survivors alive today. Those who lived through the unimaginable horrors of concentration camps, ghettos and years in hiding now hear about a resurgence of hate, ignorance and intolerance. As some on the fringes of society minimize or deny the Holocaust or the atrocities even the Nazis readily admitted, watching a new wave of hate can only be an unimaginable re-victimization for Holocaust survivors. In the 1930s when Hitler rose to power, he lacked the immediacy of modern-day communication. The internet adds speed to this phenomenon while amplifying the message. As the world becomes a smaller place, we are all becoming witnesses to a rise in hate speech against every minority. There is almost no way to avoid it.Recently, in a move of either pure ignorance or insensitivity, a high school teacher in Oswego County, New York assigned a project to students asking them to argue for or against Hitler’s Final Solution ― the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jewish people. The assignment was brought to light and permanently pulled when two students voiced their concerns. How is a young mind’s educational experience enhanced by arguing for the extermination of millions of men, women, and children?Regrettably, we’ve come too easily to overlook similar affronts in various countries hostile to Jews, but this happened in the United States and is happening elsewhere around the world, in countries that share our democratic values. The former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, claimed the Nazi policy “had the effect of supporting” Zionism. Likewise, Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front and presidential contender, denied France’s complicity in the Holocaust – contradicting nearly two decades of French policy recognizing responsibility for the roundup of nearly 13,000 Jews over two days in Paris in 1942 by the French police.We are living in a critical moment in time. We are seeing the loss of an entire generation of Holocaust survivors. Many current events serve as triggers of the past for survivors, and we must do what we can to support them by continuing to help them tell their stories and by assisting them with care, social services and support in their time of urgent need.Simultaneously, those same events should remind us – should such prompts be necessary – of our duty not to be silent in the face of bigotry and hatred which caused such unspeakable horrors in the past and which fester to this day. Because, while today may be memorialized as Holocaust Remembrance Day, to survivors, every day is Holocaust Remembrance Day."

Last week, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled what he calls the world’s first augmented reality platform, a way of layering digital effects atop anything we see through our smartphone cameras. Eventually, he says, this platform will even let you “pin” digital objects to locations in the real world, allowing anyone else who comes along to see them too — assuming they’re also using Facebook. If this effort plays out like Zuckerberg says it will, the real and the digital will merge the way they do with Pokemon Go — only on a much larger scale, and within the confines of Facebook.But if Zuckerberg is looking that far ahead at the social and creative possibilities — he showed off an AR art installation pinned to the outside of Facebook headquarters — it’s also worth looking just as far ahead at the potential pitfalls. Namely: What if the reality built by you and your circle of friends separates you from other circles — kinda like Facebook filter bubbles already do in the (purely) digital world? What if Apple builds its own augmented reality platform? And Google, Microsoft, and Amazon? Could these competing layers of reality separate us even further? And won’t they all start serving us ads?RELATED: The 10-Year Quest to Make Your Phone Do EverythingBrian Blau, a hardcore virtual reality veteran who closely tracks the development of VR and AR at Gartner, a tech research firm, calls this the meta-verse problem. “It’s something that people first talked about years and years ago, when VR and AR first came around,” he says. “How many meta-verses will there be?” And indeed, how will meta-verses separate us from real reality? Or even from each other?If AR takes off, these questions will become increasingly urgent. As the New York Times explains, Zuckerberg has always lamented that Apple and Google beat him out in building the world’s dominant mobile phone platforms. Now he’s racing these old rivals and others to the next technological beachhead. “All these companies want to turn the physical world into a digital world,” Blau says.Just as Google and Facebook want your attention when you’re on the internet, they will seek to capture your attention when you’re doing anything else, anywhere else. That was the implicit goal of Google Glass, which wasn’t ready for the mainstream. Zuckerberg is now looking for a shortcut to the same point. Microsoft is making its own play with an AR headset called the Hololens, and reports indicate that Apple is exploring similar areas. If all those companies are in the mix, you can bet that Amazon will follow as well. In the process, the online dominance these companies enjoy will creep farther into the offline world.Competing RealitiesFor all these companies, the potential benefits are enormous. Initially, AR technology will provide a new way of playing games and tinkering with photos and videos. But eventually, AR and VR could serve as the most direct way yet of getting from digital ad to making a purchase — digital creations that let you purchase in a brick-and-mortar store or in a simulation of a virutal store. The path between ad and transaction becomes all the shorter. “Will people buy things in VR? Yes, they will,” Blau says.READ MORE: In Facebook’s Future, You Live Through Your PhoneAt the moment, Facebook says, it’s not all that concerned with the business end of AR. When building a new platform, explains chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer, “we make sure people are enjoying it before we start thinking about building a business model.” The company’s history bears out that assertion. But in this particular case, there are other issues to address. Is Facebook thinking about the meta-verse problem? Is it considering the possibility of driving a wedge between us and reality? That’s less clear.“We start with: What is the compelling consumer experience?” Schroepfer says. “We can talk about the philosophy all we want, but if people don’t enjoy it — don’t want to do it — then it kind of doesn’t matter.”But Schroepfer will say he believes in making sure you can pass between competing corporate meta-verses. If other companies do build their own platforms, they can also build ways of sharing digital objects between these platforms, he says. “There are lots of ways to collaborate on this, just as you can take a photo on Facebook and share it on another network,” he says. Indeed, cross-platform AR doesn’t seem to be a major technological hurdle. But even if Apple and Google and Facebook play nicely with each other, that compatibility doesn’t overcome the greater concern about shutting ourselves off from others inside a digital space encroaching farther than ever into the physical.Today, we have our differences, but at least when all share the same world, the same physical space, the same reality. But if we start tinkering with this reality and share changes only with certain people, the world starts to split. The possibility is a long way off. But we should consider it now.More from WIRED:9 Magical Photos Of California’s Wildflower Super BloomObama Talks AI and the Future of the WorldAmerica’s Electronic Voting Machines Are Easy TargetsWhat Happens When You Talk About Salaries at GoogleHackers Trick Facial-Recognition Logins With Facebook PhotosA Hacking Group is Selling iPhone Spyware to Governments"

Artificial intelligence is an increasingly powerful force in the world, even as our grasp of what A.I. is and does continuously evolves. I like how the software engineer Liza Daly recently put it: “artificial intelligence tends to mean whatever it is that computers can’t quite master yet.”So it makes sense that Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and CEO, spent a good chunk of his latest letter to Amazon shareholders focused on artificial intelligence. The letter is worth reading in full. It contains of all kinds of pleasing Bezosisms — “disagree and commit” deserves its own article, really — but I want to focus on the section Bezos devotes to artificial intelligence, which he describes as a big trend but one that’s also “strangely hard for large organizations to embrace.”RELATED: Torching the Modern-Day Library of Alexandria “At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now,” Bezos writes. “Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa, our cloud-based AI assistant.”Here’s where it starts to get more interesting:“But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more.”And then, when Bezos gets into what all this means for Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud services platform, is where it gets really interesting:“Inside AWS, we’re excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and AI so organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques,” Bezos writes.He goes on to describe how Amazon’s cloud-services clients can use the company’s pre-packaged deep-learning frameworks—including the systems that power the Amazon Echo; Amazon Polly, the company’s text-to-speech program; and Amazon Rekognition, its facial recognition software.Clients have access to these technologies through a simple API, Bezos says, meaning developers for a range of companies can tap into Amazon’s suite of A.I. programs without having any machine learning expertise themselves.RELATED: The Six Main Arcs in Storytelling, as Identified by an A.I.This is a big deal for a few reasons. Mainly, because it means Amazon is enabling countless organizations to track its users more precisely than ever.Amazon Web Services is huge. It is, for starters, the backbone of the commercial web. (That’s why, when AWS has a server problem, it seems like the entire internet is coming apart at the seams.) It reported a stunning $12.2 billion in sales last year, and more than $3 billion in profit. Giving all AWS clients easy access to advanced data-tracking tools means Amazon is making the baseline for corporate surveillance online much more sophisticated.This may be exciting news for businesses that want to follow and analyze their customers and potential customers more closely. But for people concerned about individual privacy, this is not so great. (Amazon did not respond to my request for an interview.)Of course, many of the biggest companies that use Amazon Web Services already run in their own high-level data-tracking operations. (Remember, AWS clients include McDonald’s, Netflix, Airbnb, Adobe, Capital One, GE, and Pinterest, to name a few.) It was in Bezos’s shareholder letter last year that he boasted of AWS’s stunning client base: “more than a million customers from organizations of every size across nearly every industry,” he wrote.RELATED: How a Mormon Church-Owned Site Defeated Craigslist in UtahAmazon Web Services helps power a massive swath of the global economy — across markets and industries that are all deeply vested in collecting and sharing detailed data about individuals and their behaviors. Yet there’s clear incentive for companies to leverage machine-learning technology beyond tracking individual behaviors. There are all sorts of applications for a computer that can be trained to recognize patterns. Bezos included this lucid explanation in his letter: “Over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe with clear rules and algorithms. Modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder.”All this is a reminder that the public-facing conceptions of how businesses use artificial intelligence — the device sitting in your kitchen that responds to your voice, or the drone dropping an Amazon package on your doorstep — are only a teensy slice of what a company means when it says it’s using A.I.Instead, much of the corporate world’s algorithmic fine-tuning can be boiled down to learning exactly who customers are and how they behave. That’s already happening in the background of every business transaction you make — especially online — with remarkable precision.“Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type,” Bezos says in his letter, “quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.”“Watch this space,” he adds. “Much more to come.”Much more to come, certainly. But we’re not likely to learn very much more by simply watching, when so much of what artificial intelligence does is invisible from the outside.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: The Life-Changing Magic of Mushrooms, The Different Stakes of Male and Female Birth Control"

And I still remember that day with vivid technicolor. It was a weekend and the boys and I were at home alone. My daughter was away at a volleyball tournament in Minnesota. By all measures, it could have become yet one more weekend that blended into the blurry scrapbook of my memory bank.But my life – and my family’s life – was rearranged that weekend. It all started with a telephone call from my doctor. Before I could even put the telephone receiver back in its place – I remember processing the age of each of my children at the moment.Drew was 9. Wallis was 13. And Kevin, 15.And I remember thinking through a variety of scenarios as I catastrophized a fate matching my mother’s, my father’s and my brother’s – all who died of cancer. Our family was very familiar with the wrath of cancer. Then I started processing timelines – and negotiations with God.“Give me at least a year.”“Five.”“Let me see my kids through high school.”It was a mental dance – of sorts – that many go through, I’m sureAnd here I am, today, having seen all those scenarios play out in real life. And then some.Ironically – the mental dance continues. In the privacy of conversations with myself – I still sometimes play out what the future may bring. The anxiety returns every few months when it’s time for regular labwork to see if dormant cancer cells have decided to waken. I still gag twice daily as I shove handfuls of medications and supplements down my throat to stack the deck in my favor – and hold back the chance of recurrence.But mostly, I’m full of gratitude. Certainly to God, kids, and my doctors and nurses. But I’m also grateful for coming to better understand a few things.1. The past is the past. We cannot rewrite the storyline of our history nor the facts surrounding it.2. The present is all we have – for certain. Investing in the here and now has huge pay-offs.3. Everyone lives with adversity – if not always – at least at some points in their life.4. Making it a practice to ask the Starbuck’s barista (or any other service provider), “How is your day going?” – and really mean it – just might change the trajectory of their day.5. When a total stranger asks you to take a photo of their family – that’s a beautiful thing.6. It’s pretty awesome to be someone’s “go-to” person. Especially when that person is your son or daughter.7. Make your bed every morning. It gets your day off to a good start.8. Forget New Year’s Resolutions. If you need to make a change or have a new goal – start it today.9. Reinvent yourself with regularity. Learn to play a musical instrument. Take a new class. You’re never too old for anything.10. Remind the people in your life that you not only love them – but that their life has true value to you and others. We all need that reminder.11. Envision the eulogy you want your children to give you. Then live that life.12. Even when you hate the photo of yourself in a family picture – deal with it.

With no legislative accomplishments to highlight for the nation, Trump’s divisive anti-Latino and anti-immigrant rhetoric created and amplified an unprecedented level of fear and anxiety in our communities.Now more than ever, it is imperative that Latinos not only look for the solutions to the issues we face as a country, but also ensure that our community has a fair seat at the table.Despite all the obstacles in place, Latinos have been making great strides in realms previously unthinkable for many of us. The 55 million and growing population already start more businesses in America than any other demographic, and as a whole, we have a purchasing power of over $1.3 trillion.This is why in just a few days, Latinos from all across the country in a variety of fields, and some of the top-most influential Latino leaders in the nation, will come together to share their stories and have bold, transparent, and inclusive conversations about what our community needs to do moving forward.These leaders will include Latino Victory Foundation’s co-founder and current DNC Finance Chair Henry Muñoz, the first Latina to be elected to serve in our U.S. Senate, Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto, internationally recognized and award-winning culinary innovator Chef José Andrés, astronaut and “Reaching for the Stars” founder Jose Hernández, Women’s March Artistic Director Paola Mendoza, CNN Political Commentator and champion for Latino rights Ana Navarro, and more.Continuing to focus on our accomplishments, strategizing on how we can continue building our agenda, and supporting and lifting each other up to reach individual goals at every experience level is key. For example, by focusing on down ballot elections, we have made strides in this effort by helping to elect the largest number of Latinos in the United States Congress. And just this past week, we reached a victory with Jon Ossoff, who earned 48.6% of the vote and will face a runoff election this June to flip Georgia’s 6th Congressional District.The important conversations taking place by Latino leaders are only the beginning. Everyone has a personal story and a voice that can inspire their own community. Latinos have come so far as a community and have fought for decades to uplift our status, and for what? To find ourselves yet again in peril? One thing we have learned as activists is that we cannot do this alone: we need our leaders and each other. We need you.We must work together as a community to take action and protect our constitutional, civil, and human rights that America stands for. What is at stake? The stakes are high. In his first few weeks in office, Trump laid out a path that echoed his racial and bigotry campaign dialogue to set Latinos back. In his State of the Union address, Trump once again attempted to manipulatively and prejudicially justify his massive deportation policy. Instead of highlighting the many contributions made by Latino immigrants, Trump chose to invite a victim of an isolated crime regretfully committed by a Latino — an offense that our community understands must face justice. Even worse, his controversial series of Executive Orders include expanding detention center capacities (which are already overflowing), militarizing border communities by increasing the number of border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and building a border wall, an act that 61% of Texans are against according to a poll released this past week. His policies also include withholding federal funds needed for security and social programs to sanctuary cities. Essentially, Trump threatened that he would strip federal money from cities that refuse to comply with deporting immigrants -- Miami/Dade was the first to retreat and many cities have filed lawsuits against Trump in retaliation. In addition, the orders call for expanding the criteria of immigrants who are priorities for removal. This should NOT include innocent DREAMers like Juan Manuel Montes-Bojorquez, who is presumably the first, and sadly not the last, protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient to be deported. With the help of the National Immigration Law Center, Juan Manuel is suing the U.S. government and his case will be heard by the U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump questioned for his 'Mexican Heritage’ during the campaign. Plus, the “Muslim Travel Ban” has been called out by federal judges for being in violation of our constitutional rights, which is why states and universities have sued Trump over its illegality.And, just this past week, Trump released another anti-immigrant executive order that greatly affects H1-B Visa recipients. In an attempt to hype up his “Buy American, Hire American” agenda, Trump is hurting key U.S. industries, especially large tech firms like Google and Facebook.If Trump wants companies to hire American, then we need to educate Americans and NOT cut our education budget as Trump has proposed. He should not eliminate college grant programs for low-income and underprivileged students, decrease money for job training, after-school programs and services to promote higher education, and deter teaching performance and effectiveness. Where does he expect to find qualified and specialized workers if capable individuals in the U.S., including Latinos, don’t have access to the right education? We must not short change the fact that 83% of America’s top high school science students are the children of immigrants.In addition to cutting education initiatives in his first 100 days, Trump has also setback key environmental programs, attacked women and LGBTQ rights, and proposed cuts to programs for senior citizens.Among Trump’s defeats include successfully failing to destroy the Affordable Care Act, which has helped more than four million Latinos in the U.S. And, a failed Department of Justice attempt at halting a major Texas Voter ID law case, or SB14, that was filed during the Obama Administration arguing that lawmakers had intent to discriminate against Latinos and minorities when forming the law. A federal judge has ruled twice that Texas did intentionally discriminate.These reasons and more are why Latinos must continue to fight back and step forward to lead our march for progress."

With an elaborate design that boasted public squares, neoclassical architecture, and a road system that allowed the urban market to flourish, the city was ahead of its time. Today, the historic downtown is known for its unique infrastructure and breadth of architectural gems, attracting millions of visitors each year. Although the city will always lovingly celebrate its past, it is looking to the future with a 2018 redesign of the historic downtown area that will make better use of the waterside space and public areas, and improve the overall experience for residents and visitors alike. The city of Savannah tapped global urban design firm EDSA to take on the task, with an emphasis on preserving its rich history. AD spoke with John Torti, a senior associate at EDSA, about the firm’s design plans, the obstacles they faced, and how they intend to stay true to Savannah’s historic roots.Architectural Digest: What are the primary reasons the city of Savannah is ready for a major redesign?John Torti: Savannah is known for its rich history, and tourism is a vital component of the local economy. In recent years the historic downtown area has seen a surge in development projects, and the city thought it was an appropriate time to improve the public realm.AD: Walk us through the plans.JT: Once we understood the vision and created our guiding principles for the project we came up with two initial concepts for the community to react to. One focuses on the historical significance of the city, pulling cues from the city’s grid system, the use of live oak trees, and the historic building materials. The other ties in with the city’s relationship to the water, in this case the Savannah River, which really is the true lifeline of the city — it’s what brought the first ships there in 1733. This plan lends itself more towards wayfinding, using palm trees and nautical detailing to orient users in the downtown area and guide them to the river.AD: How are you working with the community during this project?JT: We’ve done a lot of consensus building within the community, it’s been an integral part of the design process. Throughout the conceptual design phase, which we actually just wrapped up, we had a series of six meetings with the public, and at each meeting we honed the design and got input from the residents and the city so we could ultimately create a cohesive design that works for all users.AD: What are some of the major challenges of redesigning a historic city?JT: We often find certain needs from the community exceed the space we have to work with. This is very common when working in historical places, whether we have to work with existing buildings or 100-year-old oak trees, those things define the space that you have and as designers we need to get creative with the space allotted. Through several evolutions of planning, we began to work with the constraints and find a way to celebrate them in the process.AD: What were you most excited about when taking on this project?JT: As designers, nothing excites us more than to see our vision become reality. We focus on implementation and we pride ourselves on this. Creating a cohesive, innovative public space that enhances the quality of life for Savannah residents really brings us great joy.AD: Are there any eco-friendly initiatives involved in EDSA’s design?JT: It’s always important for us to be as sustainable as possible, whether it’s the use of building materials or the type of infrastructure we implement. We have many different green goals, such as the use of bioswales and permeable paving that will reduce the amount of burden on the existing infrastructure. We also hope the city takes cues from this and begins to make these new standards for future projects.AD: In what ways will Savannah benefit from the redesign?JT: The ultimate plan, once implemented, will provide a safe, walkable public realm that enriches the quality of life for Savannah residents while continuing to exceed visitors’ expectations. It will be a design that celebrates the city’s natural and timeless beauty while preserving the history and tradition of Savannah—making it a model city for another century to come.More from Architectural Digest:126 Stunning Celebrity Homes Inside Jennifer Aniston's Gorgeous Beverly Hills Home Go Inside a $53 Million Private Jet Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady's Incredible L.A.

Ruling Socialist party candidate Benoit Hamon, also threw his support behind Macron in light of the results.France finds itself at somewhat of a crossroads in its political history. Working-class voters are struggling with high unemployment and an economy that hasn’t fully recovered from the European debt crisis. Several French cities are reeling from recent deadly terrorist attacks. Just on Thursday, a 39-year-old French national killed one police officer and injured several more on Paris’ Champs Elysées, in an incident that the self-described Islamic State took credit for shortly after. French authorities foiled yet another attack in the city of Marseille earlier last week. Following the Champs Elysées attack, President Donald Trump predicted that the shooting would have a “big effect” on the election. Le Pen gave a speech in which she vowed to protect France. Fillon also sought to position himself as tough on terror following the attack, saying that fighting “Islamist totalitarianism” needed to be a priority for the government.But despite the hard-line rhetoric, the attack did not appear to shift voting patterns. The early results mostly reflected polls before the attack, and neither Fillon nor Le Pen gained a boost that propelled them into first place. Security fears still loomed over France on Sunday as citizens voted, however, and a polling station in the eastern town of Besancon was evacuated after a stolen vehicle was reportedly abandoned nearby with its engine still running.President Trump suggested that he was keeping a close eye on the election, tweeting that it was “very interesting.” As of early evening on Sunday, turnout was down around 1 percent from the 2012 election. French citizens abroad also voted over the weekend, forming long lines at polling stations in a number of major cities across the globe.The campaign itself was marked by scandal, surprises and upsets at every turn.First, President Hollande announced he would not seek re-election. Then, former President Nicolas Sarkozy failed to win his party’s nomination when Fillon, who served as prime minister from 2007 to 2017, beat him in the primaries.The conservative Fillon was a likely front-runner, appealing to right-wing voters with a pro-business and socially conservative platform mixed with anti-immigration and anti-Islam views. But a series of scandals, including allegations Fillon had paid his family members to work as parliamentary aides, caused his support to plummet. As Fillon’s star faded, Macron’s rose. A relative political novice, Macron founded his own political party, En Marche! (which translates roughly to “Onward!”). After leaving investment banking in 2014, he served as Hollande’s economic minister until deciding to run for office last year. Unlike Le Pen, Macron is pro-E.U. and pro-immigration.For Le Pen, the election is the ultimate test of her efforts to bring the extreme-right National Front into the mainstream. Le Pen took over the party’s leadership from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and has worked hard to clean up its image. She remains vehemently anti-immigration and has vowed to hold a referendum on France’s membership in the European Union if elected.Le Pen is also an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin. During a visit to the Kremlin last month, she called sanctions against Russia “silly” and reiterated her desire for closer ties with Russia. Faced with declining polls in recent weeks, Le Pen has made a sharp turn to the right and intensified her anti-immigrant rhetoric.For months, polls have been leaning in favor of a runoff between Le Pen and Macron, putting Le Pen’s presidential dream within reach. And she’s managed to harness the youth vote: An Ifop survey last month revealed that 39 percent of French voters between the ages of 18 and 24 back her.But the far-left Mélenchon, 65, threw a major curveball by soaring to prominence in the final stretch of the race. A open admirer of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and former Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong, Mélenchon spent decades in the Socialist Party before forming his own party, La France Insoumise (“A France That Won’t Bow Down”) last year.He views himself as a patriot who wants to end austerity and boost the economy with a giant stimulus package while also reducing the workweek to 32 hours.

We’re clearly turning a page in French political history,” Macron said of the early results in a statement to Agence France-Presse.Le Pen also reacted triumphantly to the result.“The great debate will finally take place. The French must seize this historic opportunity,” she tweeted.People around the world are watching the election as a litmus test of just how influential the strains of populism and nationalism in Europe have become.The threat of terror and a lack of jobs have fueled distrust in the government and reinvigorated a vicious debate about immigration and national identity. But the vote is just as much a test for the future of Europe. Compounding France’s internal challenges are the rise of populism and the rejection of establishment politics in places like Britain and the United States. Trust in the European system has eroded, and proposals to depart the European Union have become en vogue for populist candidates across the continent. French candidates and politicians reacted almost immediately to the results, and many called for the country to rally around Macron in the second round.Conservative candidate Fillon, while giving his concession speech, called on supporters to vote for Macron. Ruling Socialist party candidate Benoit Hamon, also threw his support behind Macron in light of the results.France finds itself at somewhat of a crossroads in its political history. Working-class voters are struggling with high unemployment and an economy that hasn’t fully recovered from the European debt crisis. Several French cities are reeling from recent deadly terrorist attacks. Just on Thursday, a 39-year-old French national killed one police officer and injured several more on Paris’ Champs Elysées, in an incident that the self-described Islamic State took credit for shortly after. French authorities foiled yet another attack in the city of Marseille earlier last week. Following the Champs Elysées attack, President Donald Trump predicted that the shooting would have a “big effect” on the election. Le Pen gave a speech in which she vowed to protect France. Fillon also sought to position himself as tough on terror following the attack, saying that fighting “Islamist totalitarianism” needed to be a priority for the government.But despite the hard-line rhetoric, the attack did not appear to shift voting patterns. The early results mostly reflected polls before the attack, and neither Fillon nor Le Pen gained a boost that propelled them into first place. Security fears still loomed over France on Sunday as citizens voted, however, and a polling station in the eastern town of Besancon was evacuated after a stolen vehicle was reportedly abandoned nearby with its engine still running.President Trump suggested that he was keeping a close eye on the election, tweeting that it was “very interesting.” As of early evening on Sunday, turnout was down around 1 percent from the 2012 election. French citizens abroad also voted over the weekend, forming long lines at polling stations in a number of major cities across the globe.The campaign itself was marked by scandal, surprises and upsets at every turn.First, President Hollande announced he would not seek re-election. Then, former President Nicolas Sarkozy failed to win his party’s nomination when Fillon, who served as prime minister from 2007 to 2017, beat him in the primaries.The conservative Fillon was a likely front-runner, appealing to right-wing voters with a pro-business and socially conservative platform mixed with anti-immigration and anti-Islam views. But a series of scandals, including allegations Fillon had paid his family members to work as parliamentary aides, caused his support to plummet. As Fillon’s star faded, Macron’s rose. A relative political novice, Macron founded his own political party, En Marche! (which translates roughly to “Onward!”). After leaving investment banking in 2014, he served as Hollande’s economic minister until deciding to run for office last year. Unlike Le Pen, Macron is pro-E.U. and pro-immigration.For Le Pen, the election is the ultimate test of her efforts to bring the extreme-right National Front into the mainstream. Le Pen took over the party’s leadership from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and has worked hard to clean up its image. She remains vehemently anti-immigration and has vowed to hold a referendum on France’s membership in the European Union if elected.Le Pen is also an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin. During a visit to the Kremlin last month, she called sanctions against Russia “silly” and reiterated her desire for closer ties with Russia. Faced with declining polls in recent weeks, Le Pen has made a sharp turn to the right and intensified her anti-immigrant rhetoric.For months, polls have been leaning in favor of a runoff between Le Pen and Macron, putting Le Pen’s presidential dream within reach. And she’s managed to harness the youth vote: An Ifop survey last month revealed that 39 percent of French voters between the ages of 18 and 24 back her.But the far-left Mélenchon, 65, threw a major curveball by soaring to prominence in the final stretch of the race. A open admirer of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and former Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong, Mélenchon spent decades in the Socialist Party before forming his own party, La France Insoumise (“A France That Won’t Bow Down”) last year.He views himself as a patriot who wants to end austerity and boost the economy with a giant stimulus package while also reducing the workweek to 32 hours. Like Le Pen, he opposes E.U. and various other international institutions, including the World Trade Organization.This story has been updated as polls close in France.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified the gunman who shot two police officers along the Champs Elysées as Belgian; he was French."

""He was unbelievable.”",2017-04-23,Memphis Grizzlies guard Troy Daniels (30) and San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard (2) fight for the rebound during the second half in game four of the first round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs at FedExForum. Memphis Grizzlies defeated the San Antonio Spurs 110-108 in overtime.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fc54312600003596c472d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. ― Kawhi Leonard was making everything, scoring San Antonio’s last 16 points in the fourth quarter and finishing with a career-high 43 points.The Spurs’ young star hit 7 of 10 shots from 3-point range, made one-legged, fade-away jumpers and put his team on his back while scoring eight of their 12 points in overtime.It still wasn’t enough.In the end, it was Marc Gasol’s floating jumper over LaMarcus Aldridge with 0.7 seconds left in overtime that gave the Memphis Grizzlies a 110-108 victory over the Spurs on Saturday night at FedExForum to even their first-round Western Conference playoff series at 2-2.“(Gasol) made the play that mattered,” said Mike Conley, who led Memphis with a postseason franchise record 35 points and had nine rebounds and eight assists. “It’s scary as hell watching (Leonard). He was unbelievable.”Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said the same of the game.“Both teams played their hearts out,” he said. “Just a fantastic basketball game. The fans got their money’s worth. Marc made a great shot. L.A. (Aldridge) contested it very well; it (went) down.”But one key shot right at the rim did not go down. With 1:36 left in overtime and the Spurs up 102-100, Spurs guard Tony Parker stole a pass from Conley and had a fastbreak with Patty Mills. But as Mills went in for what looked like a sure layup and a four-point lead, Grizzlies rookie guard Andrew Harrison blocked him from behind.That started a fastbreak the other way that ended with a Gasol layup, a foul by David Lee, and a Gasol free throw for a 103-102 Memphis lead.“That was the play of the game, other than Marc’s,” Conley said. “For a young guy to make a play like that, that’s a five-point swing. We gave it up for him in the locker room, that’s for sure.”Said Harrison, who also had seven points and three rebounds: “I just didn’t want to give up on the play. I thought I had a chance to hit the ball and I did.”Leonard added eight rebounds, six steals and three assists to his stat line and his fade-away jumper with 12 seconds left in regulation gave San Antonio a 96-94 lead.But Conley, who had 11 points in the fourth, answered with a floater in the lane with 4.5 seconds left to tie the game at 96. Leonard then missed a contested 21-footer at the buzzer to send the game into overtime.It was a rare miss in the fourth quarter and overtime, where Leonard was 8-for-13 from the floor and 5-for-6 from distance.“Honestly, I’m taking suggestions on how to guard Kawhi Leonard,” Memphis coach David Fizdale said. “I’ve tried everything and the guy is just tough. Man, is he a superstar.”The Grizzlies overcame 23 turnovers that translated into 31 San Antonio points.“You just got to keep playing,” said Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph, who had 12 points and 11 rebounds. “You got to go on to the next play, and the next play after that.”Gasol finished with 16 points, 12 rebounds and four assists; he also committed seven turnovers. JaMychal Green had 14 points off the bench.Parker had 22 points and five assists for San Antonio. Aldridge scored 13 points.The Spurs shot 42.3 percent from the floor and went 9-for-30 from 3-point range (30 percent). Memphis shot 46.3 percent from the field while going 12-for-27 from distance (44.4 percent).The Spurs had a 10-point lead in the first quarter and an opportunity to take away the Grizzlies’ hope. But passing that first test set Memphis up for all the others that would follow.“I learned a long time ago if you don’t have mental stability when they punch you in the mouth, you’re in the wrong business,” Fizdale said.“I thought we played well enough to win the game,” Parker said, and then looking ahead to Game 5 in San Antonio: “It’s a must-win situation for us now.”Conley says the Grizzlies view Game 5 the same way.“Of course, we’re in desperation mode,” he said. “According to the media, we were supposed to be swept anyway.”NOTES: The Grizzlies’ Game 3 victory on Thursday night snapped the Spurs’ 10-game postseason winning streak over Memphis. The Grizzlies had not defeated the Spurs since Game 6 of their first-round series in 2011 when Memphis became just the second No. 8 seed in NBA history to eliminate a No. 1 seed. ... Spurs C Dewayne Dedmon missed Game 4 with an illness. David Lee started in his place. ... Memphis SG Vince Carter (13 points) became the first 40-year-old to make at least three triples in a playoff game, going 3-for-5 from long range."
36,POLITICS,Homeland Security Secretary: 'I Don't Know How To Stop' Homegrown Terrorist Attacks,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kelly-homegrown-terrorism_us_58fcb30ce4b06b9cb9178da7,"""There are so many aspects to this terrorist thing,"" John Kelly said.",2017-04-23,"Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly says homegrown terrorist attacks are the most common, but he doesn't know how to stop them.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fcb6511c00003a00e812f1.jpeg?cache=f8AH0tpxWk&ops=crop_0_500_3500_1833%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"John Kelly, the man in charge of protecting the nation’s homeland security, admitted Sunday that he has absolutely no idea how to prevent homegrown terrorist attacks. “There are so many aspects to this terrorist thing,” Kelly, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”“Obviously, you got the homegrown terrorists. I don’t know how to stop that. I don’t know how to detect that. You got other terrorist threats that come across the border.”Kelly’s admission to CBS host John Dickerson was surprising, in part because of its candor. For all of President Donald Trump’s focus on the border and banning people from Muslim-majority countries from the United States, the administration apparently doesn’t know how to deal with what Kelly said are the most common types of attacks.DICKERSON: I just want to follow up, Mr. Secretary. You said on the homegrown threat, a lot of people think that is the biggest threat. It was part of the San Bernardino shooting, a part of the Boston bombing. But you said you don’t know how to stop that. If that’s the biggest threat and you don’t know how to stop it, that seems like a big problem. In February, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats released a report looking at “the American face of ISIS” ― 104 individuals the Department of Justice indicted for ISIS-related crimes between March 2014 and August 2016, and eight individuals who died on behalf of ISIS either in a domestic attack or fighting in Syria. The researchers found that these individuals were mostly born in the United States. As Kelly noted, cooperation with the communities these individuals belong to is key to fighting the terrorist threat. Trump, however, has alienated many potential allies by campaigning on a promise to implement a “Muslim ban.” A December 2015 press release from his campaign stated, “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”In January, Trump implemented the first version of his ban, taking aim at travelers and refugees from certain Muslim-majority nations. However, his order also had the effect of blocking and delaying green card holders who were trying to re-enter the United States.After a judge halted that order, the Trump issued a revised version, which is also currently on hold in the courts.

The soldier yelled, “In 10 minutes we will burn your house down.”Such incidents were common by the late-1930s in Germany. My grandmother, Ilsa Dahl Cole, grew up in Geilenkirchen, a small town in the western part of the country. My great-grandparents, Emil and Clara Dahl, were in the cattle business and identified as Germans who were also Jewish. My grandmother attended a Catholic high school, and for the most part, she had a normal, carefree childhood. But, there was growing anti-Semitism in her town, and with time, the government became more hostile toward Jews. The Nazis passed laws forbidding non-Jews from entering Jews’ houses and soldiers were stationed outside of Jewish homes. A lifelong friend pretended he’d never met her. Though there had been signs that the German government was growing more hostile toward Jews, in reality, the serious consequences of the bigotry didn’t reveal themselves until it was too late for many people. My grandmother explained that the changes were gradual. She said, “We always had the feeling, well if we can’t participate in whatever the Germans do, we’ll just go on the way we can…” In the mid-1930s, my grandmother moved to Berlin. She attended the Jewish-only design school, but as anti-Semitism swept the nation, the school was closed. Jews weren’t allowed in theaters and couldn’t have telephones. Jewish butcher stores were closed, and other butchers wouldn’t sell meat to them. Barbers wouldn’t cut Jews’ hair. My grandmother reflected, “It was so inhumane.” Despite this, she did her best to lead a normal life. She secured a job as a dressmaker, met my grandfather, and got engaged. When my grandparents heard about Nazis entering hotels and restaurants and arresting Jews who then permanently vanished, they knew they had to leave. My grandparents contacted relatives in America and received ‘sponsorship’ letters stating that, if need be, they would be taken care of financially.

In early November, she went to Geilenkirchen to be with her parents for the couple of weeks she had left in Germany. On November 9, nine days before my grandmother was scheduled to leave, Germany changed forever. A Polish Jew killed a German diplomat in Paris. Radio reports made it clear that non-Jewish Germans should blame and punish Jews for the murder. It was that same night that the soldier threatened to burn down my great-grandparents’ home. Heeding the soldier’s warning, my grandmother grabbed her passport, threw things into a suitcase, and took the handful of valuables her mother offered her.

Professional development is important, but why stop there? If you really want to blow your boss’s mind, soak up everything you can about your company and your industry. For example, if you’re an IT developer, instead of simply learning the current best practices in coding, learn how those practices are being applied throughout your industry.Transferring your knowledge to the real-world context of your organization is a great way to add value. On top of knowing how to do your job, it shows that you know why you’re doing it and why it matters.Step 2: Instead of always having the answer, pre-empt the question.It’s a good feeling when you can answer your boss’s questions on the spot, without shuffling through piles of paper or telling her that you’ll have to get back to her. But if you really want to blow her mind, pre-empt the question. Anticipate what she wants to stay on top of, and send her regular updates. You’ll save her time and energy, and she’ll appreciate that just as much as your enthusiasm.Step 3: Instead of owning up to mistakes once they’re discovered, bring them to light yourself.Accountability is a lost art. Too many people try to cover up their mistakes, fearing the repercussions of admitting fault. Show your boss that you’re not afraid to own up to your mistakes, and he’ll be amazed. When you make a mistake, just give your boss a simple heads-up, and have a solution ready. Even better, tell him the steps you’ve already taken to mitigate the problem.Everyone makes mistakes. You’ll stand out by showing your boss that you’re accountable, creative, and proactive when you inevitably make them.Step 4: Instead of asking for training, do it on your own.Typical career advice is to ask your boss to send you to classes and workshops to improve your skills. But we’re not talking about what’s typical; we’re talking about blowing your boss’s mind. Pursue training yourself, on your own time. It doesn’t have to be expensive; there are plenty of online courses available free or close to free. While everybody else is asking the boss to send them to training, you can tell her what you’ve already done, and your initiative will be rewarded. You’ll save the company money and get ahead, and expand your skillset at the same time.Step 5: Instead of doing what you’re told, be proactive.Anybody (well, almost anybody) can do what they’re told. To blow your boss’s mind, you have to be proactive. If you see a problem, fix it. If you see something that needs doing, do it. Put together a how-to guide for new hires, document your processes and figure out where you can streamline them, or do whatever else you can think of to make a difference.Bosses appreciate vision more than anything. They love it when you see what could be useful to the company over the long term—and don’t forget to tell your boss about it. It’s only “kissing up” if you do it manipulatively or with the intention of making your co-workers look bad. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with owning your accomplishments.Step 6: Build relationships with other departments.It’s practically guaranteed that, at some point, your department will need help or input from another area. An excellent way to blow your boss’s mind is to build relationships throughout the company. Person-to-person interactions are almost always more effective than department-to-department exchanges. You can make your boss’s day by saying, “Why don’t I take care of that for you? I know someone who can get that done for us right away.”Step 7: Be the calm one in a crisis.Few things get your boss’s attention like your ability to weather a storm. Whether it’s conflict between people, everyone freaking out over a rule change, or what have you, make certain that you’re the one who remains calm, composed, and in control of your emotions. Your composure and ability to think clearly during a crisis demonstrates leadership potential, and leaders get promoted.Bringing It All TogetherThe people who achieve the most are those who add the most value. Business is, after all, about making a profit. You want your boss and the company to know that they’re getting a great return on the time and money they’re investing in you.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?

Here's why.,2017-04-23,"<p><a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a> Speaking in Michigan</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fc3b592600001700c472cd.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Held in the middle of one of the most tumultuous eras of American politics, the 1965 New York Mayoral Election marked an important turning point in our history. The handsome John Lindsay, a progressive Republican at a time when the party had their fair share of liberals, managed to etch out a victory against future mayor Abraham Beam, a typical Tammany Hall Democrat. Lindsay would go on to serve two terms as mayor before watching his political career falter, but he may not have become mayor at all were it not for one man: William F. Buckley. While the late conservative intellectual is now better known for his philosophical contributions to the American right, he had a brief — but significant — career as a politician.Buckley knew that he wouldn’t win the election. That wasn’t why he was running. In reality, the only real motive for Buckley was that he didn’t want to see a liberal Republican like Lindsay do well, lest John Lindsay become a central figure in the GOP and set back the young but burgeoning conservative movement. But, while Buckley may have hoped to stop Lindsay by chipping off Republican-leaning millionaires, his strongest support actually came from ethnic whites, or what we’d now call the “white working class.” In contrast, Lindsay, an Upper-East Sider and a quintessential member of the “liberal elite,” won by driving up the score with marginalized populations that saw a champion in him. Throughout his mayoralty, Lindsay would fight for the rights of African-Americans, Latinos, and even the LGBTQ community, earning their support–as well as the disdain of the white working class. Fifty-two years later, the politics of 1965 New York remain astoundingly relevant.While the white working class may not have had the political capital to even come close to electing Buckley, it was (barely) able to elect Donald Trump. But Trump was merely the capstone of white working class support for the GOP: For the first time in decades–and probably in all of American history–the white ethnic working class is the cornerstone, the central bloc, of the Republican Party’s voting base. This has understandably stunned liberals, partially because such voters formed a critical bloc of the Democratic Party as recently as thirty years ago. But it’s also because, from a liberal perspective, the Democratic Party should be the natural home of the white working class. After all, the Democratic Party is the one that stands up to big business. The Democratic Party is the one that stands up for Medicare and other entitlement programs. The Democratic Party is the one that rejects generous tax breaks for the 1%. The Democratic Party is the one that stands up for the workingman. And yet the Democratic Party seems unable to earn the support of the very people it claims to champion.Why? Opinions vary; the “Establishment” wing of the party (e.g. Nancy Pelosi, Seth Moulton, the Crooked Team) believes that the Democratic Party needn’t make any policy changes. They say that the party already has policies to support these voters in place and that the real problem comes from a failure to communicate them. The “Progressive” wing (e.g. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Keith Ellison) says that the problem is systematic, that the party is not with working people and must move further to the left to earn their support. And then, of course, there are your Thomas Franks, who more or less say that the real problem is that working class citizens have been brainwashed into supporting Republicans by way of the culture wars. Each diagnoses is compelling and persuasive, but also fundamentally wrong headed. The problem is that every pundit who holds these views has forgotten a fundamental rule of anthropological research (and the entire American working class is so foreign to Jon Lovett that we should call it anthropological): relativism. Each and every one of them asks, “How could these people who would so clearly benefit from Democratic policies vote Republican? What could possibly lead them to do such a thing?” As a result, they more or less try to figure out what might lead them to support Republicans if they were in the white working class’s shoes, seemingly without considering the possibility that the white working class views the world and its problems in a completely different way.But the problem is that they do see the world a different way. They see most problems and solutions differently, which ultimately renders a lot of proposed solutions politically worthless.Take Trump’s budget proposal as an example.Looking at it from a policy perspective, the plan is abysmal and would do nothing to make America great. The military budget in the U.S. is already sky high; the EPA–the program that helps keep the Mississippi River clean–is already cut to the bones; the National Endowment for the Arts is already underfunded, and it supports our museums, not starving artists bumming off of government assistance; the state department saves American lives by using diplomatic methods to solve conflicts, and it keeps relations with our allies intact; and if there’s a hammock sustaining the lives of welfare queens, it’s a poorly built hammock made of rusted nails and under-funded programs, the same programs used to help the elderly and disabled. But, even though the budget probably won’t make it through Congress as is, I’m guessing that it’s the kind of budget that Trump’s base were hoping he’d introduce.Trump supporters tend to be skeptical of human-caused climate change and any regulatory solutions to the issue; this is probably because many voters believe these “solutions” do little more than eliminate good jobs for blue-collar workers. So, a cutback on the EPA not only reduces frivolous spending, it creates jobs! The N.E.A.? Another example of wasteful government spending that takes tax-dollars from the hardworking and gives it to something worthless. The state department? You can’t defeat ISIS with words. And those welfare programs? All they do is subsidize undeserving idlers at the expense of the workingman, yet another example of how the government is corrupt and has to be drained. And those Goldman Sachs bankers riddled among his cabinet? It seems that supporters don’t really blame the wealthy for our problems, even if his campaign rhetoric would seem to suggest otherwise. In their minds, businesses are private, create jobs, and are therefore responsible to no one but themselves and their stockholders; why else would they have trusted a businessman enough to elect him? Instead, many of them feel that the primary fault for the Great Recession lay with the government, who takes their money and then squanders it. It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean their views are necessarily in line with the mainstream Republican Party; they just think that the way the government currently spends is wasteful, not all government spending per se (see Medicare.)They do feel that the wealthy should pay more taxes, but not as strongly as they feel they themselves should pay fewer. They also tend to believe that higher spending on schools is okay, so long as none of that extra pay goes to teachers. I could go on and on, but my point is this: Trump supporters see the world very differently. They do practice identity politics, and they think that someone is eating their share of the pie. They do support big government programs, but only to the extent that these programs help themselves, not everyone else. In their minds, they “earned” their right to Medicare and Social Security, but no one earns the right to healthcare simply by being alive. They think the problems of the working poor simply come from the fact that they aren’t willing to work, and they’d be fine if they got jobs.Additionally, there’s a real resentment from working class Americans towards wealthier Americans. When I say wealthy, I’m not referring to Lloyd Blankfein or the Koch brothers; I’m talking about people who come from affluent communities like San Jose or Schaumburg. While most of these Americans think of themselves as middle-class, most of their fellow citizens would probably disagree. The residents in these areas dominate the political conversation, meaning that before Trump, a disproportionate amount of the political conversation was focused on the concerns of the wealthiest 25 percent of Americans. Meanwhile, many white working class members felt that their opinions and concerns were not only ignored, but were consciously disregarded and mocked by the “elite.” And if we’re being honest, it’s true. Whenever the elites do come up with solutions they say are supposed to benefit the working class, they’re thought up without any input from the very people they’re supposed to help. Some of the worst places to be poor or middle class in this country are also the most liberal. Only some of this is due to policy (though it’s usually when Democrats refuse to close down public schools in wealthy neighborhoods instead of poor,) but it gives the Republican Party some outstanding selling points about how the Democrats can’t run a government.Many liberals like to view themselves as champions for the working class, but many working class citizens from all backgrounds seem to disagree. And as someone who works in a warehouse that employs a lot of minorities, I can confirm that these views are not exclusive to the white working class. While white working class and minorities may not agree on issues like trade or police reform, they aren’t far apart on issues like trans-gender rights, abortion, military intervention, or “welfare queens” (I’ve personally heard minority members of the working class complain about how people on welfare have better lives than they do.) I’ve often wondered how large a coalition a Trump-like candidate without his racial dog whistles and conspiracy theories could form.It may sound weird that these are the sentiments held by the white working class, but, in the context of history, it really isn’t all that strange. While many like to think of the 1930s-40s as the triumph of progressivism in the U.S. (and, in a sense, it was,) a lot of white working class voters never completely bought into it. Throughout the Depression, the War, and beyond, Southern voters kept sending conservative, Blue Dog Democrats like Joe Robinson and John Garner to Washington, and these men always found their way into important leadership positions once there. They were fairly progressive on women’s rights, but that’s about it. These men (and they were all men) are why we didn’t establish a national health care service in the 1940s and why it took until the 1960s to desegregate. They fought the creation of a universal welfare state, and they opposed the 1964 Immigration and Nationality Act. They resisted most aspects of the New Deal, and formed an integral part of the informal conservative coalition. Working class voters turning to a candidate like Trump is not an aberration, it’s a return to normal.I’m not writing any of this to criticize or praise the working class, and I’m certainly not proposing that the Democratic Party create a platform that caters completely to the working class’s sentiments. While I sympathize with some working class resentments, my own views are generally somewhere to the left of Barack Obama and right of Bernie Sanders. But, I am arguing that a lot of Democrats are talking about the working class without talking to them, meaning that they don’t get what they want or value. If the folks on Pod Save America want to talk about the working class and what they want, maybe they should stop making assumptions and do some homework."

Earlier in the week, Chris Pratt told Men’s Fitness that Hollywood has a representation problem when it comes to blue-collar Americans, despite an Oscar season that highlighted the experience of working-class people (see: “Moonlight, “Manchester By The Sea” or “Fences”). “I don’t see personal stories that necessarily resonate with me, because they’re not my stories,” he said. “I think there’s room for me to tell mine, and probably an audience that would be hungry for them. The voice of the average, blue-collar American isn’t necessarily represented in Hollywood.”His comments immediately elicited a passionate response from tweeters who were quick to remind Pratt that not only are there a tons of movies about working-class white men, there are other and more pressing representational issues to focus on in Hollywood. Pratt apparently realized the error of his ways and took to social media on Friday to walk back his statements after the backlash. “That was actually a pretty stupid thing to say. I’ll own that,” he wrote on Friday. “There’s a ton of movies about blue-collar America.”Celebrities, take note. Now this is how to take responsibility and apologize publicly."

47,GREEN,Bill Nye Slams CNN For Putting Climate Change Skeptic On Earth Day Panel,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-nye-cnn-climate-change-denier_us_58fc08a6e4b06b9cb91767f1,"“I will say, as much as I love the CNN, you’re doing a disservice,"" Nye said.",2017-04-23,"Bill Nye leads demonstrators on a march to the U.S. Capitol during the March for Science on April 22, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fc18692600004500c472ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bill Nye will gladly talk to the media about climate change, but he has no time for climate change skeptics. The celebrity scientist slammed CNN’s “New Day” on Saturday for putting together an Earth Day panel that included William Happer ― a physicist who thinks carbon pollution is a myth and once said carbon dioxide was being demonized like Jewish people in Nazi Germany.When asked about Happer’s skepticism, Nye answered by providing Happer with a few facts about the rising rates of atmospheric CO2 ― but not before scolding the hosts for doing a “disservice” to their viewers.“I will say, as much as I love the CNN, you’re doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic, and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change,” Nye said, referring to the widespread consensus among scientists that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activity.Before he rose to fame as a TV science educator, Nye received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering at Cornell University and went on to work at Boeing, helping to design parts of Boeing 747 planes and equipment used to clean oil spills. Nye has also worked with NASA to create the MarsDial, a sundial and camera calibrator, for the Mars Exploration Rover project. The “Science Guy” currently serves as the chief executive officer of The Planetary Society, a nonprofit space interest group co-founded by astrophysicist Carl Sagan.Happer, a Princeton physics professor who studies “spin-polarized atoms and nuclei,” according to his online bio, had earlier stated that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.“There’s this myth that’s developed around carbon dioxide that it’s a pollutant,” Happer said. “But you and I both exhale carbon dioxide with every breath. Each of us emits about two pounds of carbon dioxide a day, so are we polluting the planet?”Nye pointed that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising at a record rate, according to data released this year by the Environmental System Research Laboratory.“What he claims to not understand is the rate. It’s the speed at which we’re adding carbon dioxide,” Nye said. “What you got to get is the speed at which things are changing.”Happer later pressed Nye on global warming, saying that Earth’s “temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmists’ computer models predicted.” He added: “The whole basis for the alarmism is not true. It’s based on flawed computer modeling.”To which Nye swiftly replied, “That’s completely wrong. Say what you will, but you have it absolutely wrong.” In the past, Happer has argued that global warming and an increase in carbon dioxide is “good for mankind.” The climate change skeptic met with President Donald Trump in January, sparking rumors that he was being considered for the role of science adviser.During Saturday’s panel, Nye offered Happer a bit of advice.“Sir, with some respect,” Nye said. “I encourage you to cut this out so that we can all move forward and make the United States a world leader in technology.”This story has been updated to include more information on Nye’s and Happer’s professional backgrounds."

Our values unify us. We are unified with our commitment to America’s working families about job creation, about budget policies that invest in the future, good-paying jobs.”Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said it’s fine if an elected Democratic official personally opposes abortion, but from a policy standpoint, he or she must support a woman’s right to choose.“When it comes to the policy position, I think we need to be clear and unequivocal,” Durbin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “As long as they are prepared to back the law, Roe vs. Wade, prepared to back women’s rights as we have defined them under the law, then I think they can be part of the party.”The issue is in the forefront because of recent drama over the Democratic National Committee last week endorsing a Democratic candidate for mayor of Omaha, Nebraska, who has a record of voting against abortion rights. Among other progressives, NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue torched the DNC for making a “politically stupid” move.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) went to Omaha last week to rally for Heath Mello, who is trying to unseat the city’s current GOP mayor. He said Sunday that he didn’t think the intraparty scuffle was that big of a deal.“I have a 100 percent lifetime pro-choice voting record,” Sanders said on CBS’ “Face The Nation.”“But if we are going to become a 50-state party, if you’re going to go to Omaha, Nebraska, which has a Republican governor, two Republican senators, all Republican Congress people, Republican legislature, you know what?” he continued. “If you have a rally in which you have the labor movement, and the environmentalists, and Native Americans, and the African American community, and the Latino community coming together, saying, ‘We want this guy to become our next mayor,’ should I reject going there to Omaha? I don’t think so.”Sanders pointed out that Mello’s opponent is also anti-choice.“And she is inviting Scott Walker, one of the most reactionary, anti-choice governors, anti-labor governors, anti-education governors, to campaign for her,” he said. “The choice is clear. And I hope very much the Democratic candidate there wins.”"

The herders were searching for pasture as Kenya suffers an intense drought, local police chief Ezekiel Chepkowny said, according to The Associated Press.She was airlifted to a hospital in Nairobi and emerged from surgery in stable but critical condition, Gallman’s friends and family say.Herders have said they need land from Gallman’s 139-square-mile conservancy to graze their livestock. Authorities believe some of them recently set fire to a retreat on Gallman’s property favored by her late son.“Fear not,” she wrote on her Facebook page after the alleged arson. “I am alive my spirit holds and I shall never give up.”A Kenyan citizen and author of bestseller I Dreamed of Africa, Gallman has been raising funds to rebuild the retreat and improve security on her land.Sveva Gallman, Gallman’s daughter, told NPR earlier this month that while they’ve always allowed herders to graze their animals on the land, more herders from far away have showed up with thousands of cattle and increased tensions. She suspects that some of the livestock is owned by wealthy politicians.Gallman hasn’t been the only target of violence in the Laikipia region. Herders are suspected of killing British rancher and safari company founder Tristan Voorspuy, who was shot to death while inspecting his lodges.At least four police officers have been shot and injured during confrontations with herders in the region, Kenyan outlet Daily Nation reported. In February, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta declared the country’s drought a national disaster. The Red Cross says 2.7 million people risk starvation. "

Roger Ailes was ― could be ― charming, he could be quite charismatic, he could be uproariously funny. He could also be a bit of a bully and mean, and he also was often kind of grossly inappropriate with things that he would say,” such as talking about body parts, asking colleagues to spin around for him and wanting to be greeted with a hug. In one instance when she was new at the network, Camerota said, Ailes implied she’d have to have engage sexually with him for more career opportunities. “He said, ‘Well, I would have to work with you. I’d have to work with you in that case. I’d have to work with you really closely, and it may require us getting to know each other better, and that might have to happen away from here, and it might have to happen at a hotel. Do you know what I’m saying?’”She decided to ignore Ailes’ advances and “pretend it never happened” but was keenly aware of how her career may be jeopardized. “I remember vividly that I had sort of an out-of-body experience hovering over us in the office and thinking, ‘Is this it? Is this the end of my time here? Will I be fired if I don’t do this?’” she recalled. “And I just want everybody to understand that when it happens, there is a visceral reaction that you have where you recognize my career and everything I’ve worked for is under threat and I don’t know what’s going to happen next.” More than 20 other women have publicly and privately accused Ailes of sexual harassment. He resigned in disgrace in July 2016 amid those allegations and a lawsuit from former “Fox & Friends” co-host Gretchen Carlson.But Ailes’ harassment was not just sexual. In the years that followed, Camerota said his treatment of her morphed into “emotional harassment” in which he targeted her for maintaining political neutrality on air. “He said, ‘You’re not saying the conservative things that I want you to say, and you could be a real role model, and you could be a real star, if only you could sound conservative,’” she recalled, adding he often argued with her and lectured her.Toward the end of her decade-plus career there, she started refusing to go to Ailes’ office and eventually decided his treatment of her was reason to leave the network. Ailes’ attorney Susan Estrich denies Camerota’s claims.“These are unsubstantiated and false allegations,” she said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post. “Mr. Ailes never engaged in the inappropriate conversations she now claims occurred, and he vigorously denies this fictional account of her interactions with him and of Fox News editorial policy.”A spokeswoman for Fox News declined to comment. Camerota told CNN she is hopeful that the Murdoch family’s removal of Ailes and O’Reilly signifies “a turning point” at Fox News.Last week on her show “New Day,” Camerota miffed at statements from Fox News that women had not called the network’s hotline to report sexual misconduct.“There was no hotline,” she said. “If a hotline is secret, it doesn’t work.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fba6b32600004500c47253.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Leland Melvin hasn’t been to space since the beginning of Barack Obama’s presidency, but he’s sure glad to be back on Earth now. The former NASA astronaut joined thousands Saturday on the National Mall for “the March for Science,” a mass protest against an array of President Donald Trump’s policies that critics say attack or dismiss critical scientific evidence. “I’ve seen the planet from the vantage point of space,” Melvin, 53, told The Huffington Post, ducking into a tent to avoid the chilly drizzle outside. “It’s a beautiful planet, but there are a lot of things that are going on and, without the data, without the science, we’re going to decimate our planet.” “We’re also going to eradicate our civilization,” he added.Melvin spoke on behalf of Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation nonprofit where he’s been a donating member for years. The group employs a bevy of biologists and wildlife conservationists at outposts across the U.S. “Science is the backbone of all we do,” Jared Saylor, a spokesman for Defenders of Wildlife, told HuffPost by phone. “Species are not able to survive unless there’s strong scientific data. That data is utilized for recovery plans and saving habitats.”The group has stepped up its efforts since Trump and the Republican-dominated 115th Congress took office. In February, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee began talks with Republicans to scale back the Endangered Species Act, the 44-year-old regulatory package they say puts too heavy a burden on businesses. The move was just one of many by Republican lawmakers to curb environmental or conservation rules. The White House’s proposed budget axed billions from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other programs that fund research, monitor the climate and preserve nature. In March, Trump signed an executive order rolling back the chief U.S. policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging production of coal and other fossil fuels. In one of his first decisions as EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt scrapped a rule requiring oil and gas drillers to report emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that lingers in the atmosphere and can increase temperatures up to 86 times more than carbon dioxide, according to some estimates.The assault on climate rules is meant to spur economic growth, officials say. But the administration’s bludgeon has landed on conservation regulations as well. Last month, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke lifted a ban on hunting with lead ammunition. Up to 20 million birds and other animals die each year from lead poisoning as a result of the nearly 100,000 tons of lead used by sportsmen, according to estimates from the Center for Biological Diversity. Earlier this month, Trump signed a bill into law that allows hunters to kill wolf pups and hibernating bears in their dens. That may be of particular concern to Melvin. The one-time National Football League draftee became internet famous earlier this year when his official 2009 NASA photo, featuring him in his space suit with his two adopted dogs, Jake and Scout, went viral.

He’s proposed to slash budgets for programs including the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA. He wants to cut $900 million to the Department of Energy’s Office of Science. He ordered the National Park Service to stop tweeting. He’s called climate change a “hoax” and doesn’t trust vaccines.Saturday marks the 47th Earth Day, and thousands of scientists and non-scientists alike are marching in solidarity around the country and beyond to send a clear message to Trump: Science isn’t going anywhere.Scientists organized the March for Science, and encouraged other “scientists, educators, and advocates, as well as social service workers, artists, trade workers, business people, our elderly population, and families to come together for science.” In a statement, Trump said “rigorous science” goes into his administration’s decision making.“We can and must protect our environment without harming America’s working families,” part of the statement reads. “That is why my Administration is reducing unnecessary burdens on American workers and American companies, while being mindful that our actions must also protect the environment.” Those “unnecessary burdens” have included nixing an Obama-era regulation to protect U.S. waterways from coal mining operations. Trump has also scrapped information on methane emissions, removed the word “science” from the EPA’s Office of Science and Technology mission statement, and rolled back standards on car pollution. Some of the biggest marches in the U.S. were taking place in New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C, among other cities all around the country.Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, called the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to science “irresponsible,” “selfish,” “shortsighted” and “bordering on chaos.”“Science matters and without science wildlife have no chance for survival,” she told HuffPost ahead of the march in D.C. “So goes wildlife, so goes us. We’re all connected on this planet, and it’s absolutely essential that we respect and take care of the finite resources that we have.”“Environmental security is economic security,” she added. “And without a strong environment, without a healthy environment, we are all in trouble.”Leland Melvin, a NASA astronaut who attended the march in D.C., recalled looking down on Earth from space in 2009.“I’m a scientist, I’m an engineer, I’ve seen the planet from the vantage point of space,” Melvin said. “And it’s a beautiful planet, but there are a lot of things going on and without the data and without the science, we are going to decimate our planet and eradicate our civilization. So we have to have science.”Teddy Shipman, an 8-year-old New Yorker in D.C. for the march, stressed the importance of a healthy environment.“Trees make oxygen,” Shipman said. “It helps us breathe. Who doesn’t like that?” In New York City, rain did not stop the throngs of demonstrators from making their voices heard. April Castoldi, a speech pathologist, said that too often, people mistake pseudoscience for hard facts.“I’m really concerned that Trump wants to cut the budget for the EPA,” Castoldi said. “My mom was an employee of the EPA for most of her career. The fact that he’s telling people not to consider climate change in their research is terrifying.”Justina Simon traveled to the NYC march from Huntsville, Alabama, a place that she noted has deep ties to science, as NASA has a facility there.“Science, I think, is very important to everyone, not just liberals or Republicans,” Simon said. “It’s not a partisan issue.”Tens of thousands of other people were also taking part in rallies, with 600 other marches happening around the world. Historians are calling the events “unprecedented in terms of the scale and breadth of the scientific community that’s involved,” Robert Proctor, a professor of the history of science at Stanford University, told The Washington Post. “Hell has no fury like a scientist whose integrity is questioned,” Kathleen Rogers, president of the Earth Day Network, told NPR. Her nonprofit helped organize the march in response to the Trump administration. “These folks aren’t making hundreds of millions of dollars. They’re not billionaires. They’re working at government rates so to speak. They are giving their lives to their work and have one thing to hang on to — the truth and their integrity.”“It’s not just lab people, but everyone from computer programmers to people working on cancer,” she added. “All these people, they’re not happy being called liars.” Castoldi said it felt good to be around likeminded people. New York demonstrator Anne DeAcetis felt the same way.“There’s a great sense of unity that you feel and you are heartened by seeing and being with people that agree with you, that you can talk to,” DeAcetis said. “It’s very energizing and I think that it gives you motivation for when you’re back alone in front of social media on your computer by yourself, to not forget that you are part of a community.”Alex Kaufman and Chris D’Angelo reported from Washington, D.C. Sam Levine reported from New York City.This article has been updated throughout with comments and more information on the marches.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misrepresented the number of countries participating in the march."

55,POLITICS,Disability Rights Advocates Accuse Washington Post Of Perpetuating 'Myths' About Benefits,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disability-rights-washington-post-benefits_us_58fabc0ae4b06b9cb9172add,They worry the newspaper's coverage will embolden politicians who want to slash aid.,2017-04-22,"Disability rights activists worry about the ammunition stories like the one in the Post could give to benefit-averse Republicans, who now control the White House and Congress.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f93ee31b0000330016cb23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Disability rights advocates and a leading Democratic think tank are livid at The Washington Post over a March 30 front-page story on the prevalence of disability benefits in rural America.The newspaper claimed that “as many as one-third of working-age adults” in rural communities receive disability benefits. But as the Center for American Progress calculated ― and The Huffington Post confirmed by looking at the raw data ― that proportion holds true in only one county in the entire country.Republicans often use stories like the Post’s to argue that the disability rolls have grown due to abuse from people who can work but simply do not want to. For example, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) complained in January 2015 that people were “gaming the system” to receive disability benefits. In fact, the Social Security Administration’s inspector general has estimated that the Social Security Disability Insurance program has a fraud rate below 1 percent. “They are perpetuating the same myths that have been debunked over and over again without regard for how misleading reporting can affect people with disabilities already living on the financial edge,” said Rebecca Vallas, managing director of the Center for American Progress’ Poverty to Prosperity program.The Post issued a correction about a narrow aspect of the story on Monday, downsizing its count of “highest participation” counties, but it did not revise its estimate of the prevalence of disability benefits in rural areas. It also did not respond to multiple requests to clarify outstanding questions about ways in which its framing of disability programs lacks context about the factors truly driving growth in the program, raising the possibility of political attacks on benefits and their recipients.The Washington Post’s article, “Disabled or Just Desperate? Rural Americans Turn to Disability as Jobs Dry Up,” tells the story of Desmond Spencer, 39, an out-of-work roofer with a bad knee, as he considers applying for SSDI.It is a vivid, empathic tale of one man’s struggle to maintain his dignity and care for his family members as they grapple with serious health problems and economic deprivation in job-scarce rural Alabama.Where the Post gets it wrong, according to CAP, is in its use of Spencer’s experience to suggest that excessive reliance on disability benefits is a virtual epidemic in some predominantly white, rural areas.Using the Post’s data, CAP took apart the Post’s boldest assertion: that “as many as one-third” of working-age adults in rural communities receive disability benefits.Out of more than 3,100 counties in the U.S., only McDowell County, West Virginia ― one of the most impoverished counties in the country ― comes close to one-third participation, with 32.2 percent of residents receiving either SSDI or SSI benefits. The actual average is only 9.1 percent of working-age adults in rural counties receive benefits from one of those two programs, according to CAP’s analysis of the data sets the Post used.“There’s a word for using data this way: cherry-picking,” Rebecca Vallas, Rachel West and Katherine Gallagher-Robbins of CAP’s Poverty to Prosperity program wrote in the analysis they published Tuesday. Even if the Post’s characterization had been accurate, though, disability rights advocates and liberal scholars would have taken issue with the fundamental premise of the story.The Post presents Spencer as an example of the millions of Americans who have begun receiving disability benefits “over the past two decades as the number of people on disability has surged.”Scholars do not dispute that disability rolls have increased. But when it comes to SSDI in particular, demographic factors, such as the aging of the baby boom generation and the rise in working women now eligible for benefits, can explain the vast majority of the increase in enrollment, noted Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who wrote her own critique of the Post story on March 31.And as Social Security’s full retirement age nears 67, it means more workers who would have transitioned into the retirement program at 65 have stayed on disability.“This is not a new phenomenon, and it is a totally expected phenomenon,” Romig said. Higher percentages of people with disabilities in rural counties, like the one where Spencer lives, she added, can be explained by the aging population and the higher concentration of blue-collar workers, who are more likely to work in physically debilitating jobs or lack access to adequate health care. The demographic-driven growth in the number of SSDI beneficiaries actually peaked in 2013 and has been declining steadily as baby boomers begin to draw Social Security.“Those trends have played themselves out, and we are in a different era now, but the media narrative has not caught up,” Romig said.The Post concedes as much, noting that the increase in benefits in rural parts of the country was “partly driven by demographic changes that are now slowing as disabled baby-boomers age into retirement.”But critics believe that an article whose entire assumption is that information about national trends can be gleaned from one person’s experience by its very nature under-emphasizes those demographic changes.“There are a lot of reasons why rural America has higher rates of disability, but the Post chose to only chase the check,” said Vallas, former deputy director of government affairs for the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives, an association of disability claims attorneys. It is not even clear whether Spencer will apply for benefits. At the end of the Post’s article, Spencer called the Social Security Administration to set up a meeting to discuss how to apply for benefits.“The article leaves readers with the impression that the application process is as basic as picking up the phone and making a phone call,” said T.J. Sutcliffe, director of income and housing policy for The ARC, one of the country’s leading disability rights groups. “What we know is that the Social Security disability standard is one of the most stringent standards in the industrialized world. It is actually very difficult to qualify for disability.”The government awarded SSDI benefits to less than one-third (32 percent) of workers who applied in 2016. If the application is rejected on the first round ― and the vast majority are ― receiving benefits on appeal can often take over a year and a half. The average benefit for those workers who ultimately qualify is $1,171 a month.Congressional Republicans declined to significantly change SSDI when transferring revenue from the retirement fund to plug an imminent shortfall in November 2015.And President Donald Trump didn’t address Social Security in his first budget proposal.But that does not keep activists from worrying about the ammunition that stories like the one in the Post could give Republicans now that they control the White House and Congress. That’s particularly true since Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, a former member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, stood by his belief that Social Security is a “Ponzi scheme” in his confirmation hearing, and he hopes to convince Trump of the wisdom of scaling back social insurance programs.In an interview with CNBC last week, Mulvaney declined to rule out cutting SSDI this year, claiming “it’s become effectively a long-term unemployment, permanent unemployment program.”“This kind of story,” Vallas said, “risks providing cover to Mick Mulvaney and congressional Republicans who have been looking for a way to cut Social Security for years. It has tremendously high stakes, particularly given the political climate we are in right now.”Disability rights advocates like Sutcliffe and Vallas have been critical of what they see as reputable national outlets approaching the subject of SSDI ham-handedly in the past.An in-depth “This American Life” story in 2012 also claimed that the growth in SSDI and SSI rolls was the result of greater dependency without acknowledging the demographic factors, such as an aging population, contributing to rises in enrollment. “This American Life” drew similarly detailed critiques from policy analysts.Likewise, an October 2013 “60 Minutes” investigation sounding the alarms about SSDI’s rising costs drew widespread criticism for relying on anecdotes of alleged abuse to characterize a national trend.“We’ve seen this before,” Sutcliffe said. “Any time there is reporting, particularly at the national level, that leads the public to have an incomplete or inaccurate view of the disability programs, ... it runs the risks of policymakers getting mis-impressions about the program and considering changes to the program that would make the program less adequate and make it harder for Social Security to fulfill its function.” The Post will soon have an opportunity to redeem itself in the eyes of critics that see it as yet another reputable news organization exaggerating the challenges facing disability programs. The newspaper made it clear in its article that the March 30 profile and investigation is the first of a series of stories that will explore disability benefits.“We hope that as the Post continues this series that it will work hard to get the numbers to be as accurate as possible and provide its readers with more context about what those numbers mean, as well as how the program operates and affects people’s lives,” Sutcliffe concluded."

At first you don’t know how to handle it.”But now? “All of that confusion has left me,” she said.The interview, which comes just days before Jenner is set to release her highly anticipated memoir, The Secrets Of My Life, touched on a wide range of issues, from her transition to politics to her feelings about being a representative for the transgender community.“I had a guy actually ... ask for a selfie and said, ‘Oh Bruce, could you give me a selfie?’ And I looked at him. Nobody’s called me that in two years almost now, and I said, ‘No problem,’” Jenner, who claims she takes 20 to 40 selfies a day with strangers, told Sawyer. “I want them to walk away saying, ‘Oh Caitlyn Jenner was so nice’ .... that trans people, yes, are approachable ... and they are a vital part of our society.”The former Olympian also revealed that thinking about all of the trans people who constantly face harassment and discrimination because of their gender identity got her through her acceptance speech when she received the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at the 2015 ESPY Awards.“If you want to call me names, make jokes, doubt my intentions, go ahead, because the reality is I can take it,” she said. “But for the thousands of kids out there coming to terms with being true to who they are, they shouldn’t have to take it.” Regarding her controversial 2015 Vanity Fair cover, on which she instructed the world to “call her Caitlyn” for the first time, Jenner said, “I wanted to end the old Bruce, my old life ... and that picture did it.”The 67-year-old added, “My feeling on that picture, I know, my kids that thought, ‘You know what? It’s a little too much... But from my standpoint, I had suffered for 65 years, OK? To have a beautiful shot of my authentic self was important.”At one point during the interview, Jenner revealed that she experienced intense depression during the 1980s while hiding her true, authentic self and, according to ABCNews.com, “resigned herself to living a lie ― thinking that maybe there would be an instruction in her will to be buried as ‘her.’”Jenner told Sawyer, “I said, ‘If I go and when I’m buried,’ yeah, I wanted to be dressed as her because that’s the way I was going to heaven.” “I would say I would kind of shock everybody when they come and visit the casket,” she added.As for the future, the reality star, who is still frequently seen on E!’s “Keeping Up With The Kardashians,” wants to continue fighting for the transgender community, including taking on the Republican Party, which she has famously supported in the past, to much criticism. “Here’s the deal breaker with the Republican Party,” Jenner said. “And the deal breaker is, ‘You mess with my community ... you don’t give us equality and a fair shot, I’m coming after you.’”And that apparently includes President Donald Trump, for whom Jenner voted in 2016, but hasn’t seen since an inauguration party. She has since called him out for rescinding protections for transgender students.“He wanted me to come play golf with him,” Jenner said. “At that time, I thought it was a pretty good idea, but since Title IX ― it’s not a good idea and so I won’t be playing golf with him. ... Would I meet with him privately on this issue? Absolutely.”Ultimately, Jenner wants to play a part in securing more understanding for the transgender community but she realizes how much work is left to do and admits she doesn’t have “that many years left... I’m playing in the fourth quarter.”Still, she’s committed herself to helping bring about change.“Is it going to get better? I hope so,” she said. “And I hope that I’m part of that.”"

He is the first president not to attend the dinner in over three decades.In addition, for the first time since the event’s inception in 1921, no members of the White House staff are expected to attend the dinner.The annual event provides a forum for prominent comics to roast the president, the media and other official fixtures in Washington. The president then has the opportunity to deliver his own light-hearted remarks.Although the correspondents dinner is something of a time-honored institution in the capital, media critics have lambasted it for celebrating the coziness of the press with the politicians they cover. Trump’s decision not to attend is consistent with his notoriously antagonistic and rocky relationship with mainstream media outlets. What’s more, former President Barack Obama famously mocked Trump at the 2011 dinner at a moment when the then-reality TV star had launched an ugly campaign to demand proof that Obama was born in the United States amid “birther” allegations that Obama wasn’t a legitimate president. Figures close to Trump have even suggested that the mortification he endured at Obama’s hands that night is what motivated Trump to run for president in 2016.This year, in Trump’s absence, Hasan Minhaj, a senior correspondent for “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central, will host the dinner. Minhaj, who is from a Muslim background, has been critical of Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies."

In January, while still president-elect, he went as far as to request that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a fellow vaccine skeptic, lead a commission to investigate vaccine safety.This disregard for science is among the reasons Sabrina Solouki, a second-year Ph.D. student in immunology and infectious disease at Cornell University, made a pilgrimage to Washington, D.C., on Saturday for the March for Science, a mass protest to rally scientists against what they see as Trump’s backward policies. “The administration, by forming this safety commission, isn’t really doing a good job of listening to science — of science-informed policy,” she told The Huffington Post. Solouki also wants to unite the scientific community, to push for it to do a better job of engaging with the public at large, and to send a clear message that scientists are against Trump’s proposed cuts to science. “Scientists, in general, need to come out and support the march so that people understand that we’re here and we really want to better society,” she said. As president of Cornell’s Advancing Science And Policy group, Solouki helped organize for more than 100 Cornell graduate science students to travel to Washington, D.C., for the event, which falls on Earth Day, the 47th anniversary of the birth of the modern environmental movement. Cornell’s group arrived Friday on three buses.“If people don’t trust or accept science and scientists, we won’t be able to translate our work in labs, fields, etc. to the people who can benefit from what we find,” said Morgan Carter, a Ph.D. candidate in plant pathology at Cornell.Under the current climate, aspiring scientists may be discouraged by competition for a shrinking pool of federal research funding, she said. Since taking office, Trump has shaken the field of science, both with his proposal for sweeping cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency and other vehicles for research funding. His “skinny” budget, released in mid-March, proposed axing at least 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, eliminating the federal monies for the National Academy of Science and gutting underwriting for research at a bevy of executive agencies. Vox called it “everything scientists have been fearing.” Science, the magazine published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said the budget “squeeze civilian science agencies.” The Washington Post noted that scientists were “conspicuously missing from Trump’s government.”Trump’s hard-line immigration policies rattled science academia even more. The White House’s executive order temporarily blocking travelers from a handful of Muslim majority countries ― a move high-level Trump surrogates admitted would be a first step to establishing the so-called Muslim ban he touted during his campaign ― shook a field filled with graduates of schools across the Middle East. “People are scrambling right now in the scientific community to figure out all the ways it plays out and what it means for grad students, innovation and the private sector,” Wendy Naus, executive director of the Consortium of Social Science Associations, told HuffPost in January. “If it is a glitch or a blip, and the outrage is heard and things go back, the damage isn’t done. But if it is the new normal, then, yeah, we are risking our competitive advantage. These are fundamentally things we’ve never confronted before.”Even in his own administration, Trump has failed to hire to fill science positions. The president has yet to hire top advisers on technology of science, according to The New York Times, and has so far only named Michael Kratsios, the former chief of staff to Silicon Valley investor and campaign backer Peter Thiel, as deputy technology officer.“We are all sitting on the edge of our seats hoping nothing catastrophic happens in the world,” Phil Larson, a former senior science and technology adviser to the Obama administration, told the Times. “But if it does, who is going to be advising him?”Even among those students who don’t fear losing employment opportunities under the Trump administration, that attitude and outlook on science has bred dismay. Nikhil Krishnaswamy, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Brandeis University, isn’t concerned for his employment after he finishes school in June. But he said he planned to march in Boston, Massachusetts, on Saturday to show solidarity with other scientists.“I’m in a field that’s probably less likely to be affected by the political considerations taken by the Trump administration,” the 30-year-old told HuffPost by phone on Friday. “But I do feel like there is a possibility for all of us to stand together and stand up for a worldview that’s based in truth and facts.”His work focuses on helping computers interpret language semantics by decoding large data sets ― essentially improving the way humans talk to computers. Krishnaswamy said he hopes marching will remind him of the potential political ramifications of his work.“What I do with technology is going to shape how we interact with each other, how we interact with our leaders and how we interact with technology in the future,” he said. “I have to make sure the technology I build will not have an ill effect on the freedoms we enjoy as Americans, and aren’t going to infringe on our rights or allow the government to do so either.”Adrian Rivera-Reyes, 24, bristles when conservative pundits attack scientists as hungry for glory, fame or grant money.“No one ever comes to mind who says specifically, ‘I want to do this because I want to be famous,’ or ‘I want to be well-known or famous or considered an intellectual,’” the third-year Ph.D. student in cancer biology at the University of Pennsylvania told HuffPost by phone on Friday. “People do science because we’re interested in solving problems that no one else wants to solve. As a consequence, society moves forward.”The Puerto Rico native plans to march with a group of Latino scientists and students on Saturday. Trump’s proposed budget cuts risk eliminating funding for future work when he graduates, he said.“It’s very worrying that I will graduate and President Trump will still be president,” he said. “I’m thinking, well, what am I going to do? Will there be jobs for me? It feels very real, more real than it used to be.”The Trump administration’s hostility toward Muslim immigrants and travelers, including the ban on visitors from a handful of majority Muslim countries, jeopardize the future of his scientific research, Rivera-Reyes said.“In science, that hurts,” he said. “We are definitely a very large and diverse group of people, and just singling out people for their religious beliefs like that is wrong.”Carter echoed that sentiment.“[S]cience doesn’t stop at country borders, because scientists collaborate with other scientists in government, industry, and academia all over the world,” she told HuffPost. “And science issues aren’t limited to individual countries. A disease that is in one country doesn’t wait for a visa to go into another country and we have to work together to tackle common problems.”It’s for this reason, she added, that the scientific community has been so outraged by Trump’s travel bans and anti-immigration rhetoric.“Science is a very international community and movement limitations can prevent collaborations or communication, like conferences,” Carter said. Sean Terry, a Ph.D. student in astrophysics at Catholic University and a research assistant at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said that Trump’s signing of a bill last month to authorize $19.5 billion in funding for the agency in the 2018 budget year has given him and others in the field of space science a certain level of comfort. It’s his environmental colleagues, in particular at the EPA, that Terry said he’s “more scared” about. Although Terry expected the March for Science would draw a smaller crowd than the Women’s March back in January, he considers the message equally as important. And his hope is that at least some people denying or trying to weaken the importance of science will change their tone.“I’m marching just to show my commitment to science and science literacy, and improving science literacy in younger individuals,” he said.

60,WOMEN,"Defense Lawyer Who Said Women Are ""Especially Good"" At Lying Is ""Especially Good"" At Being A Misogynist","Aysha Mahmood, ContributorJournalist. Lover of literature. Chocolate Enthusiast.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/defense-lawyer-who-said-women-especially-good-at_us_58faa482e4b0f02c3870ea2e,Tennessee defense lawyer Steve Farese tried to do what practically every defense lawyer does for their client who is accused,2017-04-22,<p>Mark Giannini enters the courtoom at the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center on Thursday.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fac8852600001500c4714c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tennessee defense lawyer Steve Farese tried to do what practically every defense lawyer does for their client who is accused of raping a woman. He put the blame on the woman.According to The Memphis Commercial Appeal, Farese said that the woman was lying, because well, women are “especially good” at it. And apparently, women are good at lying because “they’re the weaker sex.”And who exactly was this lawyer who clearly respects women representing? A wealthy businessman named Mark Giannini, 51, who was accused of raping a 28-year-old woman in June 2014 at his Eads mansion when she was at his house for a job interview. Giannini was charged with three counts of aggravated rape. To say that women are “especially good” at lying reinforces the absurd, but rather popular belief among men that women lie about getting raped or sexually assaulted. In fact, false allegations against rape are rare. According to a study entitled, False Allegations of Sexual Assualt: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases, only 2 to 8 percent of rape allegations are false. Keep in mind that this number only includes the amount of rape cases reported to police. Further, Farese puts forward an obnoxious hypothesis that woman are good at lying because they’re the weaker sex.Surely, you’ve never actually conversed with a woman before Mr. Farese because there is nothing weak about us.Now, like most rape cases, this case wasn’t so cut and dry. Tuesday’s Memphis Commercial Appeal court blog revealed that there appeared to be disagreement as to what kind of job the woman was interviewing for and whether or not sex was an expectation of that job. But even if sex was an agreement, that doesn’t give a man permission to rape a women. The woman testified that she was crying, praying, and saying she wanted to go home. If a woman is crying or praying or saying she wants to go home, I can guarantee you that she does not want to have sex.On Thursday, Farese made another inappropriate comment stating that the halter top the woman was wearing was not admitted into evidence because it was sexy, according to the Commercial Appeal court blog.I really wish someone would start focusing on why men are raping rather than what women are wearing. I’m extremely tired of men and society telling me that my clothes are interfering with a males judgement. If what a woman wears makes a man want to rape her, then that man needs to get some serious help. It’s not a woman’s fault. Who cares if she was wearing a sexy halter top? She could be wearing nothing for all I care. That doesn’t give a man permission to rape somebody. To make matters worse, Farese told the Commercial Appeal  that his job “is not to care if anybody gets offended.”Well, that’s beyond obvious.He doesn’t care that his words are degrading to women everywhere. He doesn’t care that his words reinforce the belief among men and even law enforcement that rape is a women’s fault. More importantly, he doesn’t care that his words may have swayed the jury to rule a not guilty verdict in such an important case. Farese added that, “smart people will see it for what it is.” I don’t want to brag, but I do believe myself to be a pretty smart person. (And even if I wasn’t, I guess I can say I am, because according to Farese, I’m such a good liar.) The point is, I have no doubt that Farese was saying whatever he could to get his client off the hook. I understand that every lawyers job is to defend their client, but at what cost? The comments were pathetic and degrading and I am surprised they were said in a courtroom. It’s especially disappointing that Farese is a father of two daughters. Everyone has a job to do, I get that. But children do hear their parents, children do learn from them. Girls need to know that regardless of what they wear, they shouldn’t be raped. They need to know that they can speak up if they feel sexually assaulted and have a support system that does not accuse them of lying.They need to know that they’re not the weaker sex.And if you think otherwise, you have not met a woman."

Some are blissfully unaware of the negative impact that they have on those around them, and others seem to derive satisfaction from creating chaos and pushing other people’s buttons. Either way, they create unnecessary complexity, strife, and worst of all stress.Stress can have a lasting, negative impact on the brain. Exposure to even a few days of stress compromises the effectiveness of neurons in the hippocampus—an important brain area responsible for reasoning and memory. Weeks of stress cause reversible damage to neuronal dendrites (the small “arms” that brain cells use to communicate with each other), and months of stress can permanently destroy neurons. Stress is a formidable threat to your success—when stress gets out of control, your brain and your performance suffer.Most sources of stress at work are easy to identify. If your nonprofit is working to land a grant that your organization needs to function, you’re bound to feel stress and likely know how to manage it. It’s the unexpected sources of stress that take you by surprise and harm you the most.Recent research from the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology at Friedrich Schiller University in Germany found that exposure to stimuli that cause strong negative emotions—the same kind of exposure you get when dealing with difficult people—caused subjects’ brains to have a massive stress response. Whether it’s negativity, cruelty, the victim syndrome, or just plain craziness, difficult people drive your brain into a stressed-out state that should be avoided at all costs.The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90 percent of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize difficult people. Top performers have well-honed coping strategies that they employ to keep difficult people at bay.While I’ve run across numerous effective strategies that smart people employ when dealing with difficult people, what follows are some of the best. To deal with difficult people effectively, you need an approach that enables you, across the board, to control what you can and eliminate what you can’t. The important thing to remember is that you are in control of far more than you realize.1. They set limits. Complainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers, because they don’t want to be seen as callous or rude, but there’s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral.You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. Think of it this way: If the complainer were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the secondhand smoke? You’d distance yourself, and you should do the same with complainers. A great way to set limits is to ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.2. They rise above. Difficult people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it; their behavior truly goes against reason. So why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix? The more irrational and off-base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. Distance yourself from them emotionally and approach your interactions like they’re a science project (or you’re their shrink, if you prefer the analogy). You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos—only the facts.3. They stay aware of their emotions. Maintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Sometimes you’ll find yourself in situations where you’ll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine and you shouldn’t be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so.Think of it this way—if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he’s John F. Kennedy, you’re unlikely to set him straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking, sometimes it’s best to just smile and nod. If you’re going to have to straighten them out, it’s better to give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it.4. They establish boundaries. This is the area where most people tend to sell themselves short. They feel like because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Once you’ve found your way to Rise Above a person, you’ll begin to find their behavior more predictable and easier to understand. This will equip you to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when you don’t. For example, even if you work with someone closely on a project team, that doesn’t mean that you need to have the same level of one-on-one interaction with them that you have with other team members.You can establish a boundary, but you’ll have to do so consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you are bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to encroach upon them, which they will.5. They don’t die in the fight. Smart people know how important it is to live to fight another day, especially when your foe is a toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you’re able to choose your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right.6. They don’t focus on problems—only solutions. Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and reduces stress.When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how you’re going to go about handling them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.7. They don’t forget. Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn’t mean that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what’s happened so that you can move on. It doesn’t mean you’ll give a wrongdoer another chance. Smart people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others’ mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm.8. They squash negative self-talk. Sometimes you absorb the negativity of other people. There’s nothing wrong with feeling bad about how someone is treating you, but your self-talk (the thoughts you have about your feelings) can either intensify the negativity or help you move past it. Negative self-talk is unrealistic, unnecessary, and self-defeating. It sends you into a downward emotional spiral that is difficult to pull out of. You should avoid negative self-talk at all costs.9. They get some sleep. I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. A good night’s sleep makes you more positive, creative, and proactive in your approach to toxic people, giving you the perspective you need to deal effectively with them.10. They use their support system. It’s tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by yourself. To deal with toxic people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in your approach to them. This means tapping into your support system to gain perspective on a challenging person. Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation.Bringing It All TogetherBefore you get this system to work brilliantly, you’re going to have to pass some tests. Most of the time, you will find yourself tested by touchy interactions with problem people. Thankfully, the plasticity of the brain allows it to mold and change as you practice new behaviors, even when you fail. Implementing these healthy, stress-relieving techniques for dealing with difficult people will train your brain to handle stress more effectively and decrease the likelihood of ill effects.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more?

It is, however, important to note that while this racist misogynist was a problem and we’re glad to see him go, he was just one branch sprung from a tree that is rotten to the core. O’Reilly was just a bad symptom; Fox news is the f*****g disease.Think about it, Bill O’Reilly was able to remain employed at this sad excuse for a news outlet through decades of racism, sexism and countless known sexual assault accusations for three main reasons. 1) The average age of Fox viewers make dinosaurs look like millennials, and they frankly struggle to hear O’Reilly, never mind taking offense at the words he is saying, which is why his ratings remained high even amidst the backlash; 2) The advertisers, until recently, never lagged so the network, while knowing of the countless sexual assault accusations, could continue to justify keeping Bill on the air through the only justification necessary when it comes to multi billion dollar companies, the bottom line; and 3) Most notably, because Fox has created, and therefore embraced a hate-filled environment that welcomes all forms of prejudice. Unabashed prejudiced hate-spewing that, in addition to being a staple of O’Reilly’s show, is mirrored by several other privileged hosts throughout the network.In fact people have become so numb to the outlandish fact free assaults, that it took Bill O’Reilly insulting Maxine Waters to bring to light the equally horrendous and racist comments made by Eric Bolling FIVE YEARS earlier. A man that, thanks to O’Reilly’s dismissal, is set to head up a new primetime show, which just goes to show that racism will not only be tolerated at Fox News, it will even get you promoted. Because racism is everyday practice at Fox, as is sexism.We all remember Roger Ailes ― the man 20 women accused of sexual harassment, which led him into early retirement. Well, under his guidance women at Fox News were instructed “to wear your skirts short and your heels high,” allegedly so that Ailes could stare at their legs. But even with Ailes and O’Reilly gone, another Bill remains who is equally dangerous: Fox News’ current co-president, Bill Shine.Bill Shine is the name that appears on almost every sexual harassment case, not for committing the offenses himself, but for repeatedly coming to the defense of those accused and “making the situation go away.” He helps maintain a breeding ground where this kind of predatory behavior can thrive. So is it any surprise that this misogyny and disrespect is echoed by mostly all of the network’s male hosts? A network that had an all-male panel debate whether it was okay for women to be a family’s primary breadwinner. A network that has stated women are paid less than men for the same work because they’re worth less. A network that defends sexual predators at every cost until it starts to alter the cheques and balances or is publicly exposed beyond any doubt.So yeah, we can celebrate the downfall of O’Reilly ― I’m not going to say I didn’t indulge in a little chuckle, or an Instagram post. But it won’t eradicate the hatred or make women at Fox any safer. Powerful men will continue to feel empowered to sexually harass their employees since they’re doing nothing more than practicing behind the scenes the attitude toward women that Fox News has been espousing on the air for years. When one serial harasser is exposed, another will emerge. I mean, the guy moving into O’Reilly’s time slot is Tucker Carlson, another blatant sexist who has made countless distasteful jokes on air. So he will fill the time-slot nicely and help Fox News continue to profit off of misogyny.But while you can take some comfort from knowing that some of the deplorables at Fox News have been exposed and held accountable, do not mistake the symptom for the disease. Fox News is still, and always will be,a welcoming environment for racists and sexual predators. The real takeaway from Bill O’Reilly’s downfall should be that at Fox News they’ll tolerate powerful men who like to grab women by the pussy, but they draw the line when you start to grab Fox News by the wallet.Follow me on Instagram @francismmaxwell and Twitter @francis_maxwell."

Meningitis is a potentially lethal disease that affects more than 1 million people worldwide each year. Meningitis is an infection that affects the delicate membranes ― called meninges ― that cover the brain and the spinal cord. Meningitis can be caused by different pathogens: fungal meningitis is rare and generally only occurs in people with weakened immune systems, whereas viral meningitis tends to be less severe and most people recover without specific therapy, while bacterial meningitis can be deadly and contagious among people in close contact. It is important to know the specific cause of meningitis because the treatment differs depending on the cause.What are the symptoms of meningitis? Meningitis is not always easy to recognize. In the early stages in young children and adolescents, the symptoms can be like a common cold. The classic signs of meningitis are a headache and stiff neck, and in babies ― bulging fontanelle (soft spot on the head in babies), blank staring look and limpness. Sometimes the patient will have a rash that first looks like small blood spots then appears like larger bruises. Meningitis can develop rapidly over a few hours often leaving doctors little time for proper diagnosis and treatment.Who is at risk of meningitis? Meningitis can affect anyone at any age and cause death within 24 hours. Approximately half of bacterial meningitis cases occur in children under 5 years old and infants have a higher risk. A second meningococcal disease peak occurs in adolescents and young adults. The elderly (over the age of 65) have a high risk of dying from it. Adults and children with a weakened immune system and those who have skipped routine recommended vaccinations have a higher risk of infection.What are the ways to prevent meningitis?Stay healthy. Maintain your immune system by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet. Also, be sure to get the sleep you need. Practice good hygiene. Don't share drinks, food, eating utensils, lip balms or toothbrushes with anyone. When you need to cough or sneeze, be sure to cover your mouth and nose.Wash your hands. Careful and thorough hand-washing helps prevent the spread of germs. Teach children to wash their hands often, especially before eating and after using the toilet, spending time in crowded public places or petting animals. Get vaccinated. Some forms of bacterial meningitis are preventable with the following: (1) Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, (2) Pneumococcal vaccine, (3) Meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Getting vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox can help prevent diseases that can lead to viral meningitis. New vaccines are being developed to protect against other common causes of meningitis.Don’t wait until it threatens the life of someone you care about. Learn what to look for and trust your instincts. Learn the symptoms to protect you and your loved ones. Act now and spread the word!

Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) told the mother of a service industry worker who has benefitted from the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion that her son should get a better job if he wants decent insurance when Obamacare is repealed.The woman, a constituent of Davidson’s in former House Speaker John Boehner’s old district, explained to Davidson at a town hall in Enon, Ohio on Tuesday night first covered by ShareBlue that her grown son lacked health insurance for four years, because his job in the service industry did not provide it. He received coverage through Medicaid when Obamacare expanded the program by offering to pick up almost all of the costs for states that lowered their eligibility thresholds.She is now worried about President Donald Trump’s plan to rollback the landmark law’s Medicaid expansion, fearing it will leave her son with the bare-bones catastrophic health insurance, which, she said, is “basically no insurance at all.”“Can you explain why my son and millions of others in his situation are not deserving of affordable, decent health care that has essential benefits so that he can stay healthy and continue working?” she asked.Her son’s best route to getting decent insurance without Medicaid is to find work in an industry where employers provide it, according to Davidson. “OK, I don’t know anything about your son, but as you described him, his skills are focused in an industry that doesn’t have the kind of options that you want him to have for health care. So, I don’t believe that these taxpayers here are entitled to give that to him. I believe he’s got the opportunity to go earn those health benefits,” he responded, eliciting boos from the crowd.You can watch their full exchange at the 37-minute mark in the video above.The woman’s reference to “essential benefits” alludes to the fact that House Republican leaders at one point tried to win over hardline conservatives by removing federal regulations requiring insurance plans to cover 10 basic benefits, including trips to the emergency room, as well as maternity and newborn care. In lieu of these benefits, low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plans could cover even fewer procedures than they do now.But Davidson implied that finding a better plan was as simple as shopping for a higher-quality consumer product like a cellphone. “If he doesn’t want a catastrophic care plan, don’t buy a catastrophic care plan. If you don’t want a flip-phone, don’t buy a flip-phone,” Davidson said, eliciting loud groans from the audience.“I’m sorry, health care is much different than a cell phone and I’m tired of people using cell phone analogies with health care,” the woman responded, before walking away from the microphone.Davidson’s metaphor resembled remarks by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who suggested in March that people should not buy iPhones if they wanted the money to pay for health insurance. But as Davidson’s constituent noted at the town hall ― and many observers pointed out when Chaffetz said it ― buying health insurance is completely different than shopping for everyday consumer products.Consumers do not have the same power to command lower prices for health care, since it is not a product they can choose to not have. People also often lack the information and resources to choose a health care provider based on its cost value.Those are just a couple reasons why health insurance is wildly more expensive than paying for a phone bill ― and obtaining coverage would remain perilously out of reach for millions of Americans without help from the government.That’s a big deal, because unlike phones, Americans’ lives would be at risk if they did not have health care.Although President Trump and House Republicans have already failed to negotiate an Obamacare replacement bill at least twice, the White House is dead-set on trying again as part of negotiations to continue funding the government. The latest idea floated by budget director Mick Mulvaney would involve trading Democrats a dollar in Obamacare funding for every dollar they approve for construction of the wall.[H/T ShareBlue]"

Its findings were published in the journal Science on Friday.In 2016, BP estimated the oil spill cost the company roughly $62 billion in cleanup and legal fees. But scientists were interested in understanding the price tag attached to natural resource damage, a much trickier value to determine.To do so, researchers asked American households how much money they would be willing to pay in a one-time tax to protect natural resources by preventing another disaster similar to the BP oil spill.The researchers spent the first three years after the spill developing the survey, which aimed to effectively explain the magnitude of the destruction on natural resources. They spent the next few years administering the questionnaire to a large sample of American adults and analyzing the results.The average household was willing to pay $153 for a prevention program, the researchers found. To get the final $17.2 billion appraisal, they multiplied this rate by the number of households that the sample represented.The Deepwater Horizon explosion killed 11 people while the subsequent oil spill wreaked havoc on countless ecosystems and resulted in the deaths of billions of animals, according to the federal government.Last year, a federal judge approved a $20 billion settlement, which BP is to pay out to five Gulf states and local governments over 16 years to cover environmental damage.“Our estimate can guide policymakers and the oil industry in determining not only how much should be spent on restoration efforts for the Deepwater spill, but also how much should be invested to protect against damages that could result from future oil spills,” said Kevin Boyle, a professor of agricultural and applied economics at Virginia Tech and one of the study’s authors.“People value our natural resources, so it’s worth taking major actions to prevent future catastrophes and correct past mistakes,” he added."

Many of them had favorite local shop cats of their own.“It’s then I began to realize how pervasive shop cats were in the city, and the important role they played in adding a touch of warmth – a sense of community even – in a place that can sometimes feel overwhelming and impersonal,” she told HuffPost in an email.That realization inspired Arslanian to write “Shop Cats of New York,” a book that explores the lesser-known lives of the city’s most adored felines. She teamed up with photographer Andrew Marttila, who shot gorgeous portraits of the book’s furry stars.Arslanian had some important criteria for which cats she included.“First and foremost, I wanted to to feel confident the cats were well cared for and beloved,” she said.As it turns out, she was pleasantly surprised by just how great the cats’ lives seemed to be.“My biggest ‘ah ha’ was realizing the level of stimulation and attention these cats received in comparison to most house cats, mine included,” she said. “I see my cats for about an hour before work and a few hours in the evenings during the week, but I can’t say I’m actively playing with them for very long. It made me realize the level of enrichment these cats were receiving on a daily basis. In some ways they could be viewed as having fuller lives than most cats living in more traditional homes.”That’s one reason why Arslanian would like to see more animal shelters and rescue groups be open to adopting out cats to businesses, not just traditional residences.“Businesses could be vetted as are most adopters, and assessed to ensure the business and cat are a good fit for one another,” she said, noting that of course not all cats have personalities that would be suited to that environment.See a selection of Marttila’s photos from the book below."

Many of them had favorite local shop cats of their own.“It’s then I began to realize how pervasive shop cats were in the city, and the important role they played in adding a touch of warmth – a sense of community even – in a place that can sometimes feel overwhelming and impersonal,” she told HuffPost in an email.That realization inspired Arslanian to write “Shop Cats of New York,” a book that explores the lesser-known lives of the city’s most adored felines. She teamed up with photographer Andrew Marttila, who shot gorgeous portraits of the book’s furry stars.Arslanian had some important criteria for which cats she included.“First and foremost, I wanted to to feel confident the cats were well cared for and beloved,” she said.As it turns out, she was pleasantly surprised by just how great the cats’ lives seemed to be.“My biggest ‘ah ha’ was realizing the level of stimulation and attention these cats received in comparison to most house cats, mine included,” she said. “I see my cats for about an hour before work and a few hours in the evenings during the week, but I can’t say I’m actively playing with them for very long. It made me realize the level of enrichment these cats were receiving on a daily basis. In some ways they could be viewed as having fuller lives than most cats living in more traditional homes.”That’s one reason why Arslanian would like to see more animal shelters and rescue groups be open to adopting out cats to businesses, not just traditional residences.“Businesses could be vetted as are most adopters, and assessed to ensure the business and cat are a good fit for one another,” she said, noting that of course not all cats have personalities that would be suited to that environment.See a selection of Marttila’s photos from the book below."

Bernie Sanders speaks to a crowd of supporters at a Democratic unity rally in Salt Lake City, Utah on April 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fb71551c00003a00e81208.jpeg?cache=PcD7SmNivH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"OMAHA ― Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized the security threats to a speaking event by conservative pundit Ann Coulter at the University of California, Berkeley that prompted the school to postpone the talk.“I don’t like this. I don’t like it,” Sanders told The Huffington Post after speaking at a rally for Omaha mayoral candidate Heath Mello on Thursday night. “Obviously Ann Coulter’s outrageous ― to my mind, off the wall. But you know, people have a right to give their two cents-worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation.”University officials on Tuesday night informed Berkeley’s College Republicans, who invited Coulter to speak, that the April 27 event would need to be rescheduled due to concerns that her speech would set off violent protests and make it difficult to maintain campus security. Campus police have learned that groups responsible for recent clashes during demonstrations on campus and throughout the city planned to target Coulter’s event, according to the university.Although on Thursday the university offered to host the speech in the afternoon on May 2, Coulter and the College Republicans have rejected the proposal, arguing that students are less likely to be able to attend an afternoon speech. In insisting on the original speaking date, they also note that May 2 is during a period when classes have ended and students are studying for finals.Coulter has said that she still plans to speak on April 27 in the evening. She and the College Republicans are threatening litigation against the university.The controversy over Coulter’s speech follows violent clashes between supporters of President Donald Trump and left-wing Trump critics at a pro-Trump rally in a park in the city of Berkeley. UC Berkeley also canceled a speech by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos in February amid violent protests by some 1,500 people.The events at UC Berkeley and protests against conservative speakers, which sometimes turned violent at other college campuses, have ignited a debate among progressives about the boundaries of free speech with some on the left insisting that racial demagoguery deserves to be countered as aggressively as possible.Many other liberals argue that disruptions that effectively veto certain points of view are wrongheaded and counterproductive no matter how repugnant the speaker’s views.Sanders made clear he is firmly in the latter camp.“To me, it’s a sign of intellectual weakness,” he said. “If you can’t ask Ann Coulter in a polite way questions which expose the weakness of her arguments, if all you can do is boo, or shut her down, or prevent her from coming, what does that tell the world?”“What are you afraid of ― her ideas? Ask her the hard questions,” he concluded. “Confront her intellectually. Booing people down, or intimidating people, or shutting down events, I don’t think that that works in any way.”Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who was also in Omaha to speak at the rally for Mello, expressed similar sentiments, noting that opponents of the black civil rights movement sued protesters and media outlets that reported on them in an effort to restrict their speech.“Absolutely protest these people you don’t like, absolutely write against them, denounce them,” the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee advised progressives angry at right-wing speakers. “But the solution to bad speech is good speech, the solution to bad speech is more speech. Once you start saying, ‘You can’t talk,’ then whoever’s in power gets to impose that on whoever’s not in power and that’s not good.”At the same time, Ellison argued that UC Berkeley and other institutions might have legitimate concerns about the costs of hosting such an event that should give them a say in where and how the speech takes place.“At the end of the day, is there some venue where Ann Coulter gets to speak on that campus? I think there’s gotta be,” he told HuffPost. “But you know, I think the university president saying, ‘This is going to cost us a lot of money and we need more space and couldn’t it be at another venue that’s bigger, that’s easier to defend’ ― I think those are all factors that need to be part of the conversation as well.”"

She finds really interesting ways to pull levers of power and express herself.”At the show’s premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on Friday, the starring actors placed a heavy emphasis on the show being a “human” story and not a “feminist” one. “I think that any story, if it is a story being told by a strong, powerful woman... any story that’s just a powerful woman owning herself in any way is automatically deemed ‘feminist,’” said Madeline Brewer, who plays handmaid Janine. “But it’s just a story about a woman. I don’t think that this is any sort of feminist propaganda.”Elisabeth Moss, who plays the show’s main character Offred, echoed Brewer’s comments. “It’s not a feminist story, it’s a human story, because women’s rights are human rights,” Moss said. I never intended to play Peggy [from ‘Mad Men’] as a feminist and I never expected to play Offred as a feminist ...

We get to claim it. The Handmaid’s Tale is a dystopian fiction, sure, but it’s one that has women storming to their local libraries to grab a copies of the book. Last month, women dressed up as handmaids and protested anti-abortion legislation in the Texas Senate gallery.

After all, it feels closer to reality than the show’s creators wanted.Moss, who also serves as a producer, acknowledged the eerie and terrifying parallels between Offred’s nightmarish journey and Trump’s America.“We never wanted the show to be this relevant,” she told Entertainment Weekly in December.The relevance of story is easy to spot.In the dystopian theocracy of Gilead, where “The Handmaid’s Tale” is set, women’s bodies are policed and controlled by the male-run state. Handmaids’ only purpose is to bear children ― they have no rights, no freedom, no lives. Women are not trusted with their own bodies. America now has a president who brags about grabbing women “by the pussy.” This week, a lawyer in Tennessee said that women are “especially good at lying ... because they’re the weaker sex.” A Missouri congressman said last year that becoming pregnant after a rape is a blessing from God. Rooms full of men make legislative decisions about women’s bodies. A panel of men in Maryland decided that rapists can continue to have parental rights over the children who were conceived by rape. And abortion access is under threat across the U.S. But the beauty of “The Handmaid’s Tale” ― something that Miller misses and perhaps what women connect to most deeply ― is that it is inarguably, explicitly, a story of women’s survival and audacity.

And not because it felt so eerily similar to what was happening in our political landscape. (It did.)I cried for lines like this: “We learned to whisper almost without sound.

76,POLITICS,A River Runs Red And A Small-Town Paper Wants Answers,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/art-cullen-interview-pulitzer_us_58fa24bee4b018a9ce5ab32a,Art Cullen's Pulitzer-winning work showed how agribusiness infiltrated an Iowa battle over pollution from farms.,2017-04-21,"An Iowa farmer prepares for an evening planting of corn. Columnist Art Cullen has been pushing back against the state's agribusiness lobby, and now has a Pulitzer to show for it.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa270e2600004500c46f3e.jpeg?cache=l7Tv3ImGIb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Storm Lake Times editor Art Cullen may have lost a few friends over his reporting in recent years, but now he’s gained a Pulitzer Prize.Last week, Cullen, who co-owns the twice-a-week northwest Iowa newspaper with his brother John, was honored by the Pulitzer Prize board for a series of editorials about a water pollution lawsuit brought by the Des Moines Water Works against his home county, Buena Vista County, and two others.The Des Moines utility argued in the lawsuit that Buena Vista and the two other agriculture-heavy counties were responsible for polluting the Raccoon River with nitrates from fertilizer runoff, and claimed the counties should be liable for the utility’s increasing costs of removing the pollutants from drinking water.Cullen wondered who would finance his cash-strapped county’s defense. It wasn’t long before he grew suspicious that powerful agribusiness interests, including the Farm Bureau, were playing a role. He was determined that his family-run newspaper, circulation 3,300, find the truth.“To use a barnyard euphemism, every once in awhile even a blind pig finds a nut,” Cullen wrote in one of his Pulitzer-winning editorials. “We are not so polished, but our snout smells something that is being hidden. We can’t see very well right now. But we can smell it.”Cullen detailed his search for answers in two tenacious years of editorials that uncovered a link between the counties and agribusiness groups soliciting funds from secret donors.The fund now appears to have been dissolved, and the Des Moines lawsuit was dismissed last month. But the donors were never disclosed, and the county still has legal bills to pay.The Raccoon River remains dirty, too, and the impact of the pollution can be felt far beyond Iowa’s borders. It’s contributing to nutrient pollution in the Mississippi River and a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico that is threatening marine life and economies that depend on it.And so, Cullen’s work isn’t finished. The Huffington Post recently spoke with him about how he got the story and what’s coming next.You wrote in one of your Pulitzer-winning editorials that you could “smell something that is being hidden.” When exactly did you feel that you were onto something here? Was there an “aha” moment that you recall?It was kind of a slow buildup, where basically we had the question of, OK, the Des Moines Water Works filed this lawsuit, so how are we going to defend it? Shouldn’t we have a talk real quick to see if we can get rid of this thing somehow? But the Buena Vista County Board of Supervisors was already in contact with the Farm Bureau and the Agribusiness Association of Iowa, and they quickly set up this fund comprised of secret donors. That’s when I said, OK, we need to know who these donors are.Did you anticipate that this would snowball into what it became — something you were reporting on so tenaciously for so long?I did. I knew they didn’t want to tell us who the donors were. At first they claimed, “Our friends are going to help us out.” Who are those friends? “Well, it’s the Farm Bureau.” Was the money coming from member dues or what? “Well, we’re not sure how it’s going to work out, but we’ll get back to you.” It was the good ol’ boy response, and that ain’t good enough. Our concern was if the Agribusiness Association was meeting with Koch Fertilizer and Monsanto’s CEO on this, then they could be coloring how the county defends this case.You’ve described in recent writing that you and the paper have sustained some backlash because of your reporting on this. How bad did it get?It’s not been that bad. It was some people I thought were friends who aren’t friends anymore, and we lost a few ag ads. There weren’t many of them to begin with, because corporate ag doesn’t spend any money in community newspapers — they used to, but not anymore — so it’s been no great loss to us. We lost some subscribers, but I hope we picked up a few. But you can’t ignore the fact that the Raccoon River is running red with nitrates just so you can save your co-op ad.The water pollution issue remains unresolved, particularly as the Des Moines Water Works lost its case in court and won’t appeal the ruling. Was that development disheartening to you?Iowa has among the filthiest surface water in America, and it’s going to impact our groundwater, and that issue remains. There’s no leverage whatsoever in Iowa to change, because the water works lawsuit was the only leverage.Now that the EPA is being dismantled and conservation funding is going to be cut by about 30 percent in the USDA budget, there’s going to be no new conservation reserve program efforts, no new filter strips, nothing to protect the Raccoon River any further ― other than farmers’ of good conscience. There are many of them trying to protect the river, but like I said in the editorials, 80 percent of them can be doing the right thing, but 20 percent can screw it all up. That’s what’s happening.The state of Iowa is now on the verge of dismantling Iowa State University’s Leopold Center, a state-sponsored sustainable agriculture-focused research facility. That doesn’t seem encouraging, either.It’s only going to get worse before it gets better, if it gets better. When Tom Vilsack, from Iowa, was secretary of agriculture, we had an opportunity to really try and do something. Everybody kept talking about voluntary nutrient reduction, because no Iowa politician wants to take on regulation of agriculture. It is the third rail of Iowa politics. But remember that the state doesn’t have any authority to regulate agriculture. I think the water works case underlined that.What advice would you give to other journalists who might “smell something,” but maybe aren’t sure if they’re ready to dive down the rabbit hole on such a touchy subject?Every newspaper is different. I’m really lucky with my Storm Lakes Times publisher and co-owner brother John, who’s a news guy, and we’re a news-driven newspaper. That’s not the most profitable model probably, but in order to be successful in that model, you have to do journalism. And journalism involves covering local government and going to all those boring meetings nobody wants to go to anymore, sitting through them and letting the supervisors beat the hell out of you at all those meetings. And then you ask for the records and you press and press and press to get them. And don’t be afraid to use the paper as a foil to get those records. We believe in hammering and hammering and hammering until the house is built. We’ve been writing editorials on this almost weekly for two years. We believe in hammering and hammering and hammering.What’s next for you? More hammering?I think I’ve made my point on this one and I gotta resist the temptation to get shitty. But I think we’re going to continue to cover nitrate and phosphorous levels in the Raccoon River and continue to hold up and shine a light on farmers who are trying to do the right thing and trying to be good neighbors.I know there are farm guys out there with their backs against the wall. I’m not one to villainize farmers, but what corporate agribusiness is doing to Iowa is almost unconscionable. They’re destroying the basic openness and honest operation of Iowa government. Iowa was long known as one of the cleanest states in politics, and look at what’s happening. This is a culture of incivility and it’s spreading, and they’re ruining this state.Do you have any faith that the political and agribusiness powers in Iowa could still right this ship?Those corporate interests won’t come around. They’re defending Roundup- ready beans and BT corn and all that ― more tilling and more chemicals and more river pollution, and the idea is, OK, that’s just the cost of doing business in Iowa. There’s absolutely nothing that’s going to change that until the next election.But nature is not going to allow us to continue the way we are. Yields will fall and the chickens will come home to roost. We’ll realize we have to change things and conserve soil and make agriculture resilient to climate change.This will happen not because of political action, but because nature will demand it. People remember when the Cuyahoga River was on fire. Three years ago, there were toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie, and Toledo couldn’t drink their water. This is every bit as bad as that. You can’t keep doing this and getting away with it. Eventually we’ll wake up, but it’s going to take nature slapping us in the face. It’s already starting to happen.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

77,POLITICS,Britain Is About To Go A Full Day Without Coal For The First Time Since 1882,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uk-coal_us_58fa3b63e4b018a9ce5ae357,"The U.S., meanwhile, is attempting to bring back the dirtiest fossil fuel.",2017-04-21,"A bus passes the Battersea Power Station, a decommissioned coal plant, in London in 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa3d1014000021001b5955.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In 1952, London’s coal-fired factories and power plants spewed out so much pollution, a dense, acrid smog settled over the British capital, killing as many as 4,000 people.Sixty-five years later, the United Kingdom is poised to complete its first full day without burning any coal to generate electricity, according to National Grid, the utility that operates the British power grid. The last coal-fired plant stopped running at 11 p.m. local time the day before, making Friday the country’s first day without coal since 1882. The U.K. switches on coal-fired plants only when cleaner power stations can’t meet electricity demand. Over the last few days, coal has made up a sliver of Britain’s energy mix, according to data from Drax, the country’s biggest power station operator. Coal use historically plummets in the spring as warmer weather reduces the need for indoor heating. Coal has at times made up less than 1 percent of the mix, and even hit zero for more than 12 hours last year. But it has never remained at zero for 24 hours before.“A decade ago, a day without coal would have been unimaginable, and in ten years’ time our energy system will have radically transformed again,” Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said in a statement. “The direction of travel is that both in the UK and globally we are already moving towards a low carbon economy.”Renewable energy from Britain’s proliferating offshore wind turbine farms certainly helps. On Friday, wind energy provided slightly less electricity than nuclear power stations, according to GridWatch, a dashboard that tracks U.K. energy use in real time. But, as in the United States, coal has been largely supplanted by natural gas, a cleaner-burning fossil fuel extracted through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The controversial technique ― which ruptures bedrock with highly pressured, sand- and chemical-laced water deep underground, freeing the gas beneath ― has been met with fierce protests in the U.K. Public support for fracking fell to 37.3 percent last year, down from 58 percent in 2013, according to a YouGov poll for the University of Nottingham, which was released in October 2016.Fracking sites usually leak methane, a greenhouse gas 40 times as potent as carbon dioxide, and the toxic chemicals used in the drilling process have been found in groundwater.U.K. natural gas extraction increased by 3.6 percent last year, despite years of decline in the North Sea, the hotbed of British production. Net imports, meanwhile, soared by nearly 20 percent last year as the utility industry, weaning itself off coal, increased its use of gas by 39 percent, according to government figures. The British move away from coal mirrors a global trend as countries fight to reduce their carbon footprints, driven in part by the 195-country Paris Agreement. In November, Canada announced plans to virtually end the use of coal by 2030. In January, smog-choked China canceled 103 new coal-fired power plants as part of a larger shift toward renewables. In February, Denmark generated enough wind energy to power its entire country for a day. The U.S., by contrast, has moved to revive coal use. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month instructing the Environmental Protection Agency to rewrite a sweeping Obama-era rule limiting emissions from coal-fired plants. The order also lifted a temporary moratorium on leasing federal lands to coal companies. On Thursday, EPA chief Scott Pruitt traveled to one of the country’s oldest coal-fired power plants, one week after he kicked off what critics call his “dirty energy tour” with a visit to a Pennsylvania coal mine. Trump, along with many other Republicans, have long blamed the decline of coal production on environmental regulations. But, as in the U.K., the industry has failed to compete with natural gas. Moreover, the string of coal producer bankruptcies over the past two years came after the companies placed big bets on continued Chinese demand for U.S. exports, which nose-dived as the Chinese economy began to slow after 2012.Still, getting rid of coal hasn’t rid the U.K. of its air quality problems. In January, air quality in London reached levels worse than Beijing. Unlike the 1950s, however, motor vehicles and wood-burning fireplaces were to blame for the pollution."

81,SPORTS,Brad Stevens Is The Last Person To Blame For The Celtics' Woes,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brad-stevens-is-last-person-to-blame-for-celtics-woes_us_58f8d576e4b00fa7de11ea87,A highly flawed roster has been exposed against the Bulls.,2017-04-21,Isaiah Thomas and Brad Stevens need to figure out something if they want to avoid being ousted by the eighth-seeded Bulls.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f90d4014000021001b5695.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The top-seeded Boston Celtics find themselves in a precarious position. It’s down two games to zero against a Chicago team that barely made the NBA Playoffs and seemingly almost fired its coach multiple times, and the blame for Boston’s woes has predictably shifted onto its boy-wonder coach, Brad Stevens.Stevens, 40, has dropped 12 of 14 games, accumulating the worst career postseason record of all time. It’s a convenient statistic for those pointing the finger his way. But the sentiment is unfair. To understand why we must recognize that the Celtics at their core have a flawed roster, and one that has easily been exposed. For example, despite winning 53 games this season, they still lack a true center. Al Horford is a fine player, but he’s also a power forward masquerading as a five man. He has been abused by Chicago’s 7-footer Robin Lopez, who right now is collecting one out of every five Bulls misses ― a clip that easily would have led the league during the regular season. The Bulls have also dominated the glass thus far, out-rebounding Boston by a margin of 23.Then there’s Boston’s helplessness in protecting the rim, which has allowed Chicago’s perimeter players to live in the paint. Neither Horford, Amir Johnson, Kelly Olynyk or Tyler Zeller are legitimate shot-blocking threats. As a result, Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade have attacked relentlessly, enjoying a barrage of free passes in the lane.In one of their better combined performances of the season, the duo each scored 22 points in a 111-97 Game 2 win. The performance showed us the importance of having wings who can “get theirs” in the playoffs.Boston’s most glaring deficiency, however, stems from its best player. Isaiah Thomas, for all his offensive prowess, has been put in the blender by Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo, who has turned back the clock to his Celtic days, when he earned four consecutive All-Star appearances.Thomas, understandably, is not his normal self right now, after the unexpected death of his sister. But then again, the 31-year-old Rondo ― who scored 11 points and dished out 14 assists, while amassing 9 rebounds and 5 steals in Game 2 ― is simply doing to him what others have done all season. It’s unclear how things will play out now that Rondo has been declared out indefinitely with a broken thumb, but Thomas isn’t exactly primed for a defensive turnaround.According to ESPN’s Defensive Real Plus Minus, the 5-foot-9 Thomas ranked dead last this season for all point guards. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Rondo completely dictated his tempo to Thomas. In Game 2, for example, the Bulls shot 58 percent when the shot was created by Rondo, but just 47 percent on all other attempts, per ESPN Stats & Info.As one NBA head coach told me recently of Thomas: “He just can’t defend. Probably the worst we’ve seen all year as far as point guards go.”Thomas’ sheer inability to guard his position puts Stevens in a precarious spot. He can’t bench him, because Thomas is the main source of offense. He couldn’t put Avery Bradley on Rondo, because it would free up Butler ― and Rondo’s absence doesn’t change anything because Thomas can still only guard one position. Jae Crowder is a good player but he doesn’t have the foot speed to check Butler or Wade, and Marcus Smart can’t play extended minutes because he’s so bad offensively. Finally, there is the talented but green rookie Jaylen Brown, who is lightyears away from being trusted on this stage.Naturally, when general manager Danny Ainge was asked about the criticism of Stevens, he deflected the blame.”I think anything is fair,” Ainge said following Game 2. “I don’t agree with them, but I haven’t written this series off yet either. I don’t even want to go there. I think that anything is fair. Sure. Any criticism is fair.”The only “fair” criticism right now should be aimed at Ainge, who has been the architect of the entire roster. Don’t forget that he is sitting on gold right now ― a pick-swap with the Brooklyn Nets in June’s draft, plus the Nets’ 2018 first-round selection. Remember the swirling rumors of Butler and Indiana’s Paul George both being on the trading block?Not making a deal wasn’t only foolish, it was pure negligence. The opportunity to land a top 10 player in his prime doesn’t come along often ― and when two were being shopped, Ainge is the one at fault for not doing whatever it took to make it happen.Regardless of what happens the rest of this series, Brad Stevens has surely done his part. The former Butler University coach resurrected a moribund franchise to improved win totals during all four seasons at the helm: 25 in his first year, then 40, 48 and 53.

83,POLITICS,Another State Shows Voter Fraud Isn't A Widespread Problem,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-voter-fraud_us_58fa5b2fe4b06b9cb916ba6c,North Carolina's audit of last year's election found just two cases of voter impersonation -- the kind of fraud voter-ID laws are supposed to prevent.,2017-04-21,"Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) refused to concede last year's gubernatorial election, citing voter fraud.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa60c714000049001b5a14.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Voting irregularities in North Carolina accounted for just 0.01 percent of nearly 4.8 million votes in last year’s general election, according to a State Board Of Elections audit released on Friday.The State Board Of Elections said that even if every irregularity was proven to be voter fraud, there wasn’t enough of it to have influenced the outcome of any race.“One ineligible vote is too many in any election; however, our analysis of irregularities does not indicate any contest was affected in November,” Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the State Board of Elections, said in a statement. The audit comes as the Supreme Court is considering whether to hear North Carolina’s appeal from a lower court ruling blocking its controversial 2013 photo voter ID law, which lawmakers argued was needed to prevent voter fraud. The audit also is a slap to former Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who claimed there was voter fraud in the November election and refused to concede his defeat.Officials in other states, including Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, have been able to offer only scant examples of voter fraud. President Donald Trump, who won North Carolina in last year’s presidential election, has alleged that millions of illegal votes were cast for his opponent Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election. Trump has offered no evidence for the claim.North Carolina’s audit describes few instances of outright fraud.“The evidence suggests that participation by ineligible voters is neither rampant nor non-existent in North Carolina,” the audit report said. “Our audits suggest that in the 2016 general election, approximately 0.01% of ballots were cast by ineligible voters. Most incidents are isolated and uncoordinated, and detecting technical violations does not always prove purposefully unlawful conduct. Our work indicates that ineligible voters are not isolated to one political party or any geographical region of the state.”The audit found there were 441 investigations into suspected felons voting, 41 cases of non-citizens voting, and 24 substantiated cases of double voting. The audit found just two cases of voter impersonation ― the kind of fraud a photo ID voting requirement aims to prevent.North Carolina in 2013 passed a law that requires voters to show photo ID at the polls, shortened the early voting period, and eliminated same-day voter registration. Critics argued the law is unnecessary because illegal voting is rare and the the law made it disproportionately more difficult for African Americans, poor and elderly residents to vote. A federal appeals court last year blocked the state from implementing the law, ruling that it targeted African Americans with “almost surgical precision.”The audit provides a glimpse into why people vote illegally. Often, the motive is confusion about the law. In the 41 cases of non-citizens voting, for example, the Board of Elections found that all of the individuals were in the United States legally and didn’t know they were prohibited from voting. Some had been misinformed by canvassers. One woman who had registered to vote had lived in the United States for 50 years and thought she had citizenship because she had been married to a U.S. citizen.The two cases of voter impersonation involved one woman who forged her husband’s signature on a mail-in ballot, and another who voted in person on behalf of her deceased mother. The audit found the “suspects in each case indicated that they were motivated out of a desire to carry out their loved one’s voting wishes.” The Board of Elections said it is reviewing an additional 19 cases of potential voter impersonation, but some of those cases appeared to be cases of mistaken identity.The report also shows how easily someone can mistakenly be accused of illegally voting. The board found during its probe of voting by non-citizens that “even where data from the Division of Motor Vehicles, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the voter rolls matched exactly, a high proportion of flagged individuals were citizens.” Some felons suspected of illegally voting presented information to auditors showing they were actually eligible.Earlier this week, Democracy North Carolina, a voting rights group, called for a criminal investigation of McCrory’s campaign and the Republican Party of North Carolina, saying both groups brought frivolous challenges to legitimate votes. The group also released a report detailing the humiliation of legitimate voters who were nonetheless accused of fraud.The state GOP chairman said the party was “dismayed but not surprised” by the audit.“This report confirms instances of illegal voting by convicted felons, illegal immigrants, and people voting under other names, including dead voters,” party chair Robin Hayes said in statement that ignored the fact that the audit found a miniscule number of irregularities. “These people should be investigated and criminally prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”"

Latin Grammy friends. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fa623114000021001b5a1b.jpeg?cache=dPZD5lXvH5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"J Balvin and Nicky Jam have practically become reggaetón royalty in recent years, but they don’t view their brand of reggaetón to be on par with what filled the airwaves in the early 2000s.Both artists sat down with Billboard recently to discuss their journey to becoming global phenomenons, including why they wanted to change the idea that reggaetón is a misogynist genre for the sake of the many women and children who follow their music. During a joint conversation with the magazine, ahead of the 2107 Latin Billboard Music Awards on April 27, journalist Leila Cobo mentioned that both artists had “largely avoided objectifying women in lyrics and video, which is common in reggaetón.” In response, the 36-year-old Nicky Jam explained that given their broad audience, they need to make videos “where women look beautiful and conservative and are treated with respect, because the videos are seen by kids and adults.” He added that other reggaetón artists are targeting “one audience,” though he didn’t specify which, and didn’t have the same responsibility. J Balvin, 31, added that he felt the need to change the notion that the genre objectifies women because of the women in his own life.“Plus, we both have mothers, sisters, relatives,” J Balvin said. “Part of what we did is change that misconception that reggaetón is machista and misogynist. On the contrary, women are our biggest fans, and they inspire us.”Some examples of their portrayal of women in lyrics and music videos include J Balvin’s hit “Ay Vamos,” a song about a couple who fights each other but loves each other in the end. In the video, the artist and his supposed girlfriend try to out prank each other. Nicky Jam’s single “Hasta el Amanecer” has lyrics that do seem to have sexual undertones with verses that talk about wanting to be with a woman he just met until dawn. But the music video for the hit features the artist simply meeting a young woman at a laundry mat, trying to get her attention with his dance moves. J Balvin and Nicky Jam, who is Puerto Rican but rebuilt his career in Medellín, are both the product of a boom of reggaetón stars coming out of Colombia. The two artists were friends long before their individual success, and continue to support each other as they go head to head in both the music charts and award nominations. In a conversation with The Huffington Post, Nicky Jam explained what he feels set Colombian reggaetón apart.“I just think the music is more catchy, and the lyrics are more cotidianos (day-to-day),” Nicky Jam said in Sept. 2016. “It talks about things that happen on a daily basis. Reggaeton from Puerto Rico is more about dancing music, reggaeton specifically. Now Puerto Ricans are starting to [focus more on lyrics], because they have the ability to do it.”For J Balvin, it’s always been important to be both a leader in the genre and represent his native Colombia as an urban artist. “There’s vallenato, there’s pop, there’s rock [in Colombia] but we need the urban part and thankfully we’ve been able to do it little by little,” the artist told HuffPost in 2014, after the success of his single ‘6 AM.’ “Obviously we’re still in the process of growth, but there’s been a clear vision for the public that there’s good Urban music coming from Colombia for the world.”Read Nicky Jam and J Balvin’s entire conversation with Billboard here.
