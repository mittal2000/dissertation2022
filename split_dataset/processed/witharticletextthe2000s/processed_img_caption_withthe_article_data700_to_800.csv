The Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as a ""white supremacist lawyer.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58593afa120000590eef0540.jpeg?ops=crop_6_325_1530_1234%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A former Georgia police sergeant is suing her department after she says she was fired for flying a Confederate flag outside her home, in a case whose defense efforts briefly included an accused “white supremacist lawyer.”Silvia Cotriss, 53 and formerly of the Roswell Police Department, filed a freedom of speech lawsuit against the city and its police force last week. She was terminated for “unbecoming” conduct in July, according to a copy of the decision obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.According to the suit, Cotriss said the flag, which was a gift, had been flying for over a year outside her home in Woodstock, Georgia, about 30 miles north of Atlanta, “without causing any problems.”“She was displaying her pride in her Southern heritage and honoring her recently deceased husband,” the suit says.However, a man who lived near Cotriss complained to her department about the flag. Her attorney says that rather than asking Cotriss to take it down, the department “just fired her.”“It’s interesting because if they simply said, ‘Hey Silvia, you need to take down that flag because we received a complaint,’ she would have complied,” Cotriss’ attorney, David Ates, told The Huffington Post Monday. “I think they wanted to get rid of her for other reasons. She’s an older lady, she was out on medical leave for some time, she had trouble passing a fitness test.”Cotriss, a 20-year veteran of the police department, claimed to The Associated Press in July that she did not know some people find the flag offensive.“If I knew it offended someone, my friends, my family, I wouldn’t do it,” she said.The case recently made national news after Kirk Lyons, who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a “white supremacist lawyer,” announced on Friday that he would be helping fight Cotriss’ case with his group, the Southern Legal Resource Center.Ates said Monday that he has since cut ties with Lyons, and that he and Cotriss were not aware of Lyons’ background and the allegations against him when they first accepted his help.“We thought [SLRC was] just a Southern heritage group and like the Sons of the Confederate Veterans,” Ates said.“When this news broke last week, I started getting calls that maybe Mr. Lyons holds some extremist views,” Ates said. “And that was news to me and my client.”Lyons said he reached out and offered to help Cotriss because he specializes in defending Southern and Confederate heritage. As for the other allegations against him from the SPLC, which tracks hate groups, Lyons denies being a racist.“We are not a right-wing group, we are not a hate group and I am not a white supremacist lawyer,” he told HuffPost Tuesday.According to the SPLC, Lyons has been affiliated with Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist leaders since the 1980s. In addition to representing and defending these people, the SPLC accuses Lyons of marrying his wife in a neo-Nazi Aryan Nations compound and marching with Klansmen in a Tennessee parade in 1989.Lyons said he did indeed have his wedding in the compound, but claimed it was because his wife’s parents’ church was there. He also acknowledged that he was at the Klan parade, but said it was so he could protect the First Amendment rights of those marching.“I gave instructions,” he said. “I actually pulled people out of jail that were arrested just because they chose to participate.”He also didn’t deny defending white supremacists in court.“I don’t know if I believed everything these guys believe... but it’s my job to represent people who are hated, whose beliefs are unpopular. That is my duty as a lawyer,” he said. “It shouldn’t matter whatever my background is if I am willing to right a wrong.”Ates said he doesn’t know whether the allegations against Lyons are true. If they’re not, he said, “I feel bad for him.”Regardless, Ates said Lyons is no longer involved in Cotriss’ case.“His involvement is distracting from Ms. Cotriss’ case and interest,” he told HuffPost. “We can’t have everybody taking their eye off the ball.”Lyons said he hopes to rejoin the case at some point.“We’re getting a timeout because things need to die down, and they will,” he said. “She deserves a fair shake and people in Atlanta not thinking that Godzilla is her attorney.”“Whether I’m on the case or not,” he said, “I will do whatever I can to help Sergeant Cotriss.”The Roswell Police Department referred questions Monday to the city of Roswell, which declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.Cotriss’ lawsuit seeks reinstatement of her position or 10 years of pay and benefits."

Now he is reportedly exploring running for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58595a7b120000590eef05cc.jpeg?cache=O2LrNqWEOZ&ops=crop_0_49_910_798%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who Politico Playbook reported on Tuesday is exploring a run to chair the Democratic National Committee, is largely a political unknown on the national stage.The openly gay Navy reserve officer and former McKinsey consultant appears to be more of a liberal technocrat than a rust belt populist, according to a June profile in The New York Times and a Medium post published three days ago. He is long on good governance accomplishments like destroying or refurbishing blighted property in his city, and short on rants against job-killing trade deals, which he told the Times are not to blame for the bulk of manufacturing job losses.But a look further into Buttigieg’s past reveals an extraordinarily prescient streak of progressive political insight. In 2000, Buttigieg made Sen. Bernie Sanders, then an independent Vermont congressman, the focus of an essay that won the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Essay Contest for High School Students. In the winning essay, Buttigieg celebrated Sanders’ unabashed identification as a socialist at a time when “politicians are rushing for the center.”“Fortunately for the political process, there remain a number of committed individuals who are steadfast enough in their beliefs to run for office to benefit their fellow Americans,” Buttigieg wrote. “Such people are willing to eschew political and personal comfort and convenience because they believe they can make a difference. One outstanding and inspiring example of such integrity is the country’s only Independent Congressman, Vermont’s Bernie Sanders.”Buttigieg ticked off several of Sanders’ stances that were controversial at the time ― supporting same-sex marriage, backing gun regulations that have drawn the ire of the National Rifle Association and bringing seniors to Canada to buy cheaper pharmaceutical drugs.But he also commended Sanders for his pragmatism. Sanders’ willingness to work within the system is evident, Buttigieg argued, in his decision to endorse Democratic President Bill Clinton and forge bipartisan coalitions to, among other things, hold hearings aimed at making the International Monetary Fund more transparent and accountable.“Above all, I commend Bernie Sanders for giving me an answer to those who say American young people see politics as a cesspool of corruption, beyond redemption,” Buttigieg concluded. “I have heard that no sensible young person today would want to give his or her life to public service. I can personally assure you this is untrue.”"

The twin sisters, who have been openly gay for the entirety of their careers, said that they want to repay the community that has supported them tirelessly. “Since the beginning of our career, our LGBTQ fans have supported us in innumerable ways,” they wrote in a letter on the foundation’s website. “Your personal histories of injustice and discrimination at home, school, work, and church have inspired us to use our public status to speak out about the struggles of the LGBTQ community.” The Grammy-nominated duo acknowledged the many intersections within the LGTBQ community of women, and acknowledged that on the precipice of a Trump-Pence administration it’s the women at the center of these intersections who need support now more than ever:LGBTQ women are experiencing disproportionately high levels of poverty, health issues and inequality. LGBTQ women of color, especially transgender women often experience these issues even more severely due to racism and transphobia. Today, given the state of politics in the United States, we must continue to unite and fight for our rights and against all forms of oppression. Tegan and Sara are absolutely right when it comes to the “disproportionately high levels of poverty, health issues and inequality” that LGBTQ women face. As the foundation’s website points out, 30 percent of bisexual women live in poverty, as do 23 percent of lesbian women. And compared to the general population, trans women are four times more likely to have an annual income of $10,000 or less according to a 2015 study by the Center for American Progress. The Tegan and Sara Foundation also wants to increase visibility of LGTBQ women to reduce the stigma around the community, and pointed out the severe lack of representation of queer women in pop culture. Thanks for fighting the good fight, ladies. "
3,POLITICS,Newt Gingrich Thinks Nepotism Laws Shouldn’t Apply To Trump Administration,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newt-gingrich-donald-trump-nepotism-laws_us_5859256ce4b0b3ddfd8e8f75,The former House speaker also suggested the president-elect has the power to pardon advisers who break the law.,2016-12-20,Newt Gingrich gestures as he arrives for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York City on Nov. 21.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585937ee120000590eef0532.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich sees no reason for ethics laws to keep President-elect Donald Trump from appointing certain people to his administration. Gingrich suggested on Monday during an interview with NPR’s “The Diane Rehm Show” that Trump could sidestep anti-nepotism laws that would bar him from giving advisory roles to his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.“In the case of the president, he has a broad ability to organize the White House the way he wants to,” Gingrich said.President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the nepotism statute into law in 1967, seven years after President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Bobby Kennedy as attorney general. The law prevents public officials from employing or promoting relatives to a civilian position of an office within their jurisdiction. Gingrich previously stated Trump might have to get a “waiver” in order to bypass the law. Now it seems the former House speaker doesn’t believe the law necessarily applies to the Trump administration at all.“[The law] was a very narrowly focused bill really in reaction to a particular personality thing,” Gingrich said. “You have to look at it in the context of what [its creators] were trying to accomplish.”Overriding nepotism laws wasn’t the only notable rule-bending suggestion Gingrich made Monday. He also seemed to imply Trump could protect advisers who break the law.“He also has, frankly, the power of the pardon. It’s a totally open power,” Gingrich said. “He could simply say, ‘Look, I want them to be my advisers. I pardon them if anyone finds them to have behaved against the rules. Period.’ Technically, under the Constitution, he has that level of authority.”The Fox News contributor said Congress should adopt new practices that would take Trump’s enormous business wealth into account. “My point is we have never seen this kind of wealth in the White House, and so traditional rules don’t work, and we’re going to have to think up, you know, a whole new approach,” Gingrich said.James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, also appeared on Monday’s radio segment and said he couldn’t believe what Gingrich has proposed.“Speaker Gingrich’s statement that wealth trumps the rule of law ― basically, that’s what he was saying ― is jaw-dropping,” he said. From doing business with Bahrain to owing foreign banks large sums of money, the president-elect is associated with unprecedented conflicts of interest that should startle most government officials.But the potential appointment of his daughter and son-in-law to his administration is just another conflict of interest that doesn’t seem to bother many Republicans.“I don’t think that Mr. Trump has as big of a problem as people would like him to have with it, so, no, I have no problem,” Rep. Michael Kelly (R-Pa.) told The Huffington Post earlier this month."

5,GREEN,The Role of Science in The Trump Era,"Cristina Eisenberg, ContributorChief Scientist at Earthwatch Institute, Ecologist, and Book a...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/science-in-the-trump-era_us_5859a5d2e4b04d7df167cb78,"Only science based on rigorous, peer-reviewed research designed with full freedom of inquiry will work.",2016-12-20,<p>Polar Bear Mother and Cub Waiting for the Ice to Form</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5859a70d1800002400e43c95.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week the Electoral College confirmed Donald Trump as our next president. The election of a demagogue profoundly threatens our nation’s ability to produce sound science. And it creates a particularly pressing problem because of the many things Trump’s election isn’t changing—such as how nature works, and our human fundamental needs for survival.Humans depend on nature for food, clean water, and clean air. We rely on the environment to help us regulate climate and disease, and to support nutrient cycles and crop pollination. Trump and his new cabinet will endanger all of these ecological functions, by suppressing the use of science to inform decision-making about them.Since the 1920s, ecologists have been pointing out that nature is at risk due to unfettered human population growth, rapacious exploitation of natural resources, and related environmental pollution. In the 1960s, in response to air and water quality crises that caused human deaths and species extinctions, we used best science to create the Environmental Protection Agency and passed a formidable suite of environmental laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).Within one decade we began to see the fruits of these laws and their bedrock science. Species such as the bald eagle returned from extinction’s edge; air in cities became safer to breathe. Yet, because of our increasing demands on nature, these powerful laws have been unable to measurably slow climate change.Science is our most powerful tool to build on the legacy of these laws and craft public policy to slow and mitigate climate change. A warming global climate is leading to unprecedented human health and environmental threats, such as extinction over the next 100 years of up to 50 percent of species currently living on our planet. The only way to fully address these threats is by allowing scientists to conduct research effectively and transparently. Throughout his campaign, Trump sought support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument. Trump’s agenda to “make America great” includes slashing funding for science and universities, adopting a formal platform of climate-change denial, intensifying natural resources exploitation, weakening environmental laws, and reducing all kinds of diversity. Pundits point out that Trump’s atavistic demagoguery in assembling his cabinet creates a strategic assault on science. To that end, some of his nominees’ regressionary personal philosophies push the boundaries of legitimacy and directly counter the missions of the agencies they will be leading.A tour of Trump’s challenges to science begins with his selection of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A party to at least 13 lawsuits attacking the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts who refers to himself on his website as the “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda,” Pruitt is hardly supportive of natural resources policy checks and balance.Trump’s top nominee for Secretary of Energy, former Texas governor Rick Perry, lacks the academic background to enable him to understand the essential role of science in maintaining US nuclear security. In sharp contrast to his predecessors, who were PhD physicists, he holds a bachelor’s degree in Animal Science. Yet he will take the lead in deciding how we manage our nuclear arsenal. Additionally, the Trump Transition Team’s intrusive questioning of Department of Energy scientists and contractors creates an ominous environment where it’s unsafe for scientists to use the term “climate change.”Secretary of State nominee Exxon chief executive Rex W. Tillerson has a background in engineering and close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The billion-dollar Russian energy contracts brokered by Tillerson engender a huge conflict of interest. He’s persistently dismissed the severity of climate change, yet will be our top government official negotiating our engagement in international climate-change policies, such as the Paris Agreement.In a field populated by serious contenders like Sarah Palin, Trump’s selection of Representative Ryan Zinke (R-MT) as Secretary of the Interior offers some hope in an otherwise bleak landscape. While supporting US energy independence, Zinke acknowledges that climate change must be addressed. He brings to the presidential cabinet a centrist, Roosevelt-inspired conservation philosophy. A pragmatist who favors sustainable natural resources extraction, he also supports Native American water rights and keeping federal lands intact.Why does science matter so much in the Trump era? What is at stake? Put simply, according to ecologist Paul Ehrlich, our survival as a species is on the line. He calls out escalating indicators of global collapse such as climate disruption, environmental toxicity, the extinction crisis, soil destruction, famine, and pandemic outbreaks. Ignoring these signals is tantamount to driving civilization toward collapse. Supporting sound science will help us find solutions.Science provides our best hope for the future of life on Earth. Indeed, since Aristotle’s time, leaders have seen science as the sharpest weapon any civilization can wield to improve their survival. But today, only science based on rigorous, peer-reviewed research designed with full freedom of inquiry will work. Linked to our constitutionally mandated freedom of speech, our freedom to do science is part of what truly makes America great.Even the most conservative global science organizations are so troubled by the many challenges Trump brings to scientific integrity that they’ve been speaking out. Some have been urging the scientific community to be more vocal and frank about scientific issues. For example, recently more than 2,300 scientists (including 22 Nobel Peace Prize laureates) wrote and signed an open letter to president-elect Trump.Beyond the scientific community, non-scientists can do even more to help defend science. As members of a democratic society, we can ask Congress to maintain freedom of scientific inquiry and diversity in science. Specifically, we can comment publicly on and vote to support environmental laws. We can urge the president to hire a national science advisor as well as other scientists with appropriate credentials in ecology, physics, and engineering to fill key posts in his administration.We can become more directly involved by actually participating in science. A variety of organizations enable scientific public engagement (called citizen science) such as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the National Audubon Society, and Earthwatch Institute.Whether you are a scientist or a non-scientist, all of these strategies are about defending science and putting it into action. Now more than ever, science is our best hope for the future. And now more than ever, science needs you.* * * Learn more about carnivore conservation by reading The Carnivore Way: Coexisting with and Conserving North America’s Predators, and The Wolf’s Tooth: Keystone Predators, Trophic Cascades, and Biodiversity by Dr. Cristina Eisenberg.

6,MEDIA,Myth-busting Is Not Enough: Tell A New Story Instead Of Circulating Fake News,"Carly Goodman, ContributorCommunications Analyst, American Friends Service Committee",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/myth-busting-is-not-enough-tell-a-new-story-instead_us_5859a06ae4b014e7c72ed87e,This piece originally appeared on American Friends Service Committee’s Media Uncovered blog. As the 2016 election has shown,2016-12-20,"<p>Instead of just myth-busting, tell a new story </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5859a2531800001d00e43c81.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece originally appeared on American Friends Service Committee’s Media Uncovered blog.As the 2016 election has shown, media illiteracy and the widespread proliferation of untrue, false, and unsubstantiated claims can have dire effects on the core institutions of the country as well as on our civic efforts to promote social justice and inclusion. In part three of an ongoing blog series on media literacy, we discuss a tactic that you can use in your own life to disrupt the spread of false news.The circulation of fake news, propaganda, and lies – even when they are easily debunked – is highly destabilizing. How can we find common ground on which to debate, disagree, and build trust when the ground beneath our feet is suddenly itself suspect and the subject of lies? As the writer Ned Resnikoff writes, “when fake news is omnipresent, all news becomes suspect. Everything starts to look like a lie.” Without some consensus about what is true – that climate change is real, for example – social change becomes much more difficult.It is essential that people debunk the lies that are circulating, because when fake news is everywhere, nothing seems real. But paradoxically, fact-checking is not enough. Research shows that myth-busting is not as persuasive as we might hope. Even if experts have tons of facts on their side, arguing against a false or misleading story can cause readers to get defensive and believe more deeply in the myth. People who believe something strongly simply discard the facts that don’t agree with their belief. But if facts cannot effectively fight blatant lies, what can we do?Repeating a lie in order to debunk it can give it more weight and power – and it’s unlikely to convince anyone who believes it anyway. Instead of reacting to fake news and lies by merely pointing out that a story is false, tell a new story. For example, instead of debunking a negative, untrue myth about immigrants, talk affirmatively about who immigrants are and how humane immigration policies help all of us. Instead of demonstrating that myths about immigrants threatening the country’s safety are unfounded, for example, tell an affirmative story about how immigrants are long-standing members of our communities that our policies must respect.Another step is to try to understand the purpose of the myth. When a lie is being widely believed and repeated, it’s worth asking why it is gaining power. Recently the president-elect repeated a lie that millions of people had voted illegally, a claim that is not only unsubstantiated, but easy to debunk. That kind of voter fraud happens so rarely, it is nearly non-existent. But what is the purpose of that lie? The New York Times editorial board writes that “these lies threaten the foundations of American democracy” and may provide “justification for voter suppression laws around the country.”Instead of getting dragged down into an argument about non-existent voter fraud, start a new conversation steeped in shared values about how important it is to uphold voter rights. Get at the purpose of the myth about voter fraud without repeating it. Instead, talk about resisting new voter suppression laws, and advocate to restore voting rights to people barred from voting due to a felony conviction. Logic doesn’t answer fear – but by starting a new conversation about the fundamental importance of voting, we may be able to build support for policies that protect voting rights and thwart false messages about fraud.The best way to be persuasive when fake news is everywhere is to tell a new, affirmative story, backed up by good evidence, instead of arguing against a false one. By telling new, truthful stories, we can begin to build consensus that promotes more peaceful and inclusive communities."

It’s a time where many usually look back on the last 12 months and reflect on all they’ve accomplished (or not). For some it is a time of relief as they can release all of the funk and bad juju of the year, and for others it is another opportunity to look ahead and start over. I’ve been having a ton of mixed feelings about this past year. I’ve grown as a person, both professionally and personally, but the most critical revelation of the year for me is I discovered I am a social justice activist, a label that I never claimed before.Between the Presidential election, the financial crisis in Puerto Rico, the killings of unarmed people of color, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the humanitarian crisis in the Syrian town of Aleppo I found myself more involved and more vocal on domestic and international issues than I’d ever been. Despite all my personal achievements, this year I found there’s so much going on in the world at large and there’s always so much more of ourselves we can give.I found myself on the front lines of protest marches . I found myself making calls to my local senators and elected officials in protest of Trump’s selection of certain cabinet members. I was writing articles and gathering resources where others could do the same in their states. As an anti-Trump critic I became extremely vocal and passionate about the Presidential election, often times bumping heads and engaging in heated arguments with my father, a self-proclaimed Trump supporter. I was fist pumping, yelling, and hash tagging #staywoke all across my social media platforms. This past year has ignited a fire in me I didn’t realize I had.I don’t know if it’s because I’m getting older or because I have two young children, but the state of the world matters significantly more to me now. It matters to me the legacy I leave behind for my children and for their children (when that time comes). I understand we are responsible now for creating the world of the future which is why I think I’ve become extremely passionate about so many issues. I can’t sit back and leave the work to someone else. None of us can. We each are responsible for the state of this world through our actions and through what we contribute.In recent weeks we have been bombarded with the massacre of human lives happening in Aleppo and as I sit in the safety of my office writing this article my heart breaks knowing that somewhere in that city there is a child alone, who has been separated from his/her family, possibly hiding, and frightened to death of being killed. I think about that and it breaks me to pieces because this cannot be the world we live in. With all that I would like to do to help, I feel helpless and hopeless. I think about my own children and how grateful I am that although the United States has its own issues we live in a country where bombings in the streets isn’t part of our everyday reality. It’s recognizing this privilege that inspires me to do more. I think we all should be doing more.Though our Presidential election seemed to further divide our country I really believe this world is at a point in history where we can no longer be divided, but instead try to find some common ground for the sake of all humanity. If we continue to only act in selfish and opportunistic ways we will find ourselves left with very little hope, very little faith, and not much of a global future. For 2017, I commit to be louder, bolder, and a champion for unity and change. You should too."

It called on China to comply with international law and refrain from further efforts to impede lawful U.S. activities.“The U.S. remains committed to upholding the accepted principles and norms of international law and freedom of navigation and overflight and will continue to fly, sail, and operate in the South China Sea wherever international law allows,” Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said in a statement.The seizure has added to U.S. concerns about China’s growing military presence and aggressive posture in the disputed South China Sea, including its militarization of maritime outposts.China is deeply suspicious of any U.S. military activities in the resource-rich South China Sea, with state media and experts saying the use of the drone was likely part of U.S. surveillance efforts in the disputed waterway.The U.S. Navy has about 130 such underwater drones, made by Teledyne Webb, each weighing about 60 kg (130 pounds) and able to stay underwater for up to five months. They are used to collect unclassified data about oceans, including temperature and depth. They are used around the world, but it is unclear how many are used in the South China Sea."
9,BLACK VOICES,Why Kenny Lattimore Thinks Christmas Music Can Help Restore ‘Hope’ In America,Brennan Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-kenny-lattimore-christmas_us_5857ea2ae4b0b3ddfd8d7c7d,The veteran musician is celebrating the most wonderful time of the year with the release of his debut Christmas album.,2016-12-19,"“Christmas music ― generally, if it’s based on the true meaning of Christmas ― it should give people hope,” he said",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5857f7ea1c000011070ec483.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly three decades as a recording artist, Kenny Lattimore has added a smooth, soulful touch to Christmas with the release of his debut holiday album, “A Kenny Lattimore Christmas.”Five months in the making, the 11-track Motown Gospel project finds Lattimore reimagining beloved classic holiday standards including “I’ll Be Home For Christmas,” “Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,” and “The Christmas Song.” The Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter also provides listeners with new original compositions such as “Real Love This Christmas” and “Everybody Love Somebody.”According to the seasoned R&B crooner, recording the holiday project was among his most liberating experiences to date. “One of the things that I immediately thought was, Christmas gives me the fun, confined, place to do whatever I wanted,” he said during an interview with HuffPost. “It’s something about a Christmas album where everything doesn’t have to have the same kind of continuity that if I’m doing an R&B album one song has to flow into the next. Of course, it all gotta work together as one package, but I didn’t feel as confounded.”While Lattimore went on to credit notable Christmas tunes from the likes of The Jackson 5, Mariah Carey, Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby as sources of inspiration, he also cites a non-holiday standard from Diana Ross’ 1972 motion picture soundtrack, “Lady Sings The Blues” as an unique element that helped shaped the project. “I was listening to Diana Ross’ ‘My Man’ from ‘Lady Sings The Blues,’ and I said ‘I want the end of one of my songs to have this kind of feel, because the emotion of when she hits ‘Where ever my man is, I’m his forever,’ and I love how that makes me feel when I’m listening to it and I’m seeing her sing it,” he said. “So we took that and put it into one of the songs. And we just had fun by blending together all these different elements of things that we loved. And I think it gave it a different approach.”For the 46-year-old Washington, D.C.-native, the timeliness of his Christmas release couldn’t have arrived at a better time, given the current state of political and racial tensions in America.“Christmas music ― generally, if it’s based on the true meaning of Christmas ― it should give people hope,” he said. “And that’s what I loved about the opportunity to do this with Motown Gospel. I was able to do a song that we wrote called, ‘Everybody Loves Somebody,’ which really does touch on what has been exposed of our society is that it’s pretty much the same as it was back in the ‘50s and the ‘40s, and ‘20s. Our attitudes as a country have not changed.”In an effort to alleviate the country’s preconceived notions, Lattimore encourages his fellow musicians to use their musical platform to help restore “hope.”“I think much of our country is blind…we all try to make sense of things that we don’t control. But the one thing that we can control is our thoughts towards one another. And if we teach our generation to love one another and respect each other as human beings, no matter what our race is or economic status…I think it can circle all the way back to this music thing.”“If we can use this musical platform to continually give people hope and uplift, then even during tough seasons we can push through and have a different perspective. Music helps us gain a different perspective,” Lattimore added.Kenny Lattimore’s “A Kenny Lattimore Christmas” is now available in stores and digital retailers.

10,POLITICS,Democratic Governors Make 11th-Hour Plea To Save Obamacare,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-obamacare-repeal_us_58582dfce4b08debb78a4f40,They’re offering a gentle and sometimes not-so-gentle reminder to Republicans that their districts have a lot to lose.,2016-12-19,Kevin McCarthy (right) has Speaker Paul Ryan's ear. He also has a number of constituents depended on Obamacare. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5858362f1c000011070ec636.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an effort to slow the pace if not fully stop the repeal of Obamacare, Democratic governors from across the country are making back-channel entreaties to Republican members of their state’s congressional delegations. Their pitches have been simple and uniformly distressed: Uprooting the Affordable Care Act at this juncture, they warn, would cause a massive disruption in the health care markets and have costly impacts in members’ home districts.Gov. Jerry Brown’s (D-Calif.) office confirmed that he had been in “close contact” with legislators in Washington, D.C., to discuss “potential challenges ahead” on health care. Gov. Tom Wolf (D-Penn), meanwhile, is drafting a letter to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the entire Pennsylvania delegation, reminding them that some 63,000 people in the state depend on the law for drug and alcohol treatment ― at a time when they’re grappling with an opioid and heroin epidemic. And in Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee (D) made similar overtures to GOP leadership and fellow members, while noting that 51,000 health-related jobs have been added to the state’s economy since the ACA was passed.“I’ve talked to some of our Republican delegates to Congress, just expressing the hope that that will turn out just to be a bumper sticker,” Inslee told The Huffington Post. “We want to make sure that this repeal and replace doesn’t just end up being a repeal. ... Whatever they do, we cannot allow it to be kicking people off their health care by the hundreds of thousands in my state.”There is little indication to date that Republican leadership is heeding these warnings. Members have signaled that they plan on fully repealing Obamacare early in the new year, while establishing a window as long as four years to find a replacement. President-elect Donald Trump has given no indication of any hesitance about signing such a bill.But the governors have a compelling case to make. The ramifications of appeal in certain districts could be massive. In California alone, 1.4 million people purchased plans through state exchanges, according to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the state’s Medicaid expansion gave 3.5 million new people coverage by the end of 2015, according to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In Pennsylvania, those numbers are 412,000 and 600,000. And in Washington they’re 158,000 and 592,000.County-level data shows that the law has affected areas that elect Republican lawmakers. In the two counties that make up McCarthy’s district ― Kern and Tulare ― roughly 28,000 people enrolled in plans through the state exchange, according to state data compiled in June 2016. This total doesn’t include the number who have enrolled in Medicaid because of the law. All told, 14 members of California’s delegation are Republican, including McCarthy; 13 members of Pennsylvania’s delegation are Republican; and four members of Washington’s delegation are Republican, including Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the third-ranking member in the House.Depending on when the repeal legislation is considered, these governors will need to convince as many as 23 Republicans in the House, or three in the Senate, that it’s in their political self-interest to keep Obamacare intact ― as least until a replacement is passed.It’s a tall task. But while they play an inside game ― working legislators through direct talks, political persuasion and thinly veiled threats (such as pledges to not help the GOP clean up the mess that a repeal will create) ― outside groups supportive of Obamacare are adopting a traditionally grassroots approach. Almost immediately after the results of the election came into focus on Nov. 8, top advocacy and health policy officials began talks to reconstitute the same coalition that helped Obama pass the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Organizers met in subsequent days to discuss how to structure and staff the outfit, with leadership drafting up a state-based approach to localize pressure on lawmakers returning home for Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks. “A lot of it is facing the new reality both in Congress and the administration. These people are institutionally engaged in these issues. It is wrenching for them,” said one organizer leading the efforts, who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about specific plans. “They’ve spent their lives on this. It is not abstract. So, you suit up for this stuff because that’s what you do.” To date, liberal groups have organized protests outside of GOP Senate office buildings and a “week of action” in various districts across the country. These same groups are gathering a database of individual stories from those whose lives and health are dependent on the law. They plan to make a patient-centric public relations push once Congress reconvenes in January, in addition to framing the repeal of Obamacare as the first step in a Republican-designed plan to downsize Medicare too. “The biggest thing is making sure that people’s outrage about what the other side is doing is made visibly visible to decision-makers themselves and the press looking on,” said Ben Wikler, the Washington Director of liberal advocacy organization MoveOn.org. To date, only a few GOP lawmakers have expressed reservations about their party’s strategy. That may suggest that GOP lawmakers are more emotionally committed to repealing Obamacare than they are open to arguments that it should stay in place. But it also reflects the broader political forces at play. While Democratic governors and outside groups are gearing up for a massive campaign to save the Affordable Care Act, the forces of opposition are organizing their own push too.“We are willing to work with every other grassroots organization willing to work with us to make sure we repeal the law and making sure we [are] replacing it [with something] that doesn’t resemble Obamacare-light,” said Noah Wall, grassroots director for the conservative group FreedomWorks, which has led the effort to upend the law. “That’s key for us, and what we are going to need to do is going to require a tremendous amount of grassroots pressure. But our activists are so close to seeing the end of the tunnel that I think they will be super motivated on this.”Amanda Terkel and Jeffrey Young contributed reporting.Want more updates from Sam Stein?

11,MEDIA,Donald Trump Meets Off The Record With Journalists,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-off-the-record_us_5857bcaee4b08debb789b44e,The president-elect recently canceled what would have been his first press conference since July.,2016-12-19,Donald Trump met off the record with reporters on Sunday night. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5857d0121200008310ef005b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has not held a press conference in 144 days, but he did speak Sunday night to members of the press corps at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.We just don’t know what he said. It’s not unheard of for politicians and the press to meet socially and agree to off-the-record ground rules in order to speak more candidly. Top advisers to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign dined privately with reporters just before she got into the 2016 race, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) did something similar just last week. President Barack Obama has held several off-the-record discussions with influential columnists.But the decision of journalists to allow Trump to speak off the record after canceling last week’s press conference, and on the eve of the Electoral College vote, was particularly tone-deaf and reinforces perceptions that the press still doesn’t know how to handle a master media manipulator. Sunday’s cocktail party was especially striking given Trump’s overt hostility toward the press, an aspect of his presidential campaign that has not abated since the election. Trump railed against the “very dishonest” press in Mobile, Alabama, just a day before posing with journalists at Mar-a-Lago. “Shameful,” Mother Jones Editor-in-Chief Clara Jeffery tweeted Sunday night in response to photo of Trump, surrounded by reporters, giving a thumbs-up. “Hard to imagine any possible justification for agreeing to an off-the-record cocktail party with the president-elect,” Tim Grieve, McClatchy’s vice president for news, tweeted Sunday night. The Mar-a-Lago party was initially only to feature Trump transition aides, according to a BuzzFeed reporter present. However, Trump arrived and stayed for 30 minutes along with his wife, Melania, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and top aides Kellyanne Conway, Jason Miller and Stephen Miller. Among the attendees were journalists from The New York Times, CNN, NBC News and Reuters. Though Trump’s visit was off the record, photographs were apparently permitted. Mike Allen, the former Politico star reporter who recently co-founded the new media outlet Axios, tweeted photos of the opulent scene that drew criticism and mockery on social media. “This tweet was the moment I realized the White House Correspondents Dinner will go on as usual,” the Los Angeles Times’ Matt Pearce said in response to the group photo. Trump, whose tweets are already breathlessly covered by the news media, may have even less incentive to take questions from the press corps if they’re willing to allow him to speak off the record in person. Though Trump has done some interviews since winning the presidency, including with The New York Times and Fox News, he backed out of a planned news conference on Thursday. Trump had ostensibly called that event so he could address questions about his business ventures and his many looming conflicts of interest. Though he postponed that press conference until at least January, Trump found time over the past week to meet with hip-hop star Kanye West and hold four “Thank You” rallies. The White House press corps is already bracing for change and reduced access during a Trump presidency. Just hours before journalists posed with a beaming president-elect, Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan asked, “As Trump era nears, is the media ready for the challenge?”The scene at Mar-a-Lago doesn’t inspire hope. This post has been updated with further information about the attendees at Sunday’s event."
12,MEDIA,Germany Weighs Stiff Fines for Social Media Sites That Carry Fake News,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/german-fake-news-fines_us_585843d5e4b03904470a1dfb,German politicians hope to quell rising extremism and eliminate hoaxes.,2016-12-19,Germany has an idea for how to crack down on the problem.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585856461c00000a070ec769.jpeg?ops=crop_509_239_3654_2646%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Germany is considering legislation that would impose stiff fines on social media sites that carry fake news.Such a measure would be a dramatic departure from attempted crackdowns on fake news in the U.S., where social media sites like Facebook are allowed wide latitude to police themselves.Under the proposed measure in Germany, sites would have to remove fake news within 24 hours. Subjects targeted by the stories would also have the right to demand a retraction placed in a prominent spot on the site. The proposal would require major platforms like Facebook to staff an office in Germany to be responsive to complaints 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Sites that fail to remove false news could face fines of up to 500,000 euros ($520,000) under the measure.“Facebook did not avail itself of the opportunity to regulate the issue of complaint management itself,” Social Democratic Party parliamentary chairman Thomas Oppermann complained to Der Spiegel, according to a translation published by Deutsche Welle.The legislation is being pushed by the Social Democrats, but also has the support of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats.“Defamation and malicious gossip are not covered under freedom of speech,” and “justice authorities must prosecute that, even on the Internet,” the Guardian quoted Germany Justice Minister Heiko Maas as telling the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.The problem of fake news is becoming a major issue throughout Europe, particularly in Germany where citizens fear interference in next year’s election by extremists posting false stories in order to swing votes. European Parliament President Martin Schulz is calling for EU-wide laws to halt the problem.There was no immediate response from Facebook to the German proposal. But Facebook last week unveiled its plan in the U.S. to battle fake news. Facebook’s News Feed Vice President Adam Mosseri last week said the measures would eliminate the “worst of the worst” hoaxes “spread by spammers for their own gain.” The protections would include allowing fact-checking outlets to investigate suspicious stories and mark them as questionable. The company also intends to investigate stories that become viral in suspicious ways.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied after the presidential election that fake news played a role in the outcome.The Washington Post reported last month that Russia was not only linked to Internet hacking to manipulate the American election, but also created and grossly magnified the spread of fake online news wildly favorable to Donald Trump."

A coalition of progressive groups organized the “December 19” protests throughout the day at state capitols. Demonstrators hope to appeal to members of the Electoral College, who meet Monday to cast their votes for president. “We will be there to remind them of their Constitutional duty to deliberate, vote their conscience, and stop Donald Trump,” organizers said on a Facebook event page. Twelve protesters were arrested for blocking traffic outside the state capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ahead of the state’s Electoral College meeting, according to PennLive.Protesters gathered in other states as well, including Michigan, Virginia, Utah and Texas.Trump would receive 306 Electoral College votes if election results stand. To win, a candidate needs a majority of electoral college votes, or 270. For weeks, there have been calls for electors to “vote their conscience” and select anyone other than Trump as president, fueled by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton winning an overwhelming majority of the popular vote and allegations of Russian interference in the election.A group of celebrities made a video appealing to electors, saying anyone who broke their pledge to vote against Trump would go down in history as an “American hero.” An online petition amassed 4.9 million signatures. Though faithless electors would be breaking the law in some states, a Harvard Law School professor spearheaded an effort to offer them legal services, and activist Michael Moore promised to pay any fees they incur for refusing to vote for Trump.Moore has been one of the most vocal backers of the protests.“This needs protest, this needs people’s voices,” Moore told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes in an interview this weekend. “Don’t say to yourself, ‘Well, what’s the use? How do we ― nothing’s going to happen.’ You don’t know that. You don’t know that. That’s why we have to keep fighting. We have to fight all the way to Inauguration Day and then be ready for them to start the day after the inauguration passing law after law after law.” Protesters also gathered and held candlelight vigils in some states Sunday.One Republican elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, said earlier this month that he would not vote for Trump. However, no others have joined him publicly, and there’s little reason to believe that enough electors will withhold votes from Trump to change the election results. AP interviews with more than 330 electors found “little appetite for revolt.” "
14,POLITICS,North Carolina Legislature Set To Repeal HB2,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/repeal-hb2_us_58580107e4b0b3ddfd8d9100,The legislature is expected to meet for a special session Wednesday.,2016-12-19,North Carolina Gov.-elect Roy Cooper (D) said the state GOP leaders in the legislature have promised to repeal HB2.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585802ff1c000011070ec4b5.jpeg?cache=UTEGcnJhDR&ops=crop_0_125_3500_2364%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has called for the state legislature to meet in a special session Wednesday to take up the repeal of HB2, the controversial law that barred anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. The announcement came in response to the Charlotte City Council’s surprise unanimous vote Monday morning to rescind its ordinance providing LGBT protections. The council passed its ordinance in February, which angered the GOP-controlled legislature and prompted it to pass a law invalidating the measure. HB2 barred cities and localities from enacting anti-discrimination policies that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; it also prevented schools from allowing transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity, rather than the gender assigned to them at birth. It essentially invalidated Charlotte’s ordinance.Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) and city council members had rejected a similar deal earlier in the year, according to the Charlotte Observer. But the situation has now changed, with Roy Cooper ― a Democrat who supports LGBT rights ― set to take over the governorship.Roberts argued that the vote Monday morning “should in no way be viewed as a compromise of our principles or commitment to non-discrimination,” and said she viewed the new opportunity as the first real chance to repeal HB2. Cooper first announced news of the special session Monday morning, saying that GOP leaders assured him they would meet this week.In a video message Monday afternoon, McCrory announced his plans for the special session and blasted Cooper and Roberts. “I have always publicly advocated a repeal of the overreaching Charlotte ordinance,” McCrory said. “But those efforts were blocked by Jennifer Roberts, Roy Cooper and other Democratic activists. This sudden reversal with little notice after the gubernatorial election has ended sadly proves this entire issue, originated by the political left, was all about politics at the expense of Charlotte and the entire state of North Carolina.”In a joint statement, state Senate Leader Phil Berger (R) and House Speaker Tim Moore (R) echoed McCrory, saying they were always prepared to consider repealing HB2 if Charlotte rescinded its ordinance. They also criticized Cooper for taking credit for their decision, saying his and Roberts’ “efforts to force men into women’s bathrooms and shower facilities was a political stunt to drive out-of-state money into the governor’s race.”“For months, we’ve said if Charlotte would repeal its bathroom ordinance that created the problem, we would take up the repeal of HB2,” they said. “But Roy Cooper is not telling the truth about the legislature committing to call itself into session ― we’ve always said that was Gov. McCrory’s decision, and if he calls us back, we will be prepared to act. For Cooper to say otherwise is a dishonest and disingenuous attempt to take credit.”Cooper’s Monday morning statement indicates that he may push for statewide protections for sexual orientation and gender identity when he takes office. And Charlie Reece, a Democratic member of the Durham City Council, said he expects cities may pass new nondiscrimination ordinances of their own after the legislature repeals HB2 ― although he added that he was troubled by the “deal” and how it would affect the transgender community.“LGBT rights aren’t a bargaining chip. Charlotte shouldn’t have had to repeal its ordinance in exchange for H.B. 2 to be repealed,” said Simone Bell, the southern regional director for Lambda Legal. “LGBT people in North Carolina still need protection from discrimination. The right action is for the North Carolina Legislature to pass a statewide comprehensive civil rights bill that includes full protections for LGBT people,” The backlash to HB2 has been fierce, causing headaches for GOP leaders who supported the law. PayPal scrapped plans to expand its business to Charlotte, resulting in a loss of 400 jobs for the city and state. Business leaders spoke out against the law, and sports and entertainment events were pulled from the state in protest. The NCAA pulled seven of its championship games from North Carolina after the state passed HB2. In a statement Monday, it said it was heartened to see that the law may be repealed and would be open to possibly hosting future events in the state again.In November, Cooper defeated McCrory, whose loss was attributed in large part to the heat he took over HB2. McCrory conceded on Dec. 5, after a month of wrangling and raising unproven theories about fraud and other problems.In response, the GOP-controlled legislature pushed through legislation to take away powers from the incoming Democratic governor. McCrory signed the bills last week.This piece has been updated with additional comments and details about the special session.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

15,POLITICS,Appeals Court Deals Rebuke To Controversial Prosecutor Who Targeted Aaron Swartz,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/appeals-court-carmen-ortiz-aaron-swartz_us_585856bce4b0b3ddfd8e571b,"U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz's office ""overstepped its bounds"" in pursuing federal charges, the ruling said.",2016-12-19,"Carmen Ortiz, the U.S. Attorney for the district of Massachusetts, has drawn criticism for overzealous prosecutions.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5858588b1800002d00e438b9.jpeg?cache=q433aoyR3N&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal appeals panel on Monday overturned the 2014 convictions of three former Massachusetts probation officials accused of running a patronage-based hiring system, saying the prosecution had “overstepped its bounds.”The ruling by a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit is a major setback for Carmen Ortiz, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, who many legal experts have accused of overly aggressive prosecutions, notably in her pursuit of internet entrepreneur Aaron Swartz. Denied a plea deal that would have spared him prison time and allowed him use of a computer after his release, Swartz committed suicide in January 2013.First Circuit Judge Juan Torruella wrote in an opinion for the majority that the hiring scheme of the probation officials ― John O’Brien, Elizabeth Tavares and William Burke ― failed to meet the legal standard for racketeering conspiracy or mail fraud.“Although the actions of the defendants may well be judged distasteful, and even contrary to Massachusetts’s personnel laws, the function of this Court is limited to determining whether they violated the federal criminal statutes charged,” Torruella wrote. “We find that the Government overstepped its bounds in using federal criminal statutes to police the hiring practices of these Massachusetts state officials and did not provide sufficient evidence to establish a criminal violation of Massachusetts law under the Government’s theory of the case.”Legal experts told The Huffington Post in July that Ortiz’s office had inappropriately used federal law to prosecute the case of state-level hiring. What O’Brien and his colleagues did, former federal judge Nancy Gertner said at the time, “is American politics and not a crime.”Ortiz, who President Barack Obama appointed as a federal prosecutor in 2009, will likely lose her post after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Incoming presidents from a different party than their predecessors almost always appoint new federal prosecutors.Ortiz’ office was “disappointed” with the decision, and “will continue to fulfill our responsibility to protect the public from corrupt officials by vigorously investigating and prosecuting public corruption in appropriate cases,” spokeswoman Christina Sterling said in an email. She noted that the appeals panel agreed the government had provided evidence the defendants abused the hiring process.That this particular conviction fell apart as Ortiz’ career as a prosecutor heads to a close has a certain irony to it.Ortiz went after officials in Massachusetts Office of the Commissioner of Probation for what she charged was patronage-based hiring on behalf of state legislators who controlled the office’s purse strings. But when she went after Swartz, her lead prosecutor was Stephen Heymann, who bungled the case from start to finish. Heymann happens to be he son of a powerful figure in the legal community, former deputy state attorney general Philip Heymann, who is now the James Barr Ames professor of law at Harvard.Although Heymann may be qualified, his widely criticized handling of the Swartz case and his family background raises the appearance of nepotism. Harvey Silverglate, a criminal defense attorney critical of Ortiz, said he doesn’t believe that Heymann, who he described as an experienced prosecutor, is a beneficiary of patronage.But Ortiz was, Silverglate argued. President Barack Obama appointed her at the recommendation of the late-Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).“Nobody questions that ― and the reason nobody questions that is that this is the way it’s been done: the senior senator of the same party as the U.S. president gets to appoint the U.S attorney,” Silverglate said.“She is almost certain to be replaced by Trump because these are patronage hires,” he added.Ryan Grim contributed reporting.This article has been updated to include a comment from Ortiz’ spokeswoman.Clarification: Language has been amended to reflect more accurately the status of Swartz’s case at the time of his death."

Russian media reported that the victims were poor residents of Irkutsk, a hard scrabble city around 2,600 miles (4,000 km) east of Moscow.The case underlines how hard up a large swath of the population is despite Moscow’s growing profile and clout on the global stage.“It is a terrible tragedy,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “This type of problem is well known and the president has been informed. Measures must be taken.”Russia’s Investigative Committee sent a group of experienced investigators from Moscow, while Russian news agencies said the mayor of Irkutsk had declared a state of emergency and temporarily banned the sale of all liquids containing spirits not meant for human consumption.“According to our latest data 41 of 57 people who were hosptialised after drinking the liquid have died,” investigators said in a statement. “More than 2,000 units of the liquid have been confiscated with an overall volume of 500 liters.”Among liquids that have been used as a substitute for alcoholic drinks are perfume, after-shave, anti-freeze and window cleaner.‘DEADLIER THAN TERRORISM’Alexei Navalny, a Kremlin critic who wants to challenge Vladimir Putin for the presidency in 2018, said the case had garnered wide attention because so many people had died at the same time. Hundreds of people, he said, died unremarked every day in unrelated cases for the same reason.“The problem .... for Russia and its national security is roughly a thousand times more important than Syria, Aleppo, Ukraine and Trump put together,” said Navalny, blaming poverty and corruption for the sale of such toxic surrogates.“Every year ... (such concoctions) kill more people than have been killed in terrorist attacks in Russia’s entire history.”Investigators, who opened a criminal case into the poisonings, said they had detained two people suspected of distributing the deadly bath oil. The product carried a warning saying it should not be swallowed, but investigators said people had ignored that and consumed it as if it was alcohol.The bath oil contained methylated spirit, they said, a toxic substance found in cleaning materials and paint stripper.Police said they had found the workshop where the bath oil, called Hawthorn, was being produced alongside bootleg vodka.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said he wanted to look at banning products that could cause so many deaths and that the country’s criminal code was being amended to toughen the punishment for people caught selling them.Alcohol market expert Vadim Drobiz says up to 12 million Russians, or about one twelfth of the population, drink cheap surrogate alcohol."

The IMF said its executive board was meeting on Monday to consider the implications of the ruling.The board has consistently voiced confidence in her ability to lead the crisis lender effectively as the case wound its way towards trial over the past five years.But a shift in its view could prompt a new IMF leadership crisis. Lagarde’s predecessor, Dominique Strauss Kahn, resigned in 2011 over a sexual assault scandal.The French government, which controls about 4 percent of the IMF board’s voting power, said it had complete confidence in Lagarde’s ability to carry out her responsibilities.Lagarde was back on the job in Washington on Monday, phoning Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to commend him on a decision to nationalize a troubled bank.In Monday’s ruling, the judges did not find negligence in Lagarde’s decision to seek an out-of-court settlement with tycoon Bernard Tapie. But they said her failure to contest the award to him of about 400 million euros ($417 million) was negligent, and led to a misuse of public funds.“The context of the global financial crisis in which Madame Lagarde found herself in should be taken into account,” Martine Ract Madoux, the main judge on the case, said in explaining the absence of any sentence.She also cited Lagarde’s good reputation and international standing as reasons why the court did not hand down a punishment. The charge against Lagarde could have carried a sentence of up to a year in prison.Lagarde, whom IMF members reappointed in February, has won respect from global finance leaders for pushing governments to do more to boost economic growth and helping to include China’s yuan in the fund’s currency basket.Lagarde’s lawyer, Patrick Maisonneuve, said immediately after the ruling that his team would look into appealing the decision. Though an appeal could clear her name, it could also turn out worse for Lagarde since she was not given a sentence.“Since Madame Lagarde was not sentenced, I wonder about whether to appeal or not to the highest court,” Maisonneuve told reporters outside the court.Lagarde, who described the case as a five-year ordeal for her, argued in the trial last week that she had acted in good faith, and with the public interest in mind.She said she had signed off on the arbitration - against the advice of some Finance Ministry officials - to end a costly 15-year-old legal battle between the government and Tapie, a supporter of then-President Nicolas Sarkozy.The case dates back to a time when Tapie sued the French state for compensation after selling his stake in sports company Adidas to then state-owned Credit Lyonnais in 1993.He accused the bank of defrauding him after it resold its stake for a much higher price. With the case stuck in the courts, the two sides agreed to a private settlement and Tapie was awarded a 403 million euro payout, including interest and damages.The case was only the fifth ever heard by a special French court created in 1993 to try government ministers. The court of 15 judges, including 12 lawmakers, has never handed down a firm prison sentence."

They declined to comment on the potential motive.Two of the three men ― aged 30, 35 and 56 ― were seriously injured in the attack shortly after 5:30 p.m. local time (1630 GMT) near the main train station in Switzerland’s financial capital, Zurich police said.A third sustained less severe injuries. All three were brought to hospital.The unidentified suspect, a man around 30 years old who according to witnesses was wearing dark clothing and a dark wool cap, fled the mosque, police said.Police said a body was found nearby but would not comment on any link to the shootings while investigations continued.People at the scene told Reuters the Islamic Center on Zurich’s Eisgasse was used as a mosque, often by Somalis.“We never once had a problem,” said Abukar Abshirow, a Somali who said he was a regular worshipper at the center that attracted Muslims from around the world.“We never had anyone come and say why are you here. We never had that,” Abshirow said. He said the three victims were Somalis.Two thirds of Switzerland’s 8.3 million residents identify as Christian but the nation has been wrestling with the role of Islam as its Muslim population has risen to 5 percent, swelled by the arrival of immigrants from the former Yugoslavia.In 2009, a nationwide vote backed a constitutional ban on new minarets.The Federation of Islamic Organisations in Switzerland said the center was not a member and it did not have any direct knowledge of the incident."

Chip Michalove, who captured both sharks with his crew from Outcast Sport Fishing, called the bigger shark the “largest White I’ve seen out there.” “It happened so fast. We were talking about what to do with her and all the sudden she ripped out 400 yards of line,” he told The Island Packet. “She was so big I don’t think she even knew she was hooked.”Unfortunately, he said, the shark escaped before the crew was able to tag her.“We were just crushed, we were heartbroken and we almost went in,” Michalove told local outlet WJCL TV. “We almost said, ‘You know what, we’re calling it a day,’ but we got reset up and a few minutes later we got another one.”A photo posted to Outcast Fishing Sports’ Facebook page shows the smaller of the two sea creatures being partially hauled out of the water. The crew attached a small sound-emitting device to the male shark, then released it.South Carolina’s coast appears to be a popular hangout for great white sharks, according to OCEARCH, a group that tags and tracks the animals. A 16-foot great white known as Mary Lee weighs nearly 3,500 pounds, and has been seen zigzagging in the waters between Charleston and Savannah, Georgia, in recent days.Yeti, an 11-foot female great white, was also tracked last week off Savannah’s coast.

None of the KKK members participating in the show hide their identity in any way. Regardless of the show’s intent, broadcasting views of an extremist group to a potential audience of millions of people allows for the dangerous possibility that “Generation KKK” normalizes the very real and hateful attitudes of KKK members. “We certainly didn’t want the show to be seen as a platform for the views of the KKK,” Rob Sharenow, general manager of A&E, said in an interview with The New York Times. “The only political agenda is that we really do stand against hate.”Sharenow added, “I certainly think that A&E should be on the side of shining a light on things that aren’t really looked at. I wouldn’t go so far as to say we’re an advocacy brand. But I do think there’s a message of hope in all these shows and a promise of redemption.” The timing of the show is both uncanny and troubling. Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke publicly endorsed president-elect Donald Trump, as did the KKK’s official newspaper, the Crusader. Members of the hate group held a parade celebrating Trump’s victory in North Carolina, while onlookers shouted “White Power!” at the cars driving by. Various news reports have come out since the Nov. 8 election describing an uptick in hate crimes."

Turner registered as a sex offender four days after he was released from a California jail for good behavior after serving half his term.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An embattled California judge did nothing wrong sentencing an ex-Stanford University athlete to just six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, a state judicial panel said Monday. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky committed no misconduct with his punishment in June for former swimmer Brock Turner, now 21, the Commission on Judicial Performance said. Persky’s lenient sentence sparked a storm of criticism, including a movement to force him off the bench. Turner was credited with good behavior in jail and served less than three months. “The commission has concluded that there is not clear and convincing evidence of bias, abuse of authority, or other basis to conclude that Judge Persky engaged in judicial misconduct warranting discipline,” the six-person commission wrote.” [T]he sentence was within the parameters set by law and was therefore within the judge’s discretion.”Persky’s sentencing considered the impact on the 22-year-old victim and on Turner, and it was in line with a probation report’s recommendation, the commission said. Turner was convicted of three felony sexual assault charges in March and had faced a maximum of 14 years behind bars. Prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence for Turner, who testimony showed abused the intoxicated woman behind a dumpster before two students intervened.Persky, opting for a short term in a county jail, said he worried prison might have a “severe impact” on Turner. The commission stressed that it did not examine whether Turner’s sentence was the appropriate length of time.“The commission is not a reviewing court ― it has no power to reverse judicial decisions or to direct any court to do so ― irrespective of whether the commission agrees or disagrees with a judge’s decision,” the commission said in its 12-page report. “It is not the role of the commission to discipline judges for judicial decisions unless bad faith, bias, abuse of authority, disregard for fundamental rights, intentional disregard of the law, or any purpose other than the faithful discharge of judicial duty is established by clear and convincing evidence.” The victim wrote a powerful letter to the court criticizing her assailant ahead of the sentencing, and it attracted widespread public support. A letter from Turner’s father struck a discordant tone, arguing his son’s life shouldn’t be ruined for “20 minutes of action.”More than 1.2 million signed a petition calling for Persky’s removal from the bench, and thousands of complaints about his handling of the case reached the commission. Critics began looking at other cases Persky handled and alleged they had found additional bias. The scrutiny led Persky to request a reassignment to civil cases.A group opposing Persky said it disagreed with the commission’s findings and said the report contained factual errors about Persky’s previous cases. Recall Judge Aaron Persky campaign chairwoman Michele Dauber told HuffPost that the group would continue to press for a recall vote on next year’s ballot. “This report simply highlights what we have been saying from the beginning, which is that a petition for judicial discipline was not the correct venue to address these concerns, and the recall is the only realistic way to remove Judge Persky from office,” Dauber said. “Under the California constitution, Judge Persky is an elected official and voters have the right to decide whether he should continue to serve on the bench for the next six years.” Persky was not immediately available for comment.

He is a former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where he began his financial services career, and is a leader in electronic trading, according to his company biography.“Whether it is his distinguished military service or highly impressive track record in the world of business, Vinnie has proved throughout his life that he knows how to be a leader and deliver major results in the face of any challenge,” Trump was quoted as saying in a transition team statement.After the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.Born to Italian immigrant parents in Brooklyn, Viola was the first in his family to attend college. He trained as an Airborne Ranger infantry officer and served in the 101st Airborne Division, the transition team statement said.”If confirmed, I will work tirelessly to provide our president with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy,” Viola said in the statement. “A primary focus of my leadership will be ensuring that America’s soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict.”Trump met with Viola on Friday as the Republican president-elect considers candidates for top posts in his administration, which begins on Jan. 20. Trump has yet to nominate people for Cabinet positions including secretaries of agriculture and veterans affairs and the U.S. trade representative.In 2014, Virtu Financial received a letter of inquiry from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman as part of a wider probe of high-speed trading firms that came amid heightened attention to such trading after the publication of author Michael Lewis’ book “Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt.”Virtu ended up postponing its initial public offering that year as it awaited regulatory approval.

The private pack has accompanied Trump on his tour of “thank you” rallies, where the bodyguards have roughly ejected protesters from venues. The private security team is led by Trump supporter and registered Republican Keith Schiller, a retired New York cop, who was videotaped during the presidential campaign apparently punching a protester who was trying to retrieve protest signs Schiller had ripped from his hands. That incident sparked a lawsuit by five protesters against Schiller, other members of the security team and Trump.Read the full Politico report.In a conference call with reporters on Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller called the Politico story “complete nonsense,” and said it was “blowing [the issue] out of proportion.” But he also said Trump would continue to be surrounded by longtime supporters like Schiller, “who has been an absolute fantastic ally.”The Trump camp did not immediately return a request for clarification on whether that meant Schiller’s team would provide security for Trump after the inauguration. Schiller, who had headed security for the Trump Organization since 2004, is a deeply partisan Trump promoter who frequently posts retweets praising his boss and denigrating Trump’s political rivals, including one tweet calling President Barack Obama a “criminal president.”Some security experts told Politico that Trump’s decision may not only endanger law-abiding protesters, but Trump as well if the private bodyguards and Secret Service clash and the line of command is muddied.Combining private security with the Secret Service “increases the Service’s liability, it creates greater confusion and it creates greater risk,” former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow told the outlet.Presidential candidates sometimes use private security, but it’s unprecedented for a president to use any security other than that provided by the Secret Service or police departments for local events. But Trump actually increased payment for his private security force after the election, and spent more than $1 million of campaign funds on his bodyguards, according to Politico.The Secret Service is also guarding Trump and will continue to do so. The Secret Service will likely continue to pay rent for an entire floor in Trump Tower in Manhattan where the president-elect is still living and may maintain a residence even after he becomes president. Rent could be as high as $1.5 million a year.It’s still unclear how much New York City will end up paying for its share of the policing bill. Mayor Bill DeBlasio has demanded federal reimbursement for some $35 million in security costs.A New York Police Department official called it “unfair” that Congress appears to be dragging its feet on the issue. So far only $7 million of the requested funds have been approved, according to Deputy Commissioner John Miller. The city was “obviously disappointed,” Miller told AM 970 in New York."

From turkey and ham to vegetarian and vegan dishes, many of us will enjoy sustainably grown and responsibly harvested food from local farms and ranches across the country. By all accounts, “farm to table” is front and center this holiday season.The local food sector is valued at $12 billion and is growing 9 percent a year. However, our farmers are getting older, and we’re losing family farms to development. Sales of organic products saw double digit growth last year to $43 billion. That’s five percent of all food sales. However, only 1 percent of our land base is certified organic. And it may be too costly for farmers to increase that land base significantly. If we’re to be successful, we need to focus on a system-wide approach that includes land conservation, the farmers and ranchers, and markets. And if we want to really move the needle, we’re going to need leadership from business—and all of us as customers—to help drive change. We need to help address the lack of supply at scale.Unfortunately, many of our working lands are at risk; small and mid-sized farms are disappearing fast. In the next five years, more than 90 million acres of farmland will be sold because of changing demographics. That’s 10 percent of U.S. farmland up for sale—twice the size of the state of Missouri. Who will buy these farms? Who will grow our food?Consider the following: A 2015 study by the Farmland Information Center showed that states invested $105 million in one year to protect farm and ranch land but spent $108 billion—about 1,000 times more—on highways. In order to protect the farmer, we’ve learned you need to protect the land. And often, that also requires investing in entrepreneurs who can grow the market to keep up with rising demand.For example, since 1993, The Conservation Fund has provided more than $22 million in bridge financing to local land trusts to conserve 100 family farms. In New England, that equates to 10,000 acres of permanently protected farmland across the Connecticut River Valley. These lands provide fresh fruits and vegetables to Boston Public Market, a 28,000-square foot permanent, year-round indoor market providing only locally-sourced food to the public, the first of its kind in the country. On the West Coast, Lundberg Family Farms is a third generation family farm whose motto is simple: “leave the land better than you found it.” In the 1930’s Albert Lundberg witnessed the Dustbowl that resulted from poor soil management and short-sighted farming techniques. After moving the family to Northern California’s fertile Sacramento Valley, he impressed upon his four sons the need to care for the soil.Today, Lundberg Family Farm’s Certified Organic and Eco-Farmed rice is grown with a concern for the environment. In addition to operating a sustainable farm, the company is keenly aware of the connection between working lands, sustainability and its customers.It’s a recognition that sustainability and common sense need to go hand in hand.The same thinking must be applied to seafood production. By 2050 we will need to double the global food supply to feed the world’s population. In the U.S., much of our seafood is a far cry from local; more than 90 percent is imported. We need access to high-quality, healthy and locally-sourced seafood so we can provide for our families and put less pressure on our oceans. To meet this challenge, The Freshwater Institute is pioneering technology, research and development to redefine fish farming—on land—to provide fresh, locally grown fish. It has developed a sustainable system and fish feed that does not use wild-caught fish meal. Fish are not treated with antibiotics or hormones, and the technology can be used anywhere. When it comes to the rise of local and organic food, we can choose to make a change for good. We need to preserve the land that food is grown on, support the farmers and businesses that grow, process, and distribute our food, and strengthen the markets that serve local communities across the country. As we reflect with family and friends during this holiday season, let’s continue to build on this progress so that future generations can enjoy even better access to local, healthy food than we do today."

The misogyny she was subjected to on that long, grueling, insulting campaign represented the everyday sexism we’ve become accustomed to, but magnified a thousand-fold on the world stage. Hillary personified every promotion we’d ever been passed over for, every time we were paid less than our male counterparts, the objectification, the mansplaining, the double standards, and it hurt. The spirit of activism had been awoken in all of us.So a group of female community leaders, advocates and campaigners came together in New York for a Town Hall to discuss our primary concerns, including reproductive rights, immigration, political parity and workplace equality. We shared our stories, our ideas, our fears, our hopes and most importantly, a concrete way forward. It was a magical evening where the women present focused on bolstering one another, and where the hashtag #womenstandup went viral on Twitter. Each participant ended her speech with a call to action, summarized below. Everyone can do something. There are no wrong answers. The problems may seem insurmountable but it’s the millions of individual micro-actions that add up to the whole. To quote Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men (or women) to do nothing.”Don’t Agonize, Organize“We are at the beginning of the next great transformational movement and one day we’ll look back and thank Hillary Clinton for exposing all the ugly in America so we could finally address it. Pick one concern that is essential for you and get behind it fully. Find an organization that advocates for that issue and become a member. We have learned the price of passivity!” Tanya Selvaratnam, Founder, Humanity For Hillary.Speak Up On Behalf Of The Most Vulnerable There’s been a dramatic uptick in race hate attacks since the election, with numerous reported incidents of people being harassed on subways, in restaurants, at schools and on the streets, while those around them often turn a blind eye. Our role going forward is to fight for those who don’t have adequate status or protection.“This election was so painful for so many. We lost something as a nation. Never forget the punches and the fights that Hillary took on behalf of all of us. If you feel like you didn’t do enough and you could have done more, now’s your shot.” Reshma Saujani, Founder, Girls Who Code.Run For Office Or Encourage A Friend To Seek Elected Leadership“The US is 99th in the world in terms of government representation of women and we made no notable gains in this election, from Town Council all the way to Congress. There are 500,000 elected offices in our country and women need to step up and run for these positions. The good news is that the number of enquiries we’ve received at She Should Run has increased dramatically post election, from 100 a month up to 4500! Join us as a potential candidate or as a supporter, as we work to change the face of government.“ Erin Loos Cutraro, Co-Founder and CEO, She Should Run.“Hillary cultivated and nurtured so many women. Encourage the powerful women in your lives to push themselves forward and run for elected positions. Get a seat at the table, fix what’s wrong and think about your plan of succession for the next woman.” De’Ara Balenger, Former Director of Engagement, Hillary For America.Speak More Broadly And Openly About Reproductive Rights And Help Destigmatize Abortion“Having a baby is the most important financial decision a woman will ever make and over 50% of women who get abortions already have children. Let’s talk more openly about abortion but also discuss reproductive rights in a broader context, in relation to motherhood, sex education, miscarriage, pregnancy, fertility, menopause, birth control and the choice not to have children.” Sarah Sophie Flicker, Activist, Producer.“Planned Parenthood serves 2.5m patients a year, many for basic healthcare. The majority of patients are on Medicaid and 70% fall below poverty line. 50% of patients are people of color and we serve a lot of young women. Talk to your friends and family and use your influence to encourage them to rethink the way they perceive the organization.” Alencia Johnson, Director, Constituency Communications, Planned Parenthood.Follow And Support The State Reproductive Rights Battles“The Supreme Court has recognized for 40 years that we have the right to abortions. We should not and will not go back. There are big battles ahead. The states are emboldened and we’re going to see an increase in restrictions. Follow the state battles as well as the big fights in Washington. Know what’s happening and support where you can by donating, making your voice heard publicly and calling your legislator.” Zoe Levine, Litigator, Center For Reproductive Rights.Open Up Your Homes And Communities As Sanctuaries To Immigrants On The Front Line “A large proportion of the US workforce is made up of women who go to work every day in our homes, looking after our kids or our aging parents. Care giving is the fastest growing occupation and some of the most undervalued work in our economy. Theirs is the work that makes all other work possible. The majority are immigrants and half are undocumented and face the imminent threat of deportation. Support the We Belong Together campaign and join our Jan 14 National Day Of Action.” Ai-jen Poo, Director, National Domestic Workers Alliance.Step Up Into Leadership Roles“All around the world, there are groups of men sitting around tables making decisions that impact all our lives and these men are largely male, white, straight and wealthy. The biggest crisis we face today is a crisis of leadership. Please don’t say I don’t have the time or the bandwidth. Right now, we just don’t have the luxury of not being leaders. Think about the highest level you can attain in your profession or by using your expertize, and go after it. You are America’s potential.” Tiffany Dufu, Chief Leadership Officer, Levo League.Say What You Really Think And Ask For What You Really Want“We need to be seen as women who want positions of power because when we’re not up there, there’s a received wisdom that says we don’t want it. Your value to your business or employer is in your unique perspectives and insights. So start out by saying what you really think, in meetings, in offices and in public forums and see how dramatic the difference will be. Demand the highest salary you can and use that money to fund and support other women. And finally, talk about sex to help encourage good sexual values. Sexual harassment manages too many women out of the workplace.” Cindy Gallop, Founder IfWeRanTheWorld, MakeLoveNotPorn.Create Safe Spaces For People To Be HeardThe election results and particularly the fact that 53% of white women voted for Trump exposed the cracks in our supposed share values. Start having real and open conversations with those around you especially those who don’t share your political views. Host gatherings and invite people all of races, cultures, socio economic classes and sexual orientations, and talk, listen more deeply, and really hear one another.“Whenever women gather, affirm that what happens in the room is sacred and important. Show each other value and respect.” Cleo Wade, Poet, Artist.Use Your Brand Power As A Force For Good“For those of us who primarily hire and target women, this is no longer business as usual. How do we speak through our brands with inclusion? How do we redefine beauty for our customers and think more mindfully about who we cast in our advertising campaigns? This is the beginning of a journey.” Mara Hoffman, Entrepreneur, Designer.Thank you to Rachel Sklar, Co-Founder of The List and musician Sophie Auster for inspiring us with humor and song, and to Norma Kamali for her wisdom."

For me though, this is the time of year that I’m overbooked, underdressed, I’m on the verge of a thrilling cold-flu combo, I’ve often eaten too much and yet I still stand directly next to snacks table, and I very much would like a drink. If one drink could solve all of my needs, it would be strong, medicinal, hot and easy.It’s a hot whiskey. It’s just whiskey, boiling water, lemon juice, and honey, stirred around. You can add in a bag of tea, if the spirit moves you. Other warmed-over alcohols may be offered to you — a mulled wine, a fermented apple juice — by the ladleful. Resist. Hot whiskey is for you.A hot whiskey doesn’t suffer fools. Each component has a purpose. Booze to relax, Vitamin C to cure, honey to sooth, heat to nuzzle your soul via your esophagus. It’s efficient, it’s powerful, it’s good at its job. They’re also called hot toddies, but that sounds too derpy to describe their sturdy citric vibe. Tell me that you wouldn’t bet on a racehorse named Hot Whiskey, without even hearing the other horse’s names.Hot whiskeys are seasonal but not festive. You have enough of the festive in your life right now, trust me. You could use contact with something direct and slightly astringent and dietetic.The labor and allspice berry quantity that go into preparing a hot apple cider or mulled wine necessitates a large product. You don’t need to wash another pot. You make hot whiskeys right in the mug. It doesn’t have to boil for an ambiguous amount of time. It doesn’t fill the kitchen with a warm humid fog of boiling fermented fruits. Also, let’s not drink things from vats anymore. We are not quadrupeds. We can do better than a trough.With hot whiskeys, you free yourself from a tide of tiny floating drink detritus. Why must the other seasonal warm beverage offers have so many floating and inedible pieces? Cloves and cinnamon sticks and cardamom pods and orange peels. We can’t rely on cheesecloths to catch everything, and this is not the time of year that we should fishing out an errant star anise from our drinks with our grimy flu-hands.Beware the hot alcohol that serves as an excuse for masking B-list boozes. Hot sake is usually reserved for lower quality or older sake, because flavors and aroma are lost in the heat. Because we are comfort-seeking creatures, heat can fool us that something is better than it is. I once rented an apartment that was too expensive because it was winter and the landlord turned up the heat to show the place, which is a common trick. We are all older and smarter now. Don’t use temperature to distract yourself from a bad thing. Just don’t have the bad thing.Hot whiskeys are worthy of good whiskey because it’s the main event. I’m into Larceny bourbon right now, if you’d like a rec. The heat in a hot whiskey is also necessary. You need it to melt the honey. It’s an alchemical process that turns desperation ingredients into a liquid gold tincture.One of the best parts of an apple cider is its specific crisp effervescence. The heat drives this right out. Where did you go lovely tiny bubbles? Did an indiscriminate application of heat scare the life right out of you?Most emphatically, you did nothing to deserve mulled wine. With apologies to Marissa Ross, who has recommended what I am sure is the only delicious mulled wine recipe on this continent, but also wrote that mulled wine is usually “an easy way to get rid of wine otherwise deemed undrinkable.”Any person who has read one gentle Wine Spectator article that shamed them about storing their wine on top of their fridge will tell you that heat is wine’s sworn enemy. People buy well-lit little fridges solely to prevent their wine from “cooking.” The translations for mulled wine in other languages shine a bright light on the truth of this beverage: “boiled wine” in Czech, in Italy, “burnt wine.”What’s more, I just learned that mulled wine’s greatest fan and advocate was a “notorious baron” from the 15th century named Gilles de Rais. He drank several bottles of mulled wine every day and he insisted that his many victims drink it prior to assaulting them. It all sounds very archaic and sloppy. Mulled wine was at its most popular in the medieval era, where it should remain, along with all the notorious barons.From the moment it was translated into written culture, mulled wine was described as a crap deal. An original written recipe for mulled wine, from Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management, dated to 1869, undercuts its very premise: “It is very difficult to give the exact proportions of ingredients like sugar and spice, as what quantity might suit one person would be to another quite distasteful.” Perhaps, if we cannot recommend a concrete recipe for a tasteful version of mulled wine, it’s all quite distasteful? Just a modern thought.Another common hot booze staple was also built to fail — the Irish coffee, which I believe is the PSL of hot alcohol. A chef on board a Pan Am Flying Boat invented Irish coffees to distract a group of miserable, cold Americans. Of course, Irish coffee was invented on a flying boat. Like a Pan Am’s seaworthy airplane, Irish coffee is trying to do two things at once (buzz you up, turn you down) and really makes some sacrifices in order to accomplish both. It was a good idea, but it just didn’t work out, not like the perfect hot whiskey, the most golden of the drinks, therapeutic and celebratory, the natural multitasker, your winter ally of the first order.More from Bon Appetit:32 Fall-Spiced Recipes You’ll Be Making All Season When Life Hands You Lemons, Make These Lemon Desserts No-Cook Pasta Sauces You Should Have Up Your Sleeve at All Times 35 Make-Ahead Breakfasts so You Can Sleep in and Eat Well All WeekOur 50 Favorite Weeknight Dinners24 Recipes Everyone Should Know How to Cook"

Number of Shareholder Proposals by topic in 2015 (among Fortune 250 companies)</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585845a11800001d00e43807.jpg?ops=crop_13_79_597_306%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As Donald Trump is about to walk into the Oval Office, questions loom over the future of the U.S. federal climate change policy. He denied the existence of man-made climate change, and argued—quite innovatively, I must admit—that the concept of climate change was plotted by the Chinese. His appointment of Scott Pruitt, a long-standing pro-fossil energy advocate and a denier of human-induced climate change, to the administrator post of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is quite consistent with his previous views. Although little is known about what the forthcoming administration will or will not do, it’s clear that the U.S. federal government under Trump won’t do much to fight climate change. But it never actually did. Over the last two decades, the U.S. Congress has been a graveyard of the bills that touch upon climate change mitigation: The McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act, The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, The Climate Protection Act of 2007, The Sustainable Energy Act, and The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 all died without any exceptions. Seeing no hope in new bills, the Obama administration turned to an existing one, the Clean Air Act (CAA), under which the EPA could launch the Clean Power Plan (CPP) that aims to limit greenhouse gas emissions from utility sectors. Earlier this year, however, the Supreme Court stayed the enactment of the Clean Power Plan until the lower court clears an appeal case. Having no regulatory power in its hands means that the U.S. federal government is essentially handcuffed when it comes to climate mitigation.To be fair, the Obama administration did show tremendous support and leadership in the process that gave birth to the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. The Obama administration also closed a historical bilateral climate agreement with China. The current administration certainly deserves due credit for such achievements. But signing climate agreements alone won’t stop climate change; it needs real and urgent action to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If not the federal government, who can step up to this tall order? Fortunately, state and local governments of the U.S. are still holding strong. In September of this year, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a landmark legislation, SB32, that requires the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% relative to 1990 level by 2030. Hawaii and Minnesota also set state-wide mitigation targets, and a similar proposal is on the table in the state of Washington. Many cities and municipalities have also pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In June, 2016 the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, which was joined by 609 cities that represent half a billion inhabitants, committed to reduce nearly 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalency. Rescuer with a deep pocketWhat is the most remarkable to me, however, is the emergence of the investment community in the picture of climate change mitigation. This unlikely rescuer of the planet is painting the corporate-climate change relationship very differently. But first, why do investors even care? Well, many investors see climate change as a risk factor—actual or perceived. Think about coastal real estate in Florida, for example. Coastal cities in Florida have been experiencing an average of about 4 flood events a year. But the frequency of flooding can ramp up to 240 times a year under climate change, according to climate models. Coastal real estate markets in those regions are already slowing down, and it can be further exacerbated as climate change continues. What is particularly frightening to investors is the fact that, unlike other boom-and-bust cycles that they are familiar with, the degradation of asset value driven by climate change does not have a prospect of rebound. It is not only coastal real estate that is at risk. See it this way: Citigroup reported that the loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to climate change can be as much as $44 trillion by mid-century. Some businesses will have to absorb the losses, and so will the investors who put their money to such businesses and assets. In the investment world, perceived risks are as important as, if not more important than, actual risks. Few scientific research papers would have been more chilling to the asset holders of fossil energy resources than the 2015 Nature paper, which showed that 80% of known coal, 30% of oil and 50% of natural gas reserves need to stay in the ground if the global community is serious about limiting the global mean temperature rise within 2 degree Celsius, which is widely seen as a requirement to avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change. It is unclear when, if ever, this will happen. But if so, fossil energy assets become ‘stranded’, and dramatic devaluation is inevitable. This paper came out when the UN-led global climate change negotiation was underway, the EPA was working on the Clean Power Plan, and when coal was struggling to compete with cheap natural gas from fracking. Amidst these series of events, Peabody Energy, the nation’s largest coal producer, filed for a chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. But it’s not only these investment firms and asset managers who should be worried. What may go under water or stay under the ground are not just coastal properties or fossil energy resources, but also your own money, be it your retirement funds or mutual fund. That’s why earlier this year the Church of England, which holds significant shares of ExxonMobil (who would have guessed!), pressed the company for more information disclosure on the risks of climate change. Around the same time, Financial Stability Board Chairman Mark Carney also called for additional scrutiny of firms’ climate change risks. But this is not a new trend. For more than a decade, CDP, a UK-based non-profit backed by institutional investors that handle over $100 trillion in combined assets, has been requesting large corporations and its suppliers to report how they are coping with the risks of climate change. What impact can investment community really make?While it seems clear why investors (and you) should be concerned about the potential risks of climate change to better protect the asset value, what does that really do in terms of an actual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions? This is the point where opinions often differ. Traditional Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) strategies focused on withdrawing funds from ‘bad’ sectors and reinvesting the funds to ‘good’ ones. Would such a strategy achieve any tangible greenhouse gas emissions reduction? Suppose that a climate risk-conscious or simply environmentally responsible investor divests from a fossil energy sector. But as long as the sector that they divest from generates healthy profits, there are plenty of other investors that will gladly take the slot, resulting in no meaningful difference in actual greenhouse gas emissions. It is certainly true that divestment from fossil energy industry and carbon intensive sectors sends a symbolic signal to the market. Though important, however, there is not enough evidence that such actions reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New breed of investors That’s why some of the socially responsible investors are exploring new strategies including (1) bilateral agreement, (2) targeted investment within sector, and (3) active engagement. See what Mr. Thomas DiNapoli can do. The comptroller of the New York State landed bilateral agreements with multiple corporations requiring them to report the steps toward reducing 80% of their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Although he does not have any of the regulatory sticks that state agencies do, DiNapoli has a big carrot: the Common Retirement Fund of the New York State, which many companies could see a good use for. Furthermore, he convinced Goldman Sachs to create a new investment fund that targets low greenhouse gas emitters within each sector, to which he tossed $2 billion. Investing in ‘good’ players within each sector rather than divesting from ‘bad’ sectors altogether is a very different and potentially a highly rewarding strategy. While sectoral portfolio management hardly produces any net change in the presence of other environmentally nonchalant investors around, targeted investment within each sector can transform the environmental profile of the sector itself. The most interesting SRI strategy of all to me is what I call the Trojan approach. Some of the new SRI firms are not necessarily drawing their funds from greenhouse gas intensive businesses; in fact, they actively invest in such businesses, instead. Why? You can’t catch the tiger’s cub unless you are to step into its cave, as an old maxim says. Hermes EOS, a prominent Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing firm, for example, has been actively investing in extractive companies such as Shell and Rio Tinto, which were the primary divestment targets of traditional SRI portfolio managers. The firm then participated in the decision-making process of those companies to change them from within. Hermes EOS is not alone in this game. The Principles of Responsible Investing (PRI), a coalition of about 1,500 institutional investors including major banks and fund management firms that manages over $60 trillion in asset, operates an ‘Engagement Team’ that facilitates company-investor engagements on social and environmental issues. ChallengesBut there are challenges. In particular, creating scale is a big deal. Over the last decade, the volume of funds managed by responsible investing community grew enormously. However, these investors are still a minority among investors, and their voices are only as loud as their shares. That’s why these investors are actively seeking proxy voting opportunities. Leveraging upon proxy voting they often win larger representation in vote than what their real share represents. According to the 158 companies that filed proxy documents in 2015, 41 shareholders’ proposals were on environmental issues, which ranks itself as the number 1 most frequently appeared subtopic. Another challenge is ensuring financial performance. In the midst of the European financial crisis in the early 2010s, the renewable energy sector didn’t perform well, and neither did the investment programs targeting those renewable energy sectors. While ESG investors may operate under the vision of protecting common goods, they too have the fiduciary duties to protect the asset holdings. Unless ESG investment strategies brings back not only an improved environment and society but also financial returns, ESG investing won’t be able to sustain itself. The good news is that active engagement achieves not only ESG objectives but also higher return. Studies found 4-7% better financial performance in the cases where investors actively engage in firm’s decision.ClosingUnder the forthcoming Trump administration, the role of non-federal actors will be more important than ever in the face of climate change. Among others, investment communities are one of my highest hopes. In particular, new SRI strategies such as bilateral agreement, targeted investment within sectors, and active engagement are emerging new strategies that can change the way how we fight climate change. So, go ESG investors, and save our planet as well as our retirement funds! "
34,POLITICS,Trump And Trade: A Plus For Workers?,"Robert Kuttner, ColumnistColumnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-and-trade-workers_us_5857dd8de4b08debb789ca5e,"On a good day, Donald Trump can fool some people into thinking that he will be a change for the better on trade policy, and",2016-12-19,"President-elect Donald Trump addresses a 'Thank You Tour 2016' rally on December 17, 2016 in Mobile, Alabama.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5857e1791c00000a070ec45d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On a good day, Donald Trump can fool some people into thinking that he will be a change for the better on trade policy, and by extension on American jobs. He’s for keeping more jobs in the US, renegotiating NAFTA, and taking a tougher line with China.He did a cute publicity stunt, strong-arming Greg Hayes, the CEO of Carrier’s parent corporation into keeping several hundred jobs in Indiana (lubricated by tax breaks). Progressives were on the verge of killing the misconceived Trans-Pacific Partnership, when Donald Trump administered the coup de grace—and took the credit.Trade deals like TPP, and NAFTA before it, signaled American workers that trade policy was mainly for corporate and financial elites, not for regular people. Despite the repeated claims that these deals would produce expanded benefits for all, the benefits went to the top.The fact that Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton all promoted NAFTA and TPP (until Hillary awkwardly tried to walk back her support), split the progressive coalition and helped Trump.Some pro-business economic nationalists, such as Alan Tonelson, have contended that progressives, therefore, ought to be applauding Trump’s trade initiatives. Should they? Trump’s top adviser on trade, Dan DiMicco, is former CEO of Nucor Steel, a very successful (and viciously anti-union) mini-mill producer, which has on occasion filed trade complaints against China. It’s not clear whether DiMicco will get a job in the administration, but DiMicco supports U.S. manufacturing and is very familiar with the games that China plays. Trump’s Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross is also a longtime critic of the U.S. government’s failure to get tougher with China.Trump’s people are already reaching out to some progressive activists on trade. It makes sense to listen, even to make suggestions, but then to be very, very skeptical of the results.If we go back to first principles, what’s wrong with U.S. trade policy? For one thing, it has promoted a set of global rules that define ordinary forms of financial, labor, health, safety and environmental regulation as violations of free trade. Secondly, trade policy has promoted deals like NAFTA that not only make it easier to export and outsource jobs, but create extra-legal private tribunals to which corporations and banks can file complaints and not have the decisions subject to court review.Third, trade policy has failed to challenge the mercantilist practices of other nations that close foreign markets to U.S. exports and leave American producers vulnerable to subsidized imports. That has caused the Midwest to hemorrhage jobs—and again, opened the door to Trump.In the 1970s and 1980s, U.S. trade policy displayed these odd indulgences because state-led economies like Japan and Korea were good Cold War allies. More recently, American presidents have failed to get tough with China—no ally―in part because China cut a deal with American financiers to give them a piece of the action (thank you, Robert Rubin) and in part because U.S.-based multinationals are quite happy to produce in China’s low-wage, subsidized factories.In other words, trade policies under both Democratic and Republican presidents have helped American industry and finance sell out American workers. This was the year that somebody called them on it, and workers noticed.But what will Trump do now, and where, if anywhere, is there common ground with progressives?It helps to remember that America’s misguided trade policies are part of a suite of policies that have been bad for workers. The others include financial deregulation, inadequate labor regulation, tax policies that promote outsourcing, insufficient public investment and a war on unions.Trump’s policies in all of these other areas are likely to make things worse, not better. Just look at who he is appointing to key labor, environmental and regulatory posts. It also helps to remember that Trump’s administration is turning out to be corporatist. If Trump tries to tell his business allies where to produce at more than token levels, the corporate pushback will be yuge.Photo-ops with executives pressured into keeping a few more jobs at home may be smart politics for Trump, but they don’t add up to a trade policy.That said, Trump has decided to ally with Russia and get tougher with China. You could imagine Trump taking a harder line against China’s subsidized exports. The U.S. government has the authority to initiate anti-dumping trade cases, but with America’s kid-gloves policy towards China, that not has been done since the 1980s. In industry after industry, complaints and the cost of pursuing them have had to come from private parties―unions and companies. If Trump were to change that policy, it would be hard for progressives not to applaud, even while holding their noses.For instance, New York City just signed a contract to use public money give a Chinese state-owned company, the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) the contract to build at least 1,025 new subway cars. CRRC has already built about 1,000 subway cars for Boston and Chicago. As part of the New York deal, the Chinese state company gets to acquire a U.S. producer of rail cars. That aspect of the deal required the approval of President Obama, and certification that the deal did not have national security implications, over the objections of a rare bipartisan group of 42 senators. Deals like this happen all the time. If would not be hard for Trump, as a good New Yorker, to insist that this contract go to an American producer. That would be a nice symbolic demonstration of concern for U.S. industry and jobs, as well as a way of showing up the Democrats.Trump is a master of the symbolic stunt, and on trade he actually has some advisers who know what they are doing.Trump may try to keep more jobs at home―but by destroying social standards he assures that they will be low-wage jobs. For decades, progressives have been calling for a new global trade regime that helps raise rather than lower social standards, in labor, the environment, health, and human rights. Whatever else Trump delivers, he will not deliver that.What he might deliver, though, is a form of economic nationalism that helps his corporate allies, while doing little if anything for American workers, with the exception of workers in extractive industries, a relative handful of production workers, and some construction jobs if he gets serious about infrastructure (though he also supports killing the Davis Bacon Act which supports construction wages). As the outlines of his policies become clearer, there may be occasional points of convergence, such as the mercy-killing of TPP, and the retention of some jobs at Carrier (though it only took Trump a little while to trash the president of the union local), and some get-tough stuff with China.Here is the real risk. A moderately tougher trade policy could take the spotlight off the net effect on workers. Regulatory relief and lower taxes for industry plus the trashing of unions and labor standards may create more jobs, but with wages and career horizons that are even lower.As Trump goes through the motions of a pursuing a trade policy that serves the people who voted for him, our job is to be very careful not to be gulled or co-opted, to keep pointing out what a real pro-worker trade policy looks like, and to challenge Trump to support one.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University’s Heller School.

35,POLITICS,Legal Heavyweights Won't Change Realities Of Gun Debate,"Mike Weisser, ContributorMike the Gun Guy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/legal-heavyweights-wont-change-realities-of-gun-debate_us_58585e00e4b0b3ddfd8e6220,"I’m not an expert or even a novice on what I know about America’s legal profession, but when firms like Paul, Weiss, Rifkind",2016-12-19,"A man wearing a cowboy hat stops at the booth for the National Rifle Association (NRA) at the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, March 4, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585863531800002c00e438fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I’m not an expert or even a novice on what I know about America’s legal profession, but when firms like Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, Arnold & Porter and Covington & Burling announce that they are joining forces to tackle a legal issue, it’s worth my time to figure out what’s going on. And when these firms and a bunch of other legal powerhouses announce that the issue they want to pursue is gun violence, then it’s something I need to understand. And what better way to understand what’s going on than a long and detailed article in the New York Times which says these firms are committing “tens of millions of dollars in free legal services” to aid the gun violence prevention community (GVP) in its efforts to reduce the annual carnage caused by America’s love affair with guns.Predictably, Gun-nut Nation immediately responded to this announcement by accusing the lead Arnold & Porter attorney, Michael Schissel, of “lying through his teeth” in an interview with NPR because he wouldn’t admit that his real reason for getting involved was to help his firm get “rich off frivolous lawsuits” that would be filed once his firm helped dispose of the gun-immunity law known as PLCAA. And to prove just how much the gun industry doesn’t need any more anti-gun lawyers poking around, the whine about Schissel mentioned the sad case of Stag Arms whose owner was barred from the industry for life simply because he couldn’t provide the ATF with documentation about a pile of full-automatic assault guns. We’re not talking about the semi-automatic assault rifles which Stag manufactures in boatloads every month. We’re talking about weapons where you pull the trigger one time and the gun barks roughly ten times per second until all the ammo is used up.Of course what the new legal alliance is facing isn’t some small fry in Connecticut who forgot to do the paperwork on his machine guns. What they are really facing is the power and authority of the executive branch of the federal government whose new occupant better not forget the television ads that NRA ran during his presidential campaign. I find it interesting, incidentally, that there was absolutely no mention of anything having to do with the Second Amendment in the hundred-day agenda that Trump released back in October when he gave his version of the Gettysburg Address. And what really concerns me in this respect was the statement coming out of the new legal coalition formed to help reduce gun violence that their effort “was not aimed at eroding gun rights.”The problem with this approach on the part of advocates for GVP is that the statement simply flies in the face of reality, or at least the reality of gun ownership as it is understood by most people who own guns. Take, for example, the surveys which show a majority of gun owners and even NRA members allegedly supporting the extension of FBI-NICS background checks. Yet none of those surveys ever ask these same NRA members how they feel about the NRA’s explicit rejection of any additional background checks at all. I can guarantee you that if those same NRA members had to choose between supporting background checks and supporting the NRA, the folks in Fairfax would get their money and their votes.The search by this new legal coalition to identify and speak to all those ‘responsible’ gun owners reminds me of all those ‘responsible’ Republicans who were going to desert the party and vote for Hillary because they just couldn’t accept the rantings and ravings of this new guy named Trump. Know what happened to all those ‘responsible’ Republicans when they walked into the voting booth on November 8? They voted the way they always voted, which is exactly what will happen if gun owners have to choose between gun regulations drawn up by liberals (and their attorneys) or the protection of the NRA."
36,BUSINESS,Renovation Boom Revives A Deadly Demon For Massachusetts Workers,"Beth Daley, ContributorSenior reporter at New England Center for Investigative Reporting",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/renovation-boom-revives-a-deadly-demon-for-massachusetts_us_5857ff03e4b06ae7ec2a4058,"By Beth Daley, Martha Bebinger and Colby Burdick This story was produced in collaboration with WBUR Public Radio and The",2016-12-19,"<p><em>Henry Aguilar at the offices of Fuerza Laboral in Central Falls, Rhode Island. </em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585802581200008610ef00eb.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Beth Daley, Martha Bebinger and Colby BurdickThis story was produced in collaboration with WBUR Public Radio and The Eye.Demolition worker Henry Aguilar stopped short when he saw cracked floor tile glued to the underside of a carpet he was tearing out of an office in downtown Boston.They were brown and old, signs that they might contain asbestos, a potentially deadly health hazard. The Skinner Demolition employee said he told his supervisor about the tile on the site in September, but was urged not to worry and keep on working.Aguilar did. He said he also placed some of the tile into a plastic bag for testing, at the request of The Eye and WBUR Public Radio.Analysis at a state-accredited lab, ProScience Analytical Services, showed that the tile contained asbestos at levels requiring workers to wear specialized breathing masks to filter out cancer-causing asbestos dust. Yet the Guatemalan immigrant said he wore only a paper mask – not designed to keep out dust fibers hundreds of times finer than a strand of hair.“I wish they told me about it and someone moved it before I did the work,” said Aguilar, 32, of Central Falls, R.I. He said he was not trained to remove asbestos.Two of Aguilar’s fellow workers say they saw him complain to the supervisor. A lawyer for Skinner’s parent company said it is looking into Aguilar’s allegations about the downtown Boston worksite.Asbestos embedded in old buildings is creating a new wave of danger for laborers as renovation work soars, even as the use of the carcinogenic mineral in new construction has been sharply curbed.Regulators found more than 300 asbestos-safety violations resulting in fines in Massachusetts in the five years ending in June 2016, the majority of them on job sites, state data show.Workers are routinely confronting asbestos woven decades ago into ceilings and floor tiles, blown into walls or wrapped around boilers and heating pipes as insulation or fire retardant. Registered asbestos-removal projects in Massachusetts hit an all-time high in 2015 of 23,756, up more than 50 percent in five years.Many federal and state regulations are designed to protect the 3,400 people licensed to work in asbestos removal, as well as thousands of others like Aguilar who work in demolition. But an analysis by The Eye and WBUR of five years of enforcement cases, and interviews with company owners, government officials, asbestos experts, union leaders and academics point to big gaps between the mandated safety standards and what happens on the ground.Until monitoring began increasing last year, the total number of on-site inspections by the state agencies responsible for asbestos safety was dropping as abatement and demolition projects were rising, increasing the chances that violations were missed. The state Department of Environmental Protection performed 527 inspections in the fiscal year ending in June 2015, less than half the number of 2012.Fines reducedThe number of fines issued by state agencies for safety violations decreased during that four-year period and didn’t always prevent recurrences. The maximum fine by the state Department of Labor Standards for first-time violations is $2,500. The state environmental department’s fines are typically higher, but the agency often reduces or suspends them. The Eye found 26 repeat offenders among the companies violating safety regulations in the last five years.It’s impossible to say how many of the hundreds of workers exposed in recent years may develop asbestos-related conditions, as it typically takes 10 to 40 years after exposure for the disease to develop.But research in Britain has shown that asbestos removers are twice as likely to die from diseases linked to the mineral than those who worked with it in manufacturing. Despite curbed use, at least 4,000 people died from asbestos related diseases in the U.S. in 2014, according to the latest data.In interviews, workers in Massachusetts say safety lapses are widespread, including inadequate respiratory protection, substandard hazardous-material suits, no curtains to contain dust, and failure by employers to provide shower facilities or places to change before leaving a site to prevent tracking dust home to families.In April, one company was fined for failing to provide decontamination areas for at least three workers at an Andover home. In July, a state inspector found three workers weren’t wearing any breathing apparatus when removing asbestos ceiling tiles at David Prouty High School in Spencer. The company overseeing the work, Ludlow, Massachusetts-based Compass Restoration Services, was issued a $4,500 fine.Fran Mason, a Compass spokesman, said the company always provides adequate safety. In the case at issue, he said some workers took off their masks near the end of the abatement job.That same July, the Peabody firm National Abatement Inc. received its third state fine for workplace violations in three years. In one case inspectors found four workers removing asbestos with no personal protection at all. The state said the company has paid $9,200 related to the first two fines, and is on a payment plan for an additional $10,000 fine. National Abatement did not return calls for comment.“200 miles an hour”Alan Aulson, president of an asbestos abatement firm in Methuen, Massachusetts, says there’s a “tremendous amount” of safety rule-breaking across the industry. Jobs often go to low bidders, who operate on slim margins and can cut costs by skipping safety steps, Aulson said.He compared contractors who break the rules to speeding drivers: those going a few miles over the limit usually don’t get caught. But in asbestos abatement, “there are guys going 200 miles an hour.” Aulson said. “This industry is notorious for that.”Since many asbestos removers and demolition workers arrived in this country illegally from countries including Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and El Salvador, they fear deportation if they complain, according to labor-rights advocates and union officials. The workers say if they raise safety concerns, there is one sure result in the close-knit industry.“You don’t get any more work,” said a licensed asbestos worker in Lawrence, Massachusetts, who asked not to be named to protect his job.Reports of illness from asbestos date back to ancient Greece, where it was used in textiles. But health concerns took a back seat in the 20th century, when the mineral became ubiquitous in construction because of its strength and heat resistance. By the 1980s, research linking it to cancer spawned litigation by ill workers that had been exposed, Today, court-ordered trust funds set up by the manufacturers are still paying damage claims. The U.S. never enacted a total ban on asbestos, as 58 other countries have done. Its use here is still permitted in products including roof coatings and floor tiles.The most serious disease linked to asbestos is mesothelioma, an incurable cancer. Exposure also can cause lung cancer and asbestosis, marked by permanent scarring of the lungs.“It’s an awful cancer to have,” said Mike Dennen, 63, a former construction and textile worker diagnosed with mesothelioma four years ago. He said he spent about nine years removing asbestos in buildings.Now recovering from his sixth round of chemotherapy, Dennen has deep scars on his back and side from two cancer surgeries. In both, his body cavity was left open so doctors could wash it out with heated chemotherapy drugs. He said he suspects he was most exposed to the fibers during six months spent tearing insulation off basement pipes without adequate protection at a hotel in Martha’s Vineyard in the 1980s.“We would touch the pipe insulation and this white dust like baby powder would come off,” said Dennen, who lives in Sagamore, on Cape Cod. Now, “I have to gasp for breath.”Asbestos removal workers say getting sick is always on their mind.Ripped bagsJose Flores, a native of El Salvador, said he worked for 12 years under worrying conditions for Air Safe, an abatement firm in Littleton, Massachusetts. He worked there until 2013.Flores said Air Safe didn’t outfit him with the more protective types of respirators that he believed some jobs warranted. He said he would often have to ride home in the company van, without a mask, sitting atop black garbage bags filled with the day’s asbestos-laden debris. The bags would invariably tear and release dust, according to Flores.“Even though they are double-bagged they always break,” he said. Flores recently saw a specialist who told him he did not show signs of asbestos-related illness. However, Flores said he still worries, given the years that can pass before those who are exposed take ill.David Walsh, co-owner of Air Safe, said he stands by his company’s good safety record. In 2012, he said Flores came to him concerned about asbestos exposure in the van trips. He said he issued a memo telling workers they were not allowed to travel in the cargo area of Air Safe vans. He provided a copy of the memo, which urged workers to come to management if they encountered any safety hazards.Available data on regulatory oversight of asbestos in Massachusetts workplaces present a mixed picture of effectiveness.The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which typically acts on complaints or reports of injuries on the job, has been relatively inactive compared to state agencies. It found only one asbestos-related violation in Massachusetts in the 12 months through September 2016, down from nine violations three years earlier.State agencies say their asbestos-safety monitoring is up in the last 18 months. The Department of Environmental Protection conducted 1,199 inspections in its fiscal year ending in June 2016, more than twice the number of the year before.Gary Moran, deputy DEP commissioner, said the state prioritizes sites to inspect based on complaints, targeting bad actors. “We do think we adequately address public safety,” Moran said.The Department of Labor Standards said its inspections increased in calendar 2015 and have continued rising, but said it couldn’t provide past data that were comparable.Asbestos-related fines issued by DLS max out at $2,500 per first violation or $5,000 for repeat offenses. While DEP fines can be issued at $25,000 a day per violation, they are often reduced or suspended. DEP fines initially amounted to more than $446,000 last year, but were later reduced by 60 percent.“Some employers budget-in fines as the price of doing business,” said Cora Roelofs, an occupational health researcher who led a 2013 state study on asbestos-related deaths. “They assume there will be fines.”A history of finesIn 2014, two companies owned by abatement-industry veteran Neal Cass were fined $188,725 by DEP for issues including improper asbestos removal at a Waltham home and Malden Catholic High School. All but $20,000 was suspended in part because of his inability to pay, state records show. He was also fined $600 by DLS that year for another asbestos-related violation in Acushnet.262 Washington StreetThe DEP requires building owners to hire licensed inspectors to survey for asbestos at demolition sites before work begins. It’s unclear whether an inspection was done at 262 Washington, the building where Aguilar worked for Skinner Demolition and said he found the suspicious tile. KS Partners, which owns and manages the property, did not respond to numerous calls.Eleven Skinner workers filed complaints with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination earlier this year, a spokesman for MCAD confirmed. The complaints allege that the workers weren’t paid for all the hours they worked, and weren’t given adequate asbestos protection, according to a union that represents the workers.Scott J. Connolly, an attorney for Skinner Services Inc., which runs the demolition company, said the allegation in the MCAD complaint were unfounded.Skinner “always put us to work where there’s lead and asbestos,” said Ruben Pedrosa, 27, a Skinner worker who was with Aguilar when he discovered the suspicious tiles.If removers do get sick, it could be difficult for them to tap into trust funds established by manufacturers for asbestos liabilities, Steven Kazan, founder of a law firm in Oakland, California, that handles workers’ asbestos claims. He said workers would usually have to prove any asbestos came from a specific manufacturer and that it was never disturbed before they removed it.Available data on regulatory oversight of asbestos in Massachusetts workplaces present a mixed picture of effectiveness.The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which typically acts on complaints or reports of injuries on the job, has been relatively inactive compared to state agencies.

The state then demanded $60,725 of his suspended penalty but government records show he hasn’t paid. Cass said he paid some of the original $20,000 fine, but can’t afford to pay more.Cass is still in asbestos-related work. State corporation records show he started Nealco Inspectional Services last year, which surveys properties for asbestos. If it is found, his website recommends using a company called Clean Air Environmental.The answering machine at Nealco’s office phone says the caller has also reached Clean Air, which Cass said is owned by one of his former employees. Clean Air was fined $2,200 by DLS in June for not setting up decontamination chambers for workers at an Andover home and for having an expired contractor license.In an interview, Cass called himself “one of the good guys” in the abatement business. “It’s almost impossible in the industry not to get a fine,” Cass said, adding that he went years without a violation, and received “big fines for little things.”262 Washington StreetThe DEP requires building owners to hire licensed inspectors to survey for asbestos at demolition sites before work begins.

Statements,2016-12-19,<p><em>Parents say the darndest things.....</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585835cb1c00001d000ec633.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every now & then there are some things that I hear people say that just make me wanna run my nails across a chalkboard. Statements that are so utterly annoying and obnoxious, that I question the intelligence of the person who said it. Children are known to say some pretty ridiculous things but sometimes parents can say some equally outrageous things:“My kid is special” – Everyone is special. That’s right, everyone. No two people are made just alike, so saying that your kid is special is a little redundant. “My kid is amazing” – Oh really?! What makes your kid so amazing? Can your kid stand on their head & recite the national anthem in Latin at the same time? Does your kid understand quantum physics or did they win a Nobel Peace Prize before they hit grade school? Do they have some magical hidden talent or possess a highly sought after skill? I understand that your kid doesn’t have to be the best kid in the whole wide world to be considered amazing but that’s a pretty lofty claim to make. Most adults aren’t amazing, so how can a kid be?“I would die for my kid” – A lot of people have put themselves in harm’s way to help rescue a child even if it’s not their own. How many times have you heard stories where a stranger ran out in front of traffic to protect a little child or got injured because they were shielding someone else’s child from a horrific accident from a rabid animal? Yes, there are some people out there that would do some pretty bad things to little kids but for the most part no one would purposely harm a little child. It goes without saying that a parent would put their lives at risk for their child.“My kid is so smart” – Good grades don’t automatically make a kid smart, so what does this even mean? Why do parents think their children are smarter than anyone else’s? Because they can read or count? But wait, isn’t that what kids do – learn stuff? We did the same things when we were kids so what makes your child so different? I really would like to know why most parents think their kid is a child genius when most of them are just normal with average intelligence.“My kid is beautiful” – You don’t say?! And no one else’s is? Although no parent wants to admit it not all babies or children are physically beautiful. Of course, your child is beautiful in your eyes but that doesn’t necessarily make your child beautiful to others. Besides, children usually look like their parents. So if you’re saying they’re attractive, you are indirectly complimenting yourself. I’m not surprised when someone says their kid is beautiful; after all, kids are just a reflection of their parents. Are you a parent? Have you said any of these things? Why do you think your kids are so special or so smart? Be honest….. "
38,RELIGION,These Sikh Bhangra Dancers Will Shovel Away Your Winter Blues,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snow-shovel-bhangra-sikh_us_5858083ce4b08debb789f890,The Maritime Bhangra Group is using dance to give back to their community.,2016-12-19,Members of the Maritime Bhangra Group perform bhangra in a parking lot.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585810a9120000590eef015d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of Canadian Sikhs is using their dance skills to show that no matter how brutal this winter is, we’re all in it together. The Halifax-based Maritime Bhangra Group (MBG) took a break from shoveling snow to show off their dancing skills and raise money for a local charity.MBG was formed to help spread awareness of Sikh identity in Nova Scotia through bhangra, a folk dance that originates the Indian state of Punjab. The group posted a video of their wintry antics to Facebook on Thursday, earning more than 1.5 million views.The dancers asked fans of the video to donate to ALS NB & NS, a Canadian organization that provides support to individuals and families living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In the past, MBG has requested fans to donate to prostate cancer research and to Khalsa Aid, a Sikh humanitarian aid organization.The group’s co-founder, Hasmeet Singh Chandok, told The Huffington Post that MBG decided to do a winter-themed video because it’s a part of everyday life that people in colder climates of the world would understand.“All North Americans and people in so many countries can relate to having snow and trying to get rid of it just to get the car out of garage,” Chandok said.Chandok and his brother came to Canada from India in 2013. There weren’t many Sikhs in Nova Scotia at that point, Chandok said, so the brothers started MBG as a way to share their culture with their neighbors. “I wouldn’t call it racism or discrimination, but ignorance. Because people hadn’t met Sikhs,” he said. “We wanted to let people know where we come from, why we look different, why we have a turban on our heads. Let people know about our identity.” The group officially came together in July 2016. They’ve performed at local festivals, networked with local charities, and have also put together educational programs for schools in the area.While Sikhism is an important part of their identity, Chandok said that the group’s work is inspired by all religious traditions.“I personally feel it’s more about being human first,” Chandok said. “All religions give the same message of positivity and doing good for others.”CORRECTION: This article initially misidentified Hasmeet Singh Chandok in omitting his last name.

She never imagined this one gesture ― for which she says she has since “profusely apologized” ― would destroy her career as a UConnn student-athlete.A few weeks after the incident, then-head coach Len Tsantiris called Radwan to let her know her scholarship would be terminated mid-year for what he called a “serious misconduct issue.”Nearly two years after that phone call, Radwan is still fighting back.She announced at a press conference on Monday that she’s filing a lawsuit against UConn and three people associated with the decision to end her scholarship: Tsantiris, the university’s former athletic director and the director of student financial aid. Radwan’s layer, Greg Tarone, said UConn and the involved individuals violated his client’s First Amendment rights and the NCAA Division I bylaws.Radwan is asking the school for financial retribution, The Associated Press reports. “I loved UConn, but I lost faith in it as an institution when it allowed my scholarship to be illegally taken away so abruptly and crassly in the middle of the school year,” Radwan said. “Nobody should have to go through what I have gone through in the past two years. Only litigation will stop it.”Watch the press conference below:Tarone called UConn’s termination of Radwan’s scholarship “atrocious,” and said he believes sexism played a role in the university’s decision.“We’re here because she’s a female student-athlete who was treated differently than male student-athletes at UConn by the institution,” Tarone said. “One misguided individual, Coach Tsantiris, led the way for a couple of others to complicity violate her civil rights.”He cited several recent incidents involving male UConn student-athletes who received little to no disciplinary action from the university despite having been accused of more “serious misconduct” than Radwan.For example, a freshman football player named Brian Cespedes was charged last week with misdemeanor assault and breach of peace for his involvement in an off-campus fight in September. UConn spokesman Kyle Muncy told the New Haven Register that the coaching staff was “made aware of the incident and addressed it,” but that Cespedes had not been kicked off the team.Tarone said he also believes Tsantiris was motivated to remove Radwan from his team to free up scholarship money and make room for then-Notre Dame mid-fielder Morgan Andrews. (Andrews ended up choosing to play at the University of Southern California.)Tarone said a section of the NCAA bylaws does permit a school to cancel a scholarship mid-year for “serious misconduct,” but that this type of misconduct is undefined. “A common sense applied to the word ‘serious’ means misconduct that would significantly worry or cause injury to somebody,” Tarone said. “Noriana’s [gesture] could not possibly be characterized in the same realm of unacceptable conduct by a student-athlete on any campus in this country ― none.”Radwan, who is currently playing for Hofstra University after receiving a partial athletic scholarship, said the psychological and emotional agony of being kicked off UConn’s team had been “overwhelming.”“Please understand that I did not intend to offend anyone,” Radwan said. “I was making a celebratory statement that was seriously misinterpreted and misjudged.” UConn spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz told the AP that the school had not seen the lawsuit and wasn’t able to comment on it because of federal privacy laws.“In an excited moment, as an 18-year-old after winning her first championship, her one little mistake cost her everything,” Tarone said. “Loyalists to the UConn Huskies brand should ask themselves if they want this to happen to their daughter.”"

Five buses leaving Aleppo were held, packed with evacuees, for hours before they could drive the 5 km (3 miles) to rebel-held territory outside.In return for the evacuation of fighters, their families and other civilians from Aleppo, the mostly Sunni insurgents had agreed that people in the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya, Shi’ite villages that they have besieged near Idlib, should also be allowed to leave.Videos posted on social media showed bearded men with guns cheering and shouting “God is great” after torching the green buses before they were able to reach the villages.State media said “armed terrorists”, a term it uses for all groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad, had carried out the attack. Pro-Damascus Mayadeen television and the Observatory blamed the rebel group formerly known as the Nusra Front.Rebel officials said an angry crowd of people, possibly alongside pro-government “operatives”, was responsible.Although the Aleppo evacuation convoy was eventually cleared to drive to rebel-held al-Rashideen, there was no official word on what impact the bus burning would have on the departure of more convoys from the city and the two villages.While the Observatory said the convoy of five buses had reached al-Rashideen, a United Nations official in Syria said only that they had left east Aleppo, adding: “The evacuations are on”.Robert Mardini, regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which is at the forefront of the operation, tweeted that the buses and one ambulance of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent “just left dark & cold E #Aleppo”, adding: “Hopeful operation will proceed smoothly.”Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad’s main foreign backer, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, the rebels’ main supporter, agreed by telephone on Sunday that the disruptions must be quickly overcome, sources in Erdogan’s office said.The commander of forces allied to Assad said there was still a chance for states with influence over rebel groups to find a way to evacuate civilians safely.In a statement carried by a military news outlet run by Damascus’s ally, the Lebanese group Hezbollah, the allied forces leadership said responsibility for the delay in the evacuation falls with “terrorists and their state sponsors”.Some 40 km (26 miles) to the northeast, hundreds of fighters and their families in Aleppo sat or stood in buses, hoping the evacuation would resume after a three-day hiatus.Syrian state television, citing its correspondent in the city, said buses had started to leave east Aleppo where over 15,000 people had gathered in a square to wait, many after a night sleeping in the streets in freezing temperatures.Aleppo had been divided between government and rebel areas in the nearly six-year-long war, but a lightning advance by the Syrian army and its allies began in mid-November following months of intense air strikes, forcing the insurgents out of most of the rebel-held territory within a matter of weeks.“EVERYONE IS WAITING”According to Syria’s al-Ikhbariya TV news, about 1,200 civilians would initially be evacuated from east Aleppo and a similar number from the two villages.A document cited by al-Manar television and passed to Reuters by rebels and activists said the entire deal would see 2,500 citizens leave al-Foua and Kefraya in two batches, in exchange for the evacuation of people from east Aleppo in two corresponding batches.Following this, another 1,500 would leave al-Foua and Kefraya in exchange for the evacuation of 1,500 from the towns of Madaya and Zabadani near Lebanon, which are besieged by pro-government forces.Once evacuees from the villages have safely arrived in government areas, Aleppo fighters and more of their family members will be allowed to leave, in return for subsequent batches of people departing al-Foua and Kefraya, al-Ikhbariya TV reported.In the square in Aleppo’s Sukari district, organizers gave every family a number to allow them on buses.“Everyone is waiting until they are evacuated. They just want to escape,” said Salah al Attar, a former teacher with his five children, wife and mother.Thousands of people were evacuated on Thursday, the first to leave under a ceasefire deal that would end years of fighting for the city and mark a major victory for Assad.They were taken to rebel-held districts of the countryside west of Aleppo. Turkey has said Aleppo evacuees could also be housed in a camp to be constructed near the Turkish border to the north.UNITED NATIONS VOTEThe chaos surrounding the evacuation reflects the complexity of Syria’s civil war, with an array of groups and foreign interests involved on all sides.The United Nations Security Council agreed on Sunday on a compromise draft resolution on U.N. officials monitoring the evacuations from Aleppo. It will vote on the text on Monday.Russia said it would veto an earlier draft by France but circulated an alternative version.“We expect to vote unanimously for this text tomorrow at 9 a.m. (1400 GMT),” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told reporters after more than three hours of negotiations.Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said: “I think we have a good text, we agreed to vote tomorrow morning.”Russia, which has provided military backing to Assad, has vetoed six Security Council resolutions on Syria since the conflict started in 2011. China joined Moscow in vetoing five resolutions.A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war, and Islamic State militants have used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq.

Tehran is not allowed to enrich uranium above a 3.67 percent purity for 15 years, a level unlikely to be enough to run such vessels, according to experts.Iran on Saturday also requested a meeting of a commission comprising representatives of signatories to the accord that is overseeing its implementation."

In Philadelphia this July, Amanda Berg was gearing up to protest the Democratic National Convention.Lonkart was 77 and finishing up his second term as a city commissioner. Berg was 22 and still in school at the University of Utah.But the hardcore conservative and the bleeding-heart progressive had this in common: Both believed the nation’s political system was badly and thoroughly broken. “It needs to be blown up,” Lonkhart said.Rigged system. Burn it all down. Political revolution. Drain the swamp.From the crowds cheering on Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as he campaigned for the Democratic nomination to the throngs supporting developer-turned-reality show host Donald Trump, it was the theme that defined the election year: The United States has become so completely broken that it needs a thorough flushing to fix things.It was also a theme somewhat detached from reality. The nation holds elections regularly, the courts function, and agencies at local, state and federal levels provide services according to established rules ― and without the expectation of bribes or kickbacks, a staple in many dozens of actually corrupt countries.Indeed, elected officials at every level keep careful track of feedback from constituents, so that in instances where they must choose between angry campaign donors and angry voters, they typically side with the voters.Thomas Mann, a longtime Congress watcher at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, points to issues like abortion, same-sex marriage and even guns, which occupy a disproportionate amount of policymakers’ time even though they are not priorities for big business. “A lot more goes into policymaking and decisions than money, and the idea that it’s all bought and sold is really quite destructive,” he said.Transparency International, a group that tracks corruption worldwide, ranks the United States 16th among 168 nations ― on par with other Western, industrialized nations and considerably better than China (83rd), Mexico (95th) and Russia (119th), countries mentioned favorably by Trump during the campaign.“The U.S. doesn’t really do terribly,” said Shruti Shah, vice president of transparency at the group’s United States branch and whose native India is rife with bribery in everything from school placement to construction contracts.Nevertheless, a sense that the nation is afflicted by pervasive corruption led Berg to travel to Philadelphia to make one final push to persuade Democrats to nominate Sanders before switching her allegiance to Green Party candidate Jill Stein. And it led Lonkart, who spent years holding real responsibilities running a city, to cast his ballot for Trump.Lonkart said he wasn’t at all bothered by Trump’s lack of knowledge about or interest in the federal government. What mattered, he said, was that Trump was willing to break things. “I don’t want inaction. I want action.”Polling suggests that the attitudes represented by Berg and Lonkart played determinative roles in Trump’s victory last month. Nearly all self-identified Republicans, despite the party’s fractious primary, came back to Trump, who also benefited from support from a significant number of independent voters who cared more about dramatic change than a basic level of competence.Of voters who backed Trump, according to exit polls, a full 17 percent believed he was not qualified for the job.“The concept of change was a really important force,” said David Winston, a Republican pollster and political consultant. “Almost to the point where people were willing to play political 52 card pickup in order to get the person who was going to bring the most change.”Winston attributed the hunger for change to the personal situations of a significant percentage of voters ― the loss of jobs or homes during the recession of 2008-09, and their inability to climb back. “Things weren’t going to change in their lives, and they weren’t happy with where they were,” he said.According to Mann, though, the overarching sense that everything is terrible, while exacerbated by the financial crisis and prosecutors’ failure to send any bankers responsible for it to prison, is the end result of the Republican Party’s strategy over the past two decades to delegitimize government.Starting with Newt Gingrich, when he was House minority whip in the early 1990s, Republicans have denounced government itself as disgustingly and hopelessly corrupt, Mann said.One factor that increased transparency but, ironically, has reduced Americans’ faith in government, Mann added, was easier access to campaign contribution data on the internet. This dramatically increased the number of news stories that sought to connect politicians’ actions to specific donations ― even in cases where donors had given a few thousand dollars in races that in total cost millions. “There’s too much reporting that reinforces the public view that it’s all corrupt,” Mann said.Meanwhile, Mann’s co-author on a pair of books about congressional dysfunction, Norman Ornstein of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Republicans’ approach of attacking government grew even worse over the past eight years. “You had a doubling down on Newt’s strategy from the moment [President Barack] Obama got elected,” Ornstein said.Republicans in Congress treated Obama’s win as illegitimate and, in so doing, legitimized the segment of the party’s base that opposed him primarily because of his race, Ornstein said. “This created kind of a toxic stew.”And if Sanders’ rhetoric during the primaries started that stew simmering with his talk about the system only working for the rich, Trump brought it to a full boil with his remarks blaming undocumented immigrants and trade agreements that he claimed were forged as the result of open corruption.The underlying irony for those who sought to end what they perceived as corruption is that they may well have elected a president whose record through the years and whose actions since the election signal it could be the most openly corrupt administration in generations.Trump, who flouted four decades of tradition by refusing to disclose his tax returns as a candidate, is now refusing to make a clean break from his far-flung business interests ― and is permitting his children to participate in the formation of the government as well as the operation of the family empire. What’s more, it appears so far that he is willing to actively profit from his presidential victory. His hotel in Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House, for example, has solicited the business of foreign dignitaries who visit the capital.Critics see Trump bringing the precise sort of kleptocracy and nepotism to his administration that the United States has long criticized in third-world countries.“He’s doing the exact opposite of everything he promised,” said Robert Weissman, president of the group Public Citizen, which advocates to reduce the influence of money in politics.John Weaver, a longtime Republican strategist who has worked for Arizona Sen. John McCain and, most recently, the presidential bid of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, said Trump was able to latch on to Sanders’ “rigged system” talk and persuade enough voters in enough key states that he would do something about it.Weaver said he remembers going to Trump rallies where attendees would tell him that the media were corrupt, too. “What does that even mean?” Weaver asked. “I think he was able to thread a certain toxic needle. But he did win, and we’re all going to pay the price.”As for hardcore Sanders supporters ― many of whom appear to have stayed home Nov. 8 or voted for a third-party candidate ― Trump’s win seems to have hardened their conviction that they were right all along.On election night, Berg posted on her Facebook page: “Hey DNC, do you need any more proof that your candidate sucks? She can’t even win against Hitler.”And Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, this month continues to attribute Trump’s victory to the Democratic Party’s participation in that same “rigged” system. In an opinion piece published in The Hill, he wrote: “When elements of the party spend decades supporting job-destroying trade deals and cozying up to Wall Street and other corporate interests, it only makes sense that working people and young people’s confidence in the party as a whole has been shaken, if not shattered.”To Brookings’ Mann, that could be the Sanders campaign’s lasting legacy: convincing an entire cohort of first-time Democratic-leaning voters that the system is beyond repair. “That was his major contribution to this election, unfortunately,” Mann said. “I thought Bernie was very harmful.”"

Edward Moore said the vehicle’s unidentified owner wasn’t happy about the damage caused.“It is my understanding that the owner was incredulous that we took action in this matter,” Moore said in a press release. “He apparently was quite vocal and vulgar to my sergeant.”No charges have been filed in connection with the case, according to CBS New York. But Moore said he had a message for anyone else thinking of keeping mannequins inside their vehicles overnight.“Just to clear the record, all citizens of Hudson should be put on notice that if you park your locked vehicle on the street on a sub-zero night with a life-size realistic mannequin seated in it, we will break your window,” he said."

The hackers, posing as the mother of two, shared screenshots of alleged text conversations and direct messages, claiming to expose Chyna’s supposed plot “to marry Rob just to trademark the name Kardashian,” according to Us Weekly. In one Instagram caption, via People, the hacker posing as Chyna wrote, “I no longer am with Rob. I left him and took the baby and did not even let him know.” Rob later confirmed on his Instagram page that Chyna left with Dream.According to People, the hacker also posted alleged conversations between Chyna and rapper Young Thug, in which he apparently says he wants to “stunt” with Chyna. Another conversation, purportedly between Chyna and Jaden Smith, shows Smith bringing up Kylie Jenner’s relationship with Chyna’s ex Tyga. There’s no date visible on the supposed conversations, so it’s unclear if they took place recently or before Chyna was with Rob. In another reported conversation, between Chyna and her friend Treasure, Chyna called Rob “lazy, fat, insecure.”Chyna tried to clear the air following the hack by sharing a video on Snapchat. “Just to let y’all know, that’s not me on my IG page, that’s somebody that hacked me,” she says. “And somebody’s really, really, really, really mad.” According to Us Weekly, she told fans to follow her on a new page. In response to all the Instagram posts on Chyna’s account, Kardashian shared a video on Snapchat (later posted to Instagram), saying he’s “not feeling so good.”“My baby girl is 1 month old and Chyna took her and left this beautiful home that I just bought for us. Right before Christmas. Someone I have given my all too [sic],” he wrote. “I Loved every inch of that woman and loved everything that came with her. I truly loved Angela. I gave everything I owned for her. Didn’t know I was just part of her plan.” Chyna seemingly responded to Kardashian’s videos by sharing a screenshot of one of Kardashian’s clips on her new Instagram account along with a lengthy caption.

In 1998, Stanford political scientist, Jon Krosnick discovered something disturbing about the US Presidential election process. Despite his conclusive findings, the laws were never updated. If they had been, Hillary Clinton would have won easily with 293 electoral votes to Trump’s 245.What could have created a difference of 61 electoral votes? (Are you ready?)The order the names appeared on the ballots.Yup. Had the names been listed in a different order, there would be a different result in six crucial states (see below for details), and we would have a different president-elect.Whoa…wait…That can’t be right. People vote based on policy, platform, political party, trustworthiness, candidate charisma, and issues that are important to them, right? They don’t vote based on how the names appear on the ballot!Do they?I write books on influence and I still have a hard time believing it. (I’m giving away seven chapters of my upcoming book, True Influence at the end of this article because I’m on a mission to make sure everyone understands how to properly use - and defend against - influence strategies.)There is a lot of evidence for what psychologists call the “primacy and recency effect” - which affects all kinds of decisions from which wine or bubble gum brands we choose to which American Idol contestant we vote for. It’s best to be first, last is next best, and the middle is the worst. But can something as trivial as who’s on first affect something as important as a presidential election?Yup.While most people know exactly who they’re voting for before they ever see the ballot, name order does in fact influence some voters. How do we know? Because Ohio.In Ohio, ballot order is rotated randomly by precinct. This is a social scientist’s dream. Real people making real decisions with a controlled and isolated variable. All Krosnick had to do was look at the numbers. He found the average influence ballot order has on a Presidential election is about 2%.That may not seem like much, but six states were won by less than a 2% margin of victory. Is it possible that the primacy and recency effect could have tipped the scales for a small percentage of voters in the 2016 election as well? Was Trump’s victory decided by ballot order? By freakin’ BALLOT ORDER?!?My opinion? Most definitely, yes.Every state determines ballot order differently, so let’s look at those six states where 2% actually would have made a difference.New Hampshire (Electoral Votes: 4)According to CenterForPolitics.org ballot order is determined in New Hampshire by “party placed by total number of votes in last presidential election.”Who won the last election? Barack Obama. He’s a Democrat, so the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton was listed first on every ballot in New Hampshire and Hillary ended up winning New Hampshire by 0.4%.Minnesota (Electoral Votes: 10)Ballot order here is determined by “reverse order of votes for all statewide candidates in last election.” I grabbed my calculator and Googled the 2014 election results. The Libertarian Party received the fewest votes putting Gary Johnson first on the ballot.Democrats and Republicans received the most votes respectively putting Hillary last on the ballot and Trump second-to-last.Again, Hillary took advantage of the primacy and recency effect and ended up winning Minnesota by 1.5% while Trump got stuck in the middle.Wisconsin (Electoral Votes: 10)Now things get a little more interesting.Ballot order is determined in Wisconsin by “order of votes for party (governor) in previous election.”Who won the gubernatorial race in 2014? Scott Walker…a Republican. That puts the Republican candidate in the top spot.Donald Trump was listed first and won Wisconsin by just 0.8%. Had he been in the middle, he would have lost the estimated 2% boost from the ballot order effect, giving Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes to Hillary.Michigan (Electoral Votes: 16)How do they set ballot order in Michigan? “Order of votes for party in previous secretary of state election.”Who won the previous secretary of state election in Michigan? Ruth Johnson…Republican. That put Trump at the top of the ballot again, giving him a narrow 0.3% victory and all of Michigan’s electoral votes.Pennsylvania (Electoral Votes: 20)In Pennsylvania, the party in power is listed first on the ballot.Who is the majority leader of the Pennsylvania State Senate? Jake Corman…Republican. That put Trump at the top of every ballot in Pennsylvania, giving him a 1.2% edge and all of Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes.Florida (Electoral Votes: 29)Oh, Florida. With your hanging chads and other electile dysfunctions.Ballot order here is decided by “order of votes for party in previous election.”Who won the Florida gubernatorial race in 2014? None other than Rick Scott…a Republican and bald man, who has been described by the Miami media as “Donald Trump without the wig”.Again, Trump was first on every ballot and yet he only won by just 1.3%, capturing a whopping 29 electoral votes and sealing his victory.ConclusionBallot order gave Trump the edge he needed to win the presidency.Change the ballot in those six states and Hillary Clinton would have won with 293 electoral votes and the popular vote.I’m not here to whine about who should or should not be president. (I didn’t vote for Hillary or Donald.) It happened and it’s over.I’m more interested in asking, what do we do now?Now that we understand the impact of ballot order, most laws are simply outdated. Only twelve states mandate that ballot name order be rotated by precinct. Twelve!The solution is simple. Use randomized, rotational systems in every state. Let’s make America fair again.Now here’s the link for the free sample of True Influence that I promised: http://www.GoodAtPeople.com/huffpost"

Climate change deniers? Check. Proponents of dismantling public education? Check. Advocates for privatization, lowering taxes for the haves, and keeping the minimum wage low for the have-nots? Check, check and check. I almost wonder if it would be better not to have these agencies than to have people running them who want to turn them against their own missions.Trump voters responded to his mantra of jobs, jobs, jobs, and his pledge to help the little guy and stick it to elites. But that doesn’t square with his nomination of business executive Andrew Puzder to serve as secretary of labor. Puzder has shipped jobs overseas, promoted replacing workers with robots and fought increases to the minimum wage for low-wage workers like those at the fast-food restaurants his company owns. His company was fined for wage theft and required to pay back pay to workers after an investigation by the very department he may lead. You don’t make America great by trampling workers’ right to earn a living.Trump’s nomination of U.S. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to head the Department of Health and Human Services shows that he intends to strip access to health care for millions of Americans, including 8 million children. That’s what ending the Affordable Care Act and the Children’s Health Insurance Program would mean, if Price gets his way. Price also wants to privatize Medicare by giving seniors a voucher with which to try to buy health insurance, turning the right to health care that our seniors now have into a commodity.Betsy DeVos, Trump’s choice to serve as education secretary, has a long record of being anti-public education, a fact that should disqualify her from consideration. She has used her extraordinary wealth to destabilize and defund public schools, while promoting failed private school vouchers and unaccountable for-profit charter schools that have benefited their owners far more than the children they are supposed to serve. DeVos and her family have poured money into anti-gay causes such as so-called conversion therapy. And they have linked school choice to “greater kingdom gain,” coded language for using public funds to support making Christianity—not public schools—the center of communities, something our founders, in the First Amendment’s separation of church and state, zealously guarded against.Largely as a result of her efforts, Michigan—where DeVos focused her attacks on public education—tolerates more low-performing charter schools than just about any other state in the country. About 80 percent of Michigan’s charter schools are for-profit—more than any other state. And 67 percent of Michigan charter schools performed worse than neighborhood public schools on the Nation’s Report Card, a test administered by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. It’s all about money and ideology, not kids or the quality of education. How does that make America great for the 90 percent of students who attend public schools?Wilbur Ross, Trump’s choice to serve as secretary of commerce, has been called a vulture investor for his practice of extracting profits from troubled companies by slashing jobs, squeezing unions and gutting pensions. Steven Mnuchin, tapped to head the Treasury Department, made a fortune foreclosing on homeowners like a 90-year-old woman targeted for a 27-cent payment error. Not so great, in most people’s books.Whose side is Trump on? When a local union officer who has been leading the fight to save manufacturing jobs called out Trump for embellishing the number of jobs preserved at an Indiana Carrier plant through tax breaks for the corporation, Trump lashed out at him on Twitter. The Twitterverse turned on Trump in a storm of moral outrage, condemning him as anti-worker, dishonest, thin-skinned and a bully.With evidence of Russian interference in the election, and a president-elect poised to take office despite losing the popular vote by a much larger margin than any other president in history, we have a very divided country. Americans, even those who voted for Trump, did not vote for what is emerging to be a dangerous, extremist agenda that will end up hurting, not helping, many who call our nation home.It doesn’t make America great to undermine public education, undercut workers, restrict access to health care or pit people against each other. Standing up for our values and aspirations shows our true greatness. That’s what thousands of people will do on Jan. 19, when the Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools, which includes the AFT and community partners, will stage a Day of Action to protect our students and to fight against the president-elect’s agenda to dismantle public education. Nothing is more important than safeguarding our kids’ opportunity to live their lives and pursue their dreams free from fear—regardless of their background."

Their disdain for the Obama administration and the Clintons has left them feeling they had little choice but to support a demagogue.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5855f26c1c00001d000ec285.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My fiancé is friends with a right wing troll on Facebook. Anytime one of his posts addresses, yet another, incredulous act or comment by Donald Trump, this person responds with a comment about Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. In spite of my many attempts to point him to the subject at hand, he seems incapable of having a coherent conversation. He seems willfully ignorant of the horror unleashed upon our nation by the last election.He’s not alone, however. Many on the right seem to be drifting in a fog or euphoria. Clinton is out and Obama is leaving. Trump’s actions – creating the least educated cabinet in modern history, aligning himself with a Russian leader, avoiding intelligence briefings, upsetting the stock market by unhinged tweets, accepting the support of white supremacists, to name but a few – don’t seem to phase them.A 2015 Pew Research poll showed that only 13% of Republicans felt they could trust the government all or most of the time after six years of Obama’s presidency. Compare that to George Bush’s presidency where 47% of Republicans felt they could trust the government. Among politically engaged Republicans, 42% (compared to just 11% of engaged Democrats) were angry with the government at the time the poll was taken. Perhaps not surprisingly, nearly 1/3 of Republicans who said they were angry with the government, favored Donald Trump during the election season.It’s no secret that many on the right were led astray by fake news and meritless right wing media diatribes, such as Obama’s birth certificate, the war on Christians, climate change is only political, liberals want to take their guns away, etc., etc. Politifact shows 81% of the statements made by Rush Limbaugh, which they investigated, were either mostly false or outright lying. Fox News has a similar rating on Politifact at 59% ranging from mostly false to outright lying.Conservative Republicans have high stakes in this game. Their disdain for the Obama administration and the Clintons has left them feeling they had little choice but to support a demagogue. Facts about Trump, just like facts about their political nemeses, are irrelevant. This is an era of feelings.Yet, to be fair, many conservatives were left behind in globalization. Corporations moved plants offshore for cheaper labor and lower costs. Many people found themselves in a global economy where skills in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) are necessary to survive. In towns where factory work is a way of life, education was never presented as an option and many never saw the changes coming.Additionally, the Black Lives Matter movement has made little sense to conservative America. Most whites don’t know the history that sparked the movement and see it only as an excuse from poor, angry hooligans to go on shooting sprees against good cops. They perceive a black president standing on the side of criminals because they have no background to the historical reference of his words. Conservative white America, for the most part, did not take the same progressive journey over the last 8 years with the rest of the country. From where they stand, what little racial progress was made was done so at the expense of white America.Conservative, white evangelicals, more than any other religious affiliation, have refused to accept marriage equality, which was thrust upon them by the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2015. In 2016, according to Pew Research, just 27% of white evangelicals approved of marriage equality compared to 64% of white mainline Protestants, 58% of Catholics, 39% of black protestants, and 80% of those who identified as religiously unaffiliated. An authoritative presidency in the person of Donald Trump bodes well for a group who values order and authority.Neuroscientist, Antonio Damasio, said that humans are not thinking machines we are “feeling machines that think.” People who feel they have been wronged, gotten the short end of the stick, or have been left unemployed by the changes over the last eight years are angry, afraid, and feel out of control. When we feel out of control we tend to lash out, blame others, and defend our positions. We often do so despite evidence to the contrary. As Newt Gingrich famously told the CNN reporter, “I’ll go with how people feel and I’ll let you go with the [facts].” It doesn’t have to be logical; it just has to feel right.Humans have an uncanny ability to ignore personal incongruences. Whether we’re cheating on our spouses while expressing our undying love for them, driving gas guzzling cars while supporting environmental organizations, or supporting a candidate who exhibits the very behavior we said we despised in the incumbent, we can do it all with a straight face.Outside of Russia’s influence in the outcome of the election, whatever it was, Donald Trump is poised to take the presidency. The conversation must somehow move past partisanship and into a very real conversation about where the American people want the country to go."

Mr. Kalonji was incommunicado for 134 days during which time he was held in a hole and tortured. He did not know whether he would live or die.Youth leaders inside and outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo quickly mobilized to call attention to the capture and disappearance of Mr. Kalonji. After months of pressure, in the wake of rumors of his death, the government finally produced Mr. Kalonji and transferred him from the personal prison of Congo's National Intelligence Agency (ANR in French) to the general prison of Makala. When he arrived at the Makala prison, he joined fellow youth activists who had been imprisoned for almost a year. Both he and the other youth prisoners were ultimately released during the Spring and Summer of 2016.Mr. Kalonji's case represents the crux of the biggest challenge that president Kabila faces - courageous, educated, Congolese youth who are willing to put their lives on the line to fundamentally transform the socio-political landscape of the Congo. Jean-Marie Kalonji, a 29 year-old human rights activist, holds a degree in International Law from Université Chrétienne Cardinal Malula. He was part of the January 2015 #Telema uprisings that reversed the attempt by President Kabila to extend his stay in power via an electoral law that would require a census before the holding of elections.According to human rights groups, the Kabila regime's security forces killed 42 people and injured and arrested hundreds. Friends of the Congo visited a number of the injured youth at the hospital of the University of Kinshasa. The youth were riddled with bullets, one young woman had a bullet wound in her groin and a young man had a bullet penetrate his back and exited through his chest. Despite the fact that they were suffering from serious injuries, these youth were resolute about getting back in the streets, once healed, so they could pressure President Kabila to step down on December 19th per the country's constitution.Although respect for the Constitution is a critical aim of the youth and others in civil society, it is not their entire pursuit. Most Congolese do not know what is in the Constitution and certainly did not read its tenets before voting for it in 2006. Some do not know what a Constitution is. What people know is that there was an agreement for President Kabila to leave on a particular date and he is refusing to relinquish power. The Congolese people have suffered under his regime from negligence, disdain, contempt, corruption and the usual coterie of horrid social ills that leave Congo at the bottom of the United Nations Human Development Index.Jean-Marie Kalonji and a significant segment of Congolese youth believe that Kabila was imposed on them, first by a war of aggression by Congo's neighbors and subsequently by policies from Europe and the United States. When Joseph Kabila appropriated the 2011 elections and still received the backing of western nations, it sent a signal that they were complicit in the continued suffering of the Congolese people. When the-then United States Ambassador to the DR Congo, James Entwistle, announced on February 15, 2012, the US endorsement of the stolen elections, it sent a clear signal to the Congolese people that they would have to contend with the tyrannical regime for yet another half-decade backed by internationally legitimacy.The path forward for many Congolese youth is clear. They want to be free from tyranny more than the Kabila regime wants to repress them and deprive them of their God-given life pursuits. Although there is much ado about sanctions and pressure from the European Union and the United states, youth like Jean Marie Kalonji do not hold out hope for an external solution. They see the ultimate solution coming from their own agency as social justice advocates and an informed Congolese citizenry who seek to fundamentally and radically transform their society.Should Washington or London seek to bring support, the youth is clear that the policy of supporting tyrants in the region must end. U.S. support of authoritarian regimes such as Rwanda and Uganda has undermined democracy in the Great Lakes Region of Africa. Representative Ed Royce's letter to President Obama should inspire a fundamental change in US policy not only towards Rwanda but other ""friendly tyrants"" that the US support in Africa.In the Congo, the youth are prepared for a sustained civil disobedience undertaking to cripple and ultimately remove an oppressive system that not only kills them but also squelches their aspirations and hopes for a dignified life. Ultimately, it is through the agency of the Congolese youth and their vision for a new society, a new Congo that lasting change will happen. The youth have been engaged in a beautiful and sublime struggle for peace, justice and human dignity that will not only have an impact on a region encircled by strongmen but it will reverberate throughout the entire African continent.Note: an earlier version of this article stated that Kalonji holds a degree from Université Libre de Kinshasa (ULK). It has been corrected to say Université Chrétienne Cardinal Malula."

The driver of the Impala allegedly then got out of his car, approached her vehicle, and fired one shot into her car as she drove off.It wasn’t until after the grandmother pulled into a J.C. Penney department store’s parking lot, around 6:25 p.m., that she realized her grandson had been shot, Lt. Steven McClanahan told Reuters.The child was pronounced dead shortly after, police said.“The grandma and 3-year-old victim are innocent and have no relationship [with] the suspect,” the police department tweeted.A search remains underway for the gunman, who is described as a tall black male.Saturday’s road-rage shooting is the second to claim a child’s life in the city in less than a month.On Nov. 22, a 2-year-old girl was shot multiple times while sitting in the backseat of her aunt’s car, KTHV reported at the time.“As you can probably understand, that is very, very frustrating to our police agency as it should be to our community,” the city’s police chief, Kenton Buckner, said at a press conference Saturday night. “That case is still open.”"

58,BUSINESS,11 Secrets To Staying Productive And In Control,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/11-secrets-to-staying-pro_b_13521954.html,,2016-12-18,2016-12-08-1481239994-9857833-11SecretsToStayingProductiveAndInControlHP,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-08-1481239994-9857833-11SecretsToStayingProductiveAndInControlHP-thumb,"TalentSmart has given emotional intelligence tests to more than a million people and found that the upper echelons of top performance are filled with people who are high in emotional intelligence (90% of top performers, to be exact). The hallmark of emotional intelligence is self-control--a skill that unleashes massive productivity by keeping you focused and on track.Unfortunately, self-control is a difficult skill to rely on. Self-control is so fleeting for most people that when Martin Seligman and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania surveyed two million people and asked them to rank order their strengths in 24 different skills, self-control ended up in the very bottom slot.And when your self-control leaves something to be desired, so does your productivity.When it comes to self-control, it is so easy to focus on your failures that your successes tend to pale in comparison. And why shouldn't they? Self-control is an effort that's intended to help achieve a goal. Failing to control yourself is just that--a failure. If you're trying to avoid digging into that bag of chips after dinner because you want to lose a few pounds and you succeed Monday and Tuesday nights only to succumb to temptation on Wednesday by eating four servings' worth of the empty calories, your failure outweighs your success. You've taken two steps forward and four steps back.Since self-control is something we could all use a little help with, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that people who are high in emotional intelligence rely on to keep themselves productive and in control. They consciously apply these behaviors because they know they work. Some are obvious, others counter-intuitive, but all will help you minimize those pesky failures to boost your productivity.  1. They focus on solutions. Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you're facing, you create and prolong negative emotions which hinder self-control. When you focus on the actions you'll take to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people won't dwell on problems because they know they're most effective when they focus on solutions.2. They eat. File this one in the counter-intuitive category, especially if you're having trouble controlling your eating. Your brain burns heavily into your stores of glucose when attempting to exert self-control. If your blood sugar is low, you are far more likely to succumb to destructive impulses. Sugary foods spike your sugar levels quickly and leave you drained and vulnerable to impulsive behavior shortly thereafter. Eating something that provides a slow burn for your body, such as whole grain rice or meat, will give you a longer window of self-control. So, if you're having trouble keeping yourself out of the company candy bin when you're hungry, make sure you eat something else if you want to have a fighting chance.3. They forgive themselves. A vicious cycle of failing to control oneself followed by feeling intense self-hatred and disgust is common in attempts at self-control. These emotions typically lead to over-indulging in the offending behavior. When you slip up, it is critical that you forgive yourself and move on. Don't ignore how the mistake makes you feel; just don't wallow in it. Instead, shift your attention to what you're going to do to improve yourself in the future.Failure can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you'll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, failure results from taking risks and trying to achieve something that isn't easy. Emotionally intelligent people know that success lies in their ability to rise in the face of failure, and they can't do this when they're living in the past. Anything worth achieving is going to require you to take some risks, and you can't allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed. When you live in the past, that is exactly what happens, and your past becomes your present, preventing you from moving forward.4. They don't say yes unless they really want to. Research conducted at the University of California in San Francisco shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression, all of which erode self-control. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge for many people. ""No"" is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it's time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases like ""I don't think I can"" or ""I'm not certain."" Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them. Just remind yourself that saying no is an act of self-control now that will increase your future self-control by preventing the negative effects of over commitment.5. They don't seek perfection. Emotionally intelligent people won't set perfection as their target because they know it doesn't exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you're always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of moving forward excited about what you've achieved and what you will accomplish in the future.6. They stay positive. Positive thoughts help you exercise self-control by focusing your brain's attention onto the rewards you will receive for your effort. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, self-control is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, self-control is a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, or will happen, no matter how small. If you can't think of something from the current day, reflect on the past and look to the future. The point here is that you must have something positive that you're ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative, so that you don't lose focus.  7. They avoid asking ""What if?"" ""What if?"" statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, which are detrimental to self-control. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you'll spend taking action and staying productive (staying productive also happens to calm you down and keep you focused). Productive people know that asking ""what if? will only take them to a place they don't want--or need--to go. Of course, scenario planning is a necessary and effective strategic planning technique. The key distinction here is to recognize the difference between worry and strategic thinking.8. They sleep. I've beaten this one to death over the years and can't say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and maintaining your focus and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day's memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don't get enough--or the right kind--of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present, which are a major productivity killer. Being busy often makes you feel as if you must sacrifice sleep to stay productive, but sleep deprivation diminishes your productivity so much throughout the day that you're better off sleeping.When you're tired, your brain's ability to absorb glucose is greatly diminished. This makes it difficult to control the impulses that derail your focus. What's more, without enough sleep you are more likely to crave sugary snacks to compensate for low glucose levels. So, if you're trying to exert self-control over your eating, getting a good night's sleep--every night--is one of the best moves you can make.9. They exercise. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. If you're having trouble resisting the impulse to walk over to the office next door to let somebody have it, just keep on walking. You should have the impulse under control by the time you get back.10. They meditate. Meditation actually trains your brain to become a self-control machine. Even simple techniques like mindfulness, which involves taking as little as five minutes a day to focus on nothing more than your breathing and your senses, improves your self-awareness and your brain's ability to resist destructive impulses. Buddhist monks appear calm and in control for a reason. Give it a try.11. They ride the wave. Desire and distraction have the tendency to ebb and flow like the tide. When the impulse you need to control is strong, waiting out this wave of desire is usually enough to keep yourself in control. When you feel as if you must give in, the rule of thumb here is to wait at least 10 minutes before succumbing to temptation. You'll often find that the great wave of desire is now little more than a ripple that you have the power to step right over.Bringing It All TogetherThe important thing to remember is you have to give these strategies the opportunity to work. This means recognizing the moments where you are struggling with self-control and, rather than giving in to impulse, taking a look at these strategies and giving them a go before you give in.How do you stay productive and in control?

REUTERS/David Ryder",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7b4873c000018010da0ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Silence about injustice is our enemy now. We cannot remain silent when Donald Trump's cabinet picks have more money than one-third of Americans and are, as thousands of faith leaders have said a cabinet of bigotry. Mary, the mother of Jesus, knew this kind of gross economic disparity and bigotry was wrong. She called out the rich and the mighty for God's condemnation and even punishment, and she condemned the arrogant in no uncertain terms. When Mary knew she was pregnant, she greeted the impending birth with one of the most formidable hymns of liberation of the oppressed in the entire Christian scriptures as found in Luke 1:45-55.Called ""The Magnificat,"" this song praises God for God's liberating actions, not only on behalf of the singer, but on behalf of all the oppressed of the world. God is on the side of the poor, the exploited, and, importantly for this text, women who are sexually demeaned and despised. Mary goes so far as to call herself a ""slave,"" and yet she says she will be exalted by God. The Lukan version (unlike Matthew) mutes but does not dismiss what must have been a tradition of the illegitimacy of Jesus as Mary is ""engaged to a man whose name was Joseph"" and she becomes pregnant. It seems in this way that whatever was said of Jesus' illegitimacy at the time this gospel was composed would be seen as part of God's plan. But the fact remains that an unmarried, pregnant young woman is the one who sings this wonderful song of liberation and she sings it to Elizabeth, a formerly ""barren"" woman who is now pregnant and will become the mother of John the Baptist. Elizabeth, a woman who has been demeaned for failing to conceive, and who is now old (another way women are despised), receives the song of liberation. The unmarried pregnant woman sings it. Let's think about that carefully in regard to the sexual demeaning and shaming that has been part of the Trump candidacy, and seems likely to continue into his administration. But according to Mary's song as placed in Luke, women's sexuality is not a source of shame, but can be part of God's plan for the liberation of the oppressed. Thus, isn't the oppressive sexual shaming of women itself judged and dismissed as contrary to God's justice? Yes. Thus, Trump's sexual demeaning and shaming of women must be named as contrary to God's plan for human equality and liberation. Sexual and economic liberation are central in Mary's hymn. This could not be clearer. For those who would sexually shame a young woman who was humbled by being pregnant and unmarried, God has instead caused her to be called ""blessed.""And the unmarried, young pregnant woman goes on to sing that the humble are to be exalted, and the rich and mighty will be ""brought down"" from their thrones."" The hungry, she contends, are ""filled with good things,"" and the rich? Well, they are ""sent away empty."" According to the Women's Bible Commentary : 'Mary's song' is precious to women and other oppressed people for its concrete vision of their freedom from systemic injustice--from oppression by political rulers on their ""thrones"" and from the arrogant and rich.Is there a more appropriate message for this time where impending rule by the misogynists, the arrogantly racist and the obscenely rich is so blatant and so without precedent in our history? No. There is no clearer message than the one from Jesus' mother Mary to our time: rule by the rich and the arrogant, the proud and the mighty is an offense to God.Here is the really good news: God is on the side of sexually despised women, the poor, the humble and those without political power."

Easy peasy. From roast beef tenderloin with red wine sauce to rum cake, these tested and perfected recipes won't let you down -- and many of them can be made ahead of time so you can relax on the big day. Merry Christmas!1. Roast Beef Tenderloin with Red Wine SauceThis show-stopping beef tenderloin with a deeply flavored, richly colored red wine sauce is delicious and deceptively simple. The sauce can be prepared mostly ahead of time so there's very little fussing at the last minute. GET THE RECIPE2. Potatoes au GratinThis classic dish involves layering thinly sliced potatoes with heavy cream (a lot of it!) and grated cheese in a gratin dish, and then baking it until the cream reduces and blankets the potatoes in a rich, creamy sauce. GET THE RECIPE 3. Chicken MarbellaChicken Marbella is probably the most famous dish to come out of the beloved Silver Palate Cookbook by Julie Rosso and the late Sheila Lukins. The chicken is marinated a day ahead in garlic and herbs, and then baked with wine, brown sugar, prunes, capers and green olives. GET THE RECIPE4. Rolled Turkey Breast with Sausage & Herb StuffingThis rolled turkey breast with sausage stuffing beats a basic roast turkey any day of the year. Not only does it cook in just 1-1/4 hours, it can be made entirely ahead of time and is a cinch to carve. GET THE RECIPE5. Mashed Chipotle Cheddar Sweet PotatoesMost holiday sweet potato dishes are sweet enough to be dessert. But these mashed sweet potatoes are flavored with smoky, spicy chipotle peppers and sharp cheddar cheese, making them truly savory.  GET THE RECIPE6. Easy Slow-Cooked BBQ Boneless Short RibsYou can't beat meltingly tender short ribs slow-cooked in a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. And here's the best part: only 15 minutes of prep work and the oven does the rest.  GET THE RECIPE7. Buttermilk BiscuitsWith a fluffy inside and a toasty crust, these rich and buttery biscuits are the best to ever come out of my oven. You can throw the dough together in ten minutes and enjoy the biscuits with your meal less than fifteen minutes later. GET THE RECIPE8. The Easiest Roast Turkey You'll Ever MakeYou can't go wrong with a basic roast turkey for Christmas, and this is the easiest one you'll ever make. Serve it with stuffing, an over-the-top delicious gravy and  cranberry sauce. GET THE RECIPE9. Brussels Sprouts GratinPerfect for the holidays because it can be made ahead, this creamy Brussels sprouts gratin with a crunchy topping is always a crowd-pleaser. GET THE RECIPE10. Easy Sausage and Herb StuffingThis sausage and herb stuffing relies on store bought stuffing cubes, which eliminates the step of slicing and drying out the bread. Believe me, when you are using a pound of sausage and an entire stick of butter, the bread does not matter much! GET THE RECIPE11. Sweet & Spicy Roast Chicken with Carrots, Dates & PistachiosIn this festive dish, chicken is immersed in a honey, citrus, and chili-infused marinade, and then roasted on a sheet pan with carrots and dates. Before serving, herbs, scallions and pistachios are added for freshness, color, and crunch. Everything can be prepared and assembled a day in advance, so all that's left to do at dinnertime is pop it in the oven. GET THE RECIPE12. French Green Beans with ShallotsWith so many other flavors on the table, it's perfectly fine to keep your green vegetable simple. This dish has only three ingredients, but is much more than the sum of its parts. GET THE RECIPE13. Challah, Wild Mushroom and Herb StuffingBake your stuffing separate from the bird so that you can make it ahead of time and ensure that it gets nice and crispy on top. This version, loaded with an earthy mix of onions and vegetables, pairs beautifully with simple roast turkey. GET THE RECIPE14. Carrot Slaw with Cranberries, Toasted Walnuts & Citrus VinaigretteDried cranberries and toasted walnuts make this carrot slaw a colorful addition to your holiday feast. Plus, it's delicious with turkey sandwiches the next day. GET THE RECIPE 15. Balsamic Glazed Roasted BeetsIf you're a beet lover, you'll love (and maybe even obsess over) these simply prepared, gorgeous beets. They're oven-roasted, which intensifies their natural sweetness, and then tossed in a tart and syrupy balsamic reduction.  GET THE RECIPE  16. Easy Butternut Squash SoupThis has got to be the easiest butternut squash soup recipe ever. You start with pre-cut squash from the supermarket, then basically throw everything in a pot, simmer it, purée it and you're done. It's still everything you expect a classic butternut squash soup to be: silky, slightly sweet and full of flavor. GET THE RECIPE17. Rosemary FoccaciaFocaccia is a flavorful and easy-to-make Italian flat bread that feeds a crowd. This classic version is topped with coarse salt and fresh rosemary but other toppings can be added, such as thinly sliced tomatoes, olives or grated cheese, to name just a few. GET THE RECIPE18. Sausage LasagnaA wonderful choice for Christmas dinner since it feeds a crowd and can be made ahead, this foolproof lasagna is made with a quick sausage bolognese sauce and no-boil lasagna noodles. GET THE RECIPE19. Apple Pecan CrispWarm baked apples bubbling away in their own syrupy juices, topped with toasted pecans, old-fashioned rolled oats, and brown sugar -- served warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it's the ultimate cozy dessert. GET THE RECIPE20. Flourless Chocolate Cake with Meringue Topping A rich, fudgy slab of flourless chocolate cake topped with peaks of light, marshmallowy meringue -- this cake is as impressive as it is delicious. It's also gluten-free. GET THE RECIPE21. Pumpkin Cheesecake with Gingersnap Crust & Caramel SauceThis dessert is a bit of a project but it's the ultimate sweet ending to your Christmas feast -- and no one will miss that tired ol' pumpkin pie. GET THE RECIPE22. Pear & Dried Cherry Crisp with Walnut StreuselThis crisp is a standout, thanks to the combination of sweet D'Anjou pears and tart dried cherries, which are plumped up in an orange-scented caramel syrup before baking. GET THE RECIPE23. Dark Chocolate Bread PuddingSpiked with bourbon and served with ice cream, this comforting bread pudding tastes like a grown-up brownie sundae. GET THE RECIPE24. Almond BiscottiInspired by the almond biscotti served at the celebrated Zuni Cafe in San Francisco, these Italian-style cookies are everything you want biscotti to be: buttery, lightly sweet, crunchy but not tooth-shattering -- and delicious with after dinner coffee, tea or dessert wine. GET THE RECIPE25. Rum CakeMy grandmother loved to bake and was known near and far for her boozy butter and rum soaked pound cake. The cake was the hit of every family gathering, and no one ever passed through her kitchen without sneaking a thin slice. It's easy to make and perfect for the holidays! GET THE RECIPE"

64,ENTERTAINMENT,"The ""Fences"" Cast on Denzel, Viola, and Bringing the Pulitzer-Winning Play to the Screen","Nell Minow, ContributorMovie critic, corporate governance analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-fences-cast-on-denzel_b_13684764.html,,2016-12-18,2016-12-17-1481943655-4202914-ScreenShot20161216at9.57.00PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-17-1481943655-4202914-ScreenShot20161216at9.57.00PM-thumb.png,"My favorite film of the year is ""Fences,"" with a screenplay by the late August Wilson, based on his Tony and Pulitzer award-winning play. It stars many of the actors who appeared in the acclaimed 2012 Broadway production, including Denzel Washington, who plays former Negro League baseball player Troy and also directed, and Viola Davis, who plays Troy's wife, Rose. It was a thrill to get a chance to talk with four of the stars of the film, Stephen McKinley Henderson (Bono, Troy's best friend), Mykelti Williamson (Gabriel, Troy's brother, disabled by a WWII injury), Russell Hornsby (Lyons, Troy's older son), and Jovan Adepo (Cory, Troy's younger son). Williamson on the respect and care that goes into playing a character with cognitive impairment: The cognitive issue is TBI, which is Traumatic Brain Injury. On a scale of 1 to 100 it depends on how you are affected some people at 15 percent, some at 12, some 42, and so on. So you have to tell a story so I was actually led by the Holy Spirit to play it the way I played it. August Wilson's words were the guide but it took a lot of prayer and a lot of love and respect toward other people to create the human being that you see on screen. Injured people -- that's somebody's child too. They have a mother and a father, and they're capable of being loved and of loving somebody. That's what our trueline was; it was love, and so that's what you see. Denzel told us, ""Show us the love, whatever that means to you."" That's what you saw, that's why this is such a powerful love project from each one of us.Henderson has appeared in eight of Wilson's ten-play ""Pittsburgh Cycle,"" one for each decade of the 20th century. He spoke about the joy of Wilson's language, both familiar and poetic.I always say my misspent youth was preparing me for this poet playwright. By misspent youth I mean going to theater schools and working on Shakespeare, working on Sophocles, working on Moliere and Chekhov and all the poet playwrights. And so then to have this one come along with a song in my key with our culture, that was really quite something. And to have listened to the elders the way he did because you have to know your elders, you know the grandparents, know your great-grandma. I knew my great-grandmother and one of her friends and so hearing them talk and hearing uncles talk and going to the pool hall and going to the barbershop, all of that is pre-searched, researched and pre-searched, and having those rich words, with that whole legacy of all the great playwrights but also your own ancestors because it's Pittsburgh but it's also Kansas City, it's also Detroit, it's also Toledo -- it's a neighborhood and all the cities but Pittsburgh is where he listened. And so to do it and do it there, to film it there in Pittsburgh, having done the plays on the various stages across the country but then when it comes to filming it, to be in Pittsburgh, walking the streets where he walked and hearing the voices he heard and hearing his voice sometimes, that language is exalting. It's elevating and yet at the same time it's family. It's the words you heard.Adepo described the challenge of playing a character who is a teenager at the beginning of the play and an adult in the military at the end.I tried to create Cory's back-story that's not in the script. You want to respect the material, you want to stay within and use the outline that August creates for you. But the work that you are doing to create the character as a whole, you find that with the back-story that you create behind the script. So I wanted to give Corey a sense of life experience and that was something that I actually worked on with Viola. I had a couple of weeks between the last scene when I walked away from home and then coming back from the military. Viola was asking me questions like if I had fallen in love or what type of action did I see in battle or how often did I write home to her just to get my mind thinking about things outside of just what was on the pages. And I think that was what I used to create some sort of spine of what Cory had been through in those years and how that would've changed his personality and how he would react to certain situations especially coming back home for the final act.For Hornsby, playing the part of the older son, Lyons, who was abandoned by his father, helped him to work through his own issues about not having a father. Lyons had no father to speak of and so he wants to be helped, he wants to be told that he's loved. He wants to be just looked at lovingly and by his father especially. For a lot of men, there are father issues: you didn't know your father, your father wasn't around, or he just didn't give you the love that you felt you needed. A lot of times you don't recognize that until you look around and realize that there is a void in you which is keeping you from being able to love. You know the greatest joy of a man is just to love and be loved in return and if you don't know how to give that you are like ""Why is that disconnect? Wow."" My dad wasn't there and so for me it was deeply personal. I felt for the first time in my life, in my career I actually, it was cathartic and therapeutic because I brought my life to Lyons. I brought the real truth for the first time. I've lived so much life in the six years since we did this on Broadway. I was married longer, had my own son, brought a life into this world and so you realize that in order for you to move forward you have to let go. So that became a part of the experience. So Russell realized what he didn't have, what he didn't get all the time we were in rehearsal, the scenes with Corey and Bono, I was not realizing that that was me letting go."

Accompanied by soundtracks that are largely excerpts from pertinent passages in the ecclesiastical liturgy, the artworks demonstrate the aesthetic of machinery as well as the rhythm and condition of human life in the mass society. The complete set of these pieces are now on view at Lehnbachhaus in Munich (Germany), together with a huge site-specific wall installation and all his early films.Thomas Bayrle was born in Berlin (Germany) in 1937. Bayrle's work was on view at the Venice Biennale in 2003 and 2009 and at documenta, Kassel, in 1964, 1977, and 2012. The artist lives and works in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

The announcement was made as Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, began his holiday vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his oceanfront club in nearby Palm Beach, Florida.Mulvaney, 49, was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus.Mulvaney’s selection points to a strategy by Trump to cut government where he can. The president-elect in recent days has, for example, railed against what he has labeled a far too expensive new version of the Air Force One aircraft he will fly that Boeing is supposed to build.In a statement announcing his selection, Trump called Mulvaney a strong voice in Congress for “reining in out-of-control spending, fighting government waste and enacting tax policies that will allow working Americans to thrive.”“With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent,” Trump said.Mulvaney said the Trump administration “will restore budgetary and fiscal sanity back in Washington”.“Each day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard-earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hard-working Americans do every day,” Mulvaney said.Trump on Friday night vowed to seek approval from Congress to spend $1 trillion in new spending to rebuild America’s crumbling network of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure as a way to create jobs and make some needed repairs.“We are going to fix our country. It’s time. We have no choice. It’s time,” Trump said in Orlando, Florida.Democratic President Barack Obama had sought infrastructure spending but was thwarted by Republicans in Congress.(Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Dale Hudson)"

It cited an unidentified Chinese source.“This person said China has already received a claim request for the equipment from the U.S. side. Relevant parties from both sides have maintained smooth communication channels and believe this issue will be smoothly resolved,” the paper said.China’s Defence Ministry has yet to comment publicly on the issue.“The UUV was lawfully conducting a military survey in the waters of the South China Sea,” a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s a sovereign immune vessel, clearly marked in English not to be removed from the water - that it was U.S. property,” the official said.The Pentagon confirmed the incident at a news briefing on Friday, and said the drone used commercially available technology and sold for about $150,000.Still, the Pentagon viewed China’s seizure seriously since it had effectively taken U.S. military property.“It is ours, and it is clearly marked as ours and we would like it back. And we would like this not to happen again,” Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said.HEIGHTENED CONCERNSThe seizure will add to concerns about China’s increased military presence and aggressive posture in the disputed South China Sea, including its militarization of maritime outposts.A U.S. research group said this week that new satellite imagery indicated China has installed weapons, including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, on all seven artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea.The drone seizure coincided with sabre-rattling from Chinese state media and some in its military establishment after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump cast doubt on whether Washington would stick to its nearly four-decades-old policy of recognizing that Taiwan is part of “one China.”President Barack Obama said on Friday it was appropriate for Trump to take a fresh look at U.S. policy toward Taiwan, but he cautioned that a shift could lead to significant consequences in the U.S. relationship with Beijing, as the notion that Taiwan is part of “one China” is central to China’s view of itself as a nation.(Additional reporting by Josephine Mason and Meng Meng; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)"

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) also picked up on the misspelling, as he pointed out the seriousness of the situation.Trump’s Twitter posts came shortly after China’s Foreign Ministry said the two countries were working to “appropriately handle this issue.” The ministry later warned that “hyping up” the incident would not help ensure a smooth outcome, the Guardian reports.The drone was taken Thursday after being deployed by the oceanographic and surveillance vessel USNS Bowditch. On Friday, the Pentagon demanded its immediate return.Earlier this month, Trump sparked controversy when he spoke by phone with Taiwan’s president Tsai Ying-wen, breaking decades of U.S. policy with China, which claims sovereignty over island. He has also questioned why the United States must be bound by the “one China” policy. A state-run Chinese newspaper called Trump “as ignorant as a child” in response. During a press conference Friday at the White House, President Barack Obama said it’s fine for Trump to take a look at things through fresh eyes, but he warned against allowing the U.S.-China relationship to enter “into full conflict mode.”“For China, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket,” Obama said. “The idea of ‘one China’ is at the heart of their conception as a nation and so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what are the consequences.”Following Trump’s call with Taiwan, China’s Foreign Ministry said the policy that Taiwan is part of one China is the “political basis of the China-U.S. relationship.” Later Saturday, Trump added a twist to his position on the diplomatic dustup, saying that China should keep the drone.“We should tell China that we don’t want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!” he tweeted.This post has been updated with Trump’s Saturday night tweet that China should keep the drone."

Goethals is presiding over the sentencing hearing for Scott Dekraai, who pleaded guilty to killing his ex-wife and seven other people at a Seal Beach hair salon in 2011. The investigation into the jailhouse informant program arose when Dekraai’s defense attorney found that his client had been put in a cell next to a known snitch. Since then, the scope, secrecy and alleged malfeasance surrounding the county’s jail informant program has become a centerpiece of the Dekraai case and more than a dozen others.At Friday’s hearing, the judge threatened to initiate contempt proceedings against the sheriff and deputies who were involved in the informant scandal for continuing to fail to turn over evidence.“The last thing any judge wants to do is declare contempt hearings of public officials,” Goethals said. “Frankly, we are getting closer and closer in this case. To say this has been a painful process is a gross understatement. This case should have been resolved long ago except for the gross failures of the prosecution team, which continue to this day,” Goethals said. The D.A.’s office has been accused of turning a blind eye to the jailhouse informant scandal and has been tossed off the Dekraai case.Goethals ordered all Orange County Sheriff’s Department documents related to the informant program to be turned over to the court almost four years ago. And while some materials have continued to “wash ashore,” as Goethals has previously characterized the slow flow of evidence, it appears that the sheriff’s department has still failed to turn everything over.Citing a declaration submitted to the court in November from sheriff’s Cmdr. William Baker, who has been leading the internal search for records related to jail informants, Goethals also expressed dismay that efforts to uncover more materials appear to have begun just months ago.“I remind the sheriff that I’ve waited nearly four years ― that’s 200 weeks or 1,400 days,” Goethals said to Hutchens’ attorneys, as the sheriff was not in court, as usual for the hearing. “The entire Orange County community has been cheated,” Goethals said in court. “Those most grossly cheated are the community of Seal Beach and the defendant... . [The sheriff] shouldn’t underestimate this court’s determination to find the truth.”Earlier this month, the sheriff’s department turned over 5,600 pages of internal records related to jail informants, a volume of material so unwieldy that Goethals characterized it Friday as a “document dump” ― a deliberate attempt to obfuscate relevant evidence by handing it over amid a wealth of irrelevant material.“This is a classic strategy,” Goethals said. “This looks like that, folks.”Deputy County Counsel Kevin Dunn, who represents Hutchens, argued that the submission of the internal records was a “difficult situation” but one that was done in “good faith” by the sheriff and was not a “document dump.” He said the sheriff is determined to be responsive to the court’s orders.However, the sheriff, in turning over the latest cache of secret jail informant materials, also asked for a blanket seal on all of it, a request Goethals blasted from the bench. Doubtful of Hutchens’ “good faith,” Goethals said he’s “come to expect” these kind of tactics from the sheriff, who he said has taken “a variety of inconsistent positions” on why various materials her department has turned over must remain sealed off from the public. “I don’t know what her current position is,” he said with bewilderment.Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, Dekraai’s attorney, has been arguing since 2013 that a tainted snitch network in county jails has existed in secret for decades. In a series of blockbuster motions, Sanders has unearthed damning evidence that indicates county prosecutors and law officers have violated multiple defendants’ rights by illegally obtaining and sometimes withholding evidence received from jail informants. His discoveries have led to cases unraveling and even sentences being vacated. Embattled county prosecutors and members of law enforcement involved in the informant scandal have faced a wave of rebukes in recent weeks. On Thursday, the Justice Department announced that it has opened an investigation into the allegations that the sheriff’s and D.A.’s offices violated defendants’ rights through the use of the jail informant program. The announcement of the DOJ investigation comes less than two weeks after Goethals released a trove of notes from a once-secret document kept by sheriff’s deputies detailing their involvement. The 242 pages of notes, known as the “special handling log,” reveal the inner workings of the county’s informant program and appear to contradict testimony by multiple sheriff’s deputies who denied any knowledge of working with informants.The notes also describe deputies’ recruitment and utilization of informants, destruction and falsifying of documents, collaboration with prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies while operating “capers” to glean further evidence from inmates, and other schemes used to trick inmates into confessing to crimes. The log contains multiple entries from deputies who had previously testified in the Dekraai case that contradict their testimony on the use of jail informants.The pages represent just a fraction of the 1,157-page log, still largely under seal, which was in use from 2008 to 2013 and maintained by deputies who work in a branch of the department called “special handling,” which specifically deals with inmates and jail informants. Now, more than nine months after the database came to light, the sheriff’s department has still not offered its explanation as to why the database was apparently abruptly halted in 2013, just days after Goethals issued a broad order to turn over such information in the Dekraai case. Sheriff’s Lt. Mark Stichter, spokesman for the department, told The Huffington Post in August that the agency is still trying to determine why the database ended. It also remains unclear if the database is still being secretly used under a new name.Goethals appeared to be critical of the conduct of two former “special handling” deputies, William Grover and Ben Garcia, both implicated in the scandal, who, it was disclosed on Friday, had refused to answer questions from even their own department about why the log was terminated ― with the judge questioning why they were nonetheless able to keep their jobs. Goethals also read aloud from a new declaration from Baker, submitted to the court Friday, regarding two sheriff’s supervisors who gave interviews about the termination of the log and who later claimed those interviews were inaccurately described but then refused to explain what was inaccurate.Seemingly stupefied by the behavior of the sheriff’s department, Goethals clamored from the bench at one point: ‘What is going on over there?”The sheriff’s department continues to deny that a formal jail informant program even exists ― despite evidence such as the 1,157-page log. In June, after years of its own denials, the D.A.’s office unequivocally acknowledged that a jail informant program does exist and that sheriff’s deputies actively “recruited and utilized” informants and rewarded them for information. On Friday, Goethals addressed the baffling disparity between the two agency’s positions on the informant program saying, “To me, the horse has left the barn on what is going on in the jail.” The judge also cited a California appeals court opinion from November ― one that affirmed Goethals’ decision last year to remove the entire district attorney’s office from the Dekraai case over serious allegations of misconduct involving the jail informant program ― which concluded, based on the mounds of evidence that have already been found, that an informant program indeed exists in county jails with a “magnitude” of “systemic problems” that “cannot be overlooked.”"

75,THE WORLDPOST,"Russian Hacking May Have Helped Trump Win, but Russians Don't Really Care","Maria Snegovaya, ContributorFreelance Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-us-hack_us_58548529e4b08debb7895c2a,"Meanwhile, the president-elect says maybe this wasn’t such a bad thing for America.",2016-12-17,"America is up in arms about the possibility that Russian hacking influenced the election, but Russians aren't so sure. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58548e901800002c00e431bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The recent CIA revelations that allege Russia assisted U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in his election win and reports of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direct involvement with this interference are widely discussed in the United States, but they have so far created surprisingly little hype in Russia. In the past, when allegations of meddling first took shape, much of the Russian state-run media and public I encountered remained largely indifferent. News outlets and people on the street completely ignored or simply ridiculed the possibility that the Kremlin had intervened in American politics, and government officials demanded that the U.S. provide proof before making such lofty claims. New updates in the hacking scandal this week have done little to change this perception in Russia. But that apathetic attitude in light of the severity of the assessments is making some Americans even more anxious about the extent to which Putin may or may not have played a role in choosing their new leader. In the U.S., there is a degree of division in judgments of the findings, with some exercising caution even amid recent reports indicating Putin’s personal involvement and President Obama’s vow to retaliate. But among the views I surveyed from Russian commentators, my Twitter feed and my close contacts in the country, few openly accepted the possibility that the CIA was correct in its assessment ― even those who openly oppose the Kremlin.In pro-establishment circles, the initial euphoria from Trump’s victory that culminated in a champagne celebration in Russia’s state parliament has been replaced by a moderate optimism on the side of many pro-Kremlin commentators. The slight lowering of optimism among pro-government perspectives may have to do with Trump’s observed unpredictability, lack of balance and low tolerance of criticism. The Kremlin prefers to wait and see.Yet Trump’s victory might have already influenced the Kremlin’s domestic policymaking. According to some Kremlin-associated sources quoted in Russian media, in the event of a Clinton victory the Kremlin had planned to move the upcoming Russian 2018 presidential elections to an earlier date as a result of a worsening economic situation, falling ratings of incumbent politicians and fear that the new Clinton administration would aim to “destabilize” Russia. However, Trump’s victory seemingly reassured the Kremlin that the new U.S. administration won’t interfere in Russia’s domestic affairs.Trump, who was perceived as a Russia-friendly candidate throughout the presidential campaign in both the U.S. and Russia, is not viewed as a threat in the Kremlin in the same way that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was. Clinton herself acknowledged Moscow’s animosity towards her, saying Putin’s “personal beef” with her may have led his country to pursue the alleged hacking campaign. She also reportedly said the Russian president contributed to her election loss. The Kremlin is thus hopeful that Trump’s promises to lift sanctions against Russia will aid parts of the Russian economy and allow for strengthening elite cohesion. Some Russian elites, who were previously hurt by the sanctions and became increasingly dissatisfied with Putin’s foreign policy, will once again have reason to rally around Putin.Indeed, the excitement surrounding Trump is not new news and Russia has not made its preferences a secret. Since the beginning of the U.S. electoral cycle Russia’s pro-Kremlin media didn’t hide their pro-Trump sympathies, even as Russian broadcasting on the U.S. remained biased and aggressive in other areas. In the last several years Russian TV anchors, such as Vladimir Solovyov, Dmitry Kiselyov and Petr Tolstoy took the habit of discussing U.S. policies and establishment in a derogatory manner, and mocking and criticizing most of the policy decisions of the Obama administration. Some of the comments went completely overboard. In one of his weekly news shows following the announcement of the U.S. election results, host Dmitry Kiselyov said that, “Obama was throwing his arms about as if he was in the jungle” in his first meeting with Trump. But once the initial hype over Trump’s victory wore down a bit, the tone of the mainstream state-owned broadcasts has abruptly shifted to become much more peaceful and empathetic of America, at least Trump’s America. In fact, the negativity remains pronounced only in coverage of the Democrats or the Obama administration. But when it comes to Trump’s new appointments or broader Russia-U.S.-related policy issues, the media tone has become much more neutral and somewhat sympathetic to the States. The Russian pro-Kremlin media largely describe recent Trump’s appointments, such as Michael Flynn as the national security adviser, and Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state, as promising and allowing for possibilities of improvement in the U.S.-Russia relationship and sanctions lift. Both Flynn and Tillerson are painted as the people who can “negotiate and make deals.” In the latter case, Tillerson is described as one of very few Republicans with such good Russian connections that he “can only compare to Kissinger on the overall number of contacts in Russia.” Russian media referenced one of Tillerson’s speeches in which he stated that his approach to sanctions on Russia is “similar to that of his friend, Mr. [Igor] Sechin,” a Russian official and the chief executive of Russian oil company, Rosneft, with close connections to Vladimir Putin.But there’s a limit to Russia’s newly expressed love for America. When it comes to the reports of Russia’s role in the hacking of the U.S. election, for instance, state-run Russian media outlets remain in denial that the allegations could be remotely true. Instead, media in the country often cover the CIA disclosures in a derogatory way, describing them as a “farce.” Some even go so far as to call the attacks the “ultimate [attempt from the Democrats to] justify their defeat before their supporters.” But the explanations promoted by the most odious of Russian TV anchors, such as Vladimir Solovyov, is that the CIA investigations have to do with the internal fights and competition among U.S. secret services and their attempts to block Trump’s inauguration. The recent revelations regarding Putin’s own possible involvement in efforts to disrupt the U.S. presidential election similarly drew very little media and public attention, with the president’s own staff brushing one report as “laughable nonsense.”A number of Russians get the majority of their news via Kremlin-controlled TV channels, but they tend to be as skeptical about Russia’s ability to influence the U.S. as the media they consume. While most pro-establishment circles are moderately optimistic about Trump’s presidency, the absolute majority of the Russians I’ve come into contact with both in person and online remain unaware of the U.S. political scandals, even those involving Russia.Regular people on the streets of Russia have also reacted similarly. In conversations with Russian friends of many different political persuasions, their opinion ranged from “what is new here? we’ve heard it before”, to “[the] CIA lied so many times before and [is] untrustworthy.” Others are even more dismissive.In a discussion over Facebook, Alexei Kovalev, former head of Russia’s InoSMI media platform, which aggregates and translates Western media for Russian audiences, says that the CIA revelations are untrustworthy, “because [the] CIA [is a group of] professional and systematic liars, who no one trusts anymore. There is no evidence to support their claims. It is impossible to seriously discuss [the Washington Post article[s] that comes from “one anonymous source from the [CIA’s] security services.”This dismissive approach to the issue is also partly explained by the Russian opposition tendency to view every Putin action as a failure, in addition to the fact that despite their disapproval of the Kremlin, many people that I talked to among Russia’s opposition still supported Trump over Hillary for his more favorable rhetoric in reference to Russia. Yet even the Kremlin critics I know in Russia are still skeptical and generally uninterested in the recent CIA disclosures.The sweeping support for Trump seems to give the Russian government a lot of reason to want the election to swing in favor of the current president-elect. And given Russia’s (and Vladimir Putin’s) longing for the lost great power status, one would expect the Russian leadership and the public to jump at the opportunity to take credit for its alleged ability to swing the elections in the United States.  So why did the Russian authorities choose to let this opportunity pass? Several explanations come to mind. Anything from the desire to maintain Russia-U.S. relations, to the continued support of a future Trump presidency could explain the prolonged secrecy. As it happened in eastern Ukraine, denying the Russian involvement in the conflict and hiding its ultimate goals allows the Kremlin to effectively exercise the ability to cause a stronger adversary (the United States) to voluntarily choose the actions most advantageous to Russian objectives by shaping the U.S perceptions of the situation ― a strategy the Russian government could likely be employing in the case of the U.S. election as well. Still, even with all of the possible reasons for Russian government involvement in America’s election process, a large part of Russian society remain consumed by the country’s domestic news, such as opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s recent announcement to take part in the upcoming presidential elections, instead. And many Russians remain largely unaware of international developments like that of the U.S. election.

76,THE WORLDPOST,"Russian Hacking May Have Helped Trump Win, but Russians Don't Really Care","Maria Snegovaya, ContributorFreelance Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-us-hack_us_58548529e4b08debb7895c2a,"Meanwhile, the president-elect says maybe this wasn’t such a bad thing for America.",2016-12-17,"U.S. President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss transition plans in the White House in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C. onNovember 10, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585489c21c000011070ec0c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The recent CIA revelations that allege Russia assisted U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in his election win and reports of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direct involvement with this interference are widely discussed in the United States, but they have so far created surprisingly little hype in Russia. In the past, when allegations of meddling first took shape, much of the Russian state-run media and public I encountered remained largely indifferent. News outlets and people on the street completely ignored or simply ridiculed the possibility that the Kremlin had intervened in American politics, and government officials demanded that the U.S. provide proof before making such lofty claims. New updates in the hacking scandal this week have done little to change this perception in Russia. But that apathetic attitude in light of the severity of the assessments is making some Americans even more anxious about the extent to which Putin may or may not have played a role in choosing their new leader. In the U.S., there is a degree of division in judgments of the findings, with some exercising caution even amid recent reports indicating Putin’s personal involvement and President Obama’s vow to retaliate. But among the views I surveyed from Russian commentators, my Twitter feed and my close contacts in the country, few openly accepted the possibility that the CIA was correct in its assessment ― even those who openly oppose the Kremlin.In pro-establishment circles, the initial euphoria from Trump’s victory that culminated in a champagne celebration in Russia’s state parliament has been replaced by a moderate optimism on the side of many pro-Kremlin commentators. The slight lowering of optimism among pro-government perspectives may have to do with Trump’s observed unpredictability, lack of balance and low tolerance of criticism. The Kremlin prefers to wait and see.Yet Trump’s victory might have already influenced the Kremlin’s domestic policymaking. According to some Kremlin-associated sources quoted in Russian media, in the event of a Clinton victory the Kremlin had planned to move the upcoming Russian 2018 presidential elections to an earlier date as a result of a worsening economic situation, falling ratings of incumbent politicians and fear that the new Clinton administration would aim to “destabilize” Russia. However, Trump’s victory seemingly reassured the Kremlin that the new U.S. administration won’t interfere in Russia’s domestic affairs.Trump, who was perceived as a Russia-friendly candidate throughout the presidential campaign in both the U.S. and Russia, is not viewed as a threat in the Kremlin in the same way that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was. Clinton herself acknowledged Moscow’s animosity towards her, saying Putin’s “personal beef” with her may have led his country to pursue the alleged hacking campaign. She also reportedly said the Russian president contributed to her election loss. The Kremlin is thus hopeful that Trump’s promises to lift sanctions against Russia will aid parts of the Russian economy and allow for strengthening elite cohesion. Some Russian elites, who were previously hurt by the sanctions and became increasingly dissatisfied with Putin’s foreign policy, will once again have reason to rally around Putin.Indeed, the excitement surrounding Trump is not new news and Russia has not made its preferences a secret. Since the beginning of the U.S. electoral cycle Russia’s pro-Kremlin media didn’t hide their pro-Trump sympathies, even as Russian broadcasting on the U.S. remained biased and aggressive in other areas. In the last several years Russian TV anchors, such as Vladimir Solovyov, Dmitry Kiselyov and Petr Tolstoy took the habit of discussing U.S. policies and establishment in a derogatory manner, and mocking and criticizing most of the policy decisions of the Obama administration. Some of the comments went completely overboard. In one of his weekly news shows following the announcement of the U.S. election results, host Dmitry Kiselyov said that, “Obama was throwing his arms about as if he was in the jungle” in his first meeting with Trump. But once the initial hype over Trump’s victory wore down a bit, the tone of the mainstream state-owned broadcasts has abruptly shifted to become much more peaceful and empathetic of America, at least Trump’s America. In fact, the negativity remains pronounced only in coverage of the Democrats or the Obama administration. But when it comes to Trump’s new appointments or broader Russia-U.S.-related policy issues, the media tone has become much more neutral and somewhat sympathetic to the States. The Russian pro-Kremlin media largely describe recent Trump’s appointments, such as Michael Flynn as the national security adviser, and Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state, as promising and allowing for possibilities of improvement in the U.S.-Russia relationship and sanctions lift. Both Flynn and Tillerson are painted as the people who can “negotiate and make deals.” In the latter case, Tillerson is described as one of very few Republicans with such good Russian connections that he “can only compare to Kissinger on the overall number of contacts in Russia.” Russian media referenced one of Tillerson’s speeches in which he stated that his approach to sanctions on Russia is “similar to that of his friend, Mr. [Igor] Sechin,” a Russian official and the chief executive of Russian oil company, Rosneft, with close connections to Vladimir Putin.But there’s a limit to Russia’s newly expressed love for America. When it comes to the reports of Russia’s role in the hacking of the U.S. election, for instance, state-run Russian media outlets remain in denial that the allegations could be remotely true. Instead, media in the country often cover the CIA disclosures in a derogatory way, describing them as a “farce.” Some even go so far as to call the attacks the “ultimate [attempt from the Democrats to] justify their defeat before their supporters.” But the explanations promoted by the most odious of Russian TV anchors, such as Vladimir Solovyov, is that the CIA investigations have to do with the internal fights and competition among U.S. secret services and their attempts to block Trump’s inauguration. The recent revelations regarding Putin’s own possible involvement in efforts to disrupt the U.S. presidential election similarly drew very little media and public attention, with the president’s own staff brushing one report as “laughable nonsense.”A number of Russians get the majority of their news via Kremlin-controlled TV channels, but they tend to be as skeptical about Russia’s ability to influence the U.S. as the media they consume. While most pro-establishment circles are moderately optimistic about Trump’s presidency, the absolute majority of the Russians I’ve come into contact with both in person and online remain unaware of the U.S. political scandals, even those involving Russia.Regular people on the streets of Russia have also reacted similarly. In conversations with Russian friends of many different political persuasions, their opinion ranged from “what is new here? we’ve heard it before”, to “[the] CIA lied so many times before and [is] untrustworthy.” Others are even more dismissive.In a discussion over Facebook, Alexei Kovalev, former head of Russia’s InoSMI media platform, which aggregates and translates Western media for Russian audiences, says that the CIA revelations are untrustworthy, “because [the] CIA [is a group of] professional and systematic liars, who no one trusts anymore. There is no evidence to support their claims. It is impossible to seriously discuss [the Washington Post article[s] that comes from “one anonymous source from the [CIA’s] security services.”This dismissive approach to the issue is also partly explained by the Russian opposition tendency to view every Putin action as a failure, in addition to the fact that despite their disapproval of the Kremlin, many people that I talked to among Russia’s opposition still supported Trump over Hillary for his more favorable rhetoric in reference to Russia. Yet even the Kremlin critics I know in Russia are still skeptical and generally uninterested in the recent CIA disclosures.The sweeping support for Trump seems to give the Russian government a lot of reason to want the election to swing in favor of the current president-elect. And given Russia’s (and Vladimir Putin’s) longing for the lost great power status, one would expect the Russian leadership and the public to jump at the opportunity to take credit for its alleged ability to swing the elections in the United States.  So why did the Russian authorities choose to let this opportunity pass? Several explanations come to mind. Anything from the desire to maintain Russia-U.S. relations, to the continued support of a future Trump presidency could explain the prolonged secrecy. As it happened in eastern Ukraine, denying the Russian involvement in the conflict and hiding its ultimate goals allows the Kremlin to effectively exercise the ability to cause a stronger adversary (the United States) to voluntarily choose the actions most advantageous to Russian objectives by shaping the U.S perceptions of the situation ― a strategy the Russian government could likely be employing in the case of the U.S. election as well. Still, even with all of the possible reasons for Russian government involvement in America’s election process, a large part of Russian society remain consumed by the country’s domestic news, such as opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s recent announcement to take part in the upcoming presidential elections, instead. And many Russians remain largely unaware of international developments like that of the U.S. election. So regardless of if the allegations against Putin and the Russian state prove true, many Russians won’t be all that concerned. Instead, they will continue to focus on the issues that they believe impact them the most ― local Russian politics and their own impending presidential election. "

There are a lot of things that can go wrong, and you need to keep them all in mind when planning your trip. Read on for some tips on traveling safely.While travelling with friends and family is a great way to make memories, try travelling alone sometimes. You will find that all the activities you experience will seem just as vivid and memorable when you travel solo, and the freedom to do whatever YOU want do will seem incredibly liberating!There are some criminals in foreign cities that pretend to be police officers, so be careful. Do not give over your personal information, as you could end up with no identification fast. If you are asked to go to an office with them, walk. In order to stay safe, never ride in a car with someone you don’t know.A great travel tip is to shop around online for the best hotel deal. There are plenty of sites such as Priceline.com, where you can find and book the best hotel deal. Sites like these are great because they include all of the information in one place instead of you having to go looking for it all.When you arrive at your hotel location, check out the local brochures. A lot of brochures offer fun and affordable activities within the area. Some travel pamphlets even offer coupons for more than one person and have little maps to guide you in the right direction. Local brochures can be a fun way to explore a new area.Consider attaching small bells to your carry-on bag. If you are worried that someone might steal or tamper with your luggage during a flight, attach bells to it. Inexpensive, Christmas jingle bells will do nicely. The noise is likely to deter criminals. If not, the noise will draw your attention.If you need a rental car while on vacation consider renting an eco-friendly car. Zipcar and Flexcar are both “green” car-sharing programs which offer travelers low fees and convenient drop off and pick up. You will be able to reduce car emissions by renting the smallest car you can or a hybrid car.If you travel with a lot of electronic devices, be sure to pack an outlet strip in your bag. Many hotel rooms have a limited number of outlets, and they are often behind furniture or in inconvenient places. By using your own outlet strip, you will have plenty of room to plug in all of your various chargers.Buses have long been looked upon as a cheap, uncivil way to travel. However, travel via bus is much better today than it used to be. Buses are clean and have amenities like Wi-fi and outlets to plug in your electronics. You can find several bus companies that provide trips to and from large cities.Use the airline miles you have accumulated to save the cost of the flights to a destination. There is really no good reason to save them if you are looking to make some travel plans, but look into the conversion of cash to airline miles. If your flight costs less than $300 you may want to go ahead and pay for them with cash.When you’re searching online for the best budget travel deals on flights, don’t go straight to the airline’s web site or even to a booking site. Instead, start with one of the numerous search sites that will scan multiple airline and booking sites and find the best deal for you. You may want to make use of more than one of these sites, to make sure you don’t miss out on the lowest fare.If you use a wheelchair, make sure to let the airline know beforehand. This way they will reserve a special seat for you and make any other accommodations that you may need. If you are using a travel agent to make your reservations, make sure they make the special arrangements for you.As you can see, there are a lot of things to think about for budget travel to stay safe when traveling, whether you’re planning a trip or are already at the destination. Make sure to keep this article as a checklist so you can be sure not to forget anything you need to stay safe.For more information about Budget Travel, check out The Booking Guru."
78,ENTERTAINMENT,Reality TV Fans Conflicted About The New 'Celebrity Apprentice' Due To Trump EP Credits,"Shira Hirschman Weiss, ContributorWriter, Blogger, Regular contributor to local newpapers in Ber...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reality-tv-junkies-snooki-fans-conflicted-about_us_58556a6ae4b0d5f48e164fe0,“It’s certainly unprecedented that a president would be tied to a reality show.”,2016-12-17,"<p><a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a> when he appeared on the original <em>Celebrity Apprentice</em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5859c0971800001d00e43cc3.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_300_282%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"By now we all know Donald Trump has executive producer credits on The New Celebrity Apprentice. Despite “new” in its title and Trump having been allegedly cut off by NBC during his campaign, in Wikipedia’s words: “Trump remains as an executive producer through the show’s production company, MGM.” The MGM connection highlights that things are more nuanced than they seem and perhaps NBC is not yet fully in bed with Trump. So many things are still unclear as I write this.We don’t know for sure whether or not royalties (from the show that would go to Trump) will be placed in a blind trust. Historically that has been “the presidential way” (with money made by a president during his term). Trump might want to announce something of that ilk to avoid criticism and to evade adding fuel to the fire of clause violation-related discussions. Perhaps Trump should take to Twitter to announce that all money going his way will instead go directly to charities or, as LA Entertainment Lawyer Brad Smalls suggests, to veterans.While the celebrity cast and Arnold Schwarzenegger (the’Celeb Apprentice’ boss, Trump’s former role) appeared before the media for a press conference, they were ceaselessly queried about Trump’s involvement. In response, Schwarzenegger teased the entertainment reporters about their sudden interest in politics.Says attorney Small: “It’s certainly unprecedented that a president would be tied to a reality show.” He admits he will be tuned in this season because Trump’s executive producer credit has him curious as an entertainment lawyer and a viewer. Small caught some past seasons of (the old) ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ with Donald just like I did.“It will be interesting to see which companies are tied in with the tasks, adds Small, “For instance, Trump recently excluded Twitter from his meeting with tech companies... There will be conflicts for companies because Trump has a stake in the show. There will be eyeballs on this show and on those businesses that join in for tasks.”While Kellyanne Conway spoke on the president-elect’s behalf and informed media that Trump will work on the show in his “spare time” (you know... ALL that time Obama spent golfing? Well, that was the gist of a Conway reference), Trump himself issued a contradictory tweet that he would NOT be working on the show. Small, nevertheless, envisions Trump’s EP credit as garnering “eyeballs” (whether purposely or not) as a way for Trump to characteristically maintain control over a project he started, and as a way to make nice with NBC (a pattern if we look at Trump’s recent overtures with Romney, Carson and finally sitting down with the ‘NY Times’, as well as other seemingly conciliatory moves post-election). Small also points out a fact that his wife stumbled upon through her own Googling efforts: TV producer Mark Burnett, responsible for ‘The Apprentice’ franchise as a whole - who had his own prior fallout with Trump - is producing the presidential inauguration! The lines have become so blurred that you might as well watch ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ for the challenges that go down between guilty pleasure favorite personalities, our fawned over C-list celebs and most exalted reality stars.I polled fans of shows like ‘The Real Housewives’ and while the majority did not watch previous seasons of ‘Celebrity Apprentice’, many who did said they refused to tune in this season due to The Donald factor.“Even if he isn’t actively working on it,” said a woman named Rachel, “He has an EP credit and I just can’t support that. I love Kyle Richards and Porsha Williams who are contestants... I may be cutting off my nose to spite my face, but so be it.”Ever since Trump entered the political arena, shook it up and offended many during his campaign, I too have felt ashamed of the following: I used to enjoy him immensely on the ‘Celebrity Apprentice’. Upon reflection, his manner with female contestants was somewhat smarmy (even then) in my eyes, but I compartmentalized for my selfish TV viewing enjoyment. I could never predict then that Trump would get involved with politics and while I personally didn’t support him during the election, I couldn’t help internally agreeing with my friend Monique who wrote: “This season’s ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ is starring Arnold (Schwarzenegger)? WTH?? They might as well not bother. The best part was Trump. I want the REAL ‘Celebrity Apprentice’.” Trump was entertainment in the good ole days.As an attorney, Brad Small does not see anything explicitly illegal about Trump’s stake in the show, but he points out that there’s much discussion about Trump’s other business matters and what exactly he will or will not do to avoid scrutiny. (At issue: international business for his hotels). When the Constitution was written, it was developed so that presidents would never take bribes or foreign payments that gave them powers likening them to historic kings. Small points out that former presidents have taken painstaking efforts and gone above and beyond to avoid such scrutiny. Donald certainly has seemed more brazen and less concerned in comparison.With all that is stated above, should you tune in to ‘The New Celebrity Apprentice’ for entertainment value, you can keep in mind that the celebrities have said (whether it’s boilerplate verbage or not) that they are excited to do these tasks for charity, a truly noble and good thing!Regardless, I believe that those who truly cannot resist the temptation of the shit-show that has always been “The Celebrity Apprentice” will ultimately tune in. In addition to the aforementioned Real Housewives Kyle Richards and Porsha Williams, ‘80s icon Boy George is a contestant along with Jon Lovitz and Carnie Wilson.Reflective of what one young woman named Jen wrote on Facebook, there are ways to assuage one’s guilt watching The New Celebrity Apprentice: “I used to love ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ and I really, really want to watch this coming season,” she says, “but I’m conflicted because I don’t want to support Trump in anything he does. I think I’ll just ‘tax’ myself, and send $25 to a different charity for each episode I watch.”Now THAT is an original idea for those facing a moral dilemma.Celebrity Apprentice premieres Monday January 2nd, 2017 at 8/7CT.
