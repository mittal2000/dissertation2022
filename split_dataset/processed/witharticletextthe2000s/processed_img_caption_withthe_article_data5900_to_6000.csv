0,POLITICS,Senators Say White House Hardliners Seek To Poison Immigration Talks,Igor Bobic and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/durbin-graham-trump-immigration_us_5a5e4b40e4b0c59bc1f95a12,"""This has turned into a s-show,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham said during a Senate hearing.",2018-01-16,Sens. Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham are part of a bipartisan group working to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5e4b8d2200004b00b4eb52.jpeg?cache=Op6WFARBnR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) blame White House staffers for standing in the way of a deal to help undocumented people who came to the U.S. as children. “We cannot do this with people in charge at the White House who have an irrational view on how to fix immigration,” Graham told reporters Tuesday outside the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testified at a routine oversight hearing.Graham, who has become one of President Donald Trump’s best friends in the Senate after being a harsh critic during the 2016 White House race, added that he didn’t think the president was “well served by his staff” on the immigration issue.Durbin said he suspects top White House aide Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, was trying to tank a bipartisan compromise. “Any effort to kill immigration reform usually has Mr. Miller’s fingerprints on it,” Durbin said.The two senators are pushing for a bipartisan plan that would bring relief to so-called Dreamers, many of whom could lose deportation protections and work permits because Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. But they’ve been dealing with mixed signals sent by Trump. At times he’s stressed he wants to help Dreamers, but he’s also undercut a possible deal by demanding support for his signature campaign issue ― a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ― that is a non-starter for Democrats. He’s also surrounded himself with immigration hardliners, including Miller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who as the head of the Homeland Security Department in the administration’s early months aggressively pursued deportations and a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries. Durbin suggested Republican lawmakers who share the hardline stances on immigration ― such as Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia ― were invited to a bipartisan meeting last Thursday at the White House in order to scuttle the negotiations on DACA.“The idea was clearly to outnumber us and to kill our efforts,” Durbin told reporters on Tuesday.Democrats want a deal passed by the end of the week, and many have said they won’t support a must-pass spending package unless Dreamer protections are a part of it ― something that could threaten a government shutdown if Republicans can’t approve funding on their own. Frequent negotiations between the White House and Congress only started in earnest this month, even though Trump announced the end of DACA in September. Since then, congressional aides and other sources have warned that Miller might be trying to sink the talks, first when the White House demanded a long wishlist of changes to immigration policy in October, then again when it reiterated them earlier this month. A document sent to senators in early January with the White House’s immigration priorities was authored by Miller, according to the file.Lawmakers said progress was being made on DACA talks last week, but the negotiations were thrown into turmoil when Trump at Thursday’s bipartisan meeting made racist comments, according to some of those at the session.The president referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” and said that instead of immigrants from those areas, he would like more from Norway, according to reports confirmed by Durbin. (Trump, backed by Perdue and Cotton, has denied he said those words; Nielsen, who was also in the room, has supported his version of what transpired, although she said there were curse words said by various people during the meeting.)The White House gathering didn’t go how Graham expected it to, he said during Tuesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Around 10 a.m. on Thursday last week, Durbin spoke to Trump on the phone and afterward told Graham the chat had gone well, the Republican senator said. They then planned a meeting at the White House around noon.“What happened between 10 and 12?” Graham said during the hearing.He then made a plea directly to Trump.“If the president’s watching: I’m still in the phone book. Don’t give my number out, but call me,” Graham said, a reference to Trump publicizing the senator’s cell phone number in 2015 when both were seeking the GOP presidential nomination.Graham, resisting the temptation to directly use a vulgar term, added: “This has turned into a s-show and we need to get back to being a great country where Democrats and Republicans work together to do something that we should have done years ago.”At a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed the idea that anyone other than Trump was in control and said that he was the one who invited Cotton and Perdue to the meeting with Graham and Durbin. She said Trump shot down the senators’ proposal because it was “simply a complete failure in terms of a good deal.”“To be very clear, the president’s running the show here at the White House,” Sanders said.The story has been updated with Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ comment."

The “Alias” actress, who’s busy gearing up for her next action project “Peppermint,” is usually hesitant to share anything about her three children with Affleck ― Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 5, but we’re guessing this was just too adorable to keep to herself.On Monday, Garner posted a photo of a note written by her son that he apparently left behind in a book for another reader to find. “Hello, You are loved. I believe in you,” the note reads. “When the librarian finds a love note your son tucked into a picture book,” Garner captioned the photo adding the hashtags #actsofkindness #spreadthelove #belikemlkjr #lovenote.Garner and Affleck initially separated in June 2015 after 10 years of marriage. Although there were rumors of reconciliation over the last year, the pair officially filed for divorce last April. The “Justice League” actor has since entered into a relationship with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus. The two were recently spotted on a casual shopping date in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the former couple continue to co-parent their children, reuniting last week for daughter Seraphina’s ninth birthday party at Garner’s place, as well as spending Christmas Day as a family. Whatever is going on in their personal lives, they’re clearly doing something right at home. "
2,WOMEN,"You Might Not Be A Harvey Weinstein, But You Could Be An Aziz Ansari","Harry Lewis, ContributorRadical queer feminist, #BlackLivesMatter supporter, student a...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/you-might-not-be-a-harvey-weinstein-but-you-could_us_5a5e10cae4b003efadb6b101,There are a lot of men out there getting very nervous.,2018-01-16,<p>Aziz Ansari at the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5e11191e00001900c9785d.jpg?ops=crop_21_0_722_511%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"You’ve probably heard by now of the increasingly controversial and inflammatory piece in Babe in which Grace (not her real name) describes a date with comedian Aziz Ansari. It has not gone down well. The Atlantic called it racist “revenge porn.” Bari Weiss of The New York Times, a writer who has consistently and, it seems, deliberately misunderstood most female-driven efforts of the Trump era called the letter indicative of a lack of female agency. In short, a lot of white women in highly prestigious publications have been vocalizing a lot of hand-wringing that I’ve been hearing men doing in less prestigious and less public circles. This is not to say that these female authors are caping for men or anything of the sort. What it does mean, however, is that there are a lot of men who are reading Grace’s account in Babe and getting very nervous.It is very easy to look at Harvey Weinstein and make a moral judgment. The man was an immensely powerful studio executive with the power to make or break careers. He stands accused of forcing himself on dozens, if not literally hundreds of women. He is, quite frankly, unattractive. In short, he fits the image of a serial rapist. We can look at his behavior and match it to what we collectively understand about rape. There is no semblance of consent anywhere in there. Men can examine their own behavior and say “I have never whipped it out and masturbated into a potted plant,” and do so with confidence. They are not Harvey Weinstein.But Aziz Ansari is more complicated, because it is less cut and dry. There are not hundreds of women coming forward. There is no weird sexual behavior, only relatively common practices. The woman doesn’t even have a firm identity that we can use to make comparative judgments about our proximity to her. (This is not to say I don’t believe the account, just that anonymity often raises public suspicion a la Rolling Stone’s “A Rape on Campus”.) Men read Grace’s story and begin to panic. They’ve done things like that before ― had sex without communicating, had a hook-up end with someone in tears. Does this mean they too will lose their careers, their standing in the public? If it can happen to Aziz Ansari, a self-proclaimed feminist comedian, could it really happen to anyone?Of course, that last question is deeply ironic insofar as it reflects the common refrain of anti-rape advocates (”It can happen to anyone!”) used to describe the reality of women’s day-to-day experiences. The cold sweats of men imagining that at any moment, any future or past sexual partner could say they crossed a line is just a hint of the choking panic women feel doing everyday things, like, say, walking down the street or riding the subway.But this panic has morphed into indignation and lines in the sand. “#MeToo has gone too far,” many men and assorted women are declaring across the internet with their fists slamming the proverbial table. They say the scale of abuse is being compressed to the extent that now even a sideways glance is grounds for a public shaming. They say that we are being asked to become psychic, to peer into the minds of women who are just so not straightforward. How are we supposed to know what they’re thinking ― and not just what they say they’re thinking, but what they’re really thinking? They ask, as Bari Weiss does, why we must criminalize “awkward, gross and entitled sex.” They muse, “What if we just asked women to stand up for themselves more? That would solve a lot of problems.”Harvey Weinstein is an anomaly, or at least a relative rarity. Aziz Ansari is not. When Weiss adds the throwaway line, “I’m apparently the victim of sexual assault” at the beginning of the piece, it has a kind of weight to it that few readers likely pick up on. It signifies that, yes, the epidemic of sexual violence really is as widespread and pervasive as we’ve been saying, because sexual violence doesn’t just entail brutal, violent acts of rape. It means that, no, it’s not just as easy as women being able to boldly proclaim their sexual agency in the same way that men do without being labeled a slut or a whore. It says that, yes, men are complicit in this system in a variety of ways and at different places within the hierarchy of abuse.The sad fact is that Grace, whoever she may be, did not choose to have what to most men seems an unpleasant sexual encounter become so deeply upsetting. Perhaps another woman would have been disturbed but ultimately unaffected in the long term. But this is not how trauma operates. We do not get to choose when and how it affects us, or under what circumstances it can seep into us. When we freeze up, choke on our words, are unable to fully sit in our bodies it is not because we consciously choose to do so, it is because we revert to some primal instinct of self-protection.Aziz Ansari is not going to jail. He may well be among the many legions of men ― Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman, Johnny Depp ― who have been labeled as abusive and who have carried on as if nothing ever happened. But the culture will never change and the necessity of a movement like #MeToo will never dissipate unless the Aziz Ansari’s of the world recognize that they too must examine their behavior and, as uncomfortable as it may be, change it."

The church’s pastor, Maurice Watson, told his congregation that he felt “led by God” to speak out against the president’s comments, which he called “dehumanizing” and “ugly.”Trump reportedly told lawmakers last Thursday that he preferred immigrants from places like Norway instead of “shithole countries” like Haiti and nations in Africa ― remarks the president has subsequently denied.Watson noted that many of his congregants come from Haiti and Africa.“I stand today as your pastor to vehemently denounce and reject any such characterizations of the nations of Africa and of our brothers and sisters in Haiti,” Watson said as the audience stood and clapped, according to a video posted to the church’s Facebook page.“And I further say: Whoever made such a statement, whoever used such a visceral, disrespectful, dehumanizing adjective to characterize the nations of Africa, whoever said it, is wrong. And they ought to be held accountable.”Local station WUSA-TV reported that Pence was red-faced during the sermon.The vice president’s office disputed that description to The Associated Press on Monday."
4,POLITICS,Democratic House Candidate's Campaign Materials Full Of Plagiarized Work,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joseph-kopser-texas-plagiarism_us_5a5d266be4b04f3c55a52e3f,"Previously, Joseph Kopser's Facebook event invitation copied language from a Democratic opponent.",2018-01-16,Democrat Joseph Kopser's website and candidate questionnaire contained plagiarized material from multiple outside sources.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5d2976220000251ab4e89f.jpeg?cache=2MKLQaq6ac&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The campaign of Democrat Joseph Kopser, an Iraq War veteran and entrepreneur running to represent Texas’ 21st Congressional District, repeatedly used sentences from news sites and other sources without attribution, in several cases lifting them word for word.As part of a response to a question about climate change in a Science Debate questionnaire, Kopser’s campaign used a sentence taken verbatim from the news site Vox. “From 2007 to 2015, wind and solar in the US reduced SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 by 1.0, 0.6, and 0.05 million tons respectively. Reducing those local air pollutants has helped avoid an estimated 7,000 premature deaths (the central estimate in a range from 3,000 to 12,700),” read Kopser’s response.Another response from the questionnaire that also appears on Kopser’s campaign site addressed the importance of energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) and utility energy service contracts (UESCs).“ESPCs and UESCs save money and increase energy productivity; they are becoming more common in military applications in a time of dwindling budgets and resources,” it read.The line comes directly from a blog post on the website of the Alliance to Save Energy.Other examples of plagiarism appear throughout Kopser’s campaign site, including comments about the disproportionate incarceration of black and Latino men (taken from The Dallas Morning News); the uneven distribution of income gains in the U.S. economy (taken from The Washington Post); Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison’s proposed financial transaction tax (taken from the Economic Policy Institute); and a proposal for executive branch ethics reform (taken from a New Republic article).On other occasions, there are extremely minor changes from the original source, like a sentence about Texas’ wind energy industry that mirrors a Wikipedia entry titled “Wind power in Texas.”“Wind power has also created over 24,000 jobs for local communities and for the state,” a section of Kopser’s site on clean energy alternatives notes.The original sentence from Wikipedia differs only in that it also uses the article “the” and the word “industry,” as in “the wind power industry has also created over 24,000 jobs for local communities and for the state.”Derrick Crowe, an environmental activist running against Kopser in the Democratic primary, discovered the examples of plagiarism using the website Quetext and shared them with HuffPost. Crowe also found dozens of more ambiguous cases, in which a majority of the words in the Kopser campaign’s sentences match those in other sources.“You cannot copy and paste a true commitment to progressive values,” Crowe said in a statement publicizing his research. “This plagiarism is a troubling act by Joseph Kopser, and it is part of a pattern that will spell certain defeat in a general election. Democrats in this district deserve better.”Crowe previously denounced Kopser for a Facebook event invitation that had a sentence identical to one of Crowe’s own Facebook invitations. At the bottom of the invitation, the Kopser campaign had asked invitees to “sign up for email updates at electcrowe.com/join” ― Crowe’s campaign website.Ian Rivera, a spokesman for the Kopser campaign, expressed regret for the instances of plagiarism that he said had escaped the campaign’s vetting.“Deliberate steps were taken to prevent this from happening but, unfortunately, they were insufficient,” Rivera said.The Kopser campaign relied on a staff of 15 volunteers to draft its detailed policy responses and used a free online service to check for plagiarism, according to Rivera. “We’ll be shopping around for alternatives this week and we will make appropriate adjustments to the written text as formatted,” he added. Crowe and Kopser initially got into the race to unseat Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a climate change denier who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. In November, Smith announced that he’d retire at the end of his term, ending a long stint in Congress that began in 1988.Smith’s retirement significantly increases Democrats’ chances of winning the seat in a district that Republicans gerrymandered to include parts of Austin, San Antonio and rural areas in between.President Donald Trump won the district by 10 percentage points. But his margin of victory was significantly smaller than Mitt Romney’s approximately 22-point win in the district in 2012.In an ordinary year, flipping the 21st District would likely be a long shot for Democrats. However, Smith’s retirement and the higher-than-normal level of enthusiasm among Democratic voters have made the race competitive.Thus far, Crowe has raised a fraction of the money that Kopser has taken in. The primary is on March 6."

Conlee said that while the audit is being completed, Highpoint “will continue to support Andy and his family.”“We want to maintain trust in both Andy and our church leadership that we are not only doing things right, but we are doing right things,” Conlee said in his statement.The decision to place Savage on leave now marks an apparent shift for the Tennessee church. On Jan. 5, Conlee said that the information about Savage’s past behavior wasn’t new to him or to Highpoint’s leadership. Still, Conlee said he had “total confidence in the redemptive process Andy went through” after the alleged assault took place.Highpoint drew criticism online after Conlee’s support of Savage seemed to be echoed by members of his church. In a video of a Jan 5. worship service, Savage admitted to having a “sexual incident” with a high school senior more than 20 years ago. After he read out his apology, Highpoint members in the church’s front rows could be seen rising up to give Savage a standing ovation. Ed Stetzer, a writer at Christianity Today, called it the “standing ovation heard around the world.” “No one should ever receive a standing ovation when it comes to alleged abuse—unless it’s directed at a victim with the courage to speak out,” Stetzer wrote in a piece about Highpoint.In addition, Stetzer said that it was important for Highpoint to be truthful about Savage’s behavior. The pastor had called what happened between him and the teenager a “sexual incident.” “It’s not an incident. It’s abuse,” Stetzer wrote. Savage’s behavior drew national attention after Jules Woodson, the woman who alleges she was the victim of Savage’s assault, came forward with her story earlier in January. Woodson wrote about the 1998 incident on Christian blogs, saying that Savage, then a youth minister, had driven her to a private location and forced her to perform sexual acts. Woodson has said that Savage’s apology wasn’t enough. “Number one, he’s lying about how he handled it,” she told Memphis’s Action News 5. “He never came to me, the church told him he couldn’t talk to me and they told me I couldn’t talk to him.”Highpoint Church told HuffPost that it is taking steps to examine all aspects of Savage’s ministry at the congregation and reevaluate the church’s policies on child safety. “Highpoint Church is prayerfully considering the direction God has for ministry at Highpoint and particularly how Highpoint can be a better witness of God’s love for the hurting,” the church said in an emailed statement. In addition to placing Savage on a leave of absence, Highpoint has also asked MinistrySafe, a legal group that seeks to help churches set up sexual abuse prevention protocols, to conduct an independent audit of the church’s current child protection practices. Kimberlee Norris, an attorney for MinistrySafe, told HuffPost that leaders at Highpoint approached her organization for the “limited purpose of assessing and enhancing existing child protection protocols.” MinistrySafe will review current training, policies and screening practices for Highpoint ministries that serve minors, she said.“Our consulting services to secular and ministry clients are unabashedly victim-centric,” Norris said. But Amy Smith, a blogger and advocate for sexual abuse survivors who helped publish Woodson’s allegations, told HuffPost that she’s concerned that Highpoint may be focused more on protecting the church’s image than protecting victims of abuse.“We already know that as a pastor Andy Savage betrayed the trust of a minor in his care and abused her. An audit should not be required to do the right thing and demand his resignation as pastor.”This article has been updated with comments from Highpoint Church."

The show’s lead actress, Logan Browning, shared a series of images on Monday when she announced the news via Instagram, writing, “His dream will live on through another deserving student, and #JordanEdwards will live on as more than just a hashtag.”The Jordan J. Edwards Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund, to be set up at the University of Alabama ― Edwards’ dream school ― aims to carry on the teen’s legacy by providing a deserving student with better access to education. The scholarship is being offered in partnership with the Black Alumni Association and Edwards’ family.Edwards, who dreamed of earning his degree and becoming a pilot, was gunned down by a former Texas cop, Roy Oliver, as he and a group of friends were leaving a party. Oliver shot Edwards, who was sitting in the passenger seat of his brother’s car, as the group drove away. Oliver was charged with murder and his trial is set to begin in June. “The circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,” the scholarship’s website reads. “We will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered.

9,CRIME,How 2 California Parents Could 'Home-School' Their Shackled And Abused Children,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-children-shackled-home-school_us_5a5e2887e4b04f3c55a64f4d,The home where police found that 13 children and young adults had been held in horrific conditions was listed as a private school.,2018-01-16,"David Allen Turpin, 57, and his wife, Louise Anna, 49, were jailed in lieu of $9 million bail after police found 13 children and young adults living in deplorable conditions in their Perris, California, home.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5e01a51f00003c00db8ed7.png?cache=KxalnuKKqt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two California parents were arrested over the weekend when police found 12 of their 13 children in filthy conditions, some chained to beds and starving. Neighbors and acquaintances told news outlets that they’re shocked by the allegations and horrified that such abuse was allowed to continue unchecked so close to other neighbors. The parents have been charged with child endangerment and torture. But this story isn’t just one of child abuse and endangerment; it’s also one about an education system that allows home-schools to operate with relatively little oversight, say education advocates who are pushing for stricter home-school rules. The grandparents of the couple’s children, who range in age from 2 to 29, told the Los Angeles Times that they hadn’t seen the family for several years and that the children were home-schooled. Public records back this up. The father, David Turpin, is listed in the California School Directory as the principal of a school located in the family’s home. The school, called Sandcastle Day School, is listed as serving students in kindergarten through 12th grade. State records show that the school was listed as non-religious, with six pupils in a range of grades, the L.A. Times reported.Beyond giving this basic information to the state, though, the so-called school wasn’t required to do much else.Parents in California who decide to home-school their children can operate as a private school. These parents are required to notify the state of their decision, providing information on such things as their home address, enrollment practices and courses of study, according to information collected by the Coalition for Responsible Home Education.Schools should give instruction in English, cover the branches of study required in public school and keep a record of attendance, according to state rules, but there is no specific mechanism to make sure requirements are enforcedPrivate school employees must generally undergo criminal background checks, but parents who teach family members are exempt from this rule. These parents are not required to have any specific teaching or education credentials.Students at these schools aren’t required to take any specific assessments or show evidence of academic progress. Rachel Coleman, executive director of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, has been tracking cases of child abuse in home-school settings. She says this case shows the type of abuse that can flourish when children are isolated from the outside world. “While there are many home-schooling families who provide an excellent education, there’s nothing in the law to ensure that happens. So a family like this could completely isolate their children,” said Coleman. Coleman’s group wants states like California to require mandatory doctor visits for home-schooled students, or at least some form of contact with someone who would be required to report signs of abuse. Public school employees can often act as first responders to evidence of child abuse, but home-school students don’t always have access to adults outside the home. “Kids in these situations don’t have the resources as kids who attend public schools, like a guidance counselor they can go to, or a teacher they can go to,” said Coleman. “In most states you can be convicted of child abuse and go on to home-school your children.” HuffPost reached out to the Home School Legal Defense Fund, a group that advocates for home-schooling parents, for comment on the case. They did not respond by Tuesday evening.There are advantages to home-schooling. Some research suggests that home-schooled students score higher on college-entrance tests than do other students.Home-schooling has been on the rise, and home-school families report a wide array of reasons for their decision. Parents might use home-schooling as a way to help a child with special needs or a child victimized by school bullying.In 1999, about 1.7 percent of all students ages 5 through 17 were home-schooled. By 2012, this number had grown to 3.4 percent, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics."

Haggis, also a former church member and now prominent critic of Scientology, has been accused by four women of sexual misconduct and assault. The director’s former publicist, Haleigh Breest, said he raped her in December 2013, which led to a $9 million lawsuit against the “Crash” director. Haggis later counter-sued, claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress. “Paul Haggis deserves, based on his record as a gentleman and humanitarian, to be judged when all the evidence has been taken under penalty of perjury in a court of law,” Remini and Rinder write. “Because claims of anonymous accusers who have NOT gone to law enforcement are not credible.”Remini and Rinder don’t explicitly attribute the sexual misconduct claims to active Scientologists. But they note that the church collects potentially damaging information on followers, and speculate that material collected on Haggis could be used against him to “conjure a string of accusers.” Haggis has publicly slammed Scientology on Remini’s series, as well as in the documentary “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief.”“We expect the next ‘revelations’ about Paul Haggis in this campaign to destroy him to be based on information culled from his scientology files in the form of more ‘anonymous’ accusers, hiding behind a lawyer who will never have to disclose who is paying their bill,” Remini and Rinder write. “Those who accuse without going to law enforcement, those who seek hush money to keep their stories secret, those who make accusations to the media anonymously – they are suspect,” they continue. “And when the target of these tactics is someone who is a prominent critic of scientology, it is very suspect.”Haggis vehemently denies sexual misconduct. A representative said the church has “been attacking him for years with false accusations.”After news of the sexual misconduct claims against Haggis, actress Kirstie Alley, a Scientologist, wrote alongside a report on Twitter, “This is gonna be an interesting year for the bad guys.”The Church of Scientology has denied the insinuations by Remini and Rinder of church involvement in the allegations against Haggis.“Leah Remini, Paul Haggis and Mike Rinder have predictably thrown up a reprehensible smokescreen to turn horrific sexual assault and rape allegations made against Haggis by four women into a bigoted attack about their former religion,” a representative for the church told Deadline in a statement. “To be clear, the Church has never met the women in this case nor their attorneys and knows nothing about the accusations against Haggis other than what has appeared in press reports and public court documents.”Women who have accused Haggis of sexual misconduct deny any connection with the Church of Scientology, according to The Associated Press.Read Remini and Rinder’s full letter here.

He is being held in Orange County Jail.Investigators discovered Bernstein’s body, which had been stabbed more than 20 times, on Jan. 9 in a park in Lake Forest, California ― nearly a week after his parents reported him missing. Bernstein had been home on winter break from the University of Pennsylvania at the time. No weapon was recovered at the scene and detectives are investigating whether the killing was “an act of rage,” reported The Orange County Register.Police interviewed Woodward shortly after Bernstein’s disappearance was reported. The victim’s Snapchat led investigators to believe Woodward picked up Bernstein around 10:30 p.m. the night he went missing, reported the Los Angeles Times.Woodward told investigators that they had driven to Borrego Park that night, when Bernstein exited the vehicle and walked away, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the Register. After waiting an hour for Bernstein to return, Woodward said, he left the park to meet a girlfriend, whose last name and address Woodward told police he could not remember. He said he returned hours later to look for Bernstein.According to the affidavit, Woodward had clenched fists as he claimed Bernstein had kissed him on the lips during their time together that night. He told investigators that he pushed Bernstein away and “wanted to tell Blaze to get off of him.”Text messages reviewed by investigators indicated Bernstein had discussed his previous interaction with Woodward with friends, according to the Register.Woodward was going to “hit on me,” Bernstein reportedly said in one text conversation. “He made me promise not to tell anyone … but I have texted every one, uh oh.”The 16-page affidavit suggested Woodward was known at his former high school for having conservative political beliefs and often made his love of the Bible and guns known through his social media posts, the Register reported.On Monday, hundreds of people gathered to mourn Bernstein’s death at a memorial service at the University Synagogue in Irvine. Bernstein, who was the managing editor of Penn Appetit, a student-run food magazine, and a columnist for the university’s student newspaper, was remembered for being a talented writer and a passionate cook.“Blaze was on a path to repair our world and it is a moral imperative that we all take steps now to make sure that his dream is realized,” the Bernstein family said in a statement released before the service."

He also experienced difficulty swallowing and speaking.Doctors at a hospital in Leicester discovered that air bubbles from the rupture were permeating the soft tissue of his neck and chest. He was hospitalized for seven days, administered antibiotics and fed via a tube so that the rupture could heal. He eventually made a full recovery.Anthony Aymat, a consultant at University Hospital Lewisham in London, told Time magazine that “the safest thing to do, although it’s not socially acceptable, is just to sneeze loud” and catch the germ cloud in a tissue.“When you sneeze, air comes out of you at about 150 miles per hour,” said Aymat, who was not involved in the reported case. “If you retain all that pressure, it could do a lot of damage and you could end up like the Michelin Man with air trapped in your body.”"

She has said the abuse led her to thoughts of suicide.In 2016, Maroney received a $1.25 million settlement from USA Gymnastics after the organization learned of Nassar’s actions. That settlement included an NDA with a $100,000 penalty if she ever spoke about the abuse she’d allegedly suffered at the doctor’s hands. The 22-year-old may have already triggered that provision with her revelations in October.Teigen tweeted a screenshot of a Daily Mail article about the possible penalty, along with her impassioned show of financial support:Maroney is suing USA Gymnastics, the United States Olympic Committee and Michigan State University for allegedly forcing her “to agree to a nondisparagement clause and confidentiality provision.”Later on Tuesday, USA Gymnastics told HuffPost that they have not “sought and will not seek any money” from Maroney for “her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar.” They also said they will not seek money for any victim impact statement she chooses to make at this week’s hearing or “at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing.”“This has been her right and USA Gymnastics encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out,” the statement read. “USA Gymnastics remains focused on our highest priority ― the safety, health and well-being of our athletes and creating a culture that empowers and supports them.”In response to Teigen’s words, Maroney said in a statement via her attorneys that she was shocked by such generosity. “I’m not on social media right now, but I wish I was for this! I’m shocked by your generosity, and I just want you to know how much hope your words bring to all of us! I just can’t get over the fact that someone I don’t personally know is sticking up for me, let alone a strong woman that I’ve looked up to for years,” Maroney’s statement reads.“Thank you Chrissy, you’re so inspiring, and things are starting to change because of people like you! Just saying that was worth the decision to speak up regardless of a fine.”Maroney said Teigen’s heart is “pure gold” and ended with “God bless. All my love, McKayla.”There are 98 victims and family members currently scheduled to make victim impact statements at Nassar’s sentencing, which began on Tuesday and is set to run until Friday. Nassar has been accused of sexual abuse by 140 women in total, including former Olympians Aly Raisman, Simone Biles and Gabby Douglas. He faces several charges of criminal sexual conduct that could carry sentences of life in prison. He was previously sentenced to 60 years on child pornography charges.This piece has been updated with new statements from USA Gymnastics and Maroney and with the number of victim impact statements expected at the hearing."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5e45fb1f00003c00db8fc7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A family meeting might be in order because Selena Gomez’s mother and former manager, Mandy Teefey, can’t stop spilling the tea. A day after Teefey revealed she was “not happy” about her daughter’s rekindled romance with Justin Bieber, she weighed in on the ongoing controversy over Gomez starring in the upcoming Woody Allen film “A Rainy Day in New York.”Three of Gomez’s co-stars on the film, Rebecca Hall, Timothée Chalamet and Griffin Newman, have already pledged to donate their salaries to stand in solidarity with victims of sexual assault. Allen’s adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow, has repeatedly accused him of sexually abusing her as a child, despite the director vehemently denying her claims over the years. When one of Teefey’s followers demanded Gomez apologize for her continued public support of Allen, Teefey explained that the 25-year-old is the one making the decisions, not her. “Sorry, no one can make Selena do anything she doesn’t want to,” Teefey wrote. “I had a long talk with her about not working with him and it didn’t click. Her team are amazing people. There is no fall person here. No one controls her. She makes all her own decisions. No matter how hard you try to advise. It falls on deaf ears,” she continued. The “Bad Liar” singer previously addressed the criticism regarding her collaboration with Allen in a roundabout answer that left many unsatisfied. “To be honest, I’m not sure how to answer — not because I’m trying to back away from it. [The Harvey Weinstein allegations] actually happened right after I had started [on the movie],” she told Billboard in November. “They popped up in the midst of it. And that’s something, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, ‘Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.’”Meanwhile, Gomez’s other co-stars, including Elle Fanning, Diego Luna and Liev Schreiber, have stayed silent. Gomez’s relationship with her mother, who stopped managing the starlet’s career in 2014, seems to be on the rocks lately. They reportedly unfollowed each other for a brief period last year and clearly don’t see eye to eye when it comes to Bieber. Teefey also serves as executive producer alongside her daughter on Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why,” which is scheduled to return for a second season sometime this year. "

All of the victims appeared to be dirty and malnourished. The minors were taken to Riverside University Hospital System, and the adults were sent to Corona Regional Medical Center for examination and medical treatment. Mark Uffer, CEO and managing director at Corona Regional Medical Center, said that as of Tuesday, the couple’s adult children remain together, comfortable and “in a very safe and secure environment, and I think that’s what’s most important right now.”“It’s hard to think of them as adults when you first see them, because they’re small,” Uffer said at the press conference, saying the children’s size is a result of malnutrition. “They’ve gone through a very traumatic ordeal. I can tell you that they’re very friendly, they’re very cooperative, and I think that they’re very hopeful that life will get better for them.”Officials credited the 17-year-old who Fellows said escaped the home through a window and used a deactivated cell phone to call for help.The investigation remains ongoing, Fellows said, but so far there appears to be no sign that the parents are mentally ill.Both parents were transported to the Robert Presley Detention Center, and each is being held on $9 million bail. The Turpins are set to appear in court on Thursday, Reuters reports. Public records suggest the Turpins homeschooled their children. California’s Department of Education lists David Turpin as the principal of the Sandcastle Day School, a K-12 private school located at the Turpins’ home address that had six students enrolled last year. According to state law, parents may register their home schools as private institutions. David Turpin’s mother, Betty, told CNN that the family was “highly respectable” and would usually take vacations, during which all of the children were dressed alike and had to be lined up according to age in order to keep track of everyone.“They were very protective of the kids,” she said. Neighbors of the couple have reacted with shock and horror to the news, saying they never had any idea of the abuse that was allegedly occurring inside the home.Mike Clifford, 60, told HuffPost that the family lived across the street from him in a rental home in Murrieta, about 19 miles south of Perris, a few years ago. He rarely saw the family, he said, but he did recall incidents that stood out to him and his wife as strange.“They used to march over and over in circles in their upstairs,” he said of the kids. This behavior, which Clifford said he would see late at night as he was getting home from work, went on “for hours.”“The blinds would be open,” Clifford said. “You could see the kids marching in circles.”Clifford said he once toured the rental property when it was for sale, and saw that the home’s upstairs layout allowed one to move freely from room to room in a circular way. He said he doesn’t know why the kids were doing it, but “it was happening quite often.”“I’d notice it and I’d say, ‘Wow, those kids are marching again,’” he recalled telling his wife, who he said was on vacation at the time of HuffPost’s interview.Another thing he found “strange” was how infrequently he saw the kids.“I never saw more than a half a dozen of them at a time,” he said, adding that sometimes he’d see six of the kids pile into the car with their parents at 1 a.m.He said he was shocked to learn there were 13 of them in all. “I just thought there were six of them,” he said.Clifford said that in the two and a half years the Turpins were their neighbors, he and his wife never saw anything that made them want to call 911. “We thought they were foster parents of mentally handicapped kids,” he said. His wife had once met two of the daughters while checking the mail, he said, and had described them as “robotic” but friendly.The kids seemed thin when he saw them, Clifford said, but not to any extreme. The family also seemed financially comfortable, as he saw them with “his and hers” sports cars that were traded out every year for new ones.“I wish I had noticed something that would have made me want to say something, but it never got to that point,” he said.Kimberly Milligan, 50, told The Washington Post that she lived next door to the Turpins for over two years but rarely heard or saw the children, who she thought were “very young ― 11, 12, 13 at the most.” Milligan’s son, Robert Perkins, remembered the children looking frail and thin.“You knew something was off. It didn’t make a lot of sense,” Milligan told the Post. “But this is something else entirely.”Another neighbor, Wendy Martinez, told Reuters she’d only communicated with the family once. She was passing the Turpins’ house while four of the children were installing sod in the yard.“They were very, like, afraid,” she said of the children. “Like they had never seen people before.”In a number of family photos posted on a Facebook account belonging to the couple, they are seen appearing to renew their wedding vows with the help of an Elvis impersonator.That impersonator, Kent Ripley, told CBS News the couple had renewed their vows at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas at least three times in recent years. The last time he saw them was in 2015, when all 13 kids attended the ceremony. He expressed surprise when asked about the allegations against the couple, telling CBS that the kids looked thin, “but not excessively thin.”“I thought they were very active as a family... I didn’t think that they didn’t eat or there was punishment or anything like that,” Ripley said. “They were just well behaved. They smiled a lot.”Video of one ceremony posted on YouTube in 2013 shows the children singing, dancing and holding hands as a family as their parents celebrate what was then described as 28 years of marriage.“It’s hard to believe that the people that I performed for and entertained and sat and talked [to] before and after entertaining them, that this could happen. It’s just, it’s disturbing, it really is,” Ripley said. This story has been updated with comments from Clifford and additional details on the couple.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the age of the youngest child who police said was found in the home. The child is 2, not 6."

David Turpin’s mother, Betty, told CNN that the family was “highly respectable” and would usually take vacations, during which all of the children were dressed alike and had to be lined up according to age in order to keep track of everyone.“They were very protective of the kids,” she said. Neighbors of the couple have reacted with shock and horror to the news, saying they never had any idea of the abuse that was allegedly occurring inside the home.Mike Clifford, 60, told HuffPost that the family lived across the street from him in a rental home in Murrieta, about 19 miles south of Perris, a few years ago. He rarely saw the family, he said, but he did recall incidents that stood out to him and his wife as strange.“They used to march over and over in circles in their upstairs,” he said of the kids. This behavior, which Clifford said he would see late at night as he was getting home from work, went on “for hours.”“The blinds would be open,” Clifford said. “You could see the kids marching in circles.”Clifford said he once toured the rental property when it was for sale, and saw that the home’s upstairs layout allowed one to move freely from room to room in a circular way. He said he doesn’t know why the kids were doing it, but “it was happening quite often.”“I’d notice it and I’d say, ‘Wow, those kids are marching again,’” he recalled telling his wife, who he said was on vacation at the time of HuffPost’s interview.Another thing he found “strange” was how infrequently he saw the kids.“I never saw more than a half a dozen of them at a time,” he said, adding that sometimes he’d see six of the kids pile into the car with their parents at 1 a.m.He said he was shocked to learn there were 13 of them in all. “I just thought there were six of them,” he said.Clifford said that in the two and a half years the Turpins were their neighbors, he and his wife never saw anything that made them want to call 911. “We thought they were foster parents of mentally handicapped kids,” he said. His wife had once met two of the daughters while checking the mail, he said, and had described them as “robotic” but friendly.The kids seemed thin when he saw them, Clifford said, but not to any extreme. The family also seemed financially comfortable, as he saw them with “his and hers” sports cars that were traded out every year for new ones.“I wish I had noticed something that would have made me want to say something, but it never got to that point,” he said.Kimberly Milligan, 50, told The Washington Post that she lived next door to the Turpins for over two years but rarely heard or saw the children, who she thought were “very young ― 11, 12, 13 at the most.” Milligan’s son, Robert Perkins, remembered the children looking frail and thin.“You knew something was off. It didn’t make a lot of sense,” Milligan told the Post. “But this is something else entirely.”Another neighbor, Wendy Martinez, told Reuters she’d only communicated with the family once. She was passing the Turpins’ house while four of the children were installing sod in the yard.“They were very, like, afraid,” she said of the children. “Like they had never seen people before.”In a number of family photos posted on a Facebook account belonging to the couple, they are seen appearing to renew their wedding vows with the help of an Elvis impersonator.That impersonator, Kent Ripley, told CBS News the couple had renewed their vows at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas at least three times in recent years. The last time he saw them was in 2015, when all 13 kids attended the ceremony. He expressed surprise when asked about the allegations against the couple, telling CBS that the kids looked thin, “but not excessively thin.”“I thought they were very active as a family... I didn’t think that they didn’t eat or there was punishment or anything like that,” Ripley said. “They were just well behaved. They smiled a lot.”Video of one ceremony posted on YouTube in 2013 shows the children singing, dancing and holding hands as a family as their parents celebrate what was then described as 28 years of marriage.“It’s hard to believe that the people that I performed for and entertained and sat and talked [to] before and after entertaining them, that this could happen. It’s just, it’s disturbing, it really is,” Ripley said.

All of the victims appeared to be dirty and malnourished. The minors were taken to Riverside University Hospital System, and the adults were sent to Corona Regional Medical Center for examination and medical treatment. Mark Uffer, CEO and managing director at Corona Regional Medical Center, said that as of Tuesday, the couple’s adult children remain together, comfortable and “in a very safe and secure environment, and I think that’s what’s most important right now.”“It’s hard to think of them as adults when you first see them, because they’re small,” Uffer said at the press conference, saying the children’s size is a result of malnutrition. “They’ve gone through a very traumatic ordeal. I can tell you that they’re very friendly, they’re very cooperative, and I think that they’re very hopeful that life will get better for them.”Officials credited the 17-year-old who Fellows said escaped the home through a window and used a deactivated cell phone to call for help.The investigation remains ongoing, Fellows said, but so far there appears to be no sign that the parents are mentally ill.Both parents were transported to the Robert Presley Detention Center, and each is being held on $9 million bail. The Turpins are set to appear in court on Thursday, Reuters reports. Public records suggest the Turpins homeschooled their children.

The “Welcome to the Dollhouse” and “Princess Diaries” star revealed on Monday that she’d popped the question to her girlfriend, Heather Turman, last week. In an Instagram post, Matarazzo explained that she and Turman, who is also an actress and a comedian, had gotten engaged Jan. 11 but opted to keep it to themselves for a bit. Turman, who co-wrote 2017′s “Stuck” and appeared in “La La Land,” called Matarazzo “the absolute, unequivocal love of my life” in a similar post on her Instagram account.

The sentencing hearing began at 9 on Tuesday morning and is set to run through Thursday afternoon. Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November. According to Michigan state Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis, 98 victims and family members of victims are scheduled to read impact statements over the week. Many of the sexual abuse survivors who spoke in court on Tuesday had been named anonymously in lawsuits and came out publicly for the first time while making their statements. Almost all of them asked Judge Rosemarie Aquilina to sentence Nassar to a minimum of 40 years and a maximum of 125 years in prison, which is in line with the prosecutor’s request. The morning started off with a riveting address from Kyle Stephens, a family friend of Nassar’s and the only known victim who was not an athlete or a dancer. Stephens said she was sexually abused by Nassar for years, starting when she was just 6. “You used my body for six years for your own sexual gratification. That is unforgivable,” Stephens told Nassar.The young woman said Nassar’s abuse came between her and her parents when she tried to tell them about it. They didn’t believe her for years. Her father killed himself in 2016, Stephens said, after realizing she had not been lying. “Had he not had to bear the shame and self-loathing that stemmed from his defense of Larry Nassar, he would have had a fighting chance,” she said, referring to her father’s suicide.Stephens looked directly at Nassar as she concluded on a powerful note: “Little girls don’t stay little forever. They turn into strong women that return to destroy your world.”Nassar has been accused by 140 women of serial sexual abuse during his past tenures as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, the doctor for various Michigan State University sports teams and the sports medicine doctor at the Michigan gymnastics training gym Twistars. Of those women, 125 have filed lawsuits against Nassar, USA Gymnastics, MSU and Twistars. Olivia Cowan, now married and a mother of two young daughters, was visibly emotional as she talked about the after-effects of Nassar’s abuse. “This case has taken all of me, every ounce of my being, to press forward,” she said, adding later, “I will educate my children about monsters like you and pray to God they will never experience pain like this.” Cowan also addressed MSU and USA Gymnastics, which have been accused of covering up the doctor’s behavior for two decades. “It’s horrifying that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to the plate to admit their wrongdoing. … I want MSU and USAG to know what they have done is on the very same level of accountability as the crime Nassar has committed,” Cowan said with tears streaming down her face. “MSU knew what was being done to these athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep their reputation strong and their pockets full. If they would have only taken action upon the first reporting, they would have saved me and all these other women standing before us today.”The university has denied hiding Nassar’s behavior in any way.“Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false,” MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost earlier this month. “Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. As [MSU] President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.”Cowan also brought up the news last month that former Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney was paid by USA Gymnastics to keep quiet about the abuse she endured at the hands of Nassar. “Shame on you [USA Gymnastics] for looking the other way when this was brought to your attention,” Cowan said. “A public apology after you’ve hid behind this monster for over 20 years will never be enough. Where were you when we needed you? If you would have only listened to the women who brought complaints and concerns over all these years, this would have saved so many children and women from being abused and from all the scars this has created.” In one of the most moving statements of the day, Donna Markham spoke on behalf of her daughter Chelsea, who was abused by Nassar. “She never really recovered,” Markham said of her daughter, whom she described as her “best friend.” “He was supposed to help her heal. But he didn’t do that. He abused her,” Markham told the court. “He had the audacity to do it while I was sitting in the room.”She went on to reveal why Chelsea wasn’t delivering this impact statement. “She took her own life because she couldn’t deal with the pain anymore,” Markham said. “It will be 10 years in March that I lost my baby. She was 23 years old. … Every day I miss her. Every day. And it all started with him.”Judge Aquilina repeated to every victim who spoke that the abuse they’d endured was not their fault. “You are worthy,” she told survivor Danielle Moore. “This was done to you. It was not done by you.” The judge assured the 17-year-old Jessica Thomashow that she will heal. “You talk about being broken. He’s going to break while you’re healing and I believe that he will remain broken,” she said. In another powerful moment, survivor Kate Mahon quoted the writer Jasmin Kaur when she said: “Scream so that one day a hundred years from now, another sister will not have to dry her tears wondering where in history she lost her voice.”Mahon added that she came forward to speak on the behalf of all survivors of sexual abuse. “By publicly speaking out against Larry Nassar, I’m not just speaking out for myself,” she said. “I’m speaking out for all the girls and women of the past, present and future that have been or will be affected by sexual assault.”Other survivors who spoke on Tuesday included Jade Capua and Alexis Moore."

I contemplate Shonda’s deeper messages while stretching in my living room.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5deed41f00004700db8eaf.jpg?ops=crop_5_131_735_893%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As “Grey’s Anatomy” returns from winter hiatus for its 14th season, I’m asking myself questions about its latest Hijabi character. Queen Shonda, please allow me to introduce myself.I’m a fellow “dark and twisty” sister writing to you in a time of need. What’s my story? I’m an Egyptian-American-Muslim who was born and raised in the USA. My parents immigrated in the early 80s from Cairo, Egypt to the sunny suburbs of Miami, Florida. I was 5 years old when 9/11 occurred. At a time where Olivia Pope and her gladiators didn’t yet exist, the curly haired kindergartner at Gulliver South Miami Gymnastics school became my very own “gladiator in a suit” ― well, it was more of a shiny black gymnastics leotard, but still.We’re the same, you and I. Growing up, I had never seen someone on television who looked like me on the outside or the inside. I woke up every morning and sat crisscrossed on my living room floor, eating Eggo waffles and watching the screen. But I never found my reflection.In this post-9/11 world, Muslims were represented on-screen as either ignorant people in need of Western guidance, or terrorists seeking to destroy the world. So, I had to form my very own gladiator advance team. I was willing to do whatever it took to prove to my teachers and classmates in Miami that this stereotyped part of the world wasn’t so dark and twisty after all. You know better than anyone that gladiators don’t just give up so whether it was teaching the girls how to belly dance in the school bathroom, dressing up as Cleopatra on Halloween year after year, or abstaining from food ― not for a smaller booty, but for Ramadan.No one really understood the complexity of being American, Arab, Muslim, and ― wait for it ― female. There was no nuance to me at school and definitely not on the screen. Could I blame my classmates? Of course not. This was the image that was imprinted in their minds from every news outlet and almost every movie they watched. So when the opportunity came to be Princess Jasmine at the end-of-year gymnastics show, it was a dream come true. Although my gladiator efforts of bellydancing in the bathroom got me early suspension from school ―according to Gulliver Gymnastics, belly dancing in the bathroom is apparently a fire hazard ― it did convince the administration to rethink the entire show’s theme and change it to “Aladdin.” I would be Jasmine, the Princess of Agrabah, the fictional place loosely based on Arab, South Asian and Middle Eastern culture. As you said in your recent TV Hall of Fame speech, “You cannot be what you cannot see.” In this world, where Arabs and Muslims were only portrayed as terrorists and suicide bombers, Jasmine was all I could hold onto. As the lights of the auditorium glistened above me, I turned around and danced toward the audience to “Arabian Nights.” I had my own solo to the opening lyrics, “Oh, I come from a land from a faraway place where it’s flat and immense and the heat is intense, it’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home.”Although “Aladdin” represents the popular imagination of the Middle East ― filled with “street rats” and sandy deserts ― I knew that in this post-9/11 world this film might have never been created at all. I danced with no complaints. It was all I had to work with.Then, Shonda, you came along and brought with you an array of characters that were well-defined and well-drawn. You were that sprinkle of “bright and shiny” that we all needed. You understood the danger of the single story and you liberated entire groups of people who had been chained by it for so long.With “Scandal,” you gave the world the fearless Olivia Pope, played by Kerry Washington ― the first black female lead in a network drama in nearly 40 years. Time and time again you showed us that Olivia Pope is not a fantasy: She is reality. Black women today are powerful and successful women who continue to have an everlasting influence on American culture.A year later, you gave us Viola Davis’s character, Annalise Keating, in “How to Get Away With Murder.” With this show, you moved the needle not only for African Americans but the LGBT community as well.You fought hard for the LGBT community and created groundbreaking shows with gay or bisexual leads. People freaked out when you revealed in “Grey’s Anatomy” that Dr. Callie Torres was bisexual, but you made it your mission to fight them.“Same sex marriage is the civil rights fight of our era,” you wrote. “Back when being a person of color was the civil rights fight, people like Norman Lear put black people on TV and helped change some minds.”Years later you created Scandal’s beloved Cyrus Beene, a white, Republican, gay chief of staff. Today, there are so many shows with female leads, African Americans and LGBTQ characters, but you were Moses, leading the imprisoned bystanders in the back of the scenes to the center of our screens. From my childhood eating Eggo waffles while watching TV every morning to my young adulthood hosting weekly TGIT gatherings, I continued hoping that one day I would see myself on screen.

Who needs a polyester costume from Party City when you can wear a made-in-Egypt vintage Cleopatra costume? Although it had funky stains from the '90s, it was iconic to the Amer sisters. It was passed down from my sister who actually wore it for Halloween at the same school, just eight years before.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a62162b1f00003c00db97e3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As “Grey’s Anatomy” returns from winter hiatus for its 14th season, I’m asking myself questions about its latest Hijabi character. Queen Shonda, please allow me to introduce myself.I’m a fellow “dark and twisty” sister writing to you in a time of need. What’s my story? I’m an Egyptian-American-Muslim who was born and raised in the USA. My parents immigrated in the early 80s from Cairo, Egypt to the sunny suburbs of Miami, Florida. I was 5 years old when 9/11 occurred. At a time where Olivia Pope and her gladiators didn’t yet exist, the curly haired kindergartner at Gulliver South Miami Gymnastics school became my very own “gladiator in a suit” ― well, it was more of a shiny black gymnastics leotard, but still.We’re the same, you and I. Growing up, I had never seen someone on television who looked like me on the outside or the inside. I woke up every morning and sat crisscrossed on my living room floor, eating Eggo waffles and watching the screen. But I never found my reflection.In this post-9/11 world, Muslims were represented on-screen as either ignorant people in need of Western guidance, or terrorists seeking to destroy the world. So, I had to form my very own gladiator advance team. I was willing to do whatever it took to prove to my teachers and classmates in Miami that this stereotyped part of the world wasn’t so dark and twisty after all. You know better than anyone that gladiators don’t just give up so whether it was teaching the girls how to belly dance in the school bathroom, dressing up as Cleopatra on Halloween year after year, or abstaining from food ― not for a smaller booty, but for Ramadan.No one really understood the complexity of being American, Arab, Muslim, and ― wait for it ― female. There was no nuance to me at school and definitely not on the screen. Could I blame my classmates? Of course not. This was the image that was imprinted in their minds from every news outlet and almost every movie they watched. So when the opportunity came to be Princess Jasmine at the end-of-year gymnastics show, it was a dream come true. Although my gladiator efforts of bellydancing in the bathroom got me early suspension from school ―according to Gulliver Gymnastics, belly dancing in the bathroom is apparently a fire hazard ― it did convince the administration to rethink the entire show’s theme and change it to “Aladdin.” I would be Jasmine, the Princess of Agrabah, the fictional place loosely based on Arab, South Asian and Middle Eastern culture. As you said in your recent TV Hall of Fame speech, “You cannot be what you cannot see.” In this world, where Arabs and Muslims were only portrayed as terrorists and suicide bombers, Jasmine was all I could hold onto. As the lights of the auditorium glistened above me, I turned around and danced toward the audience to “Arabian Nights.” I had my own solo to the opening lyrics, “Oh, I come from a land from a faraway place where it’s flat and immense and the heat is intense, it’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home.”Although “Aladdin” represents the popular imagination of the Middle East ― filled with “street rats” and sandy deserts ― I knew that in this post-9/11 world this film might have never been created at all. I danced with no complaints. It was all I had to work with.Then, Shonda, you came along and brought with you an array of characters that were well-defined and well-drawn. You were that sprinkle of “bright and shiny” that we all needed. You understood the danger of the single story and you liberated entire groups of people who had been chained by it for so long.With “Scandal,” you gave the world the fearless Olivia Pope, played by Kerry Washington ― the first black female lead in a network drama in nearly 40 years. Time and time again you showed us that Olivia Pope is not a fantasy: She is reality. Black women today are powerful and successful women who continue to have an everlasting influence on American culture.A year later, you gave us Viola Davis’s character, Annalise Keating, in “How to Get Away With Murder.” With this show, you moved the needle not only for African Americans but the LGBT community as well.You fought hard for the LGBT community and created groundbreaking shows with gay or bisexual leads. People freaked out when you revealed in “Grey’s Anatomy” that Dr. Callie Torres was bisexual, but you made it your mission to fight them.“Same sex marriage is the civil rights fight of our era,” you wrote. “Back when being a person of color was the civil rights fight, people like Norman Lear put black people on TV and helped change some minds.”Years later you created Scandal’s beloved Cyrus Beene, a white, Republican, gay chief of staff. Today, there are so many shows with female leads, African Americans and LGBTQ characters, but you were Moses, leading the imprisoned bystanders in the back of the scenes to the center of our screens. From my childhood eating Eggo waffles while watching TV every morning to my young adulthood hosting weekly TGIT gatherings, I continued hoping that one day I would see myself on screen.

Can you imagine the business I stepped into 40 years ago?” she said. “Looking like I look? From nowhere Pennsylvania?” “I didn’t come here with any protection. I’ve seen it all.” Stone is one of the dozens of women in Hollywood who have spoken up about their own experiences with sexual assault and harassment in the wake of the allegations against powerful industry figures like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer and director James Toback. Stone, along with many other actresses and actors, recently wore all black to the Golden Globes to protest harassment in Hollywood. In her interview with CBS, Stone said that times are changing. More and more women are “empowered” to simply be themselves. “We were raised to accommodate men, particularly in my generation,” she said. “And women so often lose their own identify to the identity of the men that they’re with. They even change the way they dress and what they do to fit the men that they’re with.”“We’re starting to acknowledge our own gifts as women and not think that we have to behave as men in order to be empowered or powerful or valuable,” Stone added. Head to CBS for the rest of Stone’s interview. "

There are many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now it is not my fault.”USA Gymnastics responded to Biles’ statement late Monday evening.“USA Gymnastics is absolutely heartbroken, sorry and angry that Simone Biles or any of our athletes have been harmed by the horrific acts of Larry Nassar,” the organization told HuffPost. “USA Gymnastics’ support is unwavering for Simone and all athletes who courageously came forward to share their experiences. We are our athletes’ advocates. USA Gymnastics will continue to listen to our athletes and our members in our efforts of creating a culture of empowerment with a relentless focus on athlete safety every single day.”Biles joins several other high-profile Olympians, including Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, and McKayla Maroney, who say Nassar used his position to abuse them under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in November and will be sentenced on Jan. 16. Several of the charges each carry sentences of up to life in prison.Dozens of other women have also come forward with allegations against Nassar, but some worry that their own experiences of abuse are going relatively unnoticed.“A lot of people seem to believe it’s only Olympians that this [abuse] happened to, which isn’t true,” Alexis Alvarado, another abuse survivor, told HuffPost’s Alanna Vagianos.Biles’ fellow gymnasts, including Raisman, shared words of support after she posted Monday’s message.“I am so proud of you. You are incredible Simone,” Raisman said, while once again calling for an investigation into USA Gymnastics. Raisman said earlier on Monday that she would not attend Nassar’s sentencing because it would be too traumatic.Biles said it was “impossibly difficult to relive” her abuse. She added that she would work toward competing in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, but worried about returning to “the same training facility where I was abused.” She also called for an inquiry into Nassar’s decades of abuse.“We need to know why this was able to take place for so long and to so many of us,” she said. “We need to make sure something like this never happens again.”"

But critics have pushed back, as city life appears to be bustling along as usual. Many local leaders see racism behind the alarmism.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a584d861e0000d900c96e8d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recent reports of a wave of violence at the hands of young Africans in Australia’s second largest city, Melbourne, have sparked a national debate and a fierce political fight about how to deal with the issue, but also whether there is a problem at all.Over the holiday break, Australia’s conservative media outlets reported extensively on a wave of violent crimes ― the robbery of a group of tourists, damage inside a McDonald’s restaurant, a wild party that trashed a rented home and terrorized neighbors, and an assault on a police officer at a shopping center. They blamed the incidents on “African gangs.”An “African gang” problem has long been a hot-button issue in the state of Victoria, with conservative media, commentators and politicians claiming the situation is widespread, while police and state government officials downplay concerns.Sudanese and Somali refugees have recently settled in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Australia’s second most populated city. And for several years, Melbourne media have reported on the so-called Apex gang, a group of young African men allegedly linked to a string of violent crime including carjackings, home invasions, brazen robberies and riots across Melbourne. The gang issue went relatively quiet for several months, with police claiming the gangs were a “non-entity” after leaders and key members were arrested and jailed. But the recent reports were quickly picked up across the country, sparking a fierce spat between national and state political leaders. Following the events, the state of Victoria’s left-leaning Labor government resisted calls to label the incidents as gang-related. State police said the young people involved in these crimes did not fit the standard profile of criminal gang members, lacking organization and sophistication.Australia’s conservative government, however, disagreed. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton have criticized the Victorian government and even claimed the “political correctness” of the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, was to blame for the crime wave.The federal government criticisms come despite the most recent Victorian crime statistics showing a reduction in property damage, burglary and theft. Robbery figures rose by 12 percent in the last 24 months, but all other major crime categories remained stable, according to the state’s Crime Statistics Agency.Dutton said in a radio interview on Jan. 3 that “of course it’s African gang violence,” and claimed people in Melbourne are “scared to go out to restaurants in the nighttime.” Many residents refuted the claims ― including State Treasurer Tim Pallas, whose west Melbourne electorate is one of the areas where incidents are taking place.The Victorian government has now established a task force with members of the African community to work alongside police to not only tackle youth crime, but also deal with incidents of racism or vilification directed at people of African descent.“We know that the vast majority of African-Australians in Victoria are decent, law-abiding people,” Victoria’s police commissioner, Graham Ashton, said in a statement. “They are suffering as a result of the actions of a small cohort of young offenders. The African-Australian Community can, and want to, play a role in providing solutions.”Ashton said it was “complete and utter garbage” to say Melbourne was not a safe place.“Victoria is one of the safest places in the world to live,” the Victoria police commissioner said at a press conference last week. “I don’t think anyone is sitting at home cowering with the sheets over their heads.”“If you put it into context, you’ve got a few hundred offenders engaged in offending in a city of 4 ½ million people,” he added. “We have some young people that are engaging in ... gang-related behaviors, we’re not shying away from that, but I think it’s important we keep it in perspective.”The Victorian state government, arguably the most progressive in the nation, and the federal government have long been at loggerheads over social issues including refugees, domestic violence and energy policy. The federal government sees the state and Premier Andrews as soft on crime and immigration. Andrews has publicly castigated the federal government’s harsh policies on refugees and offshore detention. 2018 is an election year in Victoria, and some commentators see the federal intervention into the gangs issue ― a state government responsibility ― as a ploy to boost the chances of the conservative opposition winning office from the left-leaning incumbents.While Melbourne residents met Home Minister Dutton’s hyperbolic remark with ridicule, the government’s rhetoric had real-life repercussions. South Sudanese and Somali community leaders warned that the federal government’s stance on the issue further perpetuated stereotyping of the community. South Sudanese community leader Kot Monoah accused the federal government of “scaremongering” on the issue, claiming not enough was being done to help educate and integrate African migrants and families.“The current youth crisis has been in the making for the last 14 years,” he said in a TV interview last week.On Wednesday, David Anei, a Brisbane resident of Somali decent, posted a video of an angry, verbally abusive and physically imposing man he claimed had followed him and his family home. Anei put the blame squarely on Dutton’s and Turnbull’s shoulders.“[They bear] full responsibility for this racial attack on my family because they chose to be in the office to serve certain group of Australian communities NOT Australia as a whole country,” he wrote on Facebook.On Thursday, the government’s Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission criticized the federal allegations and called on Victorians to “take a stand against racism and discrimination in the community.”“Misleading claims of an African gang crisis in Victoria ― refuted by the Chief Commissioner of Police ― have already spurred race-based hate and threats towards African Victorians,” the EOHRC said.The issue of “African gangs” has been a favorite of Australia’s conservative tabloid newspapers and TV stations for years. Reports peaked in 2016, when a group of young men of African descent dubbed the Apex gang sparked a round of street fighting during a Melbourne community festival. The group was later accused of being behind a series of carjackings, home invasions and robberies in Melbourne. While police say the gang had about 130 members at its peak, the deputy commissioner of Victoria Police said the group had become a “non-entity” by April 2017. Police say this remains the case today, but graffiti tags of the words Apex and MTS ― standing for Menace To Society, another group allegedly linked to the series of crimes ― were found at the scene of some of the recent incidents.Some residents are taking matters into their own hands. A group of far-right activists calling themselves the True Blue Crew, just one of several “patriot” organizations active in Victoria, held a clandestine meeting last weekend to discuss how they can “take a stand on the streets” against the gang issue. The group was previously focused on anti-Muslim activities.The Soldiers Of Odin, another group linked to the True Blue Crew and neo-Nazis, had previously operated its own “street patrols” in Melbourne after earlier concerns about gang violence.On social media, members of the African community pushed back by reclaiming the term “African gangs” with a hashtag showing how members of the African community are valuable, committed members of society. The controversy has also laid bare stark differences about how the government should respond to the economic woes of some African immigrants. While the federal government has blamed recent crimes on a failure of African youths to “integrate” into Australian society, community leaders point to poverty and other social issues among the migrant enclaves in Melbourne’s less wealthy outer suburbs. Unemployment rates among Melbourne residents of Sudanese, South Sudanese and Somali backgrounds have hovered between 25 percent and 30 percent, according to the 2016 census. “We know that the vast majority of African-Australians in Victoria are decent, law-abiding people,” Police Commissioner Ashton said in a statement. “They are suffering as a result of the actions of a small cohort of young offenders. The African-Australian Community can, and want to, play a role in providing solutions.”"

It provides, in Joyner’s words, a “universally relatable” character for anyone who has ever felt inadequate or unworthy of being uplifted. In the book, 15-year-old Juniper Bray is a young, nerdy, science-obsessed teen who goes on a journey to discover that she has magical powers. However, Joyner says the most important journey the character undergoes through the novel is one of self-discovery.“I want people who read Juniper Leaves to finish the book and be inspired by Juniper not only because she’s a #MagicalBlackGirl, but because she represents so many of us who feel like we’re not good enough,” Joyner told HuffPost. “I want readers to leave understanding better how relatable a story lead by a black queer protagonist can be. There’s this idea that black stories can’t be relatable to the masses. You see it all the time with TV execs being surprised black-led TV shows and movies do so well — and that’s bullshit. I want to be a part of that shift.”“If Juniper Leaves inspires even one teen to work in STEM, or get hype about science, or read more fantasy stories starring PoC protagonist, or even just see themselves in a better light, then I will die happy,” they added.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of Joyner’s book."

Hundreds of protesters responded to news he’d be in town with a march across a bridge connecting Palm Beach to West Palm Beach. The group carried signs demanding an apology from the president for his disparaging remarks last week. “If Dr. Martin Luther King were alive today, he’d be here marching with us,” James Leger, a radio show host and one of the protest organizers, told the Sun Sentinel. “We’re going to pray for America and pray for President Trump. People make mistakes. We’re not asking for impeachment. We just want an apology.”Across the street from the protesters, a group of Trump supporters also gathered to cheer the president’s passing motorcade.In an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Trump reportedly described Haiti and African nations as “shithole” countries and slammed the idea of restoring protections for immigrants from those places.“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” the president said, according to The Washington Post. Trump reportedly then suggested the U.S. should welcome more immigrants from countries like Norway. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who was at the White House meeting, later confirmed Trump made the comments. Trump has denied he “said anything derogatory about Haitians.”In November, the Trump administration announced a July 2019 date to end a special status given to about 59,000 Haitian immigrants who were affected by a devastating 2010 earthquake. The decision gives the impacted Haitians 18 months to return to their home country or legalize their status in the U.S., likely putting tens of thousands at risk of deportation.“The president does not understand us,” Jean Bruny, a Haitian pastor in West Palm Beach, told Palm Beach Post on Monday. “We are not coming here to do any bad thing, we are coming here for a better life and to help our family in Haiti. We pay taxes, we buy houses, we contribute to the United States.”"

In a piece published on Saturday, more than two dozen current and former male models who worked with Weber or Testino recounted unwanted sexual advances to The New York Times. The alleged incidents, some of which were said to have occurred as far back as the mid-1990s, involved nudity, inappropriate touching, masturbation and other sexual demands. “I saw him with his hands down people’s pants at least 10 times,” said Thomas Hargreave, a shoot producer who once worked with Testino.“We are deeply disturbed by these accusations and take this very seriously,” Anna Wintour, artistic director of Condé Nast and editor of Vogue, and Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., chief executive of Condé Nast, said in a statement. “In light of these allegations, we will not be commissioning any new work with Bruce Weber and Mario Testino for the foreseeable future.”Wintour, in a separate statement, acknowledged that the stories have been “heartbreaking” for her. “Both are personal friends of mine who have made extraordinary contributions to Vogue and many other titles at Condé Nast over the years, and both have issued objections or denials to what has emerged,” she wrote. “I believe strongly in the value of remorse and forgiveness, but I take the allegations very seriously.”Weber denied any wrongdoing, while Testino’s lawyers disputed some of the accounts included in the Times piece and questioned the credibility of the accusers. Brands, including Stuart Weitzman, Michael Kors and Burberry also announced their own plans to cease relationships with both photographers over the weekend.Condé Nast released a new set of protocols Saturday in an effort to provide safer work environments and prevent sexual harassment. These include setting the minimum age for models to 18, the prohibition of drugs and alcohol on sets and the advance approval of any shoot involving nudity, sheer clothing, lingerie, swimwear, simulated drug or alcohol use or sexually suggestive poses. The company added that it plans to release a complete code of conduct by the end of January.Condé Nast International ― along with Hearst and a handful of fashion brands ― cut ties with Terry Richardson in October over the sexual abuse allegations that have followed the controversial photographer for years."

Referring to Trump’s taunting tweet about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s “nuclear button” being smaller than his own, Hagel said Trump was spouting “irresponsible kind of talk.”Hagel has criticized Trump’s leadership before. Last May, he said Trump didn’t understand governing and needed to “listen and learn” but was “doing just the opposite.”“I hope he will take a different tack soon, before it’s too late, before he loses the credibility and the confidence to govern,” he told the Omaha World-Herald.Months later, Hagel, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, said he was “offended” by Trump’s handling of a call to a widow of a soldier killed in Niger and the president’s accusations that Obama had not called the families of fallen soldiers when he was in office.“I’m offended by the way he’s handled it,” Hagel told USA Today at the time. “You just don’t use the families of the fallen to score political points, especially to take jabs at your predecessor. I’m very unhappy about this.”"

The appreciation of what you do is what it should be. Dressing [Donald Trump] would be one thing. But with her, I think it’s different. After the election, notable designers like Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs and Sophie Theallet declared they wouldn’t dress Melania Trump (though Ford’s reasoning was based on Trump’s personal image, rather than political reasoning).Many in the fashion community would like to dress members of the first family, or have done so already. Designer Stefano Gabbana of Dolce & Gabbana regularly dresses Melania and Ivanka Trump and praises their outfits on Instagram. Designer Tommy Hilfiger said just a few days after the 2016 election he would be “proud” to dress Melania.“I think Melania is a very beautiful woman and I think any designer should be proud to dress her,” he said, according to Women’s Wear Daily. “Ivanka [Trump] is equally as beautiful and smart, although she wears her own clothes. I don’t think people should become political about it.”"

We exchanged numbers. We texted back and forth and eventually went on a date. We went out to dinner, and afterwards we ended up engaging in sexual activity, which by all indications was completely consensual.In the story, a 23-year-old woman said she went on a date with Ansari last September in New York after they met at a party. The woman, who went by the name Grace in the article to protect her identity, said the pair eventually went back to Ansari’s apartment, where the comedian quickly initiated a sexual encounter.Grace then alleged Ansari began performing oral sex on her and asked her to do the same to him. She said she felt pressured to continue the experience despite giving “verbal and non-verbal cues to indicate how uncomfortable and distressed she was.”“Most of my discomfort was expressed in me pulling away and mumbling. I know that my hand stopped moving at some points,” Grace told babe. “I stopped moving my lips and turned cold.”After she left his apartment, Grace said she began crying and sent Ansari a text message explaining her discomfort: “It may have seemed okay. But I didn’t feel good at all,” she wrote.“I’m so sad to hear this,” Ansari replied at the time. “All I can say is, it would never be my intention to make you or anyone feel the way you described. Clearly I misread things in the moment and I’m truly sorry.”Grace said she came forward with her account after she saw Ansari win the award for best actor in a television comedy at the Golden Globes for his Netflix series “Master of None” earlier this month. Ansari was photographed wearing a pin reading “Times Up” at the event, a message of solidarity with women in the entertainment industry."

We do go through a process to make that determination,” District Attorney Faith Johnson said at a news conference after a grand jury returned the indictments.Mathews was additionally charged with abandoning a child and tampering with evidence, both in the second degree and carrying two to 20 years in prison, Johnson said.

The quote was later confirmed by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who attended the meeting.Nielsen, who was also in the meeting with Trump, said Sunday she could not recall him “using that exact phrase” to describe giving visas to individuals from certain countries.“I think he has been clear, and I would certainly say undoubtedly the president will use ― continue to use ― strong language when it comes to this issue because he feels very passionately,” Nielsen added.Nielsen, a longtime aide to White House chief of staff John Kelly, was tapped to lead the Department of Homeland Security after Kelly was given the chief of staff role last year.Sens. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), other participants in the meeting, seemed to backtrack on a prior statement regarding the president’s language in separate interviews on Sunday. While Perdue and Cotton initially said after the meeting that they could not recall whether Trump used the phrase, Perdue told ABC’s “This Week” that Trump “did not say that word.” “This is a gross misrepresentation, and this is not the first time Sen. Durbin has done it,” Perdue said, referring to his Democratic colleague.Cotton told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he “didn’t hear” the president say the word.Trump’s comment drew outrage from both Democrats and some Republican lawmakers, who criticized the president’s choice of words and called for him to apologize. Rep. Mia Love, a Utah Republican and the only Haitian-American in Congress, agreed Sunday that Trump’s comments were racist.“I think that they were unfortunate,” Love said of Trump’s comments during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I don’t know if they were taken ― I wasn’t in the room. I know the comments were made. I don’t know which context they were made. I’m looking forward to finding out what happened, but more importantly, I’m looking forward to trying to fix the problem. I think we need to ― we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard.”Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) went further during an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” however, stating that he thought Trump “is a racist.” Asked if he will attend the president’s first State of the Union address this month, the civil rights icon replied, “In good conscience, I cannot and will not sit there and listen at him as he gives the State of the Union address.” Trump, meanwhile, defended himself Sunday on Twitter."

Jesse Jackson announced in November that he’d been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, he was not spared by the ruthless news cycle.Jackson’s name scrolled along bright red tickers for only the brief, intermittent moments between chaos. His announcement was largely crowded out by news of the GOP tax bill and sexual assault allegations against Democratic Sen. Al Franken. As his revelation traveled across the Web, unfounded rumors of his imminent death caused a brief reflection on what Jackson meant to his nation.But Jackson’s legacy is worthy of deeper scrutiny — albeit a scrutiny spurred by his ill condition — particularly as the United States feels the tremors from waves he helped create.Race is the most potent force in American politics, and no one has navigated it and manipulated it for longer, and with greater stature, than the Rev. Jesse Jackson. His complicated history reveals one whose influence is perhaps further reaching and more implicative of our nation than any other since its beginnings.Barack Obama’s presidency unveiled a flood of overt racism that has, to date, imperiled the United States domestically and exposed the nation abroad. And to credit Obama for this is also to credit Jackson for providing Obama with a methodology for political success, thus influencing the arc of our national history in incomparable ways. In the 1970s, Jackson emerged as the civil rights movement’s foremost vestige. He’d outlived or outgrown his cadre of activist contemporaries from the late-1960s — the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. among them — and spent a significant portion of the decade compiling a portfolio of global activist work. By the 1984 Democratic primaries, Jackson had reified himself in American culture as a thought leader on civil rights, to the dismay of some who’d accused him of carpetbagging for years, and any study of Jackson’s political significance requires noting the privileges afforded him. A concoction of racism and sexism had, up to then, inhibited Americans from allowing black women to ascend similarly in politics, even though a Shirley Chisholm or Barbara Jordan may have been more qualified.Nonetheless, Jackson consolidated enough heft among Southern blacks and disillusioned whites to win contests in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina during his 1984 bid. His soaring speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention conceded victory to his opponents, but it provided a framework for Democratic politics that still holds.“Our flag is red, white and blue, but our nation is a rainbow ― red, yellow, brown, black and white,” Jackson said, “and we’re all precious in God’s sight.”Jackson concluded his speech by professing, “Our time has come. Suffering breeds character. Character breeds faith. In the end, faith will not disappoint.”Twenty years later, these broad appeals to human goodness would characterize Obama’s foray into national politics and ultimately identify the Democratic Party as a whole. When, in his famous address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Obama said “there is not a black America, and a white America, and Latino America and Asian America — there’s the United States,” he, too, was making the proclamation to white Americans and not the black, Latino or Asian Americans who knew otherwise. At their heights, Jackson and Obama mastered such sermons to white Americans about their greater selves. Disregarding the validity of these arguments, the political expediency in them is clear: Historically, politicians have stood a greater chance at coalescing white voters by assuring them of their good faith, not by citing injustices that favor them. This strategy proved fruitful for Jackson in the 1988 election cycle. Jackson tripled his share of white voters from 1984 to 1988, improved upon his support in the South and captured victories in 13 contests, including Michigan. His failed-but-competitive candidacy modeled a path forward for Democrats, who, as today, sought to encircle rural white voters in the electorate when it seemed they’d secured the black vote reliably.Obama praised Jackson during his 2008 candidacy, saying he “set a precedent for African Americans running for the highest office in the land.”America’s first black president inflicted a psychic trauma upon his nation.In his absence, it becomes easier to interpret Obama’s presidency as a denouement in the American experiment. The semblance of order and rightness during Obama’s reign has been followed by overt racist fragility, lawlessness and grift, and studies link these shifts to a national recoil to the first black president and his accompanying implications. A majority of white Americans now believe whites face racial discrimination in the U.S., with a near-majority of Trump voters believing whites face more discrimination than any other group. And ahead of the 2016 election, polling found that 72 percent of registered Republicans expressed doubt about Obama’s citizenship. Tracing this all back, it was Jackson’s 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns that provided Obama with a blueprint for electoral success.American media has frequently portrayed Jesse Jackson as a cabal leader whose sycophants — 40 million-plus blacks in the U.S. — animate at his whim.In a 2013 segment, for example, Fox News host Tucker Carlson confessed that he didn’t “know how [he felt] about George Zimmerman,” who fatally shot 17-year old Trayvon Martin in Florida, but that he was “positive that people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton do not deserve to be called civil rights leaders,” after he accused them of inflaming racial tension.His is a name which riddles racist message boards and comment threads. This assignment of messianic stature has always caricatured Jackson in many ways. But the enduring question concerning him, lobbed earnestly from his good-faith dissenters and cynically from those opposed to his anti-racist activism, concerns whether or when his willingness to engage for the sake of political access is driven by self-interest.When, for example, candidate Bill Clinton campaigned at Jackson’s 1992 Rainbow Coalition conference and denounced musician Sister Souljah for her remarks about race in America, Jackson labeled Clinton’s behavior a “character flaw.”When, as president, Clinton endorsed the 1994 crime bill, Jackson professed black voters would be best served by not granting their power “without merit” to Democrats in the South. When Clinton signed a 1995 law to retain disparate sentences for crack and powder cocaine, Jackson deemed it a “moral disgrace” and suggested Clinton sacrificed “young black youth for white fear.”But in 1996, when it came time to endorse Clinton, Jackson did so on the stage of the Democratic National Convention.It is reasonable to attribute these decisions to pragmatism — to deem them the begrudged acts of a conflicted man. But when juxtaposed against Jackson’s more recent history, the result is a Rorschach test: He means something to everyone, and that something varies greatly from person to person.Jackson’s wavering politics on matters of abortion and end-of-life rights soured many, and news of his extramarital affair in 2001 disappointed those who expected more of their civil rights icons. His initial reticence to support Obama, and his later comments condemning Obama and calling for his castration, cleaved his support among blacks and ostracized those already skeptical of his motives.And presently, in a rapidly changing activist environment guided by a vast, non-centralized network of teens and twenty- and thirtysomethings, Jackson has seen his esteem wane among some who, at once, may be unfamiliar with his bona fides but also wish to depart from his style of leadership.Further, Jackson is a black man who, uniquely, saw his name establish enough clout to garner political favor for his family, and he eventually saw that favor ensnare his family in scandal. But he is also one who exposed the truth about American activism: that it is inherently desperate work. One is driven to act only in response to some sort of outside, unbearable pressure. And the urgency with which those enduring this pressure seek to alleviate it — either for themselves or their community — can beget strange bedfellows, because the underlying objectification in allyship is clear: In a white male-driven society, accessing the levers of power often requires partnering with, and using, those who deem your cause unworthy.Jesse Jackson has played that game. And his doing so has shaped our world for the foreseeable future. "

49,POLITICS,How DACA Could Outlast Trump,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-daca-could-outlast-trump_us_5a59237de4b0fcbc3a100bda,A federal judge’s ruling raises the possibility the program may survive this administration ― even if the White House wins in court.,2018-01-13,Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient Gloria Mendoza participates in a protest in support of a standalone Dream Act in New York on Jan. 10.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5928501f00009a00db880b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Congress and the White House spent much of this week trying to fix the problem President Donald Trump created in September when he abruptly canceled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that provides renewable two-year deportation protections and work permits to undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as youths. But even if Congress and the White House fail to hash out a deal to protect Dreamers, as the young immigrants are known, DACA could remain in effect through 2020, and possibly into a new administration. DACA could outlast Trump because Dreamers and their advocates aren’t solely relying on Congress to help them. They’re also fighting Trump’s move in the courts, where they won a key victory Tuesday night: a national injunction blocking Trump from phasing out DACA. The injunction could make it much harder than the White House thought to make DACA go away. And although U.S. District Judge William Alsup’s ruling doesn’t allow new DACA applications, it lets people who hold the protections keep renewing them past the March 5 deadline set by the Trump administration. If litigation drags on for several months, as it likely will, DACA might remain in effect through 2020, and possibly into a new administration. “It’s entirely possible to see that some people will still have DACA permits on Election Day in 2020,” Michael Kagan, a law professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, told HuffPost. “I’m not predicting that. But it is now possible that people will be able to renew DACA permits later this year and some of those permits may still be valid in November 2020.”The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court could invalidate the injunction. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who plans to appeal the district court’s decision, will face an uphill battle trying to convince the appeals court that the U.S. government needs to start canceling DACA work authorizations before the courts decide the lawsuits, according to Stephen Legomsky, the former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The program has hummed along for five years without any legal challenge. “There’s no irreparable harm and there’s no urgency,” Legomsky told HuffPost. “The administration is going to be hard-pressed to come up with a reason to stay the injunction during the long period of time this case will be pending … If Congress does not enact a Dream Act, I think it’s possible that people could renew DACA into the next administration.” Litigation wouldn’t have to drag on long for that to happen, provided the injunction remains standing. If the Supreme Court hasn’t decided the case by next January and Congress hasn’t passed some version of the Dream Act, the two-year DACA renewals will start extending into the next presidential term. If Trump were to lose his re-election bid, DACA could wind up outlasting him ― even if those challenging the cancellation of DACA ultimately lose in court. Up until now, the case before Alsup has plodded along slowly, partly because of a dispute over what documents to include for evidence in the case. Alsup has ruled the Trump administration must turn over all memos and emails that informed the decision to kill the program ― a prospect that would offer a unique window into communications between the White House and the departments of Justice and Homeland Security. Lawyers for the administration appealed the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that the records amount to executive deliberations that don’t have to be disclosed to the court. They won temporary protection from having to give up the documents, but the issue remains unresolved. That question must be answered before the discovery period ― when parties in a lawsuit disclose evidence to one another ― can end, so the case can move to trial. And Alsup’s injunction ruling says those challenging the Trump administration are likely to win on their claim that canceling DACA “was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with the law.” If Alsup rules against the White House at trial, the government will almost surely appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and appeal again if that court decides against them. The case is likely to wind up before the Supreme Court. Each of those steps takes time. All the while, provided the injunction is left standing, DACA recipients will be able to keep renewing their status for another two-year period. It’s also possible that a different set of consolidated lawsuits filed in New York to challenge the end of DACA could result in a separate injunction. Those cases ― brought by a DACA recipient, and a coalition of 15 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia ― make many of the same allegations found in the California lawsuit. The Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to seek public comment or provide enough notice when it canceled DACA, the lawsuits say. And they accuse Trump of acting with the goal of discriminating against Mexicans ― “racial animus,” in legalese ― which would violate DACA recipients’ constitutional right to equal protection before the law.It remains to be seen how Alsup’s injunction will affect the tense negotiations in Washington. With DACA left hanging by a thread in the courts, some analysts suspect the injunction could make some Congress members cool on Dream Act legislation.“Lawmakers who were not keen to do anything for the Dreamers now have an additional excuse not to do it,” Muzaffar Chischti, who directs the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute’s office at New York University, told HuffPost. “They could say, ‘Let’s see how it now takes its course in the courts.’”Others say the injunction wrests away, if only tenuously, the leverage Trump took when he canceled the program back in September. “I believe it’s good as well for proponents of a permanent fix,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) said in an interview about the injunction in his case to preserve DACA. “It gives them the leverage to fight back against those who are trying to load up a measure to fix DACA with things that have nothing to do with DACA and have very little sense or value ... This is a chance for everyone to say, ‘DACA is demonstrating its staying power. Let’s get this resolved.’” "

She had enough of watching her parents constantly struggle to scrounge up wood to heat the house.The 12-year-old girl went to the bathroom and tried to kill herself.“She was tired of waking up cold,” Jimmy Two Bulls, a Pine Ridge resident who’s helping out the girl’s family, told HuffPost. “Reservation life is a hard life to live. It’s a struggle.”Suicides reached record highs in South Dakota last year. Oglala Lakota County, which is where the Pine Ridge reservation is located, was one of five counties in the state with the highest rates of suicide. People who have experience dealing with depression and suicide on the reservation say this is tied, in part, to the devastatingly difficult conditions residents face. While there’s no indication that suicides increase during the winter, local experts say winter’s relentless conditions can lead to feelings of despair. A 2016 study conducted through the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs found that there’s a close correlation between poverty rates and suicide rates in the U.S.“It’s tough, and it all builds up,” Eileen Janis, 57, who co-runs Oglala Sioux Tribe Suicide Prevention, told HuffPost. “And you say: ‘To hell with it.

But it’s not the only one. People living without heat are also susceptible to hypothermia, and older members of the community are particularly vulnerable because their health could already be compromised. Those who rely on space heaters run the danger of starting a house fire. Children who don’t have access to sufficient heat struggle to sleep at night and then aren’t able to concentrate in school, Alice Phelps, 47, principal of the Wounded Knee School District, told HuffPost.“The children act up at school. But when we talk to them one-on-one, the bottom line is they didn’t sleep that night,” Phelps, who grew up on the reservation, said. “They’ll say: ‘I didn’t have a blanket. I gave it to my little sister. I was cold.’ It just breaks your heart.”Winter is also the time children appreciate school the most, because the building is heated and they’re guaranteed at least one hot meal. Attendance is near perfect at this time of year, Phelps said.“They want to be in school,” Phelps said. “It’s warm. It’s safe. Their immediate needs are met.Wounded Knee is working on building a “safe house,” a place where up to 10 children in need of a place to stay for the night can come, whether because of abuse at home or not having heat or other critical resources. The building is basically complete, but Phelps is working on hiring a staff member to run it.But even those on the reservation who can afford to buy propane to heat their homes typically can’t afford as much as it takes to keep a house livable when temperatures are drop below zero, said Bob Claussen, owner of Bob’s Gas, a company in Martin, South Dakota, that makes the 45-mile trek to the reservation when it’s able. Claussen said he typically gets around 15 “small” orders for propane ― about $150 worth of propane at a time. But that can last only about three weeks, he said. A number of nonprofits work with fuel companies to get propane to households in need. Lakota Kidz, an organization that donates supplies like books and clothes to the reservation, is one of the groups that works with Bob’s Gas. Lakota Kidz donates enough to cover two months’ worth of fuel for about 30 families on the reservation.Last year, the Oglala Sioux Tribe received $1.2 million in funding from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federal program that helps underserved families with their energy bills and other needs. Those funds will drop slightly this year. In addition to struggling to afford heat, many residents also live in run-down homes that simply aren’t built for the brutal winters.Some of these homes have only one room.

She had enough of watching her parents constantly struggle to scrounge up wood to heat the house.The 12-year-old girl went to the bathroom and tried to kill herself.“She was tired of waking up cold,” Jimmy Two Bulls, a Pine Ridge resident who’s helping out the girl’s family, told HuffPost. “Reservation life is a hard life to live. It’s a struggle.”Suicides reached record highs in South Dakota last year. Oglala Lakota County, which is where the Pine Ridge reservation is located, was one of five counties in the state with the highest rates of suicide. People who have experience dealing with depression and suicide on the reservation say this is tied, in part, to the devastatingly difficult conditions residents face. While there’s no indication that suicides increase during the winter, local experts say winter’s relentless conditions can lead to feelings of despair. A 2016 study conducted through the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs found that there’s a close correlation between poverty rates and suicide rates in the U.S.“It’s tough, and it all builds up,” Eileen Janis, 57, who co-runs Oglala Sioux Tribe Suicide Prevention, told HuffPost. “And you say: ‘To hell with it.

In addition, Haggis’ former publicist Haleigh Breest filed a $9 million lawsuit last month accusing him of raping her in 2013.Haggis quickly filed a countersuit against Breest. Rennard said he told her he cannot directly address any charges until that case plays out in court.In her statement, Rennard said that her ex-husband is “not the type of man who would ever commit an act of violence or aggression against a woman.”She then attacked two of the allegations made against Haggis, including that from Breest.Rennard claimed that at the time Breest was allegedly raped, January 2013, Haggis had just had “serious back surgery” and wore a brace under his shirt until early March. Since he had to be careful how he stood or sat, his former wife said he “was no physical condition to restrain a young woman against her will.”Rennard criticized Haggis’ other accusers for not identifying themselves:I don’t know the women who are making these allegations against Paul; because they are anonymous. How is it even possible, in America in the year 2018, that someone can destroy another’s reputation and not even have to give their name?Then she focused on the allegation made by one of the anonymous accusers. That woman said she was working for Haggis as an in-house publicist when the alleged rape occurred, but Rennard said that wasn’t possible:There was no in-house “publicist” working in our offices – I would know, I had the office adjacent to Paul’s. We frequently worked late, and I always stayed with Paul and we always left together. Although we were not yet married, we were living together, and together we would make the half hour drive home. Every morning. Every night.Deadline said it was printing Rennard’s letter because “it seems fair to allow voices from both sides to be heard.”"

Mia Love (R-Utah), who made history in 2014 as the first Haitian-American woman elected to Congress, released a statement on Thursday responding to reports that Trump insulted multiple countries during negotiations on restoring federal protections for some immigrants.When lawmakers at the Oval Office meeting proposed granting visas to individuals from Haiti, El Salvador and a range of African nations, Trump reportedly said, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”He followed his comment by suggesting that the U.S. “should have more people from places like Norway,” sources told NBC News. The following day, Trump claimed on Twitter that he hadn’t used those specific words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― who was in the room at the time ― swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact “said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.”Love said the president’s remarks were “unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation’s values.”The congresswoman, one of the few Republican lawmakers who called out Trump, continued:This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation. My parents came from one of those countries but proudly took the oath of allegiance to the United States and took on the responsibilities of everything that being a citizen comes with. They never took a thing from our federal government. They worked hard, paid taxes, and rose from nothing to take care of and provide opportunities for their children. They taught their children to do the same. That’s the American Dream. The President must apologize to both the American people and the nations he so wantonly maligned.This wasn’t the first time Love stood up for Haitian immigrants. In November, she said she disagreed with the Trump administration’s decision to end the temporary protected status granted to Haitians who had fled their country after a devastating earthquake in 2010.“I’m going to do everything I can to work with the administration, but this is a place where we disagree, really disagree,” Love told a Utah radio show, according to the Deseret News. She added, “There is going to be a full-court press on the president on this issue because this is a bad decision.”Two Florida Republicans joined Love on Thursday in condemning the president’s ugly comments.“The president calling #Haiti a ‘shithole country’ ignores the contributions thousands of Haitians have made to our #SoFla community and nation,” Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen tweeted. “Language like that shouldn’t be heard in locker rooms and it shouldn’t be heard in the White House.”Rep. Carlos Curbelo also stood up for immigrants under temporary protected status, saying that “under no circumstances is it acceptable to degrade, denigrate or dehumanize” them.The article has been updated to include that Trump has denied having used that specific language, and Durbin’s assertion that he did."

The bonds issued since 2000 alone will ultimately cost the federal government about $3.2 billion over their terms, according to the Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank.“That is about $10 per person in the U.S., hardly an amount that gets people to rise up in the street,” Matheson said. “But the use of tax-exempt financing can easily save an individual NFL owner $20 million in financing costs for the new stadium for every year of his lease.”The House version of the tax bill eliminated the stadium subsidy, but the Senate bill didn’t. When the two sides came together to hammer out the differences, the Senate ― and the rich owners of NFL, NBA and MLB teams ― won this round. As a result, every American taxpayer will keep helping to finance increasingly expensive stadiums.“The point of those bonds is to help communities to build infrastructure and when you have teams that make billions of dollars, that’s probably not the best use of our tax structure,” Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), who was a member of the conference committee that negotiated the final bill, told HuffPost.Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), another member of the conference committee, said that even some Senate Republicans didn’t want to preserve the stadium subsidy.“I think it was probably controversial on our side,” Thune told HuffPost. “The use of private activity bonds and some of the things that the House did away with, there was a lot of support for in the House, but there was also strong support for in the Senate. But I think a lot of those were part of the negotiation, and it was a lot of give-and-take on both sides.”Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) took credit for killing the House provision in a statement last month. “Heller was able to protect the tax exemption for stadium bonds, which is critical to preserving the influx of business and growth associated with the construction of the Raiders stadium in Las Vegas,” his office said on its website.Nevada approved a plan last year to put a record $750 million in taxpayer money into a new stadium for the NFL’s Oakland Raiders, who will relocate to Las Vegas as soon as 2020.The sports tax break was a creation of the 1986 tax overhaul. It provides a federal subsidy to stadium projects through discounted interest rates on the tax-free bonds and was originally written in the hopes of curtailing public spending on stadiums.Instead, it helped spark a boom in new stadium construction. Cities and states dumped more than $17 billion in public money into stadiums between 1986 and 2012, according to a Bloomberg analysis. The building explosion has only continued since. Government watchdogs and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have lamented stadium subsidies for more than a decade, for good reason: while new stadiums have helped double the value of sports franchises, there is near-consensus among economists that the costs of new stadiums for the taxpayers far outweigh the minuscule economic benefits they provide cities and states.Repealing the tax break for sports facilities would have led to only modest savings over the next decade ― an estimated $200 million, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation ― and it wouldn’t have stopped taxpayer-financed stadium construction. But it would have removed federal taxpayers from the equation ― someone living in St. Louis, for instance, would no longer help pay for a new billion-dollar arena in Las Vegas.It would have also raised the costs of such projects for both team owners and state and local governments, potentially adding millions of dollars a year in interest payments to stadiums’ already exorbitant price tags. No surprise then that the broad support for repealing the subsidy was countered by vocal and bipartisan opposition, particularly from lawmakers with new or pending stadium projects in their districts.Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.), whose district includes the new Raiders stadium, said the repeal provision of the House bill was “one of the many reasons why the GOP tax bill is bad for Nevada.” Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) said he would try to ensure that a new stadium for baseball’s Texas Rangers would still get the tax break even if it were repealed.Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), who opposed the tax bill primarily because it curbed a deduction used by high-income taxpayers to write off what they pay in state and local taxes, said pressure from lawmakers in stadium districts likely killed the subsidy repeal.“I would assume it’s people from areas where that would benefit,” King said.MLB and the NFL lobbied Congress on “issues related to tax reform” throughout 2017, according to federal lobbying disclosures. The NFL publicly opposed the effort to eliminate the stadium tax break. Neither the NFL nor MLB immediately responded to a request for comment.In the final stretch, preserving the tax break became “a priority” for President Trump, a Republican aide told The Wall Street Journal in December.Though Trump made a show of threatening NFL-related tax breaks in the fall ― a bit of political theater rooted in his opposition to football players protesting police brutality and racial injustice during the national anthem ― he is also friendly with several influential NFL owners, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who now serves as Trump’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.NFL owners collectively gave Trump’s inaugural committee more than $7 million. The league itself contributed $100,000. During the 2016 election cycle, NFL owners donated more than $8.5 million to political candidates and causes, with the vast majority of their money ― slightly more than $8 million ― going toward Republican candidates and right-leaning causes. Overall, team owners from the four major American men’s leagues gave $23 million to Republican candidates and committees during the last election cycle ― 10 times more than they contributed to Democrats.Just before the tax law passed, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) pushed an amendment to end the stadium subsidy. But the Senate never adopted it.“We’re really disappointed, and we’re not giving up,” Lankford’s spokesman told HuffPost. “We’re exploring other avenues in the Senate.”This story has been updated to include Sen. Dean Heller’s comment."

Tracking his route and calculating his steps is a new Fitbit bracelet on his wrist.Hahyar, a 63-year-old recently retired from his job as a special education teacher, credits his daily walks with keeping him active and lifting his mood. Motivating him, he says, are the many public parks and tree-lined streets in this beachfront city in western Los Angeles County.Healthy living habits might be precisely what you expect of residents in this sunny Californian city. The data, however, paint a different picture. According to the city’s latest Wellbeing Index, only 38 percent of Santa Monica’s population of 92,000 are active for 20 minutes or more per day. Hahyar is one of 200 residents who were given Fitbits for a six-month government initiative created as a result of these findings, in the hope the tech will nudge them to increase their exercise levels.The Wellbeing Index, introduced in late 2013, marks an attempt to go beyond economic criteria as the sole focus of a city’s success. The initiative reflects a growing conviction among U.S. social policy experts that positive economic figures often hide growing inequalities and pockets of deprivation.  Alongside economic opportunity, the Index analyzes how citizens are faring in terms of their general outlook on life, their sense of community, their interaction with their environment, their health and their access to learning. Santa Monica is not alone in trying to break the monopoly that hard economics enjoys in public policy. Other U.S. cities experimenting with broader ways of defining urban health and happiness include Seattle, Jacksonville, New Haven and Somerville. Where Santa Monica differs is the extent to which its well-being calculations are informing government activities. Most other indices of this type are run as policy prototypes or research experiments, says Julie Rusk, who carries the daunting job title of chief civic well-being officer for the city.“Here in Santa Monica, it’s different. We’re embedded right in city hall,” Rusk said. Her team sits within the city manager’s office, giving them prime access to both the mayor and the city council.With this policy focus in place from the outset, the need for hard, credible data has always existed, Rusk added. In addition to traditional data sets, the Index team has developed a survey to tease out residents’ everyday experiences in a range of areas.The latest survey findings, which draw on the views of over 3,800 residents, confirm the general view of Santa Monica as a relatively affluent and progressive place to live. Some key factors of life satisfaction are above average: levels of trust among neighbors (84 percent of respondents agreed “people in my neighborhood could be trusted”), average household incomes ($76,000, compared to a national median of $55,775) and rates of volunteering (around one third of the city’s residents regularly volunteer, against one quarter nationally).Yet, as with almost any U.S. city, pockets of economic deprivation and social alienation exist. Many of these run along ethnic or race lines. Santa Monica’s population is predominantly white, although it also counts significant Latino (15.4 percent) and Asian (9.3 percent) communities.Education attainment among minority groups in Santa Monica is consistently lower than among their white counterparts, for instance. The same is true for levels of health, with black and Asian residents getting the least sleep, and Latino residents eating the least healthily, according to Index results.The point of the Wellbeing Index is not to collect information for information’s sake, but to inform government decision-making, stressed Rusk: “It’s really about better reflecting who the community is so we can better understand those we are here to govern and partner with.”Helping in this is the ability of the Index’s administrators to splice the aggregated data according to gender, race and ethnicity, or ZIP code. Hence the decision to target the Fitbit program on Hahyar’s mid-town district, where residents were revealed to be especially inactive.To gain an even more granular understanding of residents’ lived experience, the city government is experimenting with the mining of social media. One current pilot, for example, sees it tracking job-seekers on Twitter to determine local attitudes toward employment opportunities. Another crunches data from the location app Foursquare to work out how many people are visiting Santa Monica’s parks. The Index has revealed a number of surprises, said Lisa Parson, a project manager in the city government’s Wellbeing division. Fresh fruit and vegetable consumption in the city, for instance, is only around half that of the U.S. average, according to the Index’s findings. The statistic was all the more unexpected given Santa Monica’s numerous, well-attended farmers markets. The Wellbeing division convened community leaders and residents from the worst-performing neighborhood in an attempt to discover the reasons behind this. They found that many customers came from other municipalities to shop at the farmers markets. In contrast, local people — especially those on low incomes — felt that the markets were “not for them,” Parson said.In response, the city worked with the farmers market nearest to the targeted neighborhood to make it more welcoming. Among the initiatives were a vegetable scavenger hunt for kids and a community cooking competition for their parents.The biggest boost to local dietary habits came through a reform to a publicly funded food subsidy program. It was found that only one-third of the 1,200 eligible individuals had subscribed, with most put off doing so because of the cumbersome online application process. The Wellbeing team asked the county government, which administers the benefits, to fund an employee to sign people up in person. “The individual was given a station in the park to address the problem of signing up online ... and since the beginning, their appointment book has been pretty much booked up consistently,” Parson said.These are one-off interventions, however. The real challenge will be integrating the Index’s findings into decision-making processes across city government. As a first step, all city departments now have to show how they intend to progress the city’s well-being agenda. The results will feed into how departmental budgets are divvied up.This change in institutional thinking marks a “big shift,” Parson said. “It takes a long time to get appropriate buy-in and appropriate movement to turn this into an operating system for the city, but we’re on our way.” Asking people about the quality of their own lives, ideally before and after implementing programs, “provides a powerful bottom-up measure of the quality and success of a community or country,” Professor John Helliwell, a University of British Columbia economist and editor the United Nations World Happiness Report, said. He praised Santa Monica as “one of the leading participants in this worldwide innovation.” Community leaders have responded positively to the efforts of the city government as well. In meetings with city officials, having hard data on social and environmental issues on-hand helps reinforce residents’ arguments, says Irma Carranza, a longtime advocate for Santa Monica’s Latino population.“Before, government was mostly focused on buildings, traffic and the like. But we believe government’s job is also people, their well-being and quality of life ... The Wellbeing Index now provides the data to support our testimony [and] can help guide the city’s focus and those of us working in the community,” she said.Carranza said particular concerns among the predominantly Latino residents in the city’s Pico neighborhood are around changes to immigration rules and affordable housing. In response to the Index’s findings, the city government is looking into ways to keep residents in their homes. “The Wellbeing Index reminds us of some things we already knew but also about many things we didn’t know,” Carranza said. “ And now that we know, we can look to address those burdens and challenges so residents are able to focus on their well-being, their families and things that matter and bring them joy.”For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.

A statement from the Marchesa brand, which is run by Chapman and her partner Keren Craig, described the collection as a visit to “a nocturnal garden party, boasting dramatic silhouettes and colors.” Chapman, 41, announced that she’d be splitting from Weinstein, 65, in October 2017, amid explosive reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker that accused Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein denied the allegations.Since then, the couple have privately reached a settlement to end their 10-year marriage and give primary custody of their two children to Chapman. They have not yet formally filed for divorce in court.“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,” Chapman previously said of Weinstein’s deeds in a statement to People magazine.In the past, Weinstein reportedly supported his wife’s fashion business by forcing stars like Felicity Huffman and Sienna Miller to wear her brand on the red carpet. With Weinstein now deluged by accusations of sexual misconduct, many speculated that Marchesa would suffer unless Chapman cut ties. Now that she seemingly has, we can only wait and see what will happen.You can check out Marchesa’s lookbook on Women’s Wear Daily."

At least one of the videos shows an officer putting a gun to Sterling’s head while saying, “I’ll kill you, bitch,” according to court documents.“We still don’t have closure,” Michael Adams, one of the attorneys representing the family, told Baton Rouge’s WBRZ-TV. “The city is still sitting and waiting to see what happened or what is going to happen. It’s unfair that this entire community is still talking about this almost two years later and have not gotten any further down the road.”Tired of asking and waiting, the Sterling family attorneys this week filed subpoenas in a Baton Rouge state court to force state Attorney General Jeff Landry to turn over not only the videos, but other unreleased evidence.Sterling, 37, was confronted by East Baton Rouge Parish police officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II outside the Triple S Food Mart on July 5, 2016. The officers, police said, were responding to a call about a man with a gun.According to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Sterling’s family last year, Sterling cooperated when approached by Officer Lake and it was Salamoni who displayed aggressive behavior.The court documents allege that Salamoni “pulled out his gun from his holster, pointed his service weapon to Mr. Sterling’s head and yelled aggressively, with intent, ‘Bitch, I will f**king kill you … I am going to shoot you in your mother f**king head.’″After deploying a stun gun and tackling Sterling to the ground, Salamoni, who claims Sterling reached for a gun, shot him a total of six times, according to the court documents.In the days following the shooting, store owner Abdul Muflahi told HuffPost that he witnessed the shooting and did not see Sterling with a gun, but did see officers remove one from Sterling’s pocket.

At least one of the videos shows an officer putting a gun to Sterling’s head while saying, “I’ll kill you, bitch,” according to court documents.“We still don’t have closure,” Michael Adams, one of the attorneys representing the family, told Baton Rouge’s WBRZ-TV. “The city is still sitting and waiting to see what happened or what is going to happen. It’s unfair that this entire community is still talking about this almost two years later and have not gotten any further down the road.”Tired of asking and waiting, the Sterling family attorneys this week filed subpoenas in a Baton Rouge state court to force state Attorney General Jeff Landry to turn over not only the videos, but other unreleased evidence.Sterling, 37, was confronted by East Baton Rouge Parish police officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II outside the Triple S Food Mart on July 5, 2016. The officers, police said, were responding to a call about a man with a gun.According to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Sterling’s family last year, Sterling cooperated when approached by Officer Lake and it was Salamoni who displayed aggressive behavior.The court documents allege that Salamoni “pulled out his gun from his holster, pointed his service weapon to Mr. Sterling’s head and yelled aggressively, with intent, ‘Bitch, I will f**king kill you … I am going to shoot you in your mother f**king head.’″After deploying a stun gun and tackling Sterling to the ground, Salamoni, who claims Sterling reached for a gun, shot him a total of six times, according to the court documents.In the days following the shooting, store owner Abdul Muflahi told HuffPost that he witnessed the shooting and did not see Sterling with a gun, but did see officers remove one from Sterling’s pocket.

68,POLITICS,A Medicaid Work Requirement Would Be Bad Policy Without The Opioid Crisis. It's Disastrous With It.,Livia Gershon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicaid-changes-opioid_us_5a57e4e5e4b0720dc4c592ee,The first state waiver is likely to be from Kentucky -- a state that has benefited enormously from Medicaid coverage for people facing opioid addiction,2018-01-12,Protesters gather in Denver in July to pressure Colorado's governor to turn down a bill that would limit Medicaid.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a580912220000251ab4e056.jpeg?cache=CP3fDlOkR3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trump administration opened the doors Thursday for states to set work requirements for people who get Medicaid, a move that is likely to be a catastrophe for some of the most vulnerable Americans, particularly those struggling with opioid addiction.The new Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services guidance, which allows states to seek federal permission to establish restrictions, could threaten the Medicaid coverage of the many adults with disabilities, children and the elderly who cannot work. And, since the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, its benefits have been a key component in addressing the rise of substance abuse. From 2011 to 2016, Medicaid spending on prescription treatments for opioid use disorder rose from $394.2 million to $929.9 million, according to a report from the Urban Institute, a left-leaning Washington, D.C., think tank.The guidance letter does acknowledge the severity of the opioid crisis. It says states must “take certain steps” to provide coverage for people in need of substance abuse treatment, potentially by counting time a person spends in treatment toward work requirements or by exempting those participating in “intensive medical treatment.”But Sara Rosenbaum, a law professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, said the letter doesn’t actually bar states from kicking people with substance abuse problems off their insurance.“There’s absolutely nothing that requires the exemption of people with addiction,” Rosenbaum said. “They just said there are considerations…. It does not say you can’t do anything that would impair access to treatment.”Even if people in treatment, or with other circumstances that prevent them from working, are legally entitled to an exemption under state rules, another big issue is how many hoops they’ll have to jump through to keep getting medical care. Under state work requirements, people have to verify their work status or their qualification for an exemption, according to MaryBeth Musumeci, associate director of Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicaid & the Uninsured. In some cases, they may have to file paperwork as often as every month to verify that they’re still exempt.“There is a real risk of eligible people losing coverage due to their inability to navigate this process or miscommunication or other breakdown in the administrative process,” she said in an email to HuffPost.For people in exceptionally vulnerable positions — say, someone who just lost his job after failing a drug test and can’t find an available space at a substance abuse program in his area — adding another bureaucratic hurdle could make it even more difficult to get back on track.The red tape associated with work requirements also adds a new burden on the agencies that administer Medicaid benefits, Musumeci noted. Because of the added administrative costs, the waivers that states have filed to create work requirements generally don’t anticipate saving much money, even as they reduce the number of people in the program.In fact, similar work requirements for the federal nutrition program SNAP have proved so burdensome that states often prefer not to implement them just to avoid the hassle, according to a 2016 report from the Agriculture Department’s Office of the Inspector General. The report notes that implementing the work requirements “can be error prone,” resulting in some people being denied benefits they should get and others receiving benefits they’re not really eligible for.Ironically, the first waiver request the Trump administration is likely to approve is from Kentucky, a state that has benefited enormously from Medicaid coverage for people facing opioid addiction. The state has one of the highest rates of overdose deaths in the country, and its Medicaid spending on prescriptions for opioid use disorders jumped 326 percent from 2011 to 2016, to $64 million.Kentucky also anticipates the most drastic drop in Medicaid enrollment out of the 10 states with pending work requirement waivers, according to an analysis by the Commonwealth Fund. The state predicts that a full 15 percent of its Medicaid beneficiaries will lose their coverage within five years of the waiver’s implementation.Beyond the opioid crisis, the new policy also threatens a range of low-income people. About 60 percent of the Medicaid recipients whom the federal government considers to be able-bodied adults are already working, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But many are in the kind of unstable, low-wage jobs in which hours vary from week to week and sporadic layoffs are common. That leaves plenty of chances to fall through the cracks of a work requirement.Meanwhile, many of those who don’t work are going to school or caring for children or other family members, and many others are ill or disabled but haven’t been able to officially qualify for federal disability insurance. The new policy allows states to make exceptions to the work rules for caregivers and students, but it doesn’t require that they do so. It also states explicitly that states can’t get federal Medicaid money for services like childcare and transportation that people might need to get back to work.The stated purpose of the new guidance is to encourage work, which the Trump administration argues is ultimately good for people’s health. But Rosenbaum notes the absurdity of arguing that keeping people from health care will make them more likely to be able to work.“It places their insurance coverage at existential risk, despite the fact that there is no evidence that suggests that work requirements produce major changes in employment or income, and despite the fact that the health risks that these kinds of requirements potentially create vastly outweigh whatever gains are going to be achieved,” she said."

In a statement to HuffPost, company spokesman Jon Sullivan said, “These allegations are baseless and we will be filing to have them dismissed.”Among the lawsuits’ claims are that the Fortune 500 company misleads new hires, exploits workers by classifying them as independent contractors and pressures associates with sales goals that lead them to sell policies without customer consent.The Intercept article published Thursday is reportedly the first installment in a series that will detail the lawsuits and the employees’ claims. Thursday’s report zeroes in on claims of worker exploitation, painting a picture of a contractor workforce desperate for avenues to income.The company has a practice of recruiting sales associates for contractor positions with promises of unrealistic earnings that only a tiny fraction of new hires manage to make, according to allegations outlined in the report. The company then reportedly pushes sales associates to sell policies to friends and relatives, as well as to target them for recruiting ― which is among the ways contractors make money.Associates are allegedly responsible for paying for their own office space and materials, as well as covering travel expenses for mandatory trainings.“On a daily basis, hundreds of people are receiving phone calls and emails that make you think it’s a job,” Martin Conroy, a nine-year Aflac veteran and lead plaintiff in one of the lawsuits, told The Intercept. “Those who figure out the scam get out of it. Some people go into financial ruin.”The contractor economy has come under scrutiny in recent months as workers increasingly find themselves strapped in freelance and commission-based roles that don’t offer benefits or retirement funds. Uber, whose drivers are all considered contractors, paid two multimillion-dollar settlements in 2017 over complaints that it exploited workers. Aflac has previously come under fire for selling policies without of the consent of customers. In 2012, the company agreed to pay a combined penalty of $1.6 million for their operations in Idaho, Minnesota and Missouri, and to submit compliance reports for three years. The settlement came after regulators found Aflac agents were selling duplicate health coverage and other policies consumers didn’t authorize.Aflac has roughly 10,000 salaried employees and earns over $20 billion in annual revenue.Recently, the company touted an overhaul to its 401(k) retirement savings program following the passage of the tax overhaul bill pushed by President Donald Trump. Aflac announced it would increase matches from 50 percent to 100 percent on salaried employees’ contributions of up to 4 percent of their pay. The company also said it would put $500 in every full-time employee’s 401(k) plan. "

The House voted 256-164 to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, with 191 Republicans and 65 Democrats voting yes, and 119 Democrats and 45 Republicans voting no. After years of libertarians and privacy-minded Democrats pushing to change FISA, the House passed a six-year reauthorization with hardly any changes. Before the final vote, lawmakers rejected a substitute proposal, 183-233, from libertarian-minded Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) that would have added privacy protections and reauthorized FISA for four years. The amendment would have barred the federal government from knowingly collecting communications exclusively between Americans, and required the federal government to seek a warrant to search communications collected using FISA authority.The major point of contention involved Section 702 of FISA, which allows the government to spy on the electronic communications of non-U.S. citizens who they have a reasonable belief are outside the United States. Critics argue that the 702 program vacuums up the information of millions of U.S. citizens who communicate with those individuals, and that the U.S. government should not be allowed to specifically search for that U.S. person information or use it against Americans in court without a warrant.Trump added to the controversy Thursday morning when he speculated, via Twitter, that FISA was used as the authority to spy on the Trump campaign ― a claim that is misleading at best. (The FBI sought a FISA warrant to surveil a Trump aide, Carter Page, who was meeting with Russian officials.)Almost two hours later, another tweet was sent from Trump’s account, saying this vote was about “foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land.”“We need it! Get smart!” said the tweet, which was threaded to follow on from Trump’s earlier message ― something the president hasn’t shown a consistent ability to do.The mixed messages prompted House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to urge Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to pull the bill. Ryan, though, was apparently unconvinced, and decided to move ahead.That bet paid off with a strong vote for the FISA reauthorization, with lawmakers providing over 40 votes more than what was needed to pass the bill. GOP leaders had shown some concern over the past few weeks that the FISA measure would have some trouble, particularly because they were relying on some Democratic votes to get the bill over the finish line, but ultimately they had more than enough support.The bill will now go to the Senate, where it will likely face some debate. But privacy advocates had mostly believed the best chance of altering the legislation was in the House.“Today, the House of Representatives abandoned its responsibility to protect the Constitution and the privacy of Americans,” said Sean Vitka, policy counsel at Demand Progress, a progressive surveillance reform group.“We look forward to fighting this deeply flawed legislation in the Senate,” Vitka added."

On her talk show Thursday morning, the host became visibly upset recounting the series of natural disasters that have ravaged her hometown of late. After fires swept through large swaths of the state last month ― including Montecito ― the slides triggered by recent rainfall have killed at least 17 people in the area and injured 28. With several other people reported missing, the death toll may rise. DeGeneres said that she and wife Portia de Rossi were forced to evacuate their home this week, along with much of the rest of the tight-knit community of about 10,000 people. The couple previously had to evacuate during the fires.“This room is always so full of positivity and love and today I really need it. So many times over the past 15 years people have come up to me and say to me that when they’re going through a tough time this show helps them through it,” Ellen told her audience. “Today, I need you because there’s a lot going on in my life right now.”“They’re finding people and bodies and I mean, you hear the word mudslide and you have no idea the impact that it has, but after the largest fire in California history, it’s catastrophic,” she added. “It is beyond recognizable.”While DeGeneres works in Los Angeles, Montecito is her home, and she expressed pride over signs around the community thanking fire fighters and first responders. “I just love this place,” she said. “It’s not just a wealthy community, it’s filled with a lot of different types of people from all backgrounds. And there are families missing, there are people who are missing family members.”She then FaceTimed Winfrey from Montecito, who recently shared her video of the mudslide’s impact on her 65-acre estate in the area. “Everyone was saying to me, ‘How’s your property?’” the “Wrinkle in Time” star said from her estate. “I’m looking out the front window, I think everything’s fine, everything’s fine, and it wasn’t until I put my boots on and went outside walking and I realized everything wasn’t indeed fine.” “Where I am right now, which is, like, on the east side of my property, I was walking down here and ... all of my neighbors’ homes are ... gutted. All of the neighbors’ homes are gutted,” she said.“I’m standing right now ... still in a lot of mud but not as much mud as yesterday,” she continued. “I walked out back, you know, where we share a fence line and the neighbors out back, they’re houses are gone, just gone. It is as devastating as it can be,” During the phone call, Winfrey encountered firefighters from the nearby city of Ventura. “I am blessed and I am going to do whatever I can for the rest of the community,” she said. “We all just love the firefighters.”"

Bush and now the Trump administrations, the nation is increasingly at risk. In contrast, President Obama not only agreed with Panofsky, but he tried to embrace science through policy and action. Unfortunately, both of the recent Republican administrations have fostered anti-science and anti-intellectual attitudes and have taken actions against the scientific community that foreshadows real danger for the nation.Within only one year in office, President Trump, has stirred up the ever-present, but often latent, hostility in America toward science and our scholars and intellectuals. It took the Bush administration a few years to do this; Trump has managed to achieve that goal in one. The Bush administration curtailed embryonic stem cell research; created FBI oversight of work that used “select agents” (bacteria or viruses that can cause disease, but which are necessary for research if we are to find cures, treatments, and antidotes for these diseases); removed distinguished scientists from a bioethics panels when they questioned Bush’s ideological positions; silenced climate change scientists; and deleted facts related to reproductive health from the Center for Disease Control’s website related to HIV prevention. These are only a few policies of his administration that displayed a skepticism, if not hostility, to the idea of scientific truths.President Obama, trying to reverse these actions, sent a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies in 2008 making clear his commitment to the integrity of scientific results. “The public,” he said, “must be able to trust the science and scientific process informing public policy decisions. Political officials should not suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions” [Quoted in J.R. Cole, The Great American University, p. 428] In an address to the National Academy of Science, he said: “This work begins with an historic commitment to basic science and applied research, from the labs of renowned universities to the proving grounds of innovative companies.” [Source: ibid, p. 503]. Obama also appointed a stellar group of science advisors and invested in scientific infrastructure and scientific research as part of his economic stimulus package following the dramatic recession of 2007.Now we have returned to a darker time of uncertainty for science. President Trump seems to be mimicking actions taken during Bush years. As the legendary New York Yankee catcher, Yogi Berra, captured in his infinite wisdom: “It’s Déja vu all over again.” There is little evidence that President Trump and others in his administration or in the Republican controlled Congress, with exceptions like Tennessee’s Senator Lamar Alexander, have an interest in, knowledge about, or commitment to, science and technology. They are willing, fortunately to rebuff the president in proposing a significant increase in health related research at the NIH. The lack of understanding or interest in the role that scientific advances in fundamental knowledge and its applications make in the growth of our economy and the welfare of our people is reflected in recent observations by Rush Holt, a former member of Congress (now the chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science). He contrasted the Trump administration’s view that scientific research was essential for the future welfare of the nation (and his creation of the National Science Advisory Committee in 1951) Holt contrasts Truman and subsequent president’s commitment to science and technology with President Trump’s apparent “neglect, distrust and manipulation of evidence” and a hostility to matters of the intellect. The absence of a group of preeminent science advisors stand in sharp contrast to those appointed by presidents from Roosevelt to Obama. Richard Nixon was an exception. He terminated the Science Advisory Committee in 1973, but Congress passed legislation creating the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 1976. Evidence for Trump’s hostility can be found in a directive disclosed by The Washington Post that policy analysts working at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention have been told to stop using words such as “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based,” or “science-based” in their budget proposals for next year. [Source: Lena H. Sun and Juliet Eilperin, “CDC gets list of forbidden words…”The Washington Post, December 15, 2017]. The Department of Health and Human Services has removed information about LGBT Americans from its website, according to the Post reporters. These anti-science views are illustrated, as well, in the Trump administration’s rejection of a virtual consensus in the scientific community on the impact that humans are having on global climate change; in the initial proposal to cut the National Institutes of Health budget by roughly 20 percent – and its proposed cuts in the budgets of the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies’ supporting university research activities. It’s lack of understanding of how science is done in the United States can be found in the proposal to eliminate or cut still further the overhead costs associated with research projects that the government pays as part of research grants and contracts. Had these proposals gotten more traction in Congress, the results would have been both the elimination of a great deal of health and basic research at universities and the increase in tuition pricing that might be used to partially subsidize research. The Trump administration, as well as many members of Congress, apparently does not realize that conducting research at our finest universities loses money. A more effective and intelligent policy, initiated after World War II during the Truman administration, had the federal government cover the full audited cost of research. The subsequent battle over full-cost reimbursement was lost several decades ago, but to eliminate entirely payment for the cost of maintaining research facilities and other overhead costs, such as the cost of complying with federal regulations of research, is simply unwise policy. It would inevitably have highly negative consequences for the work that will produce discoveries that cure diseases and improve the health of our citizens. It would limit our efforts to build a stockpile of fundamental knowledge that down stream will help generate of new businesses and associated jobs. The outcomes of university research has an enormous economic and social impact – for every university initiated start-up company developing new pharmaceutical products or new sources of clean energy, as examples, the economy grows by the jobs created within the businesses themselves and then from the jobs created by the suppliers of those businesses. Economic impact studies in Boston and in the Bay Area of California, particularly in Silicon Valley, have shown that this impact reaches into the many billions of dollars. To cite just one example: the companies in Silicon Valley that were spawned from the work by faculty, students, and alums of Stanford University alone generated sales in 2010 of over $267 billion and had a total market capitalization of roughly $650 billion, which was almost half the sales and half the market capitalization of the top Silicon 150 companies. It is undoubtedly far higher today. These companies include, among others, giants such as Cisco Systems, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems. The same impact can be found at the Research Triangle in North Carolina and to a growing extent in the high technology industries being developed in New York. In short, investments in research have huge payoffs for the nation. Unlike the Obama and past administrations, President Trump has yet to nominate a science advisor – a position of some importance in prior administrations. There has been, to my knowledge, virtually no mention of a science policy from this administration and it’s unclear what voices the president will listen to when it comes to the national science and technology policy. After one year in office, no nominations have been made for key leadership positions at the government research funding agencies. Will the anti-science rhetoric yield to a more rational policy that supports in a tangible way the knowledge growth; will the administration let the scientific community, rather than politicians, determine the quality of the science produced, the priorities for investment in the future, and truth value of the work that discoveries made? That remains an open question, but if I were to advise the president, it is time for him to embrace the scientific efforts at our great research institutions, commit to their funding, and place people with impeccable scientific credentials in positions of leadership. Otherwise the support of science will wither away and become increasingly “political” science.Finally, great scientific efforts often take a long time to complete. Breakthroughs in efforts to cure diseases or raise agricultural production by using CRISPR technologies; brain research and neuroscience research; investigations into the causes and consequences of the inequality of income and wealth, take years and decades to complete. Indeed, some of these foci of scientific attention may require most of the 21st century to reveal nature’s laws and how we might determine the causes of disease and be able, in an ethical and morally acceptable way, to alter the human genome by using scientific knowledge in a way that saves millions of lives lost to cancer, sickle-cell anemia, HIV-Aids, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s, and various protein determined diseases.Disease and public health problems are not linked to party affiliations. There are a sufficient number of members of Congress who should support increased funding for research on both disease prevention and cures as well as the effort to enlarge the stockpile of knowledge that will eventually lead to new health and other discoveries that will propel our economy and improve our nation’s health. If the president won’t take the lead, Congress in a non-partisan way can take legislative action that forces President Trump either to embrace these pro-science efforts or to veto those pieces of legislation, which can then be over-ruled by Congress. It makes economic sense as well. As the great supporter of science, Mary Lasker once said: “If you think research is expensive, try disease!”If the road is long to find cures and treatments for disease, then the commitment must be vigilant. The scientific community, and the individual laboratories that educate new scientific talent and that initiate novel ways of approaching vexing scientific problems, requires a continuity of commitment of resources that cannot be dramatically altered from one administration to the next. There is no way to sustain these scientific efforts without some level of certainty about available resources. National health is not a partisan issue. Family members of Democrats and Republicans fall victims to cancer, heart disease, and various other life threatening illnesses – some caused by genetics; some by the environment; some of unknown origin. The two parties should enact a science policy that provides independence for scientific inquiry and freedom to take paths that differ from received wisdom. It should embrace the development of extremely promising new technologies, such as CRISP-Cas9. A sound policy must depend heavily on the advice of the scientific and university communities and the resulting funding, or investments, should be clearly prioritized by those with deep knowledge of science and technology. A long-term investment in science and technology is needed; it should grow; and its stability should be assured. Investments in scientific and technological research at our great universities should not be viewed as part of the discretionary budget, but as a good bet on continued American preeminence in our universities and in the science and technology that change our lives and those of people throughout the world."
75,POLITICS,White House Won’t Say If Trump’s Physical Will Include A Cognitive Impairment Test,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cognitive-impairment_us_5a5694d5e4b0a300f9059d34,Trump’s own Health Department says people his age should have the tests as part of their annual checkups to detect early signs of dementia.,2018-01-11,The White House is not saying if President Donald Trump's physical will include a cognitive evaluation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5695c92200004b00b4dc6e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s own administration recommends that those 65 and older get an annual “cognitive impairment” screening as part of their annual physicals.So will Trump’s physician follow that guidance Friday and check for early signs of dementia?The White House would not say.To Yale University psychiatry professor Bandy Lee, not evaluating Trump despite what she considers obvious signs of mental degeneration since he took office will endanger the country.“He is the commander in chief,” said Lee, who noted that she was speaking for herself and not for Yale. “Unfortunately, we’re seeing signs of impairment in the sitting president.”Lee is among 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts who wrote last year’s The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, which questioned the president’s mental fitness. The book did not receive nearly as much attention as Michael Wolff’s new Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which describes an ignorant but emotionally charged chief executive with deteriorating cognitive skills.Trump’s rambling, at times barely coherent remarks have been a feature of his persona going at least as far back as the start of his presidential campaign in June 2015. He has been impulsive, serially dishonest and quick to lash out at perceived slights going back decades further.But Lee said his worrisome behaviors have been getting more frequent and more severe since he took office. “It’s been markedly getting worse. All the signs have been getting worse,” she said.According to the National Institute on Aging, housed in Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services, older patients should have brief annual assessments for cognitive impairment as part of their well-care exams under Medicare. “Many people who are developing or have dementia do not receive a diagnosis. One study showed that physicians were unaware of cognitive impairment in more than 40 percent of their cognitively impaired patients,” the NIA website states.Lee pointed out that military commanders must take assessments to ensure they are mentally fit for those positions. She said that if it were up to her, she would insist on a much more comprehensive exam for Trump. “If I were his private psychiatrist, I would recommend a full neuropsychiatric evaluation.”Lee, of course, will play no role in Trump’s physical exam, which will be conducted by White House doctor Ronny Jackson at Walter Reed Military Medical Center on Friday. And while the White House would not respond to queries about a cognitive impairment assessment, spokesman Hogan Gidley had a one-word answer to whether Trump would get a psychiatric evaluation: “No.”His mental state notwithstanding, Trump is the most physically out-of-shape president since William Howard Taft a century ago. Every modern president since Ronald Reagan has had a workout regimen. Bill Clinton, despite a weight problem, could run at an 8-minute-mile pace. George W. Bush rode mountain bikes. Barack Obama spent each morning in the gym and played the occasional game of basketball.Trump does none of this, while favoring high-caloric food. His initial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, described a typical evening meal for Trump as two McDonald’s Big Macs, two fish sandwiches and a chocolate shake ― a total of 2,430 calories.It remains unclear what of Jackson’s exam will be released and when that might happen.The Obama White House released findings from his first physical upon taking office. It reported Obama was in good health, although he still was struggling to stop smoking. And his cholesterol count had crept upward. Eight years earlier, the George W. Bush White House put out his exam results, which found he was in the top 2 percent for cardiovascular fitness for men of his age.Americans’ only medical information about Trump comes from his longtime personal doctor, Harold Bornstein. In a single-page letter just weeks before the 2016 general election, Bornstien declared Trump to be in “excellent physical health” and provided data on his blood pressure, his cholesterol count and, oddly, his testosterone.The same doctor nine months earlier, in an even shorter letter, had noted Trump’s “astonishingly excellent” lab results and closed: “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”"

(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a57be80220000251ab4df7e.jpeg?cache=IfXQ7z63Jc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sarah N. LynchWASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - When the U.S. Justice Department said last week it was reversing policy on the $7 billion marijuana business, it failed to first notify federal officials who advise banks in states where the drug is legal, sources in Congress said.The announcement by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime critic of legalizing marijuana, caused confusion among banks about how to do business with marijuana growers, processors and distributors without running afoul of federal money laundering laws.The uncertainty unleashed a flood of phone calls to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an office within the U.S. Treasury Department, from congressional offices with questions from lawmakers and constituents.But FinCEN had no ready answers because it received no advance warning of Sessions’ Jan. 4 announcement rescinding an Obama-era policy that had eased up on federal enforcement of marijuana laws, said congressional aides who spoke on condition of anonymity.A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment about whether it had coordinated with FinCEN in advance.The abrupt announcement by Sessions was the latest example of sudden actions by the Trump administration that have blind-sided its own government agencies on major policy shifts. In 2017 the administration blindsided the Defense Department with a decision to ban transgender Americans from serving in the military. It also took many by surprise at the Department of Homeland Security by barring people from some predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.Marijuana is banned by federal law but it has become legal in one form or another in a number of states.About 400 banks and credit unions do business with the U.S. marijuana industry. Most are small institutions with operations limited to states where marijuana has been legalized.Critics said the Justice Department’s decision, which gives prosecutors wide latitude to pursue criminal charges, could drive banks out of the cannabis industry.Sessions issued his one-page announcement three days after California formally launched the world’s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana. Five other states have legalized recreational use, while dozens permit medicinal use.“I imagine that Sessions did not even contemplate that his action could trigger potentially billions of dollars of cash from being unbanked,” said Saphira Galoob, whose firm The Liaison Group lobbies on behalf of cannabis clients.Reversing the Obama administration, Sessions said the Justice Department was withdrawing legal guidelines known as the Cole and Ogden memos, widely seen as giving safe harbor against prosecution to cannabis businesses in states where pot is legal.The memos said that, while marijuana was still illegal, prosecutors would not prioritize pursuing criminal charges in states that had set up their own regulatory regimes.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in September that the marijuana policy was under review for possible changes.In last week’s announcement, the Justice Department made no mention of parallel marijuana guidance that FinCEN issued in February 2014 in coordination with Justice officials.The guidance provided a pathway for banks to serve marijuana businesses in states such as Oregon, Colorado, Washington and California. It relied heavily on the Cole memo.FinCEN requires banks to file suspicious activity reports with the government on legally questionable transactions. The FinCEN guidance says banks must continue to file those reports, but lets them say if they are confident that their cannabis customers are complying with relevant state laws.Democratic Representatives Dennis Heck of Washington state and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado are expected this week to send a letter, seen by Reuters, to FinCEN urging it not to rescind the guidance amid concerns that doing so could “inject uncertainty in the financial markets.”Stephen Hudak, a FinCEN spokesman, said in a statement that the agency’s guidance “remains in place,” despite the Justice Department’s actions.(Reporting by Sarah N.

You know that Carly Simon song, ‘You’re so vain, you probably think this song is about you’? He probably thought that Maria was about him.”“But it wasn’t about him, it wasn’t about politics; it was about saving lives,” she continued. “FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] was asking Puerto Ricans to go online and register for support. For heaven’s sake, we have no electricity. FEMA kept asking for memos, as if this were the first disaster that they had ever encountered. I finally lost my patience and stopped being politically correct. And I just shouted out an SOS to the world: ‘We’re dying here!’ That didn’t make me a lot of friends in the federal government, but that’s my duty.”In the weeks following the storm’s landfall in Puerto Rico, Cruz publicly asked FEMA to prioritize lives over bureaucracy. The decision to call out the Trump administration sparked a headline-grabbing Twitter feud with the president, who said she was “nasty” and that the people of Puerto Rico wanted “everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.”In October, the mayor told HuffPost she felt it was “unthinkable” the federal government could not bring enough supplies to meet the needs of hurricane survivors.“It may be easy to try to disregard us,” Cruz said. “It may be easy because we’re a U.S. territory and a colony of the United States. But we are people, dammit, and I don’t care what the political status is.”Cruz Soto also slammed Trump’s October visit to Puerto Rico, nearly two weeks after the hurricane made landfall. She criticized the president for tossing paper towels to storm survivors in need of supplies, after the storm left millions of Puerto Ricans without power and limited access to drinking water. During the visit, Trump also downplayed the island’s devastation during a press conference, saying it was not a “real catastrophe like Katrina” in reference to the death toll at the time, 16. Since then, the figure has quadrupled, amid reports from media outlets who’ve looked into the accuracy of the official death count and found that the number dead as a result of the storm is likely more than 1,000.Last week, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló announced the formation of a task force that would investigate the death count. Nearly 20 percent of the island of Puerto Rico is without power as of Thursday, according to government data. "

The teenager, who came to the United States without authorization as an unaccompanied minor, alleges in a complaint that she asked to go to a clinic to terminate her pregnancy using her own funds two weeks ago, and has not to be allowed to do so. It’s yet another example of the Trump administration’s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) refusing a girl in its custody access to abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the teenagers, argues the administration’s actions are a violation of the girls’ constitutional rights. The girls’ treatment is a result of policies by ORR Director Scott Lloyd that allow him or other officials to essentially veto immigrant teens’ abortions as long as the individuals are in government custody. Lloyd described abortion as “killing a human being” in an internal document revealed as part of the broader lawsuit against ORR, referring to a separate case of an immigrant teen seeking an abortion. That teenager was the victim of a rape, and was eventually allowed to terminate her pregnancy after court intervention.“The Trump administration is effectively banning abortion for these young women,” Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement on Thursday about the latest teen seeking an abortion, referred to as “Jane Moe.” “We’ve already stopped the government from forcing three other ‘Janes’ to continue pregnancies against their will, but clearly, their heartlessness knows no bounds,” Amiri said. “This administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court has held that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right.”ORR officials “have pushed Ms. Moe further into her pregnancy,” according to the complaint filed in court by the ACLU. “Without this Court’s immediate intervention, Defendants will continue to deny Ms. Moe the ability to access abortion, and ultimately will force her to carry to term against her will,” the complaint reads. The past three teenagers represented by the ACLU were eventually able to obtain abortions against the government’s wishes. In court, Trump administration officials have argued that they are not blocking teens’ access to abortion, because the individuals in question can agree to return to their native country ― potentially one that bars abortion or that they’ve left to seek asylum in the U.S. ― or be released to a sponsor, something the teens have no control over. Department of Health and Human Services officials did the same on Thursday when asked about “Jane Moe.”“The Jane in this case, Jane Moe ― who entered the country illegally ― has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or find a suitable sponsor,” a spokesman for the HHS’s Administration for Children and Families, which includes ORR, said in a statement. “If she chooses not to exercise these options, HHS does not believe we are required to facilitate Jane Moe’s abortion, out of concern and responsibility for the mother’s best interests,” the spokesman said. This article has been updated to include a comment from the Department of Health and Human Services."

In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the Olympic gold medalist wrote that USA Gymnastics is “100 percent responsible” for Nassar’s rampant sexual abuse, and called for an investigation into the organization.″@USAGym STOP VICTIM SHAMING,” Raisman wrote. “Your statements are hurtful. If you did not believe that I & others were abused than why pressure & manipulate us? WE WERE MOLESTED BY A MONSTER U ENABLED 2 THRIVE FOR DECADES. You are 100% responsible. It was mandatory to get ‘treatment’ by Nassar.” Raisman seems to be referring to USA Gymnastics’ most recent statement in which the organization responds to top-tier gymnast Maggie Nichols’ new allegations that Nassar sexually abused her while treating a back injury. In the statement, USA Gymnastics denied that the organization covered up Nassar’s abuse, and applauded Nichols for coming forward. But it says Nichols and a second athlete “did not provide reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred.”Raisman said USA Gymnastics should have done much more to protect athletes from the now-imprisoned serial predator. “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again,” she tweeted. ”... The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.” Raisman, along with Olympians Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, have alleged that Nassar abused them for years under the guise of treatment. ""‘Treatment sessions’ with him always made me feel tense and uncomfortable,” Raisman wrote in her book Fierce. “I would grit my teeth trying to convince myself that all this was part of the healing process. The truth was he never made my injuries feel any better, but I always obeyed because he had a reputation for being the best doctor.”All of Nassar’s victims claim that he abused them during routine medical exams; some say they were as young as 12 at the time.Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November and is awaiting sentencing. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for possessing child pornography. Sentencing on the sexual misconduct charges is scheduled for Jan. 16, when victims will be allowed to read impact statements. "

Her grieving family has launch a campaign to raise awareness of cyberbullying.Amy “Dolly” Everett, who at 8 years old was an Akubra model, took her own life last week. Her family said her death came after she was victimized by cyberbullies.A national anti-bullying campaign has been launched in the wake of Dolly’s death, and thousands have paid tribute on social media under the hashtags #doitfordolly. Her parents, Tick and Kate Everett, thanked the community for its response to their grief and asked for time to celebrate her life.“This is all we are capable of at the moment and ask for your respect to give us time to grieve,” the family said in a statement to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. “Our daughter Dolly was the kindest, caring, beautiful soul, and she was always caring for animals, small children, other children at boarding school who were less fortunate than herself.”In an earlier Facebook post, Tick Everett challenged Dolly’s harassers to come to her memorial service later this week “and witness the complete devastation you have created.”“If we can help other precious lives from being lost and the suffering of so many, then Doll’s life will not be wasted,” he said. Akubra said in a statement on Facebook that the company was shocked. When Dolly was 8, she was in Christmas advertisements for Australia’s unofficial national hat. “Dolly chose to end her life last week due to bullying. She was not even 15 years old,” the company said. “To think that anyone could feel so overwhelmed and that this was their only option is unfathomable. “Bullying of any type is unacceptable. It is up to us to stand up when we see any kind of bullying behaviour.” According to the National Centre Against Bullying, 1 in 5 Australian children reported being bullied in the past 12 months. The Australian Institute of Family Studies says about 10 percent to 20 percent of children and young people have been cyberbullied. In response to a post about Dolly, Australia’s internet safety commissioner, Julie Inam-Grant, said her office is committed to fighting online bullying. “This is a global fight and we need to figure out the best strategies to call out abuse and disrespect when we see it and encourage young people to report and seek help,” she said on Twitter. “They are not alone - there is a Global alliance of people that want to help support & empower.”If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
