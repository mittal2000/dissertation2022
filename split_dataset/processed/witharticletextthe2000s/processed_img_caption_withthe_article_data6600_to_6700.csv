0,ENTERTAINMENT,Fyre Festival Co-Founder Has History Of Failing His Customers,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/billy-mcfarland-fyre-festival-magnises-tickets_us_5907a43fe4b0bb2d08708ae6,"If you can't pick up concert tickets in person, you probably can't throw a multi-day music bash on a remote island.",2017-05-02,Billy McFarland's Fyre Festival was supposed to be a luxurious escape for wealthy millennials. It didn't turn out that way.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5907bdfb1400001f00a9ce96.jpeg?cache=czVGBzmlzy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Billy McFarland’s credit card and private club for millennials, Magnises, promised access to exclusive events, but some customers say they paid for tickets they never received. In one instance last year, that might be because McFarland simply failed to pick up tickets he bought.In 2016, McFarland, the 25-year-old behind the disastrous Fyre Festival, contacted a broker for tickets to a Radiohead concert at Madison Square Garden. The broker, who requested anonymity so as to not jeopardize his business, said he told McFarland that he’d need to pick the tickets up in person with an ID. (Brokers often require their customers to pick tickets up in person with an ID, to prevent fraud.)But when it came time to pick the tickets up, McFarland sent an associate in his place. The broker says he called McFarland and explained again that McFarland, not an employee, needed to up the tickets because they were purchased with a credit card that bore McFarland’s name. “He was so arrogant, I almost hung up on him,” the broker said.Eventually, McFarland agreed to pick up the tickets in person but never did, the broker said. A representative for the ticket broker waited for McFarland with the tickets on the street for 45 minutes, but he never showed.The broker summed up his experience with McFarland by saying, “He lied.” Magnises and a spokesman for McFarland did not return several requests for comment.McFarland’s failure in this instance to follow through and pick up tickets he’d purchased for his customers may help explain why the internet is littered with complaints from Magnises customers who bought tickets that the company never delivered. And of course, failing to deal with the logistics of picking up concert tickets does not bode well for one’s capacity to pull off something like throwing a music festival on a remote island. In an interview published Tuesday on Rolling Stone, McFarland admitted as much himself, saying he was a “little naive” thinking he could pull off the festival. He has promised that all vendors and Fyre Festival ticket holders will be refunded in full."

I Can't.",Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-budget-bill-acorn_us_5908d54de4b0bb2d08728757,Republicans are blocking funds for the long-shuttered ACORN again.,2017-05-02,Speaker Paul Ryan leads a House that copies and pastes budget language from year to year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5908d5f21700001f00dd6202.jpeg?cache=kDoZxDD9cZ&ops=crop_23_51_2977_1709%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― One morning in early March of 2013, I received a reporting tip for what I thought would be the single dumbest story I would ever write. When I answered the phone, the Capitol Hill staffer on the other end could barely contain his laughter. House Republicans had slipped detailed language into a must-pass government funding bill that would prevent federal cash from flowing to an anti-poverty group called ACORN.My source wasn’t a cold-hearted bureaucrat.The GOP had grown accustomed to demanding concessions from Democrats on critical legislation since winning control of the House in 2010. Some of these maneuvers ― including a failed attempt to repeal Obamacare ― carried serious policy implications. But this particular case of legislative hostage-taking came with a punchline: ACORN didn’t exist. The organization had disbanded nearly three years prior. Congress was about to do something thoroughly futile, for no reason.There was a certain aesthetic harmony between the emptiness of this looming legislative assault and the attack that caused ACORN’s demise. In 2009, conservative provocateur James O’Keefe had stitched together undercover footage that appeared to show ACORN staffers offering financial advice to a pimp who declared he was prostituting underage girls. Multiple government investigations would eventually clear ACORN of legal wrongdoing, and O’Keefe’s career would descend into a series of bizarre self-owns. But the damage to ACORN was done. Congress voted to cut off federal funding and the group closed its doors, humiliated.Years later, ACORN’s enemies were apparently still not satisfied. I called the GOP spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, who told me the anti-ACORN language was “a typical provision that is included in most appropriations bills.” This explanation, of course, only made everything weirder. Why would Congress routinely bar federal funding for an organization that doesn’t exist?The ultimate answer turned out to be that Congress was barely functional. And it remains all-but-broken today. Four years later, here I am, sitting at my desk, writing another story about a budget bill attacking funds for ACORN. It’s right there on page 1,060 of the latest government funding legislation:None of the funds made available under this or any other Act, or any prior Appropriations Act, may be provided to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, allied organizations, or successors.Since ACORN does not exist, it has no affiliates or subsidiaries. “Allied organizations” and “successors” are not legally defined terms. I know because I have written different versions of this story over and over and over again. Every time Congress unveils a new bill to fund the federal government, I do a quick search through the text for “ACORN,” and Congress rarely lets me down.Sometimes liberal publications or nerdy blogs boost the stories, but they always click well, because this tale is always so breathtakingly stupid. In August 2014, in a fit of foolishness, I declared the crusade against ACORN over because the language attacking funds for the nonexistent organization had disappeared from the budget bill. It reappeared in December of that year, prompting HuffPost’s publication of what I still believe to be the masterwork of this mini-genre, which we headlined “Tears of Sisyphus: Republicans Resurrect ACORN, Only To Murder It. Again.”Once upon a time, lawmakers determined the federal budget by debating policy priorities and holding hearings about what the appropriate funding levels for different programs ought to be. This would be a series of negotiations over final appropriations and, ultimately, a relatively reliable stream of funds would emerge for social services, scientific research and other federal programs.Congressional leaders abandoned that process some years ago, after a calamitous effort to extract ideological concessions tied to a bill to raise the debt ceiling nearly resulted in the U.S. government defaulting on the federal debt. In place of the old system, party leaders now copy and paste language from prior bills, seeking to avoid controversy, and hash out any disputes in private meetings. That’s how the ACORN phrasing makes it into law again and again. Somebody just pulls up whatever the old language was on Department of Health and Human Services funding, correctly assessing that whatever passed last time around won’t cause too much trouble today.I used to get a kick out of the ACORN story. Most of my writing for HuffPost involves financial regulation, international bribery or some other technical issue involving money and numbers with high stakes. ACORN was a nice break ― something fun, stupid and essentially harmless.But I can’t do it anymore. I’ve been writing about this foolishness for more than four years, and I’m not getting the same sense of joy or relief I used to get from seeing those five magic letters. The truth is that I’m starting to resent this beat, and I don’t want to remember it as something frustrating or annoying. I want to remember ACORN the way it deserves to be remembered. It’s not you, ACORN. It’s me."
2,MEDIA,The New York Times' Controversial New Columnist Nearly Joined Pulitzer Board,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bret-stephens-pulitzer-board_us_5908eb7ee4b05c397683aedd,"Bret Stephens was vetted for the board while at the Wall Street Journal, but couldn't serve after switching papers.",2017-05-02,Bret Stephens emerged as one of President Donald Trump's fiercest critics from the right while at the Wall Street Journal.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f12e422600003600c45c7e.png?cache=ZWmCmiW5Oj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shortly before Bret Stephens joined The New York Times last month, he had been expected to also join another prestigious institution: the Pulitzer Prize Board.Stephens’ admittance into the elite journalistic club wasn’t thwarted because of his controversial skepticism about the effects of climate change, according to sources familiar with the matter. He was prevented from coming aboard because of a rule that two employees of the same publication can’t serve at the same time.The board vetted Stephens while he was deputy editorial page editor at The Wall Street Journal and was prepared to add him to the group. But Stephens was no longer eligible to join after he switched papers because Times columnist Gail Collins is already on the board.Eugene Robinson, a Washington Post columnist and current board chair, confirmed that only one person from a publication can serve on the board at a time, but declined to comment further on the selection process.Pulitzer Prize administrator Mike Pride also declined to comment.Stephens presumably would have checked off several boxes for a prospective new member. A Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, Stephens would have filled the void left by another conservative writer from the Journal: Paul Gigot, the paper’s editorial page editor, recently wrapped up his last term on the board. Stephens’ profile had also recently risen after he emerged as one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest critics on the right.The board still needs to fill the vacancy with a new member. Pulitzer board members commit to at least three years, but can serve for up to nine.Such scrutiny only ramped up after Stephens’ first column Friday addressed uncertainty in politics or climate science. Some critics blasted the piece as “classic denialism” and “bullshit,” while more than a dozen climate scientists argued in an open letter Tuesday that the piece promoted “alternative facts.” The Times’ climate desk appeared to subtweet the new columnist, and some leading climate experts have canceled their Times subscriptions. Still, Times Editorial Page Editor James Bennet, who hired Stephens, has defended the columnist’s views as adding to a “vitally important debate” and said it is “totally unfair” to describe him as a “climate denialist.” Stephens himself identifies as “climate agnostic.”"
3,POLITICS,"America's Food Supply Is Potentially At Stake, Thanks To Trump",Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-food-safety_us_59024d29e4b05c39767d25b2,"Advocates are growing anxious while key federal agencies shun them, meeting with industry groups instead.",2017-05-02,"President Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order as business leaders stand in the Oval Office on Feb. 24, 2017. Food safety advocates are concerned about deregulation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5902529f2600003596c481e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Public health and consumer groups that often clash with the Food and Drug Administration say their relationship with the regulatory agency has markedly deteriorated since President Donald Trump took office. A group of organizations calling themselves the Make Food Safe Coalition had for the past eight years been meeting regularly — at least bimonthly, but often every month — with FDA representatives. Those meetings were paused after Trump’s inauguration, and coalition members said they’re unsure why.Thomas Gremillion, director of the Consumer Federation of America’s Food Policy Institute, said the mood at the group’s last meeting, in December, was typically friendly. Though there was some uncertainty in the air, there was no warning that the regular meetings would be disrupted.“It’s been a pretty collegial environment despite the substantive differences,” Gremillion told HuffPost. “We didn’t have any inkling that things were going to change, or that we might not have the same kind of access.”The group is now trying to schedule a June meeting with the FDA.Another coalition member expressed alarm that it’s taken so long to get on the FDA’s calendar. “I think it’s a real problem,” Pat Buck, executive director of the Center for Foodborne Illness, said. “We’re just at a point where we’re starting to say, ‘My goodness, guys, this has been a six-month delay now.’ A lot can happen in six months.”An FDA official said in a statement that the agency has maintained regular contact with coalition members. Scheduling, the statement said, always has been “dependent on requested topics to be addressed, and the collective availability of key agency leaders and subject matter experts who can address those topics.”Food-safety advocates aren’t totally buying that claim, noting that other Trump administration agencies also have been avoiding meetings with advocacy groups this year. “The longer this is delayed, the longer everybody sits holding their breath, wondering which direction they’re supposed to be going in here,” Buck said.As Politico reported last month, advocates have failed to reconvene their monthly meetings with the Agriculture Department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. In the meantime, both the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the FDA have reportedly been meeting with industry groups.Food-safety advocates said their shunning is particularly troubling in light of the Trump administration’s embrace of a deregulatory policy that appears to favor corporate interests over public health.In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at reducing the number of federal regulations by requiring the elimination of two rules for each new one. The following month, the president signed another order establishing “regulatory reform” officers and task forces within all federal agencies, tasked with identifying regulations they deem to be unnecessary or overly costly.Republicans in Congress also have advanced legislation that some food-safety advocates said is cause for alarm. In January, House Republicans, aided by just five Democrats, advanced the Regulatory Accountability Act that would further complicate new regulatory rule making. Groups including the Consumer Federation and Center for Science in the Public Interest have labeled the measure the “filthy food act,” and said it would establish “an unprecedented regulatory gauntlet” that few new food-safety rules or guidance could surmount.Jim O’Hara, director of health promotion policy at Center for Science in the Public Interest, told HuffPost the bill “would significantly undermine” the nation’s food supply by hampering federal agencies’ abilities to respond rapidly to food-safety threats.“The legislation puts in place more hurdles for agencies to jump over in order to put in place food-safety protections,” O’Hara said. “And it also gives industry all sorts of ways to interfere with agencies putting those protections in place.”Other food safety experts said they aren’t as concerned.David Acheson, who worked in food safety roles at both the USDA and FDA during the administrations of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama prior to founding his own consulting firm, dismissed the “filthy food act” criticisms as “more politically motivated than based in reality.” He said he’s seen little evidence so far of Trump administration antipathy to food safety. “Is there a new [food safety] regulation sitting in the wings that we’re waiting on? I don’t know that we are,” Acheson told HuffPost. “Let’s keep the hyperbole out of this and wait and see.”Acheson also pointed out that Trump’s budget proposal maintained funding for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service while pushing for dramatic cuts elsewhere in the department. The sweeping Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law by Obama in 2011, has only been partially implemented, Acheson said, so there remain lots of new food safety protections yet to go into effect. That process could be telling about the Trump administration, he said.Some industry groups said they’re increasingly anxious that key FDA roles needed to implement the act remain unfilled. Jim Gorny, vice president of food safety and technology at the Produce Marketing Association, an international trade group representing fresh produce businesses, admitted that some members of his group are getting “a little nervous” as they await guidance on the new rules.“We’re in kind of an awkward pause here, and the clock continues to click,” Gorny said.Still, Gorny said the delay “doesn’t surprise me.” “We just hope it comes to fruition quickly so we can get clear direction going forward,” he said.Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Trump’s pick to lead the FDA, has yet to be confirmed by the full Senate. During his confirmation hearing in April, Gottlieb commented that Food Safety Modernization Act marked a “significant advance” for food safety that he would implement in “a proper way” that “strikes the right balance.”Those words did little to ease anxieties. Some advocates said they fear possible cutbacks at the FDA as well as at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that could weaken a government response to an outbreak.“It’s great to say you support something, but the real test will come in the action,” O’Hara said. “It’s very unclear if [this administration] actually understands food safety. If there’s a tragedy, they’ll learn about food safety really quickly.”Trump signaled during his campaign that food safety could be at risk under his presidency. His campaign website briefly advocated “eliminating” “the FDA food police” and claimed inspectors were over-regulating food facilities. The “fact sheet” was later removed from the website and replaced with a one that did not mention the proposal.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

Bresha, 15, is charged with aggravated murder in the death of her father, Jonathan Meadows. She has been incarcerated since her arrest on July 28, 2016, over nine months ago. She was transferred to a mental health facility in February for an evaluation, but was returned to jail a little over 30 days later. Her lawyer, Ian Friedman, maintains that Bresha acted in self-defense after witnessing her father abuse her mother, Brandi Meadows, for years. The mother has described her late husband as very controlling and violent and said he punched, strangled and stabbed her. Several people close to the family told HuffPost previously that they believe Bresha’s father may have sexually abused the teen, allegations that her lawyer declined to confirm or deny.Bresha’s trial date is set for May 22. She has pleaded “not true,” which is equivalent to a not-guilty plea. She is being tried as a juvenile, which means that even if she is convicted, she can only be kept behind bars until age 21. A national campaign in support of Bresha has spread on social media, with advocates organizing under the hashtag #FreeBresha. A petition calling on prosecutors to drop charges against the teen and release her immediately has garnered over 28,000 signatures. It argues that she needs “a safe and supportive environment to heal and rebuild,” not years of incarceration. Bresha is not receiving adequate medical and mental health care at the Trumbull County Juvenile Detention Center in Warren, Ohio, her lawyer charged in a motion filed in April. Without proper care, she cannot appropriately participate in her own defense, he wrote. “We are asking for her release so that she can get the health care that she needs,” Friedman told HuffPost on Monday. “It is critical that all clients be in a place mentally that they can best assist their attorneys in their own defense. We feel that she is not getting what she needs at the jail. So we need to ask the court to consider alternatives that would be in her best interest.”Friedman expects to argue the motion in front of Trumbull County Juvenile Court Judge Pamela Rintala on Wednesday morning. He will ask for Bresha to be released into the custody of her maternal aunt, Martina Latessa, who is a Cleveland police officer. A number of mental health experts are expected to testify on her behalf at that time.The home of Bresha’s aunt was identified as the best place for the teen because of its location, an hour away from Warren, where the alleged murder took place. Latessa said she spent the weekend buying a twin bed and turning her spare room into a bedroom. “For both of us, it will be an adjustment,” she told HuffPost on Monday. Even though Latessa has been a fierce advocate for Bresha since the moment the girl was arrested, the two have spent very little time together in real life.Latessa last saw Bresha in March, while the teen was at the mental health facility, which allowed visits from extended family. Her aunt said Bresha seemed happy: She had a window, was allowed to go outside and take walks, and could eat meals with her family. At the jail, where she returned over a month ago, she is allowed visits only from her mother and her grandparents. Latessa said Bresha is looking forward to the hearing. “She wants to get out,” Latessa said. “She knows that if she gets out, she will be coming to my house.”______"

But the “threat” turned out to be a student using a glue gun for an art project.The campus lockdown occurred after reports that someone had “entered the O’Connor Campus Center while carrying what witnesses believed was a weapon,” said a statement from university spokesman Daniel DeVries.The precautions on the campus of the private liberal arts college took place on the same day that an attacker armed with a hunting knife stabbed four people, killing one, on the Austin campus of the University of Texas. Police arrested a student over the attack.But some Colgate students expressed concerns about suspected overreactions to the incident on their campus because the student with the glue gun is African-American.As police scoured buildings at Colgate, a university of 2,900 undergraduates located in Hamilton about 40 miles from Syracuse, students said rumors spread that there were two gunmen, and one had committed suicide — none of which was true.Shortly after early reports about sightings concerning a weapon at Colgate around 8 p.m., university administrators tweeted, “There is an armed person at the Coop. Find a safe space and remain indoors. If you are off-campus, stay away.” The Coop is a dining hall on campus.During the lockdown, students in campus dorms were advised to keep their lights off to avoid attracting attention, a student told The Huffpost. The college finally lifted the shelter-in-place order shortly before midnight.“After thorough investigation, and with the assistance of the person in question, law enforcement identified the individual as a student who was using a glue gun for an art project, confirmed the misunderstanding, and released the campus from lockdown,” said a Colgate statement.“We understand that this has been a very upsetting evening on many levels. Students who wish to gather at the chapel to be together can do so tonight at 12:30 a.m.”Some students expressed concerns on social media about the reaction to the student with the hot glue gun, and worried about what could have happened to him because of his race, particularly as rumors mounted.Student Tolu Emokpae posted a comment on Facebook calling the lockdown “one large reaction to a report based purely off racial profiling.”Miranda Robles posted, “I am glad things did not turn out to be as bad as we thought. However, this is extremely problematic and absurd. Why make such a big claim for there to be no proof? Could have gotten the student in serious trouble.”The university did not identify the student, but Huffpost saw a video of him speaking on a cell phone ― apparently to someone investigating the situation ― explaining how he was holding a glue gun.University President Brian Casey called for a thorough investigation into the incident:Emergency situation resolved"

The award ― previously handed out to the likes of LeBron James, Jahlil Okafor, Jabari Parker and Maya Moore ― recognizes them for their outstanding character, leadership and the values as student-athletes in the community. Carter, who is committed to Duke, and Westbrook, a Tennessee signee, recently caught up with HuffPost to discuss the prestigious McDonald’s game, as well their emphasis on academia and how the love of all things basketball extends far beyond the game.The recruiting process can be relentless. What was the hardest part about it for you? Wendell Carter Jr.: Saying no to some of the great schools. Harvard, Georgia, Georgia Tech and Duke were all great schools and unfortunately, I can only go to one of the schools, so saying no was probably the hardest part.Did you enjoy your recruitment?Evina Westbrook: Oh, I definitely had the most enjoyment in my recruitment. I think me and my parents handled it very well and it was really in our control. We didn’t let it overwhelm us or anything like that. We were in control at all times and we managed when I would talk to coaches on the phone and when they would talk to coaches on the phone. How did you manage the high demand, especially with the barrage of phone calls from coaches? EW: I would just let them know, “Hey coach, I’m busy right now but is there a time where I can call you tomorrow or maybe in the next couple of days?” So when I was busy or I was hanging out with my family or had to do homework ― anything like that ― I definitely let them know that I’m not forgetting about them. I’m just busy at the moment just like any other teenager. You just have to really communicate.What drew you to Tennessee aside from the wonderful hoops tradition? EW: I think when I was on my visit, that was just a place where I felt most at home. I’ve always wanted to go away from home ― I’ve known that since I was younger, and my parents have known that. I feel like I’m going to be safe and surrounded by people who have my best interests. Duke is a highly respected university, aside from all its basketball prowess. What attracted you to the school?WC: Like you said, it had a great measure of both academics and athletics. I’m not saying that Harvard was not a great athletic school and I’m not taking away from any other colleges ― it just seemed like Duke was the perfect mix of both. And the town is nice and small, not too busy, and also still a college town where I think I can have a little bit of fun.How did you inform other coaches that you would be attending Duke? WC: I kind of let them find out after my commitment video because it was kind of hard to call them over the phone. If I could, I would rather talk to them face to face and tell them, but I wasn’t able to do that.Your family recently hosted Coach K in your home as part of a recruiting visit. What was that like? WC: It felt great. Being able to talk to him, listen to all the knowledge he was able to give to me at the moment. It just felt amazing, him and all the assistant coaches just sitting in the same dining room that I sit in every day — it felt amazing.What did you enjoy about the relentless AAU circuit? WC: You get more of a chance to prove yourself to the college coaches who are at these games. Every game was a great game, every team had great players on the team so there were never any blowouts or anything like that. It gave you an opportunity to show coaches that you’re an actual hooper and you know what it means to play basketball.What role did academics play during such a strenuous hoops schedule?WC: Growing up, my parents told me that if I didn’t maintain an A in all of my classes I wasn’t allowed to play basketball in my church league or go out and play basketball. So it kind of was engrained in my brain if I don’t keep good grades in the classroom I was not going to be able to play basketball. I eventually started liking school and actually going to class. I mean, it took me a while to actually like it, I’d wake myself up in the morning to go to school and it kind of took off on its own.EW: My main thing was that if I didn’t get good grades, I couldn’t play. So if I wanted to keep playing or keep working out or keep going to the gym after school, my grades had to be all As and Bs. So for me, there was really no other way.Did you grow up watching both the men’s and women’s game?EW: Yes, both. It’s just something that I’ve had dreams of being a part of and it’s amazing to say that I can be a part of something like this.Basketball IQ is a term we hear describing you. When did you develop it?EW: I started playing in fourth grade, but I always played with boys so I think that had a lot to do with it. I never really started playing with girls until the eighth grade. Just playing with my guys where I worked out at and really just putting in the time and just wanting to get better is something I loved. Did playing with guys help you increase the physical element and your overall approach to basketball?EW: I mean yeah, a little bit. Guys are obviously a little more physical and they’re bigger and stronger than a lot of girls. The hits didn’t really affect me that much ― the game is a little bit different. It’s really helped me now.What type of advice have you received from NBA players?WC: I’ve been able to talk to Chris Paul. I’ve talked to Blake Griffin once, I’ve talked to Jabari Parker once. I was able to talk to Jahlil Okafor and that’s about it. How do you balance basketball with living a regular teenage life?WC: I kind of make time for it. Just like I made time for basketball, I made time for my friends and family, I kind of let it work itself out. I don’t try to strain myself in the gym, I believe that God has a plan for me and he’ll tell me how long I’ll have to be in the gym, when I need to be with my family and friends and that’s kind of how I approach it. I think I can call myself a people person.What level of importance do you put on being coachable and a good teammate?WC: Yeah, that was one thing I’ve always wanted to work on. Growing up I’ve been known as the kid with the bad temper ― getting mad at refs and my teammates and things like that. And I just got tired of hearing that so I found a way to fix myself where I’m more coachable. Enjoying the game, and enjoying the moment, that’s really about it. NBA players stress the summer as the time to add to their games. What part of your game will you attack this summer? WC: My endurance and stamina is definitely one thing I want to improve, where I’m able to play in the game longer and still be able to play as hard as I did from tip-off. I also want to work on my ball-handling skills and my confidence ― like if time is running down and we need a big shot, I can be able to do it and still be calm and collected and still make the right moves to get the ball off.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

On April 27, San Francisco-based Holberton School ― a higher education program that uses project-based learning to train engineers ― announced that the singer-songwriter has joined its board of trustees and mentors. Ne-Yo and a team of investors raised $2.3 million for the school. Ne-Yo said in the press release that he admires the school for its decision to provide opportunities for underrepresented students in tech.“Everybody knows that tech and all these things are the wave of the future,” he said. “I just love the fact of what they’re doing with the school — that they’re making it easier for underrepresented people in the world of tech. They’re giving them a platform and access to this knowledge that they probably wouldn’t get otherwise. I think that’s one of the coolest things about this whole situation.”The computer science and software engineering school plans to expand their program from accepting 30 students to more than 100 a year, and will use its funds to attract underrepresented students. Currently, the school’s student body is 40% women and nearly 50% people of color.“This is not, ‘oh, let me attach my name to something.’ This is something that I’m genuinely passionate about,” Ne-Yo said. “You know, diversifying the tech world. Tech is changing the world by the second so it makes sense to get the people that live in the world to be part of this thing that’s changing it, as opposed to just this one group of people.”Major props to Ne-Yo!"

ICE Detained Him On His 18th Birthday.,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teenager-immigration-asylum-shelter-ice-detained_us_590772dfe4b05c39768113a5,"Immigration experts fear Erik Javier Flores Hernandez's detainment heralds a new wave of ""cruel"" and ""baseless"" deportation policy under Trump.",2017-05-01,"Erik Javier Flores Hernandez, who fled Mexico after drug traffickers killed his mother, was sent to an adult detention center in Orange County, California, on his 18th birthday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5907b8681400002000a9ce79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A teenager seeking asylum from “severe child abuse” is currently being held in an adult detention center in Southern California after U.S. immigration agents shackled and arrested him in a youth shelter on his 18th birthday.Erik Javier Flores Hernandez fled northern Mexico in late 2016 to escape his abusive father, as well as drug traffickers who abducted and killed his mother and grandmother, according to the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, an advocacy group providing Flores with legal representation.The IDLC said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detained the teen on Saturday despite their client’s compliance with guidelines that would likely have allowed for his release from the Office of Refugee Resettlement custody at 18 under the Obama administration. Flores is currently being held at the Theo Lacy Facility in Orange County.Some immigration advocates fear his detainment is a precursor to more “cruel” and “shameful” immigration tactics toward children and teens under President Donald Trump’s administration.“There’s nothing about this arrest that serves any rational policy in the United States government. Period,” said David Leopold, an immigration lawyer. “It’s cruel, baseless, mean-spirited, ugly ― it’s just wrong.”After crossing into the U.S. in December, Flores was immediately apprehended by U.S. officials, designated as an unaccompanied minor, and sent to a federally run youth shelter in Los Angeles. The IDLC appointed Flores an attorney in January and began the process of applying for his asylum.Flores’ chances of securing asylum status seem strong, said IDLC executive director Lindsay Toczylowski. He has no criminal record and earned glowing behavior testimonials from shelter staff, who have described him as respectful and soft-spoken. Both his aunt and another community member offered to take him in, another factor that would likely have helped garner his release under the last administration.Toczylowski said her group briefed ICE agents last week about Flores’ good standing, but agency officials told IDLC that Flores would nonetheless be detained when he turned 18 and transferred to an adult detention facility.“Prior to this, if we had all of those things in place, unless there was some reason to believe that the child was a threat to the community or they were a flight risk, ICE would always release them on their own recognizance,” Toczylowski said. It’s unclear why ICE didn’t release Flores, though the agency said in a statement that he could not “appropriately remain” in the children’s shelter:Individuals being housed in centers operated by the Department of Health and Human Services that are designed to hold unaccompanied alien children may not appropriately remain in those facilities once they reach age 18, as Mr. Flores now has. Accordingly, he was transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody Saturday and will be moved to a facility used to house immigration detainees who are 18 and older. ICE is currently reviewing the circumstances of Mr. Flores’ case to determine appropriate next steps. At this time, his immigration proceedings are ongoing before the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review.Toczylowski claimed ICE had other options besides hauling Flores off to an adult detention center, where conditions are similar to a prison and strikingly different from the “group home” setting he was used to at the shelter.She said officials could have allowed Flores to live with relatives or transfer to an adult shelter instead, as they’ve done with other cases in the past.“We just think this is emblematic of what they’ll be doing across the country in these cases under this new policy,” she added. “And it’s really tragic because it means these kids will be traumatized a second time when we should be welcoming them as asylum seekers and ensuring they have the services that they need.”In February, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly issued a memo to immigration officials instructing them on how to implement Trump’s executive order on immigration from January.The memo instructs ICE agents to ignore Obama’s memos on immigration priorities that targeted only recent arrivals and convicted criminal migrants for deportation. Instead, ICE agents are allowed to use wide discretion in deciding who to deport, and to consider anyone who is in the U.S. illegally to be subject to deportation.“[Kelly] has the audacity to publicly state to the media that they’re going after ‘bad hombres,’” Leopold said. “He either doesn’t know what’s going on or he’s lying to the American public ― or both.”Toczylowski argued that Flores’ detention is not only egregious from a moral standpoint, but in terms of government efficiency as well. She said releasing Flores would have minimal costs, maybe a few dollars a day. Instead, the government will spend an estimated $164 a day to detain him, according to Human Rights First.“What we’re hoping is that if the public is aware of what’s happening ― and also of the inefficiencies of what’s happening ― that there will be pressure on the Trump administration to rethink whether or not detaining asylum seekers ... is something that they will continue to do,” said Toczylowski.The IDLC plans to seek a bond hearing to get Flores released, but that could take weeks. Flores will likely remain in adult detention until at least May 8, when a judge is scheduled to consider his asylum application, Toczylowski said. “The American people are not going to take this kind of stuff lying down,” Leopold said. “We have been shocked over and over again by the brazen cruelty of this administration toward immigrants. Enough is enough.”Read more details about Flores’ detainment below in a Facebook post from Lisa Okamoto, the IDLC’s managing attorney."

The IDLC appointed Flores an attorney in January and began the process of applying for his asylum.Flores’ chances of securing asylum status seem strong, said IDLC executive director Lindsay Toczylowski. He has no criminal record and earned glowing behavior testimonials from shelter staff, who have described him as respectful and soft-spoken. Both his aunt and another community member offered to take him in, another factor that would likely have helped garner his release under the last administration.Toczylowski said her group briefed ICE agents last week about Flores’ good standing, but agency officials told IDLC that Flores would nonetheless be detained when he turned 18 and transferred to an adult detention facility.“Prior to this, if we had all of those things in place, unless there was some reason to believe that the child was a threat to the community or they were a flight risk, ICE would always release them on their own recognizance,” Toczylowski said. It’s unclear why ICE didn’t release Flores, though the agency said in a statement that he could not “appropriately remain” in the children’s shelter:Individuals being housed in centers operated by the Department of Health and Human Services that are designed to hold unaccompanied alien children may not appropriately remain in those facilities once they reach age 18, as Mr. Flores now has. Accordingly, he was transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody Saturday and will be moved to a facility used to house immigration detainees who are 18 and older. ICE is currently reviewing the circumstances of Mr. Flores’ case to determine appropriate next steps. At this time, his immigration proceedings are ongoing before the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review.Toczylowski claimed ICE had other options besides hauling Flores off to an adult detention center, where conditions are similar to a prison and strikingly different from the “group home” setting he was used to at the shelter.She said officials could have allowed Flores to live with relatives or transfer to an adult shelter instead, as they’ve done with other cases in the past.“We just think this is emblematic of what they’ll be doing across the country in these cases under this new policy,” she added. “And it’s really tragic because it means these kids will be traumatized a second time when we should be welcoming them as asylum seekers and ensuring they have the services that they need.”In February, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly issued a memo to immigration officials instructing them on how to implement Trump’s executive order on immigration from January.The memo instructs ICE agents to ignore Obama’s memos on immigration priorities that targeted only recent arrivals and convicted criminal migrants for deportation. Instead, ICE agents are allowed to use wide discretion in deciding who to deport, and to consider anyone who is in the U.S. illegally to be subject to deportation.“[Kelly] has the audacity to publicly state to the media that they’re going after ‘bad hombres,’” Leopold said. “He either doesn’t know what’s going on or he’s lying to the American public ― or both.”Toczylowski argued that Flores’ detention is not only egregious from a moral standpoint, but in terms of government efficiency as well. She said releasing Flores would have minimal costs, maybe a few dollars a day. Instead, the government will spend an estimated $164 a day to detain him, according to Human Rights First.“What we’re hoping is that if the public is aware of what’s happening ― and also of the inefficiencies of what’s happening ― that there will be pressure on the Trump administration to rethink whether or not detaining asylum seekers ... is something that they will continue to do,” said Toczylowski.The IDLC plans to seek a bond hearing to get Flores released, but that could take weeks. Flores will likely remain in adult detention until at least May 8, when a judge is scheduled to consider his asylum application, Toczylowski said. “The American people are not going to take this kind of stuff lying down,” Leopold said. “We have been shocked over and over again by the brazen cruelty of this administration toward immigrants. Enough is enough.”Read more details about Flores’ detainment below in a Facebook post from Lisa Okamoto, the IDLC’s managing attorney."

Greg Abbott agrees to veto a measure punishing ""sanctuary"" cities.",2017-05-01,"Immigrant rights rights activists and faith leaders stage a sit in at the offices of the Texas governor on May 1, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590775fd1c00003a00e829a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― Roughly 20 people were detained and served with misdemeanor trespassing tickets Monday after refusing to leave offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott unless he agreed to veto a Republican-backed effort to crack down on “sanctuary” jurisdictions. The protest, led by immigrant rights activists, faith leaders and at least one elected official, aimed to force a public confrontation with the GOP governor, who is likely to disregard the pressure and eventually sign Senate Bill 4 into law.Opponents say the bill will lead to increased deportations, undermine trust between police and immigrant communities, and put Hispanics at risk for racial profiling. Dozens of activists gathered Monday morning in front of the south gates of the Texas Capitol, before marching down the street to the beat of a drum, chanting, “No SB4!” When the throng of protesters arrived at the State Insurance Building, where several of the governor’s offices are located, they walked up the stairs. Several sat in the lobby, vowing not to move.“We don’t have rights,” activist Carmen Zubieta yelled in Spanish through a bullhorn. “And then they make a business out of putting us in jail,” she added ― a reference to the fact that roughly two-thirds of immigrant detention center beds are run as for-profit enterprises by private prison contractors.Norma Herrera, another of the those who refused to move from the lobby, said she arrived in the United States from Mexico when she was 3 years old, and has since thought of herself as a Texan. She told the crowd she’d worked for the Texas legislature for three years, but with the passage of SB4 felt betrayed.Herrera was among more than 100 religious leaders, immigrants, and law enforcement officials who registered opposition to the bill during committee hearings, without budging the legislature’s Republican majority.“I considered myself an important part of that building,” Herrera said of the Texas capitol. “But now I see that, depending on the political climate, they can just police you out. … The process failed us.”The group continued to chant and sing songs, including, “No Nos Moverán,” before splitting into two, with each of them blocking one of the main entrances to the building. “This entrance is closed! This entrance is closed!” they chanted, when people tried to enter or exit the building.The protesters stayed for the rest of the business day, chanting, singing and holding a teach-in with legal experts who explained the implications of the law. The state Democratic Party chairman visited the group in the afternoon, describing the bill as a “racist” attack on Texas Hispanics and immigrant communities. The party had pizza delivered to the protesters, who didn’t budge until the building closed at 5 p.m.By then, a May Day protest that began at City Hall had convened outside, with demonstrators shouting support for those occupying the governor’s office. The confrontation grew increasingly tense. Police told protesters they would be arrested if they refused to leave, and escorted reporters outside. Roughly 20 activists remained seated in the lobby, repeatedly singing, “With hope, with prayer, we find ourselves here. With hope, and prayer, we’re right here,” for nearly a half hour. Magistrate Judge Nick Chu entered the building as protesters were handcuffed with zip ties and served with trespassing citations. Authorities released them after issuing the tickets, saving them the spectacle of escorting the protesters in cuffs to the city jail in front of the crowds outside. The baseline definition of a “sanctuary” jurisdiction is one that declines to reflexively honor requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees who would otherwise be allowed to leave in local jails ― either because they weren’t charged with a crime, or they qualified for release on bond. By that standard, the only sanctuary jurisdiction in the state is Travis County, where Austin is located. Austin City Councilman Greg Casar, who was among those charged, likened the Texas immigration crackdown bill to Arizona’s contentious SB 1070 ― a 2010 measure derided by opponents at the “show me your papers law.” Texas state government should expect litigation, he said.“We won’t be coerced,” Casar told HuffPost. “Even if [Gov. Abbott] threatens us with criminalization, even if he threatens to remove us from office, we can’t betray our communities.”George Lobb, a lawyer for Casar, said the protesters were exercising their rights to free speech and would take the trespassing charges to trial. He accused authorities of keeping him from seeing his clients and said Chu urged them to sign the citations without a lawyer present.“When I woke up with this morning, the Constitution was still good law,” Lobb told Huffpost. Texas Republicans have tried to pass some version of a “sanctuary city” ban for several years, but were unable to field enough votes in the state Senate. The bill finally made it through this year, after easing long-standing Senate rules that required a two-third vote in order to bring any bill for debate before the high chamber. "
21,POLITICS,Chris Christie Accuses Democrats Of Trying To 'Poison Our Kids' By Legalizing Marijuana,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-marijuana_us_5907b427e4b0bb2d0870a41d,"The New Jersey governor called legalization efforts  ""beyond stupidity.""",2017-05-01,New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie claims marijuana is a gateway to drugs like heroin.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5907b7f71c00003a00e82ae8.jpeg?cache=PmEk19YCEL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a vocal critic of marijuana legalization, accused Democrats of attempting to “poison our kids” in pursuit of tax dollars from recreational cannabis sales.Speaking at a conference on substance abuse hosted by the New Jersey Hospital Association on Monday, the Republican governor criticized an effort by state lawmakers to regulate and tax recreational cannabis similarly to alcohol, as states like Colorado and Washington have done. Despite growing support across the nation for legalization, Christie remains firmly opposed to the idea, claiming pot is a gateway drug to substances like heroin. (Research does not support that claim.)In his remarks, Christie cited a recent report that found marijuana legalization could raise $300 million annually in taxes for New Jersey. “This is the part that liberals love the most: We can tax it,” he said, according to Politico. “Sweet Jesus, we can tax it! More money for us!”“I can say this now because I’m not running for anything again: $300 million is nothing,” Christie continued. “We have a $35.5 billion budget; $300 million is a rounding error. I’m sorry. It’s true. Think about it, that’s 1 percent, less than 1 percent, of the entire state budget for a year. And we’re going to poison our kids for 1 percent more money that they can spend on some God awful, stupid program that they can put in the mailer and send out and say, ‘I delivered $300 million more for this.’”He specifically called out three Democrats: state Sen. Nick Scutari, the author of the recreational pot bill, state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and gubernatorial candidate Phil Murphy. Sweeney and Murphy support legalization.“If people like Nick Scutari and Steve Sweeney and Phil Murphy want to bring this poison into the state under the guise that it doesn’t matter because people can buy it illegally anyway, then why not legalize heroin?” Christie asked, according to NJ.com. Christie also called legalization efforts “baloney” and “beyond stupidity.” Christie has opposed such efforts throughout his tenure as governor, which ends in January. He’s blocked bills to expand the state’s medical marijuana program, which became law before he took office. Last year, he described tax revenue from legal marijuana as “blood money.” And while running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2015, he vowed to crack down on marijuana-legalization programs in states if elected president.“Marijuana is against the law in the states, and it should be enforced in all 50 states,” he said at the time.The governor has also spoken at length about drug addiction, and in March was tapped to lead President Donald Trump’s commission on the opioid crisis."
22,HEALTHY LIVING,Deportation Fears Are Putting A Damper On Diverse Medical Research,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deportation-fears-medical-research_us_5902307ce4b0026db1df7589,But one organization is dedicated to keeping Latinos in the clinic.,2017-05-01,"Valentina Hernandez (back row, second from right) with staff from Mountain Park Health Center, the Mayo Clinic and Sangre Por Salud, a blood biobank that aims to include more Latino patients in medical research.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5902a2a61c00002600e8227d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Medical research subjects skew white and male, meaning that the most effective treatments are designed for and tested on white men. Doctors prescribe these standard treatments to female, black and Latino patients, but they are doing so without patient-based evidence they’ll be effective. One prime example: In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved Addyi, a drug designed for women with low libido, based on a study of 23 men and 2 women, meaning researchers couldn’t definitely say whether it was safe for women to drink alcohol while taking Addyi. Enter the Sangre Por Salud biobank, a collaboration between Mountain Park Health Center and the Mayo Clinic in Arizona. Sangre Por Salud collects blood samples from Latino patients at Mountain Park who consent to donate, so that future studies (and the precision medicine that results from them), will include Latinos ― who, like black and female patients, are underrepresented in medical research. Valentina Hernandez is the director of integrated nutrition services at Mountain Park, which is essentially a one-stop shop for primary care services ― including pediatric and women’s health care, labs, a pharmacy and health education classes ― in the Phoenix area. Hernandez, who also oversees Sangre Por Salud’s operations, talked with HuffPost about some of the biggest challenges she faces when recruiting Latino patients to donate to the biobank. HuffPost: Who is eligible to donate blood to Sangre Por Salud? Do you have to be a U.S. citizen to participate? Any patient who self-identifies as Latino or Latina can be included in the biobank. We enroll patients that come into the clinic. We don’t ask them their immigration status. They go to see their doctor, we approach them and we invite them to participate in research. We explain what it is, what we’re doing and why, and if they want to participate, then they come in and give a blood sample that is stored for future research. Why focus specifically on the Latino population? It’s the fastest-growing demographic in the U.S., and there’s a huge need for more research for this community, because their health factors are different than other communities that have been researched.That’s why it’s so important that we include them in research, to understand their health status and what treatment they are going to respond to or not respond to. A lot of them might struggle with a condition like diabetes, or they have family that does. They see it as a way of helping research advance so that their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, might not have to struggle with it as much. It’s very altruistic. If you talk to our participants, they really want to help future generations. They completely understand the value of what it is they are doing. What are some of the barriers to enrolling Latinos in the Sangre Por Salud biobank?There are a few barriers that we see all of the time, for any type of initiative that we do at Mountain Park, like transportation and time away from work.In research, what we have seen is that there’s more fear of sharing their personal information. And every time that we have different immigration climate change and there’s a different initiative out there to try to scare or identify people who might be undocumented, we see a decline in participation.We talk a lot about the undocumented participants, but we’ve seen that fear [among] participants that might be here legally or might even be citizens, because their families are mixed. That’s a huge barrier. You might have status or be a citizen, but if your wife, your husband, your niece, someone who is with you is not, your fear is equal to theirs. The risk you’re taking can impact them.PresidentDonald Trump has waged an intense deportation campaign during his first months in office. Is it harder to recruit patients now that Trump is president?It’s been a little more difficult to recruit patients. In the past, in order to meet our weekly goal, we had to approach 60 patients a week. Now we have to approach between 70 and 75 patients to get to our goal.Since the beginning of this year, our participants are saying they’re more afraid. They don’t want to share their information or leave their homes. We’ve seen more fear. Just driving a car across town might put them in a situation where they might be pulled over or asked their immigration status. They don’t want to risk going to the grocery store. The fear of being out in public and being in the wrong place at the wrong time is scary. What do you tell potential biobank participants who are worried about participating? Mountain Park Health Center has been in the community for more than 30 years. That is our strongest currency, the trust our patients have in us.Sangre Por Salud has also obtained a certificate of confidentiality that protects the researcher and the study from being forced to disclose identifying information. It’s a federal protection. We explain that to all of our participants. And if the patient says, “You know I’m really afraid to leave my house. I don’t want to drive my car,” we say, “We’ll send you a cab.”What could happen to the Sangre Por Salud project if gets increasingly difficult to recruit Latino participants? The strength of the research is in the number of participants you have. If you have a biobank of 5,000 patients versus a biobank of 3,000 patients, your 5,000-patient biobank is going to be a lot more valuable.We want it to be valuable, so we want to meet our goals. Otherwise it might not be as attractive for researchers to want to study that group. We’re about 10 percent behind where we should be. How do you feel about the next four years and beyond? Are you hopeful about the biobank’s future? I’m going to remain hopeful as long as I can. It’s important work and the entire nation is going to benefit from it.In Arizona, the immigration climate can change from week to week. There have been immigration sweeps in the city of Phoenix or in Maricopa County, and during those times we see a decrease in participation.I’ve been with Mountain Park for about 15 years. We’ve weathered a lot. Joe Arpaio. S.B. 1070. In Arizona, it’s a cycle. This is no different. We’re just going to keep moving forward.

Circuit in Washington declined a request to rehear the dispute filed by the same coalition of telecommunications companies that challenged the 2015 rules in court — among them AT&T, CenturyLink and Verizon, which is the parent company of HuffPost.In a separate opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Sri Srinivasan explained that the court wouldn’t reconsider the rules, since Pai had already stated he intended to rescind them and make them into something “markedly different.”The full court “could find itself examining, and pronouncing on, the validity of a rule that the agency had already slated for replacement,” Srinivasan wrote.Srinivasan was part of the same appeals panel that upheld the net neutrality rules as a valid regulatory exercise under existing federal law and the First Amendment. As he did last year, he cautioned that the court’s role was not to comment on the “hotly debated” issue of net neutrality.“We have no involvement in that ongoing debate,” Srinivasan wrote. “Our task is not to assess the advisability of the rule as a matter of policy. It is instead to assess the permissibility of the rule as a matter of law.”But U.S. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has been floated as a potential Supreme Court nominee in the event of a new vacancy under President Donald Trump, wrote in a dissent that the net neutrality rules are “unlawful” because Congress has never clearly delegated such broad authority to the FCC to regulate internet service providers.“Under our system of separation of powers, an agency may act only pursuant to statutory authority and may not exceed that authority,” wrote Kavanaugh, who would have reheard the case and voted to vacate the rules. “For major rules, moreover, the agency must have clear congressional authorization.”A second conservative judge, U.S. Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown, also wrote at length to lament that net neutrality is a grand choice that the FCC made in the face of congressional inaction.The FCC chairman, who might agree with Kavanaugh and Brown’s view of the internet rules, faces a tough road ahead to undo them — in part because of how much support they have received from the public."

Sheth, who is transgender, can currently be seen in William Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night,” which is being performed at various venues in all five New York City boroughs as part of the Public Theater’s Mobile Unit. In the beloved comedy of mistaken identity, the 35-year-old plays Maria, servant to the wealthy countess, Olivia (Ceci Fernandez), who falls in love with Viola (Danaya Esperanza), disguised as a man. She says the production, which opened April 27, is everything she’s “hoped and dreamed for,” particularly since she’s getting the chance to inhabit a role traditionally played by cisgender women.“When the opportunity came up to do this, I was absolutely terrified. I’ve never done Shakespeare before,” Sheth told HuffPost. Now that performances are underway, however, she said she feels “very, very blessed to be able to do this show for so many people and see the way that different people and communities react to it.”“Twelfth Night” marks Sheth’s second Public Theater stint. In 2016, she starred in the acclaimed bluegrass musical, “Southern Comfort,” about a group of transgender friends who gather to support a dying trans man (played by Annette O’Toole). Between “Twelfth Night” and “Southern Comfort,” Sheth is now finding steadier work as an actress. When she began her transition in 2008, however, it was a much different story.“Back then, ‘Transparent’ and ‘Orange is the New Black’ – these big shows that are trans-inclusive – did not exist,” Sheth said. Convinced she wouldn’t get cast as a trans actress, the Pune, India native relocated from New York to California and began pursing a career in social work instead. “I felt like there was no space for me,” she said.Sheth’s thespian dreams wouldn’t be cast aside for too long, however. In 2011, a friend connected her with the producers of NBC’s “Outsourced,” who offered her a guest spot. Though the role of Kami Sutra lasted only two episodes, it turned out to be turning point for Sheth. “I thought, ‘Well, if I’m able to land a spot on an NBC sitcom, then I should not limit myself because of who I am,’” she recalled. “Having that opportunity pop up proved me wrong. I was able to go back to where I was meant to be.”Though Sheth is generally pleased with how her career has progressed, she admitted there have been setbacks. The recent push to cast transgender actors in trans roles on stage and screen has helped land her auditions, she said. Still, a number of casting agents have told Sheth that she “doesn’t look transgender enough,” a comment she calls “ridiculous.” Then there’s the roles themselves, many of which promote “ancient, stigmatized and fetishized views” of both Asian Americans and the trans community, she said.“My gender identity, as well as my race, has been a hindrance sometimes,” she said. “It’s been easier to get my foot in the door, but there’s still this misconception that we all look a certain way, or that we’re all one way.”After “Twelfth Night” wraps May 14, Sheth would like to turn her attention back to the musical stage, possibly in a role that has yet to be written. Though she cites Broadway icons Patti LuPone and Audra McDonald as influences, she’d ultimately like to “forge her own path” as an artist.Given that openly trans performers are still an anomaly, Sheth said she does feel a responsibility to portray her community in a positive light. She won’t shy away from addressing politics in her work, either. “Like everybody else, we are human, and have our own thoughts and feelings about the things that are happening in the world,” she told HuffPost. “I feel lucky that, as an artist, there are ways for me to express what I’m feeling about the world through my art.”Sheth doesn’t see her recent successes as much as a reflection of increased trans visibility as much as a testament to her perseverance as a performer. “If you keep reaching for what it is that you want, eventually you’re going to get there,” she said. “Eventually you’re going to show people that you deserve to be there as much as anyone else, regardless of what your gender identity is.”The New York Public Theater’s production of Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” runs through May 14.

26,QUEER VOICES,How This Trans Actress Was Happily Proven Wrong About Show Business,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aneesh-sheth-twelfth-night_us_5903b736e4b0bb2d086e9ad4,"Aneesh Sheth is ""very blessed"" to have found her voice on the New York stage.",2017-05-01,"“When the opportunity came up to do this, I was absolutely terrified. I’ve never done Shakespeare before,” Sheth said of ""Twelfth Night,"" which opened April 27. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59074d741400002000a9cc5b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In order for Aneesh Sheth to find her voice as an actress, she had to walk away from show business first. Sheth, who is transgender, can currently be seen in William Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night,” which is being performed at various venues in all five New York City boroughs as part of the Public Theater’s Mobile Unit. In the beloved comedy of mistaken identity, the 35-year-old plays Maria, servant to the wealthy countess, Olivia (Ceci Fernandez), who falls in love with Viola (Danaya Esperanza), disguised as a man. She says the production, which opened April 27, is everything she’s “hoped and dreamed for,” particularly since she’s getting the chance to inhabit a role traditionally played by cisgender women.“When the opportunity came up to do this, I was absolutely terrified. I’ve never done Shakespeare before,” Sheth told HuffPost. Now that performances are underway, however, she said she feels “very, very blessed to be able to do this show for so many people and see the way that different people and communities react to it.”“Twelfth Night” marks Sheth’s second Public Theater stint. In 2016, she starred in the acclaimed bluegrass musical, “Southern Comfort,” about a group of transgender friends who gather to support a dying trans man (played by Annette O’Toole). Between “Twelfth Night” and “Southern Comfort,” Sheth is now finding steadier work as an actress. When she began her transition in 2008, however, it was a much different story.“Back then, ‘Transparent’ and ‘Orange is the New Black’ – these big shows that are trans-inclusive – did not exist,” Sheth said. Convinced she wouldn’t get cast as a trans actress, the Pune, India native relocated from New York to California and began pursing a career in social work instead. “I felt like there was no space for me,” she said.Sheth’s thespian dreams wouldn’t be cast aside for too long, however.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590736d01c00002600e82888.jpeg?cache=secp68qvI2&ops=crop_1483_114_1295_1415%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"That didn’t take long. A $100 million proposed class-action lawsuit was filed Sunday in California against the organizers of the now infamous Fyre Festival on the grounds of fraud, claiming a “lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees — suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions ― that was closer to ‘The Hunger Games’ or ‘Lord of the Flies’ than Coachella,” ABC News reported.The lawsuit was filed by concertgoer Daniel Jung and his attorney, Mark Geragos, who says the whole debacle “was nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam from the very beginning” and that they “intended to fleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water — and without regard to what might happen to them after that.” The festival, organized by entrepreneur Billy McFarland and Ja Rule, was promoted (with the help of supermodels like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid) as a luxury music experience on a “remote and private” island in the Bahamas with the promise of posh accommodations and adventure for a cost between $5,000 and $250,000.Alas, when attendees arrived, they realized the reality of #DumpsterFyre was a stark contrast from the advertisements. The suit, which expects more than 150 plaintiffs, claims attendees “were hamstrung by their reliance upon Defendants for transportation, as well as by the fact that Defendants promoted the festival as a ‘cashless’ event —Defendants instructed attendees to upload funds to a wristband for use at the festival rather than bringing any cash. As such, Attendees were unable to purchase basic transportation on local taxis or buses, which accept only cash. As a result … at least one attendee suffered a medical emergency and lost consciousness after being locked inside a nearby building with other concert-goers waiting to be airlifted from the island,” according to an excerpt from Variety. Defendants are accused of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs are seeking damages in excess of $100 million. McFarland, the 25-year-old Fyre co-founder who has landed in hot water before with his other business ventures, wrote a piece for Rolling Stone saying that the organizers were “overwhelmed.” He promised to refund customers and offer a make-up event next year.“We thought we were making timeframes that were correct,” he wrote. “We were a little naïve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves. Next year, we will definitely start earlier. The reality is, we weren’t experienced enough to keep up.”Geragos was not immediately available for further comment.Read the full filing below. "

Reed, and journalist Eric 'Rico' Reed pose for a portrait at the premiere of National Geographic's 'LA 92' After Party on April 27, </em>2017<em> in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images)</em>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59077f051400001f00a9cd39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before Ferguson and before Baltimore, there was a moment in American history that riveted the nation. The gruesome and horrific beating of motorist Rodney King sent shockwaves through the veins of Americans who were able to see police brutality without filters and in transparent living color. As if it was some sort of competitive sport of who could physically assault the negro more, L.A. cops took turns striking King like an animal over and over and over. In a premeditated sigh of relief, many African-Americans believed that finally police would be held accountable for their racist assault towards Black people ―especially because their violent assault was caught on tape. No one was prepared for the aftermath. Not even a clear videotape could convict cops for something as visible as the brutality they committed. Like the combination of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, the aftermath resulted in the explosion of the city of L.A. via protests that were bound to happen sooner or later.Now, after 25 years, National Geographic Documentary Films presents ‘LA 92’, a riveting look back at the controversial Rodney King trial and subsequent protests, violence, and looting of the city. Viewed from a multitude of vantage points through visceral and rarely seen archival footage, the film brings a fresh perspective to a pivotal moment that reverberates to this day. Produced by Lightbox’s two-time Academy Award winner Simon Chinn (”Man on Wire”) and Emmy winner Jonathan Chinn (”American High”) with Academy Award-winning directors Dan Lindsay and TJ Martin (”Undefeated”), and featuring original music from Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans (”OA,” “Enemy”), LA 92 premieres at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival on Friday, April 21. “Race relations is America’s Achilles’ heel,” said Lightbox producers Jonathan Chinn and Simon Chinn. “The production of this film might mark the 25th anniversary of this seminal uprising, but these kinds of events still recur, and we are still dealing with their root causes. Our goal with ‘LA 92’ is to reframe the story of this tragedy for a modern audience, and we hope it will encourage reflection and debate as we wrestle with these very real conflicts that continue to plague America’s cities.”Following the premiere at Tribeca, the film completed a multicity screening tour including Baltimore; Charlotte; St. Louis; Washington, D.C.; and Atlanta. Additionally, a limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles begins Friday, April 28, and ‘LA 92’ makes its television broadcast debut on National Geographic on Sunday, April 30, at 9/8c and will also air globally in 171 countries and 45 languages. Furthering the national conversation, National Geographic has also partnered with Picture Motion to provide free screenings of the film to colleges and universities nationwide and has developed a robust, free discussion guide to accompany the film. For more information, visit natgeotvpressroom.com.Using no narration or talking head interviews, the filmmakers decided to take a bold approach: to reconstruct the tumultuous events that unfolded in 1992 by exclusively using archival footage and photographs. Culling thousands of hours of visceral broadcast news footage, radio reports, police files and personal home videos ― some of which have never been broadcast ― the filmmakers tell the story through a variety of different points of view and perspectives and set it all to a rich orchestral score composed by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans.“We come from a cinema verite background and as such, we are always striving to find ways to let the footage speak for itself,” said Martin and Lindsay, who also edited the film. “Our intent was to fully immerse viewers in a raw and unfiltered experience in order to challenge their understanding of the civil unrest, both emotionally and intellectually.”The filmmakers sourced an intricate network of citizen journalists with boots on the ground during the civil disturbance to bring authenticity to the film. The film features never-before-seen and rarely used footage from the Los Angeles First AME Church, which supported many victims of the violence; materials from the Los Angeles police and fire departments; and video from contemporaneous news broadcasts from L.A.-based Korean-language television stations. ‘LA 92’ takes viewers out of the prism of their own cultural, racial and political perspectives and allows them to see the events of 1992 in a new light. The film captures the shock, disappointment, and fury felt by many Angelenos, particularly those in the African-American community, following the outcomes of two back-to-back, highly publicized trials. In November 1991, a Korean convenience store owner who was convicted of fatally shooting African-American teenager Latasha Harlins was given no jail time by a white Los Angeles judge. Six months later, four police officers caught on videotape brutally beating unarmed black motorist Rodney King were acquitted of assault by a predominantly white Simi Valley jury. The King verdict sparked a wave of violent protests, looting and arson that lasted several days and left more than 50 people dead, thousands injured and large swaths of Los Angeles ― including many Korean-American-owned businesses ― in ruins. In the case of the King beating, it was the first time the kind of abuse many had witnessed or experienced at the hands of LAPD officers was recorded and broadcast for the world to see, leaving some with the sense that if justice did not prevail despite such graphic evidence, it never would.Tune in tonight at 9/8C on National Geographic."

Less than 24 hours before Aaron Hernandez “hung it up,” an all too common and casual turn of phrase in prison parlance, a group of prisoner-rights advocates held a rally at the Massachusetts State House. Their concerns were nothing new. The prison suicide rate in Massachusetts is nearly double the national average, and advocates pointed to apparent retaliation against prisoners who tried to stand up for the human rights of themselves and others. Yesterday’s protesters, who told the Boston Globe that Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker’s office had ignored their request for a meeting to discuss these issues for an entire year, are not alone in their frustration. I had two open letters, see here and here, forwarded to the governor’s office as well as to Massachusetts Attorney General, Maura Healy, Chair of the State Board of Registration in Medicine, Dr. Candace Sloane, and Acting Director of the U.S. Marshals, David Harlow, in the past two months, warning them about the Commonwealth’s unacceptably punitive approach towards mental health in its prisons, and I was ignored as well. Since my arrival at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF) in Plymouth, Massachusetts in February, there have been five suicide attempts here, and at least one was successful, coming near days after my first open letter. The family of now-deceased 26-year-old U.S. Marshals detainee William Lufkin feel that officials at PCCF are not fully answering their questions regarding the death of their beloved family member. Within 24 hours of his arrival, Billy, as he is known to friends, died in the isolation unit here and neither PCCF nor the U.S. Marshals, who choose to contract with this facility despite its troubling record, have been forthcoming. Another one of the attempted suicides occurred when 24-year-old disabled war veteran Joshua L. Daniels was placed in segregation despite his PTSD diagnosis and record of past suicide attempts at that very isolation unit. The callous brutality and negligence is simply astounding, and one wonders how the U.S. Marshals, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, State Department of Corrections, and MASAC can all contract here knowing the body count. I hope that the families of others who have died here or have been irreparably harmed will come forward and be counted. Maybe then something positive will come out of the publicity surrounding the preventable death of Aaron Hernandez. Anyone who wishes may contact my wife and I at our Facebook page, FreeMartyG. Here is the text of my most recent open letter, which was delivered on March 20th of this year: Dear Acting Director of the U.S. Marshals Service David Harlow, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Massachusetts Attorney General Healy, and Chair of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine Candace Lapidus Sloane, M.D.:I wrote to you last month reporting human rights violations here at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF,) overseen by Sheriff Joseph D. McDonald Jr. I left it to you to answer my concerns ""not by mere words, but my your much louder actions and/or inaction.""Unfortunately, I received no response and it is now my sad duty to relay news of five subsequent suicide attempts and at least one death at this institution. First, federal arrestee William Lufkin, whose friends and family called him Billy, hung himself in the isolation unit. He died the day after the US Marshals dropped him off, a mere five days after my last open letter. He was 26. Curiously, and concerning too, his death seems not to have been reported by either PCCF or federal authorities left over from the previous administration. Around the same time, in the same unit, disabled Afghanistan war veteran Joshua L. Daniels also tried to ""hang it up."" Due to what I can only describe as callous negligence and/or reckless disregard for both human life as well as Joshua's sacred service to our country, the 24-year-old father of two was placed in segregation despite his PTSD diagnosis and previous suicide attempt in this very same facility. As the dangers and human rights concerns surrounding solitary confinement of the mentally ill are well-recognized, and further it is widely known that many of our warriors return home bearing wounds that don't show on the surface, this tragically predictable result shouldn't have surprised any of the state-licensed mental health staff here. Though he survived, Joshua is by no means out of the woods. He has now been moved to the infamous Bridgewater State Mental Institution, where it seems a foregone conclusion that his record of service and desperate need for help are being met with apathy and disrespect for our obligations to our veterans. Without the actual care heroes like Mr. Daniels deserve from our state, I fear he will eventually succeed in ending his own life. I hope by now I have made it obvious that I expect much better from my native Massachusetts, our leaders, and our licensed mental health professionals. Given that Justina Pelletier was maimed and many other children have already been hurt by unwanted and unneeded psychological care forced on them by our state, it would be a tragic irony for Joshua to die having been deprived by our commonwealth of the psychological help that could save his life. We owe those that choose to serve our nation only the best, and when they have trouble readjusting to civilian life due to battlefield trauma they deserve appropriate treatment and most certainly not to slip through the cracks in our justice system. I'm disturbed by the number of veterans I've encountered here. Joshua is one of three combat rescue personnel I've had the honor of meeting since my arrival on February 4th, and there are many others with different specialties. Why aren't we ensuring they all get the help they need instead of felony convictions that mark them for life? Does their service really mean so little to us and our elected officials here in Massachusetts? Additionally, our veterans are not alone here at Plymouth County Correctional Facility. While I was working to draft this letter, another individual, a Mr. DeS, slit his wrist under his bed covers no more than 35 feet away from me. Thankfully, he was discovered before he lost too much blood and was alive when staff wheeled him out. I am unsure of the identities in the other two recent suicide attempts. From my experience, it is readily apparent the main problem is the unjustifiably punitive approach taken for mental health here. As you may recall, my previous letter detailed ""Q5,"" a form of torture that masquerades as an emergency mental health intervention at PCCF. People who ask for physiological care are placed in approximately 40 degree Fahrenheit ""Q5"" solitary cells. Most have a bare tile floor and one features a hole in the ground victims must use to defecate instead of a toilet. People are locked in these cells alone, naked or nearly naked, and usually with neither a mattress nor blanket. The temperatures are so cold that skin turns purple, inmates can see their breath, and people find themselves literally frozen to the floor. While a minority of the survivors I've met were put in ""Q5"" after seeking mental health assistance, the majority of them do not suffer from mental illness. Instead, they report being put there as a form of extrajudicial punishment by dishonest guards. Specifically regarding ""Q5,"" one staff member rhetorically asked a group of us ""you think we don't make up stories?"" Having now encountered sadistic and belligerent staff like D. Fernandez and P. Donnelly, it is crystal clear to me that such horrible human rights abuses run rampant and unchallenged by the doctors and upper management here. I even saw medical staff threatened the elderly man who first applied pressure to stop Mr. DeS’ bleeding with “Q5” because he flashed his prisoner ID too quickly. Indeed, about one third of the inmates I interview have been ""Q5'ed,"" and some have been there a dozen times or more. I recently mailed ten complaints on behalf of eight different survivors to the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, which has already informed me it has decided to abdicate it's duties, as it did in the Pelletier case, rather than investigate. This dereliction is disastrous for all the inmates here, but especially for those who, like Mr. Daniels, need psychiatric treatment and belong in therapy instead of prison. As it stands, when they seek such assistance they instead find themselves forced into isolation in ""Q5"" for 24+ hours before they are asked if they still need help. They are held there until they answer ""no."" Under such circumstances, it isn't hard to conclude why people don't come forward, and it shouldn't be surprising there are a lot of suicides here. I believe “Q5” and similar practices across Massachusetts are the primary cause of our state's extraordinarily high prison suicide rate — about twice the national average. Let me reiterate now -- there is no way I would ever seek help here. So, I am once again left to ask questions of the utmost urgency. How many families must lose a son, grandson, nephew, father, or grandfather to this place and these abhorrent practices before action is taken? I hope none. Are the Massachusetts Board of Registration and Medicine and Department of Mental Health mere rubber stamps? I hope not. How much time will go by before the governor’s office and attorney general address these human rights violations and their tragic consequences? I hope not long.

He has now been moved to the infamous Bridgewater State Mental Institution, where it seems a foregone conclusion that his record of service and desperate need for help are being met with apathy and disrespect for our obligations to our veterans. Without the actual care heroes like Mr. Daniels deserve from our state, I fear he will eventually succeed in ending his own life. I hope by now I have made it obvious that I expect much better from my native Massachusetts, our leaders, and our licensed mental health professionals. Given that Justina Pelletier was maimed and many other children have already been hurt by unwanted and unneeded psychological care forced on them by our state, it would be a tragic irony for Joshua to die having been deprived by our commonwealth of the psychological help that could save his life. We owe those that choose to serve our nation only the best, and when they have trouble readjusting to civilian life due to battlefield trauma they deserve appropriate treatment and most certainly not to slip through the cracks in our justice system. I'm disturbed by the number of veterans I've encountered here. Joshua is one of three combat rescue personnel I've had the honor of meeting since my arrival on February 4th, and there are many others with different specialties. Why aren't we ensuring they all get the help they need instead of felony convictions that mark them for life? Does their service really mean so little to us and our elected officials here in Massachusetts? Additionally, our veterans are not alone here at Plymouth County Correctional Facility. While I was working to draft this letter, another individual, a Mr. DeS, slit his wrist under his bed covers no more than 35 feet away from me. Thankfully, he was discovered before he lost too much blood and was alive when staff wheeled him out. I am unsure of the identities in the other two recent suicide attempts. From my experience, it is readily apparent the main problem is the unjustifiably punitive approach taken for mental health here. As you may recall, my previous letter detailed ""Q5,"" a form of torture that masquerades as an emergency mental health intervention at PCCF. People who ask for physiological care are placed in approximately 40 degree Fahrenheit ""Q5"" solitary cells. Most have a bare tile floor and one features a hole in the ground victims must use to defecate instead of a toilet. People are locked in these cells alone, naked or nearly naked, and usually with neither a mattress nor blanket. The temperatures are so cold that skin turns purple, inmates can see their breath, and people find themselves literally frozen to the floor. While a minority of the survivors I've met were put in ""Q5"" after seeking mental health assistance, the majority of them do not suffer from mental illness. Instead, they report being put there as a form of extrajudicial punishment by dishonest guards. Specifically regarding ""Q5,"" one staff member rhetorically asked a group of us ""you think we don't make up stories?"" Having now encountered sadistic and belligerent staff like D. Fernandez and P. Donnelly, it is crystal clear to me that such horrible human rights abuses run rampant and unchallenged by the doctors and upper management here. I even saw medical staff threatened the elderly man who first applied pressure to stop Mr. DeS’ bleeding with “Q5” because he flashed his prisoner ID too quickly. Indeed, about one third of the inmates I interview have been ""Q5'ed,"" and some have been there a dozen times or more. I recently mailed ten complaints on behalf of eight different survivors to the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, which has already informed me it has decided to abdicate it's duties, as it did in the Pelletier case, rather than investigate. This dereliction is disastrous for all the inmates here, but especially for those who, like Mr. Daniels, need psychiatric treatment and belong in therapy instead of prison. As it stands, when they seek such assistance they instead find themselves forced into isolation in ""Q5"" for 24+ hours before they are asked if they still need help. They are held there until they answer ""no."" Under such circumstances, it isn't hard to conclude why people don't come forward, and it shouldn't be surprising there are a lot of suicides here. I believe “Q5” and similar practices across Massachusetts are the primary cause of our state's extraordinarily high prison suicide rate — about twice the national average. Let me reiterate now -- there is no way I would ever seek help here. So, I am once again left to ask questions of the utmost urgency. How many families must lose a son, grandson, nephew, father, or grandfather to this place and these abhorrent practices before action is taken? I hope none. Are the Massachusetts Board of Registration and Medicine and Department of Mental Health mere rubber stamps? I hope not. How much time will go by before the governor’s office and attorney general address these human rights violations and their tragic consequences? I hope not long.

Like even though the waves are calm right this second I can’t relax because any second now—whether I relax my vigilance or not—a new wave will crash over me and pull me under – Jennifer, mother of 10-year-old with autism and anxietyParenting is demanding and overwhelming under the best of circumstances. But parenting a child who has behavioral health needs such as Autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, feels like you are drowning, all of the time, relentlessly.We are hyper-aware, constantly on edge.This is perhaps the biggest weight that threatens to pull us under. We must be on the lookout for the next trigger, the next possibly explosive situation, the next unexpected change in schedule that will derail everything. Will I get a text from my daughter today, having another panic attack? Will I get a call from the school, telling me my autistic child has run away again? Will I have to start monitoring every pill again to make sure he’s taken his meds?We are constantly engaged in an inner war: our maternal love and instinct versus our own self-preservation. Every parent negotiates this to some extent, but for many parents of kids with behavioral health needs, we are pushed to the absolute limit, over and over again.Because for so many of these kids, we are their emotional whipping boys. They often fight so hard to hold it together at school, when they get home safe with us they completely lose it. It’s a terrible thing to love your child and look forward to seeing them, but also dread what hell the evening will bring.But when they lash out and act horribly, when they are the most unloveable, that’s when they need love the most. So we let them hurt us. Again and again we say, I can take it. You can’t carry these emotions right now, so I’ll carry them for you. And even though I might be silently howling with rage, hurt and weariness—I have to push my emotions aside, so that I can focus on my child, on what will make her feel safe and loved and bring her back from the brink.Until we can’t take it anymore and shut down completely. I have spent days where I could not speak with anyone. I was completely shut down. Like a clam who closes for self-protection. Sometimes we have to take this time for ourselves so that we can recover. We are constantly balancing giving our kids what they need and keeping ourselves from going under completely.We don’t have the luxury of staying angry. We don’t have the luxury of hating the one who is breaking our heart. After all, our kids ARE our own hearts, out walking around in the world.We are exhausted from always giving everything we have, keeping nothing for ourselves or our spouse. So just when we need support and connection the most, we are withdrawing and pulling away, because we are so weary and have nothing left for spouses and friends.We are so tired of being the strong one. Being the one that fixes everything. Being the one that has to take care of everything, solve everything, figure everything out. We need someone to fix us once in a while, to nurture us.We feel so, so alone. Other parents can’t really understand ASD meltdowns or suicidal ideation or bipolar phases. It’s hard to hear about other kids’ accomplishments: the honor roll, sports achievements. We’re just happy our kids have stopped cutting, or can now take a shower or even use the bathroom on their own.We feel like we’re failing all of the time. We’re failing our child because he’s not getting better, we’re failing our other kids because we don’t have the energy to give them what they deserve. We’re failing our spouses because there is nothing left for them. We’re failing ourselves because all the hopes and dreams we had for our own lives are left far, far behind. We are just trying to survive. Every day. And being in survival mode is no way to live.We grieve the kids we thought we’d have, the life we thought we’d have. We fantasize about a different life, about running away, about having nice “normal” children or no children at all, and we feel guilty for it. For many of us, it will never end. They will always need support, even after we’re gone, and this thought keeps us up at night.Parenting a child with behavioral health needs has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but it’s also made me a stronger person in every way. Now I can take myself out of a situation and see it clearly: what emotional need does this child have in this moment that is not being met?But being stronger swimmers won’t keep us from being pulled under. If you see a parent struggling just let them know they’re seen. Offer them some sorely-needed nurturing. Invite them for lunch or a drink. Let them feel safe enough so that they don’t have to pretend everything’s fine. Don’t exclude them because they have the “weird” kid.To parents who are drowning: I see you. You are not alone. Let’s find each other and we’ll stay above water together.Previously published as ‘Mothering Underwater’ in The Wild Word magazine.This is Part 2 of a three-part series.

But Johnson, who is no fan of Trump, wants the administration to push for the legal rights of all LGBTQ people, not just her child.“I love the fact that they have intervened,” she told HuffPost in a phone interview. But, “it shouldn’t have taken for a child to lose his life, and for everybody to think it was a hate crime, for them to step up and do something,” she added, using the male pronoun to refer to Kedarie Johnson. “They need to continue to do something, even after this case is over.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions took the unusual step of sending a federal lawyer, Christopher Perras, to help prosecute one of two men charged in the killing of the 16-year-old, The New York Times reported Sunday. The decision surprised people familiar with the case, particularly given that Sessions has rolled back protections for LGBTQ people more broadly. He has, for example, overturned a policy that encourages schools to let transgender students use the bathroom facilities that correspond with their gender identities. Although several news outlets have referred to Kedarie as transgender, Katrina Johnson and a school mentor prefer the term “gender-fluid.” Johnson said Kedarie sometimes liked to wear girl’s clothing and go by the name Kandicee, and they would go get their nails and hair done together. But she compared Kedarie to “RuPaul,” referring to RuPaul Andre Charles, a professional drag queen who is gay and identifies as male. When Kedarie came out to her as being interested in boys, she said, she was supportive, though she said some peers bullied her child. “I had to teach him and instill in him, don’t be ashamed of who you are,” she said. “Be who you are and what you are, no matter what people think.”Shaunda Campbell, former career center coordinator at Burlington Community High School and a mentor to Kedarie, said the teen had a big heart and cared a lot for others. “If he saw somebody crying in the hallways at school, he would always try to go and comfort them,” she told HuffPost. “He was comfortable in his own skin; I tell you, I have yet to meet somebody, even an adult, like that.” Campbell said she was surprised by the Justice Department’s action. “Because he’s a kid, I would hope that something like this would happen and I’m grateful,” she said. “But, there’s so many people that this has happened to, and if nothing else, I’m hoping this will get some recognition around the United States that hey, this isn’t okay that people are getting killed because they’re transgender or gender-fluid or [because of their sexual orientation.]” First-degree murder charges have been filed in the case against Jorge Luis Sanders-Galvez, whose trial is scheduled to start next week, and Jaron Narelle Purham, who is being prosecuted separately. (DOJ officials declined to comment on whether Perras is aiding in the prosecution of Purham, for whom a trial date has not been set.)Though Johnson and others believe Kedarie’s murder was a hate crime, the cases are not being prosecuted as such under Iowa state law. (The statute covers sexual orientation, but not gender identity.)Federal officials, though, have been investigating whether Sanders-Galvez should be charged with a federal hate crime, “and so they would like to be part of the state case for seamless prosecution, should an indictment in federal court be handed down,” Amy Beavers, the Des Moines County attorney, told The Des Moines Register. (She did not respond to HuffPost for a request for comment.)Curtis Dial, a defense attorney who represents Sanders-Galvez, said the Justice Department contacted him in July and informed him of the investigation. “I was surprised that there is another attorney joining the prosecution,” he told HuffPost. “It doesn’t have any effect on the way that we’re handling our case.” Sessions directed civil rights division attorneys to “dedicate themselves to proactively investigate a certain set of cases of individuals who were murdered because they are transgender,” Devin O’Malley, a DOJ spokesman, told HuffPost in an email. “This is just one example of the attorney general’s commitment to enforcing the laws enacted by Congress and to protecting the civil rights of all individuals.”Johnson said she has strong faith DOJ will deliver justice for Kedarie. But she still wants the administration to push for more legal rights for the LGBTQ community, “not just because it’s my son, but they need to do it for all.”"

The country often threatens to turn Washington and the South Korean capital, Seoul, into a “sea of fire,” and Pyongyang has released propaganda clips showing simulated attacks on the U.S.But the administration of President Donald Trump has amped up its own rhetoric in return in recent months. The president has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea and mocked its leader, Kim Jong Un, as a suicidal “rocket man” on Twitter. Kim notably fired back at Trump last month with his own wordplay, calling the American leader a “mentally deranged dotard.”U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has continued to work on a diplomatic solution, telling CNN on Sunday he would continue to engage with North Korea “until the first bomb drops.”Trump “has also made clear to me that he wants this solved diplomatically,” Tillerson continued, dismissing tweets by Trump earlier this month that said the secretary was wasting his time. “He’s not seeking to go to war.”The U.N. has passed a series of sweeping sanctions against North Korea, which Pyongyang has said are having a “colossal” effect. But the country has continued to reject proposals to hold any peace talks with South Korea.Ambassador Kim said Monday that the country would continue to develop its nuclear arsenal, calling it a “precious strategic asset that cannot be reversed or bartered for anything.”“Unless the hostile policy and the nuclear threat of the U.S. is thoroughly eradicated, we will never put our nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets on the negotiating table under any circumstances,” he said.Trump will visit South Korea next month and speak with President Moon Jae-in, as well as the country’s National Assembly. Reuters has reported that Trump may visit the Demilitarized Zone, following up on a trip Vice President Mike Pence took to the region in April."

But, although ISIS will adapt and persist, losing the city that was once the organization’s central hub will likely see a fundamental shift in how the group operates. “It marks the end of the so-called caliphate as we knew it,” Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told HuffPost.“They are now on the defensive and will continue on as an insurgency, which still wreaks havoc both internally and abroad.”ISIS now faces the challenge of keeping its organizational structure intact and maintaining some physical presence in Iraq and Syria, while also reworking its narrative to convince followers they still command power and respect.

We stand in solidarity with all women who have bravely spoken publicly of their horrific experiences of abuse, harassment and exploitation. However, we cannot stand behind false allegations towards other group members partaking in activities that simply did not take place. PREVIOUSLY: Pussycat Dolls founder and choreographer Robin Antin has spoken out against claims made by a former member who said the group was more a “prostitution ring” than a girl band.Singer Kaya Jones, who got involved with the Pussycat Dolls in 2003 and left before they released their first album in 2005, began tweeting about her experience last week. She alleged that being part of the Dolls meant having to “sleep with whoever.” Antin responded to Jones’ claims in a statement to Entertainment Tonight, calling them “disgusting, ridiculous lies.” “Kaya Jones was never a member of the Pussycat Dolls, but simply a Pussycat reject who’s looking for her 15 minutes of fame,” the choreographer said. “I am shocked with the allegations Ms. Jones has stated and they are nothing more than disgusting, ridiculous lies. Ms. Jones was never an official member of the group, she was one of the many, many girls who auditioned for the Pussycat Dolls over the years.”In her series of tweets, Jones also seemingly made reference to Simone Battle, who was a member of the girl group G.R.L. also created by Antin. Battle died by suicide in 2014 at age 25.The singer’s messages were posted as other female stars have shared stories of abuse amid sexual assault and harassment allegations tied to film executive Harvey Weinstein. She recalled fighting off older men in the music business while part of the Dolls, adding that she spoke out in the past, but no one listened.""We have to face reality that this is the norm in the entertainment industry. It is not just [Weinstein],” she told the Daily Mail. “Then I read that the Pussycat Dolls are planning a reunion. That would mean more girls being abused just the way we were. Why wouldn’t it happen again? It’s all the same people involved.”In her statement to Entertainment Tonight, Antin also took issue with Jones’ apparent reference to Battle. “I am especially incensed that Ms. Jones would bring up former G.R.L. member Simone Battles’ suicide. This is not just nasty, but it’s unfathomable and disrespectful to everyone who works towards suicide prevention and awareness,” she said. “Bringing up Simone’s suicide in such a brazen way not only scars her family further, but the millions of people who loved and cared for Simone.”According to The Blast, the choreographer is drafting a legal response to Jones. Antin formed the Pussycat Dolls in 1995 as a burlesque troupe. She landed a record deal for the group in 2003 and released the debut album “PCD” in 2005 under Interscope. The album went on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide."

Sometimes it is so dependent on a local ingredient that it can’t even be parodied, let alone reproduced, back in New York. But there are generally a few dishes that we think we’ll take a stab at once we get home.The trip from which we’ve just returned was particularly rich in that regard. For part of the time we were in Modena and Parma in the Emilia Romagna area of Italy, where lots of the cooking is centered on dairy, eggs and cured meats: lasagne; fresh pasta with ragù Bolognese; platters of variations on prosciutto, coppa, culatello and salami; shards of parmesan cheese – these are emblematic of the region and are pretty familiar to even semi-engaged diners, and certainly to any cook with a reasonably serious interest in Italian food.Here, though, are a few dishes and cooking ideas that were new to us, or that we’d heard of but had never tasted. I’m determined to devise recipes for them and add them to the repertory, but that determination may well crumble once I get back into post-vacation cooking mode and find dinner defined more by farmers’ market produce than by travel memories. So I shall pass along my to-cook list, with accompanying snapshots, and advise you not to wait for me to give more details in a future Cooking Off the Cuff: Look these dishes up on your own and get cooking.Having said that, I absolutely, one-hundred-percent, will soon be making calzagatti. As served at the lovely Modena restaurant Trattoria Pomposa (whose name does not mean “pompous”: it is located on Piazza Pomposa, deriving ultimately from a place), these are made of polenta combined with well-flavored stewed beans, chilled, cut into fingers, dusted with rice flour and fried to enduring crispness. (The bean-polenta mixture can also be spooned into a bowl without frying.) The flavor is heightened by adding the cooked polenta to the bean pot and simmering it for a while longer with the beans and their stewing liquid. Ours were served on a pillow of cow’s-milk ricotta, but there are many possible accompaniments. I’m thinking along the lines of a drinks snack, perhaps with a parmesan cream to dip them into.Yes, parmesan cream. At Franceschetta58, the informal trattoria of Massimo Bottura (the chef-owner of Osteria Francescana, Modena’s three-Michelin-star restaurant), we had a dish of intense pumpkin spiked with, I think, crisped pancetta and topped with an aerated sauce made from aged parmesan. The home version would simply entail melting lots of parmesan cheese into a mixture of milk and cream, then – if possible – spritzing it out through a cream-whipping siphon. Lacking a siphon, one could make it solely with milk then fold hand-whipped cream into it to give it an airier consistency.(Aerated parmesan cream must be a Thing, because we ate it also in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, at the chef Nick Grieves’s excellent restaurant The Patricia; there, it topped onion jam and Brussels sprouts and was in turn dusted with an aromatic grating of fresh truffles. Don’t let the truffles mislead you into thinking this is a fancy restaurant: it’s an easygoing place, the cooking sophisticated and entirely delightful.)Also from Franceschetta58 (whose menu is not limited to local dishes or ingredients), here’s a tip for dried peppers: deep fry them, and they’ll develop a pleasing crunch while retaining their flavor. There, they did it with mild peppers from the southern Italian region of Basilicata, known in their dried form as peperoni cruschi. They also served an untypical dish of passatelli – a pasta made of breadcrumbs and eggs that is usually served in broth but that here were combined with octopus, potatoes, capers and lemon. Because of their fragility, I think they’re better served in the traditional way, and when I make them (using a potato ricer to extrude the worm-shaped noodles) that’s how we’ll eat them.I don’t normally get into charcuterie (except for the occasional batch of cotechino), but I think I’ll try to make ciccioli, which we had as part of our antipasto at Trattoria Pomposa. It’s in my comfort zone because I make duck confit every year or two, and ciccioli are pork slowly cooked in lard, including cracklings from the rendered fat and gelatinous parts such as ears, pressed into the form of a cake; once it has chilled under a weight, all that gelatin holds it together for slicing. Unbelievably good: soft, unctuous and totally porky.In Parma, we had operas to see in the evening, so, uncharacteristically, we ate lunch rather than supper. On the day of our arrival we made for Ristorante Cocchi, about a half hour’s walk from our hotel (the Mercure Parma Stendhal - a perfect location for opera-going). It serves classic Parma dishes in that sort of simple, comfortable environment that restaurants in Italy get just right. Two things there are on my list: first, Punta di vitello ripiena (oven-braised breast of veal with a bread stuffing). My mother used to stuff breast of veal with nicely seasoned bread, but this is in another world: The custard-smooth stuffing is made with bread, maybe a butter-cooked onion, eggs and lots of grated parmesan cheese. Such simplicity, such intensity of flavor; light and rich at the same time. When winter is upon us, I’ll give this a try.On our way into the restaurant we saw a tart pan containing something golden brown. At dessert time, the waiter did not mention it, so we quizzed him. It was sbrisolona, which is rather like the topping of a fruit crumble but intended to be eaten on its own. We asked for some, and it came, full of toasty almonds and crunch, with a dish of zabaglione on the side. They sell it in pastry shops too, but even the best store-bought versions don’t have the butteriness and freshness of Cocchi’s. It’ll be easy to make, but not easy to make quite as well.Finally, erbazzone, a thin pie filled with ricotta and one or more green vegetables, typically spinach and/or Swiss chard. We ate it in Modena at the bar/café Caffetteria Giusti, sitting outside gazing at the imposing Palazzo Ducale (now an officer-training school for the Carabinieri) and watching people and their dogs stroll by. In fact, we ate it twice: once cut into little squares as part of the cocktail-hour freebie that Italian bars offer; and the following day in a larger portion. True-flavored, tender filling and crisp, flaky crust. When I get around to making this, it will make a great snack – or a great dinner.That’s quite a to-cook list considering we were in Emilia Romagna for only four days. But travel, especially Italian travel, is like that."

When you don’t even acknowledge the sacrifice or the death, then it’s like you don’t even care,” Karen Meredith said on Tuesday. Meredith’s son, Army 1st Lt. Ken Ballard, died in Iraq on Memorial Day 2004.“I don’t know what’s more important of a job as the commander in chief than to acknowledge the sacrifice of one of his military members,” Meredith added.Meredith, who is active in the progressive veterans advocacy group, VoteVets, recalled receiving a letter from then-President George W. Bush and then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld when her son was killed.Bush’s note was a “little bit informal,” which she did not like, Meredith said. He addressed her by her first name, rather than as “Ms. Meredith.”“But at least he sent something ― unlike the current president,” she said.The grieving families of slain service members receive many letters from the military and gestures of support from the community of Gold Star families, according to Meredith.“So nobody’s sitting around waiting for letters from the president, but the president shouldn’t be the last one to write or to contact the family,” she said. Most Gold Star families expect a timely letter but not a phone call from the president, according to Stephanie Fisher, whose son, Army Staff Sgt. Thomas Fogerty, was killed in Afghanistan in February 2012. Fisher said she received a letter from then-President Barack Obama within a week’s time.The families of those who died while serving in elite military units are more likely to receive a phone call, said Fisher, who is also active in VoteVets. “It appeared from Trump’s comments that he had not even reached out to the families of our Green Berets ― and these are our elite special forces,” Fisher said. “You would think that Trump would have the families on the phone to thank the families and say, ‘I’m really sorry.’”Trump was criticized on Monday when he claimed that most previous presidents, including Obama, did not make phone calls to the families of troops killed in action. In fact, Obama called, wrote and met with many Gold Star families and frequently visited wounded and disabled veterans at Walter Reed Medical Center.“That just wasn’t true. I found it offensive,” Fisher said of Trump’s specific jab at Obama.Michelle DeFord, another VoteVets activist, appreciated the kind treatment she received from President Obama and the first lady years after the death of her son, Oregon National Guard Sgt. David Johnson, in Iraq in September 2004. Michelle Obama wrote DeFord a letter asking for a photo of her son to put on one of the ornaments decorating a White House Christmas tree.“That was so nice to me that his face would be on a Christmas ornament in the White House,” DeFord recalled.Trump’s remarks at Monday’s press conference were his first about an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger in which four Green Berets were killed. The attack was the single deadliest incident for U.S. troops since he became president. He said that he had written letters to the families of the four men over the weekend, which would soon be sent to them, and that he planned to call them as well.“The toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens. Soldiers are killed. It’s a very difficult thing,” Trump said.Meredith suggested that the families of the Green Berets might have appreciated receiving his sympathies earlier. It often takes 10 days for the bodies of fallen service members to be returned to their loved ones, she said, so they are “probably” just getting to holding funerals now.“They don’t want to hear from the president on the day of the funeral,” she said.Meredith brushed off Trump’s remarks about how difficult it is for him to call families in mourning.“Put yourself in my place: How do you think I felt getting those letters? Ken was my only child,” she said.This story has been updated with comment from more Gold Star mothers."

A Hawaii judge blocked the ban the day before, just hours before it was set to go into effect.It represents an “extricable re-animation of the twice-enjoined Muslim ban,” Maryland District Judge Theodore D. Chuang said. His ruling is somewhat smaller in scope than that of his Hawaii counterpart, Judge Derrick Watson. It applies only to those who couldn’t prove a “bona fide” relationship with a family member or entity in the U.S.The International Refugee Assistance Project, the Iranian Alliances Across Borders and various individual plaintiffs, including the state of Hawaii, filed lawsuits in Hawaii and Maryland after the travel ban ― which would indefinitely ban citizens from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen from entering the country ― was announced on Sept. 24. They view this ban as yet another thinly veiled attempt to target Muslims (six out of the eight countries on the list are Muslim-majority).“EO-3 suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be ‘detrimental to the interests of the United States,’” the Hawaii court order said. The ban also “plainly discriminates based on nationality in the manner that the Ninth Circuit has found antithetical to both Section 1152(a) and the founding principles of this Nation,” it noted.Non-visa holders from most of the countries listed have already been banned for the last several months, after the Supreme Court ruled to allow parts of a previous travel ban to go into effect in June. The latest initiative removed Sudan from the list, and added Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. It was planned to go into effect Wednesday.Omar Jadwat, who is the director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and was among those arguing the case in Maryland, called Trump’s ban “illegal and unconstitutional.” “We’re glad, but not surprised, that President Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional Muslim ban has been blocked once again,” Jadwat said. “Like the plaintiffs in the Hawaii case, we are working to ensure the ban never takes effect.”The changes were interpreted by many as mere political posturing ― an attempt to make the ban appear less overtly targeted toward Muslims. “Each new version is just an updated version of the previous ones, and they all have one goal: to keep out people primarily from majority-Muslim countries,” Becca Heller, head of the International Refugee Assistant Project, said Monday. “We will not rest until this cruel and senseless policy is blocked for good.”A White House statement released Tuesday afternoon called the Hawaii court order “dangerously flawed” and noted the travel ban was issued after an “extensive worldwide security review.”“The entry restrictions in the proclamation apply to countries based on their inability or unwillingness to share critical information necessary to safely vet applications, as well as a threat assessment related to terrorism, instability, and other grave national security concerns,” the White House said. “These restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our Nation.”The Department of Homeland Security “will comply with any lawful judicial order,” acting secretary Elaine Duke said in a statement, adding that they “look forward to prevailing in this matter upon appeal.” She said the “requirements are essential to securing the homeland.” The new orders doesn’t directly implicate the U.S. refugee resettlement program because the Trump administration had already taken measures to limit the number of refugees able to seek safety in the country. The 120-day suspension included in the second iteration of the ban expires on Oct. 24. Experts don’t think the White House will replace it with a new refugee ban because the administration already slashed the annual resettlement ceiling to 45,000 for fiscal year 2018, the lowest it’s been since the program’s inception in 1980.The series of limits placed on immigration places tens of thousands of people already in the resettlement pipeline in limbo. Plus, it precludes so many more from being able to begin the process. For Amir Abbasi, 33, the uncertainty has been excruciating. (He asked for his name to be changed out of fear of persecution by authorities in his home country.) He and his partner fled Iran due to the persecution they faced for being gay. They illegally traveled to Turkey in 2014 and first went through the Canadian refugee pipeline.They were told the country couldn’t handle any more cases, so earlier this year they began the process with the U.S. program. After one pre-screening interview, they stopped hearing from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.He no longer holds hope that his U.S. application will lead to anything, he said. He doesn’t know where to go or what to do.“Life in Turkey is very hard,” he said. “We don’t have any access to job markets legally. Most LGBT refugees don’t have access to funds from their families. And if you work illegally you might be arrested and you might be deported to Iran.”This story has been updated to include the Maryland federal court ruling."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e6189d2d0000888e30aaee.jpeg?cache=14LZUYByYb&ops=crop_0_69_4432_3031%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Gretchen Carlson thinks the recent allegations against Harvey Weinstein are the “tipping point” that could finally help dismantle the culture of sexual harassment in workplaces around the country. On Monday, the news anchor and author spoke to USA Today about the dozens of accusations of assault, harassment and sexual misconduct against Weinstein. “What we’re seeing happening now with the Harvey Weinstein revelations, to me this is the watershed moment,” she said. “This is the tipping point I’ve been working so hard for over the last 15 months. People are finally saying ‘enough.’”Carlson was one of the first women to file a lawsuit against then-Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for sexual harassment. Since coming forward with her story, Carlson has become an outspoken advocate against sexual harassment and recently wrote a book titled Be Fierce. “There’s no way that situations like this could continue for that long without other people knowing about it and covering it up. And that is happening all over the place,” Carlson said. “And that’s why I feel like this is the tipping point. Now that women feel empowered to come forward it’s going to be in other professions as well.” Carlson added that this moment is so powerful because it’s allowing women the space to realize they’re not alone in their experiences of sexual harassment. “Maybe [women coming forward with stories of harassment] won’t get the same attention as a huge Hollywood mogul,” she said. “But there’s a ton of women sitting at home right now saying ‘Oh my gosh, I’m going to do that now.’ And there are probably a lot of sexual harassers sitting at home going ‘oh no.’”During a Washington Post event earlier on Monday, Carlson revealed that she experienced sexual harassment prior to her experiences with Ailes. Carlson said it was during her first job, right after she had just covered Anita Hill’s testimony, when she was sexually harassed by her cameraman: I was with my cameraman in a rural part of Virginia, and we were covering a story, and when we got back into the car together, he started asking me how I had liked it when he touched my breasts when he was putting my microphone on. And it went on from there... The sheer panic that women go through when you face something like that... I literally thought to myself about rolling outside of the passenger door at 40 miles an hour, like I’d seen people do in the movies, and wondered how much it would hurt. (Watch the full exchange above.) She said that when she returned to the newsroom later that day she was “a shaking mess.” “Luckily my boss ― a man ― kept approaching me and saying, ‘What is wrong with you? What happened?’ And I didn’t want to tell him either… because I was new on the job,” Carlson continued. “It was the whole shame thing that women go through: What did I do to bring this on? This is what women feel, this is how we’ve been socialized to feel about this. If it wasn’t for the tenacity of [my boss] I don’t know what would’ve happened.” "

When he finally spoke about the matter on Monday, he slammed his predecessors, including former President Barack Obama, for failing to call the forgotten families of fallen service members.The Khans blasted Trump on Tuesday in a statement to ABC News, declaring that they “stand with the families in their moment of grief.”Khizr and Ghazala Khan became household names in July 2016 after Khizr Khan delivered a stinging rebuke to then-presidential candidate Trump at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. “Let me ask you, have you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy,” Khan addressed Trump, before pulling a copy of the document from his pocket.Trump subsequently attacked the Khans, implying that Ghazala Khan had not spoken at the convention due to the couple’s Islamic faith.The comments sparked widespread denunciations of Trump for attacking Gold Star parents ― a term referring to the parents of fallen service members, which Trump was reportedly unfamiliar with beforehand. The Khans’ son Capt. Humayun S.M.

Last week, Santa Rosa city officials tweeted a request for food trucks willing to help with relief efforts, Eater reports. Local company Off The Grid responded in a big way.Off The Grid organizes food events around Northern California, so they have a lot of vendors in their Rolodex. Since last week, they’ve been acting as a dispatcher for food trucks and vendors who want to serve those displaced or affected by the fires.“Because of their mobility, food trucks are particularly well-suited to help in disaster relief situations by providing hot, healthy meals to people who are otherwise without reliable access to food, power and water,” Off The Grid CEO Matt Cohen told HuffPost. “Our vendors have been able to mobilize to these areas right away.”The company is “giving priority to Napa/Sonoma-based businesses that have been affected, to provide an opportunity to serve in their community and recoup lost dollars,” a spokeswoman added in a statement. That means Sonoma County-based food trucks like Fruity Moto, Caribbean Spices and Mai Thai Kitchen are making money at a time when business would normally be slow by dishing out food to locals in need, like senior citizens at nearby residential complexes. Off The Grid foots the bill, paying trucks $7.50 per meal out of a GoFundMe campaign that’s raised $32,000 and counting.Emergency workers have been contacting Off The Grid to request food deliveries all over the county, the spokeswoman said. On Saturday, two of the company’s food truck partners, a burger truck and a taco truck, fed 200 meals to first responders coming off 36-hour shifts. On Tuesday, more vendors fed 200 displaced farm workers at a community hall in Sonoma Springs. Starting this weekend, even more vendors will join together and deliver over 3,500 meals to shelters in the area.Much of the feeding is made possible by Off The Grid’s GoFundMe page, which raised $30,000 in five days after it went live last Tuesday. If participating food vendors aren’t based directly in Sonoma, the company offers them a $125 stipend per 50 meals served, the spokeswoman said. However, many have declined to accept payment altogether, she added.Off The Grid has upped its initial fundraising goal to $50,000 so it can fund long-term relief efforts. Other businesses are following suit: Google recently announced it will team up with Off The Grid to deliver more than 25,000 meals to Napa and Sonoma County shelters over the next month.You can donate on Off The Grid’s GoFundMe page."
48,POLITICS,DOJ Admits It Isn't Legal To Keep Prosecuting Washington State Medical Marijuana Users,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kettle-falls-five-marijuana-law_us_59e630cbe4b0a2324d1e45b0,The so-called Kettle Falls Five were first charged in 2012.,2017-10-17,"Rhonda Firestack-Harvey (left), her son, Rolland Gregg, and his ex-wife, Michelle Gregg, have been facing prison time for violating federal marijuana law.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e63d851800004a00dfae37.jpeg?cache=3fzJLbMgtH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Department of Justice has agreed with defense lawyers that five Washington state residents ― including members of the same family ― who said they grew and used marijuana for medical reasons had complied with state law and that the U.S. government shouldn’t have pursued federal charges against them.In a brief filed late Monday in the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, DOJ lawyers acknowledged that the department “was not authorized to spend money on the prosecution of the defendants after December of 2014 because the defendants strictly complied with the Washington state medical marijuana laws.”The defendants became known as the Kettle Falls Five, because of the region in eastern Washington where they live. Three have been facing prison time, following the death from cancer in 2015 of Larry Harvey ― the patriarch of the family in the case ― and a plea deal taken by family friend Jason Zucker to testify against the other defendants. The remaining three were sentenced in 2015. Rhonda Firestack-Harvey, 59, the wife of Larry Harvey, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Her son, Rolland Gregg, 35, was given a 33-month prison sentence, and his now ex-wife, Michelle Gregg, 38, was sentenced to a year and a day. All three also were sentenced to three years of probation.The trio have remained free as they appealed their sentences.The case received national attention as critics of the federal government’s ban on marijuana blasted the DOJ for prosecuting state-registered medical marijuana growers and patients in a state where pot is legal for both medical and recreational purposes.“This case has turned the justice system completely on its head,” said Kari Boiter, who became a spokeswoman for the Kettle Falls Five. “Here we have prosecutors admitting that it’s the DOJ who is breaking federal law, not the other way around.”State authorities raided the Harvey family home in 2012 and found more than 70 marijuana plants growing nearby. The defendants maintained that the marijuana patch complied with state law and the plants were for their own medical use. Washington state legalized marijuana use for medical reasons in 1998 and allows the growing of it for that purpose. The state legalized recreational marijuana use in 2012.The five were originally charged with distribution of marijuana, conspiracy to distribute, and a violation of firearm laws ― all of which carried harsh prison sentences. Charges were dropped against Larry Harvey because of his terminal illness, and Zucker took his plea deal right the trial started.In 2015, a jury cleared the three remaining defendants of all the charges except illegal cultivation of marijuana.Twenty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have enacted laws legalizing marijuana growth and use for medical purposes (17 other states have laws allowing limited use of cannabidiol, or CBD, the non-psychoactive ingredient in pot that holds promise for therapeutic use).Meanwhile, a federal marijuana provision that lawmakers have been renewing since it first passed in 2014, known as the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, prohibits the DOJ from prosecuting medical marijuana operations that are legal under state laws. In 2016, the ninth circuit appeals court ruled unanimously that the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment blocks federal officials from prosecuting state-legal marijuana operators and patients.The DOJ lawyers cited that ruling in the brief filed Monday.“This court determined that [Rohrabacher-Farr] prohibits the Department of Justice from spending funds for the prosecution of individuals who engaged in conduct permitted by the state medical marijuana laws and fully complied with the laws,” the brief said.That prohibition, the lawyers said, extends to expenditure of DOJ funds even if the prosecution was properly initiated prior to the enactment of the Rohrbacher-Farr provision, the brief said.Despite the admissions by the from DOJ, the brief did not recommend charges be dropped against the three defendants. Instead, it urged that further proceedings in the case be bumped back to a federal district court. Still, lawyers for the family are expected to seek the case’s dismissal."

52,POLITICS,Suit Against D.A. Who Used Fake Subpoenas To Put Victims In Jail Kicks Off Civil Rights Battle,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prosecutorial-misconduct-fake-subpoenas_us_59e4f2e5e4b03a7be58281c4,Prosecutors are generally immune from accountability. A new joint initiative from Civil Rights Corps and the ACLU seeks to change that.,2017-10-17,Renata Singleton is a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the district attorney in New Orleans. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e525f81500004800da1ba4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Renata Singleton is a black woman who spent five days in a New Orleans jail because she couldn’t afford her bail. Away from her three children, she lost eight pounds before her mother was finally able to purchase her release.When Singleton got home, she had an 8 p.m. curfew and started wearing bell-bottom jeans to hide the electronic monitor on her ankle from her kids. Despite having a master’s degree in business administration, she’s worried she’ll have trouble finding a new job: Her mug shot and a record of her arrest are still floating around online.None of those facts make Singleton’s story extraordinarily noteworthy: Legally innocent defendants unable purchase their freedom ahead of trial are regularly locked up. Here’s what does: Singleton wasn’t accused of a crime. She was the victim of one.About three years ago, in November 2014, Singleton got into an argument with her boyfriend. He shattered her phone. Her daughter called the police. The boyfriend was arrested. Singleton’s ex-boyfriend was able to pay a $3,500 secured bond at his arraignment the next day, and he was released. He later pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to probation without jail time.Singleton, the victim in the case, didn’t have such an easy go of it. When a victim-witness advocate for the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office reached out to her, Singleton said she wasn’t interested in pursuing charges. She had a job that paid by the hour, and she didn’t want to miss out on work or time with her kids. She’d broken up with the man. She was ready to move on.Prosecutors didn’t let her let it go. According to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro and others in his office, investigators drafted up “subpoenas” requiring Singleton to appear for a meeting at the district attorney’s office in April 2015, when the case against her ex-boyfriend was still pending. Those documents were not actually subpoenas ― but the district attorney’s office misleadingly labeled them as such to compel Singleton to show up to a meeting. Singleton didn’t know that at the time, but she didn’t go to the meeting because a friend in law enforcement told her that she hadn’t been validly served.The day Singleton missed the meeting, an assistant district attorney applied for a material witness warrant, asking the court to jail Singleton. Believing the fake subpoenas were actual subpoenas, a judge issued the arrest warrant.Singleton eventually met with prosecutors, but told them she wouldn’t talk to them without a lawyer present. Rather than granting her access to a lawyer, prosecutors had Singleton led out of their office in handcuffs, and she was arrested on the warrant.It was the first time Singleton had ever been arrested. She was taken to jail and forced into an orange jumpsuit. Her bail was $100,000 ― more than 28 times the bail amount set for her alleged abuser. She spent five days in jail before she went before a judge, who reduced her bail to an amount her mother could afford.Singleton is now the main named plaintiff in a lawsuit against Cannizzaro and his office that alleges that his prosecutors “routinely issue their own fabricated subpoenas directly from the District Attorney’s Office ― without any judicial approval or oversight ― in order to coerce victims and witnesses into submitting to interrogations by prosecutors outside of court.”The suit, filed by Civil Rights Corps, the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Louisiana, opens a new front in the legal battle to change the criminal justice system ― by challenging the actions of prosecutors through civil rights litigation.“Prosecutors are one of the biggest forces behind our society’s addiction to senseless mass human caging,” says Alec Karakatsanis, the Civil Rights Corps’ founder. “And for years, they have operated with virtually no transparency or accountability. Our hope is that cases like this one help tell people the story about what prosecutors have been doing in our legal system, away from view, and about why they have been doing it.”Anna Arceneaux, an ACLU senior staff attorney on the case, said she hoped this lawsuit and others like it would help “change the landscape in holding prosecutors accountable, because so much of our crisis of over-incarceration in this country turns on the decision-making of prosecutors who are so used to not being held accountable and having very little oversight of their decisions.”Prosecutors are notoriously protected from being held accountable for misconduct. The high bar for suing prosecutors for the actions they take in the course of their jobs amounts to near immunity.But there is one rarely used provision of the law: challenging patterns and practices of unconstitutional conduct. That’s what’s happening in the New Orleans case ― the plaintiffs are alleging that issuing fake subpoenas was the office’s adopted formal policy, not just the action of one rogue prosecutor. Cannizzaro had challenged members of the New Orleans City Council last month to show him one person who was ever arrested on one of the D.A. notices. It evidently wasn’t too hard: Civil rights investigators have already found at least 10 cases in the past three years in which prosecutors applied for arrest warrants by relying on the assertion that a witness didn’t obey one of the office’s fraudulent subpoenas. The lawsuit alleges that the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office engages in an unconstitutional policy of using “extrajudicial and unlawful means to coerce, arrest, and imprison crime victims and witnesses.” The lawsuit said that victims and witnesses “routinely wait weeks or even months in jail” before they appear before a judge.According to the suit, a rape victim spent 12 days in jail before making a first court appearance, while a child sex trafficking victim spent 89 days behind bars before she was able to challenge her detention in court.“Defendants’ policies are designed to create a culture of fear and intimidation that chills crime victims and witnesses from asserting their constitutional rights,” the lawsuit says. “As a result of these policies, crime victims and witnesses in Orleans Parish know that if they exercise their right not to speak with an investigating prosecutor, they will face harassment, threats, arrest, and jail.”Prosecutors can typically request subpoenas through a formal process that requires witnesses or victims to appear at a court hearing or before a grand jury. They’re not allowed to use a subpoena to demand that a witness show up to a private meeting. So prosecutors in New Orleans forged and doctored the documents, according to the lawsuit. In one case, prosecutors gave a doctored subpoena to a 60-year-old homeless battery victim. The man was required to appear in court on March 6, 2017, but prosecutors altered the document to say he’d instead have to show up to the district attorney’s office on March 3. The forgery was apparent because the individual who altered it failed to change the appearance date in some cases, and forgot to remove some references to the court, the lawsuit said.The Lens, a New Orleans news organization, first reported on the fake subpoenas in April. Shortly afterward, Cannizzaro announced he would bring an end to what he admitted was an “improper” office policy.“It was improper for us, it was incorrect for us to label those notices as a subpoena,” Cannizzzaro told a local news station. “That was incorrect. It was improper and I take responsibility for that.”Instead, the office has begun sending out “notices” that do not include the word “subpoena.” Still, the lawsuit alleges, the documents “create the false impression that the witness is ‘required’ by law to meet privately with prosecutors.”The lawsuit also alleges that Cannizzaro threatened Tamara Jackson, the executive director of the New Orleans victim rights organization Silence Is Violence, another plaintiff in the suit. According to the suit, after Jackson filed a complaint to the National District Attorneys Association about what she saw as the local district attorney office’s inadequate protections for crime victims, Cannizzaro “called Ms. Jackson and told her to be careful: if it appeared that she was encouraging victims not to communicate with his office, he could prosecute her for witness coercion.”Jackson told HuffPost that the district attorney’s office’s actions have made her organization’s work more difficult. She said she felt retaliated against for publicly criticizing the office for not offering supporting services. “What they tell people is that they will likely have this witness protection when we don’t have a witness protection program here in Orleans Parish, and they’re not being truthful. They give folks deceptive information to encourage them to share,” Jackson said. “I don’t trust them at all, and I do share the sentiments of our clients because I know what they’re capable of.” Both Civil Rights Corps and the ACLU are placing a new focus on prosecutorial accountability. Civil Rights Corps, which prides itself on an “innovative and aggressive” approach to civil rights law, has brought several notable challenges to bail systems across the United States, including a noteworthy case currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that bail supporters and opponents are watching closely. Civil Rights Corps has received funding from Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan. As part of its new project on prosecutors, the organization is planning to build a publicly accessible, centralized database of instances of prosecutorial misconduct. It will also pursue pattern and practice cases ― when an office is accused of using unconstitutional methods on a widespread basis ― and state bar complaints. A job description for the project states that there are “vast swaths of largely unexplored areas” of the law in regard to prosecutorial misconduct.The ACLU also wants to draw attention to the role of prosecutors, both through litigation and through educational efforts. Arceneaux said the ACLU wants to challenge the contours of prosecutorial immunity and take cases that others aren’t always willing to take.“The district attorneys hold a lot of power, and it’s not an easy lawsuit to bring for people in the local community,” Arceneaux said. “Prosecutors have enormous power, and they routinely operate without oversight.”This story has been updated with a quote from Tamara Jackson.Read the full lawsuit below.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

53,POLITICS,Suit Against D.A. Who Used Fake Subpoenas To Put Victims In Jail Kicks Off Civil Rights Battle,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prosecutorial-misconduct-fake-subpoenas_us_59e4f2e5e4b03a7be58281c4,Prosecutors are generally immune from accountability. A new joint initiative from Civil Rights Corps and the ACLU seeks to change that.,2017-10-17,"Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro, pictured here on April 6, 2015, now faces a lawsuit from the ACLU and Civil Rights Corps.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e507761500004800da1b25.jpeg?cache=p1z1hJrCX0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Renata Singleton is a black woman who spent five days in a New Orleans jail because she couldn’t afford her bail. Away from her three children, she lost eight pounds before her mother was finally able to purchase her release.When Singleton got home, she had an 8 p.m. curfew and started wearing bell-bottom jeans to hide the electronic monitor on her ankle from her kids. Despite having a master’s degree in business administration, she’s worried she’ll have trouble finding a new job: Her mug shot and a record of her arrest are still floating around online.None of those facts make Singleton’s story extraordinarily noteworthy: Legally innocent defendants unable purchase their freedom ahead of trial are regularly locked up. Here’s what does: Singleton wasn’t accused of a crime. She was the victim of one.About three years ago, in November 2014, Singleton got into an argument with her boyfriend. He shattered her phone. Her daughter called the police. The boyfriend was arrested. Singleton’s ex-boyfriend was able to pay a $3,500 secured bond at his arraignment the next day, and he was released. He later pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to probation without jail time.Singleton, the victim in the case, didn’t have such an easy go of it. When a victim-witness advocate for the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office reached out to her, Singleton said she wasn’t interested in pursuing charges. She had a job that paid by the hour, and she didn’t want to miss out on work or time with her kids. She’d broken up with the man. She was ready to move on.Prosecutors didn’t let her let it go. According to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro and others in his office, investigators drafted up “subpoenas” requiring Singleton to appear for a meeting at the district attorney’s office in April 2015, when the case against her ex-boyfriend was still pending. Those documents were not actually subpoenas ― but the district attorney’s office misleadingly labeled them as such to compel Singleton to show up to a meeting. Singleton didn’t know that at the time, but she didn’t go to the meeting because a friend in law enforcement told her that she hadn’t been validly served.The day Singleton missed the meeting, an assistant district attorney applied for a material witness warrant, asking the court to jail Singleton. Believing the fake subpoenas were actual subpoenas, a judge issued the arrest warrant.Singleton eventually met with prosecutors, but told them she wouldn’t talk to them without a lawyer present. Rather than granting her access to a lawyer, prosecutors had Singleton led out of their office in handcuffs, and she was arrested on the warrant.It was the first time Singleton had ever been arrested. She was taken to jail and forced into an orange jumpsuit. Her bail was $100,000 ― more than 28 times the bail amount set for her alleged abuser.

These 3 Things Will Help Us Eliminate It.,"Philip Alston, ContributorUN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poverty-eradication-is-possible-united-nations-economics_us_59e5d3b9e4b0a2324d1d64ab,"A prosperous society is one which enables everyone to live decently, not just the rich.",2017-10-17,"Homeless people on a Skid Row sidewalk in Los Angeles, California.

It’s a refrain we often hear – sometimes from politicians, from the wealthy, and even from governments. The tragedy is that it’s true, only not in the way many elites think it is. Those who are living in poverty are losers in terms of human rights. They are the ones most likely to be murdered, beaten up by the police, sexually assaulted, and driven out of their homes, and the resources devoted to protecting them will generally be far fewer than that spent on protecting the well-off.The poor are losers when it comes to the political process. They are discouraged and sometimes prevented from voting, and they have little real chance of expressing their opinions in ways that will be heard by the powerful because their “representatives” tend not to listen to people who have neither money nor clout.And the poor are losers when it comes to the economic system. Increasing privatization forces the poor to buy goods and services on the private market, money that they often simply don’t have. When they look for credit, insurance and other services from private corporations, algorithms weed out the poor and direct them to more expensive or substandard offers. The middle class and the rich have Uber and Airbnb, the poor have a higher monthly car insurance bill and expensive temporary accommodation.And the poor are losers because they can’t count on the State to give them a break. The lion’s share of public expenditures including tax deductions and special treatment go to the wealthy. Meanwhile, the piddling amounts of welfare given to those in dire need are subjected by governments to death by a thousand cuts as politicians vie with one another to prevent fraud, drug abuse, laziness, and whatever else they deem the poor to be guilty of. Meanwhile, labor market institutions to protect the poor (and the middle classes) such as the minimum wage, employment protections and labor unions are under sustained attack.If we listen to the dominant voices in our communities it seems that our prosperity and success as a society depend primarily on implementing two sets of policies. The first is to tax the rich as little as possible because this will generate the wealth needed to help the rest of society to live decently. The second is to whittle away at every last food stamp benefit, to reduce the drain that non-wealthy people impose on the healthcare system, and to make the receipt of any form of government benefits as unpleasant and unrewarding as possible.Sadly for those who seek quick fixes, there is remarkably little evidence to support any of these propositions.But the question then is whether it’s true that there is little that can be done to help the poor and to eradicate poverty? Happily, it’s not. There are three things we need to do.The first is to acknowledge that the persistence of poverty in almost every society is a result of political choices that have consciously been made by those in power. The bottom 15-20 percent of our societies live in conditions that we would find abhorrent, largely because our political leaders and we don’t really give a damn because they/we like to think that people (especially those of us who are successful) are fully responsible for their own fate, and because they/we would prefer that public resources be spent on ourselves rather than on others. To move beyond this we need to acknowledge that extreme poverty, which continues to afflict hundreds of millions of people around the world, is effectively a negation of all human rights and that its persistence challenges any notion of a common humanity and solidarity.Second, we have the financial resources to eliminate poverty and it would cost a fraction of what “coalitions of the willing” poured into wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Arguments that we need to cut spending on social protection in order to enable tax cuts for the rich are self-serving and obscene and we need to recognize that. The reality is that even the so-called poorest countries would have the necessary resources if they were to curb corruption, collect taxes, and prevent illicit financial outflows. They don’t, and we in the global north are often complicit in their actions. Third, we need to make poverty elimination a political issue. We need to reassert a common humanity, shared responsibilities, and the centrality of human dignity.For more content and to be part of HuffPost’s “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group."

Whether it is natural disaster in the form of drought, or man-made crises such as famine and the consequences of climate change, extreme poverty, disease, violence, extremism, inequality, and weak institutions unable to deal with these challenges, each one is all too familiar for Somalis. Despite it all, the people remain resilient.I weep for the hundreds killed in Mogadishu, for the thousands touched by this crime, and for the millions of Somalis who have suffered from years of violence and instability.The tragedies Somalis face do not have their origins in Somalia alone. The country has been subject to almost continuous foreign intervention. It has seen boots on the ground and drones in its airspace, and it now witnesses regional and international governments queuing to carve up its strategic assets. While Turkey mobilised medical aid, some more fair weather friends who are quick when it comes to setting up ports and bases were silent when assistance was required for the victims in Mogadishu.Foreign and international intervention - from Ethiopia, the US, AMISON and UNSOM - has too often been driven by narrow and selfish political interest and short-termism. Somalia faces grave economic, security and governance weaknesses. It cannot address these problems without assistance from outside, but neither can they be solved if fixes are directed by foreign powers. Solutions that will work for Somalia must come from within. This will require Somalia’s institutions to be resilient against the corruption and infighting that remain so prevalent. It will need an end to the posturing and positioning at municipal and provincial levels that undermines central government.Even in a country that has witnessed as much suffering as Somalia, Saturday’s atrocity can be a wake-up call. The consequences of people failing to to work together, failing to build peace, failing to build strong institutions, became all too real again in Mogadishu. In an instant, the future of over 300 Somalis was wiped out on Saturday, and the lives of the many more people affected were left irrevocably scarred. Those of us left have a duty to end the scourge of corruption and weak leadership that have contributed to this and many more tragedies. We must also demand the support of international institutions like the UN, the African Union, the IMF, the World Bank, and foreign governments to help us in this cause, rather than helping themselves.Somalia’s people have shown great strength in the face of disaster. Their resilience hints that grief for the victims can ultimately give way to hope for peace and stability."

That the tax code is riddled with loopholes that the rich use to avoid paying anything. That the government will take a big chunk of what Americans hope to leave to their children.Most Americans, as it turns out, are really, really wrong – and their misconceptions are helping Republican leaders to push tax law changes that polls show Americans do not actually want.Virtually every income group is paying lower taxes now than at any other time since Ronald Reagan became president. And while the tax code has plenty of deductions and credits, the most costly ones are those that middle-class taxpayers would be incensed if they lost.And that inheritance tax? It only affects the richest Americans ― a tiny percentage of families every year.“We’re a low-tax country, by the standards of other developed countries,” said Roberton Williams, a recently retired analyst at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. That Americans believe what they do, though, is not surprising to him. “They’re continually told how taxes are too high,” he said. “It’s a continuing drumbeat.”Now, President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are taking advantage of those erroneous beliefs while pushing a tax proposal that slashes taxes for the wealthiest Americans but gives only modest breaks for the middle class. As currently structured, the plan would actually be a tax increase for most Americans.Despite this, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has on numerous occasions described the plan as one that will give the middle class a well-deserved tax break. “The entire purpose of this is to lower middle-class taxes,” he told CBS News earlier this month.Trump frequently praises the plan because it would allow returns to be done “on a single sheet of paper” by simplifying the code. “Our plan goes from eight tax brackets down to four,” he said at a speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, last week.Vice President Mike Pence, on a recent trip to Detroit and Milwaukee to sell the proposal, heard from an employee of a metal fabrication plant who said that even though his parents were not rich, he was worried the government would tax what they have managed to accumulate when they die. “Whatever they have built, it would be nice if they could pass it down,” he said.That is a relatively common fear among Americans. Thirty-two percent, in fact, believe they are either “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to have to pay the estate tax, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by HuffPost ― even though the tax applies only to inheritances worth at least $5.5 million. Thirty-eight percent said they were unlikely to have to pay any estate tax, and 31 percent said they were unsure.A subsequent survey found that 41 percent of Americans believe they personally are paying more in taxes than they were 10 years ago, and 52 percent believe the middle class is paying more than it was 10 years ago. Thirty-eight percent, meanwhile, believe the wealthy are paying less than they were a decade ago.None of those impressions is accurate, however.The middle fifth of taxpayers in terms of income paid 12.8 percent in federal taxes in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, compared with 13.6 percent in 2003, 17.2 percent in 1993, and 17.5 percent in 1983 ― immediately after Reagan’s big first-term tax cuts, according to Congressional Budget Office figures.That same trend is reflected across every income group, in fact, except the richest fifth of Americans, who saw their taxes rise from 23.8 percent in 1983 to 26.3 percent in 2013 ― and that was only because of tax increases under President Barack Obama following his re-election. That group’s tax rate had been 23.9 percent in 2012.As for “loopholes” ― there are several dozen in the tax code, and they do total $1.2 trillion in lost tax revenue each year. But in reality, the 10 largest loopholes account for two-thirds of that value. And of those 10, all but two benefit middle- and lower-income families. The biggest “loophole,” for instance, worth $236 billion this year, allows employees who get health insurance through work not to pay any taxes on it. Another large one, worth $113 billion, lets homeowners enjoy the housing value of their dwellings tax-free – giving them a big advantage over landlords and tenants.“Most people don’t realize they’re there,” Williams said. “[They don’t realize] that they’re getting a benefit that’s not being taxed.”The earned income tax credit, worth $64 billion, only goes to lower-income Americans, while the child tax credit, which costs $54 billion, is unavailable to the wealthy. If these exclusions, deductions and credits were eliminated, middle- and lower-income families would see their tax bills rise substantially.And the estate tax, thanks to changes passed as part of President George W. Bush’s tax cuts in the early 2000s, now only affects inheritances worth $5.5 million or more ― meaning it was highly unlikely that the factory worker who spoke to Pence needed to worry about it.“When it’s called the death tax, it sounds really bad,” Williams said. “One in 500 deaths results in a tax. It’s obfuscation by repetition.”During that visit to a metal shop in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Pence continued that repetition, employing the “death tax” phrasing that Republicans adopted decades ago after polls and focus groups found that its use made the estate tax less popular.“Listen, the president’s tax cuts eliminate the death tax,” Pence told the Weldall employee concerned about his parents’ nest egg being taken by the estate tax. “We believe death should not be a taxable event.”Even when making the case that the tax code is too complicated ― an argument that appears to naturally resonate with many taxpayers ― Republicans are using a sales pitch that glosses over the facts.A full 68 percent of Americans, including 59 percent of Democrats, believe the tax system is too complicated, according to recent polling by HuffPost.That’s the case even though the vast majority of taxpayers ― about 70 percent ― do not itemize deductions, and instead take the “standard deduction,” which this year will be $6,350 for single filers and $12,700 for married couples. What’s more, simply reducing the number of income brackets ― which Trump, Ryan and other proponents continue to boast about ― would not actually simplify taxes for anyone, particularly with more and more taxpayers using computer software that does the arithmetic for them.Political consultant Doug Heye, a former communications director at the National Republican Committee, said he understands why the simplification argument strikes a chord.“Number one: Look at our math scores,” he said, noting that even filing a single-page 1040EZ or a two-page 1040 requires understanding a detailed packet of instructions. “You’re handed a book. And you’re expected to figure it out? That’s not simple.”The best advantage Republicans have, Heye said, is the fact that few people believe their taxes are being well spent. For that matter, few people are eager to pay taxes to begin with. “Anybody who files their taxes is upset by how much they have to pay,” he said.Trump has certainly been relying on that for months. At a recent White House event marking Hispanic Heritage Month, Trump promised “the largest tax cuts in the history of the country” ― and then asked his audience if anyone objected.“Does anybody in this room mind getting a massive tax cut?” he said.The audience responded: “No!”“Does anybody object to paying less taxes?” Trump asked, and then answered his own question. “I don’t see any hands.”The two HuffPost/YouGov polls cited each consisted of 1,000 completed interviews, one conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 2 and the other conducted Oct. 13-14. Both were conducted among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

As she relayed, from the moment she was born, Sarah’s life was shaped by inequality: She was born into poverty, with no support from her family, no access to education or health care, and no job opportunities in her rural town. As a young girl of 12, she moved to the city on her own looking for economic opportunity, where she was raped by an older man and became pregnant. Through her sheer will Sarah survived: She gave birth unattended and, with no other opportunities to provide for her child, ultimately engaged in sex work so that she and her baby daughter could survive. In Sarah’s part of town, the majority of women engage in sex work to make a living, some starting as early as age 12 or 13. They do not become sex workers because they want to; there are simply no other options to provide for themselves and their children. Sarah’s story – a story that could be told of many women in her situation – brought to life the sheer gap between us. Her circumstances meant all the cards were stacked against her from the beginning, trapping her in a cycle that gave her little hope or opportunity for more. Inequality is often framed in terms of rich or poor, of “have” and “have not.” But there is much more to the equation. Critical to understanding today’s age of inequality – and in helping to close the gap – is recognizing that inequality is layered. If you are poor, then you are also unlikely to have access to sexual and reproductive health care and, in turn, unlikely to have access to education or good jobs. This is exactly what the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) seeks to uncover in its latest annual report, Worlds Apart: Reproductive Health and Rights in an Age of Inequality. In Worlds Apart, the bottom line is that economic inequalities reflect and are reinforced by inequalities in realizing sexual and reproductive health and rights. It is a vicious cycle with compounding problems: A woman or girl whose health and rights are not fulfilled is more likely to face inequalities in education, economic stability, and health outcomes; and, a woman or girl in poverty is likely to have less access to reproductive health information and services that can help her break the pattern. Some, if not all, of the disparities she faces will be passed to her children, and her children’s children. These effects ripple out to impact not just her rights, her health, her job prospects, and her economic potential, but that of her family, her community, and her country. She is trapped in a cycle of poverty and marginalization. This is not a woman’s issue; it’s the world’s issue. According to the report, 68 countries had larger gender gaps in 2016 than in 2015 – a significant step backward as we inch closer to the 2030 deadline of the Sustainable Development Goals. The ripple effects of a healthy, empowered woman or girl tie into each and every one of the goals, which are based on a foundation of equality and inclusiveness. These goals will remain out of our reach unless we can reach those who are left the furthest behind – those for whom basic human rights are still not fulfilled. In developing countries, women in the poorest 20 percent of households may have little or no access to or information about contraception, prenatal care, safe delivery, and antenatal care. This means they are subject to unequal reproductive risks like unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, or complications before, during, and after pregnancy. For example, newborn survival is a key indicator of how much access a woman has to reproductive health care. Increased rates of neonatal mortality – or newborn death during the first 28 days of life – is a sign that a population lacks access to family planning and quality maternal care during pregnancy and at birth. The report found that while globally, newborn deaths are declining, the gap between rich and poor is increasing: An infant’s survival rate beyond its first month of life is much higher if he or she is born into a wealthy family. Addressing these disparities in girls’ and women’s health and rights is the first step in narrowing these disparities, putting us all on a path to a more equal world. It’s feasible. Take, for example, education: Worlds Apart data show that if girls in developing worlds all received secondary education, we would see a 64 percent decline in child marriage, a 59 percent decline in early births, and a 42 percent decline in the fertility rate. Imagine what this generation of girls can achieve if they are able to simply control when – or if – they have children. When I think about Sarah from my vantage point in Washington, D.C., I’m humbled by her strength and perseverance in a world that puts up barriers that I’ve never had to face. It will take collective action – and political will – to address the inequalities in sexual and reproductive health and rights that underlie all other forms of inequality. The truth of the matter is, we cannot move forward while so many are left behind.

Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Stephens was a pro-slavery advocate and a leader of an insurrection against the United States government and the American people. Yet he and his ideas continue to be honored by place names and statues. There are counties named after Stephens in Georgia and Texas, and a Stephens Historic Park in Crawfordville, Georgia with a statue of Stevens at Liberty Hall, his former home.One of the most egregious examples of honoring a racist and national traitor is a statue of Alexander Stephens in the National Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol building in Washington DC. Each state places two statutes in the hall. The Stephens statue has represented Georgia since 1927. The other Georgia honoree is Dr. Crawford W. Long, a 19th-century physician who pioneered the use ether in surgery. Congressman John Lewis of Atlanta has demanded that the Stephens statue be removed since 2015.In an open letter published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution this summer, two of his descendants urged that the statue be removed. They argued, “Confederate monuments need to come down. Put them in museums where people will learn about the context of their creation, but remove them from public spaces so that the descendants of enslaved people no longer walk beneath them at work and on campus.”Before and after the Civil War, Alexander H. Stephens served in the United States House of Representatives, from 1843 to 1859 and from 1873 until 1882, where he defended slavery and opposed citizenship rights for African Americans. He was briefly imprisoned as a traitor after the war and was also briefly Governor of Georgia before his death in 1883.The official federal Architect of the Capitol website describes Alexander Stephens as a “dedicated statesman, an effective leader, and a powerful orator, always seeking moderation and peace.” If you doubt Stephens’ bonafides as a racist and national traitor, these are selections from some of his speeches.In a March 1861 speech Stephens delivered in Savannah, Georgia, after Southern states had formed the Confederacy and just before they attacked a United States fort in Charleston Harbor, he explained the “Cornerstone” or foundational principles of the Confederate Constitution. “Its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.” Stephens proceeded to attack “anti-slavery fanatics” who “assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights with the white man.” He charged, “They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.”At the April 1861 Virginia secession convention, Stephens argued “negroes with us, under masters who care for, provide for and protect them, are better off, and enjoy more of the blessings of good government than their race does in any other part of the world.” He then declared, “the African is inferior to the white man. Subordination to the white man is his normal condition.”After the Civil War, Stephens argued it was the South that had remained loyal to the United States Constitution, not the North or the nation. He continued to defend Southern secession and slavery, claiming, “We of the South will be acquitted, not only in our own consciences, but in the judgment of mankind, of all responsibility for so terrible a catastrophe, and from all guilt of so great a crime against humanity.”In January 1874, after his return to the House of Representatives, Stephens led the opposition to passage of a civil rights bill intended to protect newly freed African Americans from White militias and the Ku Klux Klan. Stephens, who for decades had argued that Africans were inferior to whites, now claimed “my opposition to this bill springs from no prejudice, in the slightest degree, against any man, woman, or child within the limits of the United States, on account of race or color or previous condition of servitude. I entertain no feelings of that kind, and am not governed in my action here, nor elsewhere, by any influence of that sort,” but, and it is a big BUT, Stephens proclaimed “I do not hold the doctrine of the equality of races of men.” He argued the claim of equality in the Declaration of Independence was “never meant ... to convey the idea that men were created equal in all respects, either in physical, mental, or moral development.” Stephens said he accepted the notion of equality before the law, but in his view, “This requires no leveling of the population of a State” and “no equality and fraternity.”Statues and place names celebrating people like Alexander H. Stephens are just another reason to support National Football League players “taking a knee” to protest racism and racial violence in the United States today.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8 "

Only the most prolific House campaigns break the $1 million barrier in a quarter; for comparison, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) raised $956,000.Ryan, however, had a major head start. Because he began the cycle with money left over from previous cycles, Ryan has more than 10 times as much cash on hand as Bryce ($10.4 million versus just over $1 million.) Still, Bryce’s treasury is bigger than any other non-incumbent running for a House seat, excluding self-funding candidates.Ryan defends his seat against Bryce in a solidly Republican district in what is considered a non-competitive race, according to the Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voter Index.The House race is not considered one of the 81 competitive House races in the 2018 election, according to Cook Political Report. Wisconsin’s 1st District scores an “R+5” on its Partisan Voter Index, meaning the Republican presidential candidates outperformed the national average by five points in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.The number of “solid seats” for House Republicans has declined from 203 in May to 180 in October, according to Cook’s index, while the number of Republicans now in “toss up” districts has risen from two to nine. Republicans still hold a perceived edge overall, however, as 228 House seats are either safely or leaning Republican versus 192 for Democrats, according to Cook."

Whether he’s defending white supremacists, discriminating against our brave, transgender soldiers, or demonizing and deporting immigrants, Donald Trump has proven himself to be the “Divider in Chief.” For all Trump’s unpredictable tweets and un-presidential antics, division and hatred are two areas where he’s been notably consistent. His latest move is a great example. Thwarted by Congress and the American people – who stood up and fought against many zombie-like repeal-and-replace bills this summer – Trump’s latest moves on health care demonstrate that he’s set on dismantling the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with or without Congressional support. It’s critical to look beyond the president’s tweets and focus on what he does with his pen. Last week, the President signed an executive order to undermine the ACA, and, no surprise, it benefits the rich at the expense of the most vulnerable. The Trump order’s long list of damages includes gutting protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, raising health care costs for millions and sending the ACA marketplace into complete chaos – his ultimate goal all along. Then, later that same night, Trump delivered a second blow to Americans’ health care. He announced that the federal government would stop funding subsidies that help people struggling to make ends meet pay for health care. This “spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage,” as Congressional Democrats described it, would ultimately make health care more expensive (or completely unattainable) for many Americans. And that includes millions of the people who voted for the President. Among the litany of terrible directives in this executive order is a push for federal agencies to make short-term, non-ACA compliant health plans more widely available across state lines. These non-compliant plans are often called “junk insurance,” and for good reason: unlike plans under the ACA’s rules, these plans can violate every protection in the landmark health care law, from charging people different rates for the same care to denying people coverage altogether, simply because they have a pre-existing health condition, like asthma or diabetes. In addition, these plans do not have to abide by the ACA’s “essential benefits” – leaving millions of insured people without access to basic services like maternity care, mental health treatment, or prescription drugs – not to mention the millions who will not be able to afford coverage at all. Adding fuel to the fire, these reckless decisions will have a ripple effect on insurance markets across the country. As millions of healthy, young people flock to cheaper junk plans, the vast majority of Americans will find themselves facing higher premiums and out-of-pockets in the health care marketplace.For nine long months, Trump has played our differences against us like a fiddle – dividing us by race, religion, immigration status, gender and now, with a tweet and a swipe of a pen, our health. This is the most brazen attempt we’ve seen yet to sabotage the ACA and jeopardize health care for millions, pitting the interests of young, healthy people against those of older people and those with pre-existing conditions.We must not fall for this latest attempt to divide us. Just as we have come together to protest this administration’s racist immigration bans, decried the president’s implicit support of white supremacists, and remained strong in the face of his misogynist, racist and xenophobic policies, we must stand together now and fight this latest attack on our most vulnerable citizens.Dorian Warren is president of the Center for Community Change Action."

The site heralded this past season a “landmark,” concluding that the spring/summer 2018 runways were the most diverse yet, thanks to increased visibility of models of color, transgender and non-binary models and models over 50.The report found that at least two models of color appeared on every runway in New York and London (up from at least one each last season), 93 plus-size models walked the runways compared to 30 the season before and just 16 the season before that, and there was “by far the largest figure” of transgender and non-binary model appearances since the site started recording data. There were 45 transgender and 4 non-binary model appearances across 47 runways this year. In comparison, there were only 12 such castings in Fall 2017. It all sounds like a major leap of progress, but high fashion still shouldn’t really pat itself on the back that hard. While it’s refreshing to hear that every runway in two major cities featured more than one model of color, considering the fact that many runway shows feature somewhere in the ballpark of 40 models, it’s still an extremely small percentage. The report also revealed that Milan did not feature a single curve model, and four shows ― Les Copains, Comme des Garçones, Anrealage and Undercover ― featured no models of color whatsoever.Refreshingly, and contrary to what our social media feeds might have led us to believe, Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner were missing from the list of models who racked up the most runway appearances. Those honors went to 11 lesser-known models, including four models of color. It’s worth noting that this season also marked a major move toward ensuring health and safety of models involved in fashion week. Fashion conglomerates LVMH and Kering issued a charter in September 2017 that enforced guidelines surrounding size and age. It came after casting director James Scully shed light on horrific working conditions at a casting for Balenciaga. The groups pledged to work together to bring much needed change to the industry.Upward and onward, and more diversity all-around, please. "

Now, critics, journalists, and parents alike are wondering if Girls Scouts USA should follow suit and accept boys.I am an active Eagle Scout; if Girl Scouts decides to accept boys, I will be one of the first to join. There are a variety of factors that would influence my decision, but the defining factor would be that Girl Scouts could serve me ― and other boys ― well in my career and personal life.With today’s increasing emphasis on practical skills in the workplace, joining Girl Scouts could give me a vital edge in my future career. Although Boy Scouts offers an array of activities for thrill-seeking boys ― including whitewater rafting, backpacking, and rifle shooting ― these activities are largely lacking in practical benefits. On the other hand, practicality is at the core of many of the Girl Scouts’ programs, equipping young girls with useful skills to navigate and excel in their future careers.From a young age, while Boy Scouts are learning how to tie knots, the Responsible for What I Say and Do patch teaches young Girl Scouts to take up responsibilites at home, encouraging girls to babysit and help their parents with dinner.From a young age, while Boy Scouts are roughing around, Girl Scouts are given the opportunity to refine their writing skills through the Scribe badge and enhance their critical reading skills with poetry reading.And from a young age, while Boy Scouts are pitching tents, Girl Scouts learn, through the Finding Common Ground badge, how to “get to know someone different from you,” “make decisions in a group,” and “explore civil debate”—all of which are invaluable skills in this day and age.Although the practical benefits of Girl Scouts might outweigh those of Boy Scouts, this is not to say that joining Boy Scouts is a worthless endeavor. Young boys still love camping, backpacking, and pinewood derby racing, and would much prefer these activities over babysitting, writing, and civil debates. Furthermore, scouting teaches young boys invaluable leadership skills that can be transferred to and utilized in a vast array of fields and careers.Nevertheless, with today’s boys falling behind in all spheres of education, consistently scoring lower on national standardized tests, allowing boys in Girl Scouts could close this performance gap. Today’s boys could benefit from extra writing resources and conversations on important topics outside of the classroom ― both of which are offered in Girl Scouts.In the meantime, while the decision to accept boys is up to Girl Scouts USA, it’s time for Boy Scouts administrators and officials to rethink how scouting is equipping young boys to “be prepared” not only on camping trips, but also in their future careers."
68,EDUCATION,Returning To Class The Morning After A Massacre,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/returning-to-class-the-morning-after-a-massacre_us_59e1007de4b09e31db97589a,"Children are especially vulnerable to the trauma caused by acts of community violence, which is particularly noteworthy when the trauma is all-encompassing.",2017-10-16,<p>A 9-year-old boy attends a prayer vigil in honor of those affected by the shooting on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e100842000001134086ac1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alia WongClark County School District, which serves Las Vegas and surrounding cities, held classes the day after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. The attack killed 59 people at a country-music festival in the city, and injured more than 520 others.“Law enforcement has cleared us to have school today, but students & employees directly affected by the tragedy on The Strip will be excused,” the school district tweeted just before 3 a.m. Monday, less than five hours after the shooting. A subsequent tweet acknowledged that some school buses would be running late because of road closures on the Strip.Backlash was swift. In response to the district’s tweet, some complained that holding classes was insensitive; others said it was irrational. One Clark County student described the horror of not knowing whether her stepfather and mother had survived the attack. “The most terrifying thing wasn’t knowing that my stepdad had been shot; it was not knowing where they were,” she told me over the phone. She learned about the shooting around midnight, after getting a push notification on her phone. She says she couldn’t get in touch with her parents until 3 a.m. RELATED: How Schoolchildren Will Cope With Hurricane Harvey“Is this the best course of action given that no one slept and no one feels safe?” another person tweeted in response to the Clark County School District announcement. Children are especially vulnerable to the trauma caused by acts of community violence, which is particularly noteworthy when the trauma is all-encompassing: Even though Clark County’s roughly 320,000 students make it the fifth-largest school district in the country, every one of those students — and every one of its 41,000-plus employees — has in some way been affected by the carnage. The scale of the attack increases both the likelihood that any individual in Clark County has directly suffered a loss and the need for the community to grapple with what has happened.Ensuring kids feel safe is the most effective means of ameliorating that trauma, according to Joel Dvoskin, a clinical psychologist whose expertise areas include talking to children about tragedy. And while every case is different, Dvoskin and other experts tend to agree that school is often the place best-equipped to do that.RELATED: How Florida’s Schools Are Welcoming Puerto Ricans“I think schools represent, for the majority of children, a very safe and secure and stable environment,” said Robin Gurwitch, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who has conducted extensive research on methods for supporting children in the aftermath of trauma and disasters. “They’re also a place many parents turn to for information.” Jane Webber, a disaster-response crisis counselor in New Jersey and lecturer in the counselor-education department at Kean University, described schools as “an anchor for [students and families] in times of need.”This rationale perhaps explains why many school districts in cities affected by mass shootings in the past resumed classes almost immediately after the given event. Schools were back in session the day after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, for example, which left 14 people dead and another 22 injured. Orlando-area public schools stuck to their original schedule of starting summer-school classes on June 14, just two days after the Pulse Nightclub massacre left 49 people dead and another 58 injured. Schools in Newtown, Connecticut, reopened one weekday after 20 children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. “The longer you keep them out, the harder it is,” one Newtown parent told The Wall Street Journal.“Our goal was to provide our students with as much normalcy as possible,” said Melinda Malone, a spokeswoman for Clark County schools. “Giving students the opportunity to be around their teachers and classmates where they could express themselves and where they feel comfortable is what some of our students needed.” Approximately 88 percent of the district’s students attended classes on Monday, compared to an average of about 93 percent, according to Malone; any absences that day were excused.RELATED: Learning While Homeless“For kids to be home alone or watching TV over and over again with the news media on — that’s not a healthy thing,” Webber said. According to Webber, although adults are often tempted to treat a mass shooting like a mental-health catastrophe, that framing often reinforces rather than mitigates the trauma in part because it feeds into the emotional disarray. Resuming classes as quickly as possible “is the safest and best way to get children back on their feet,” she said. “It helps them to return to some stability even though things are chaotic all around, to bring them a sense of normalcy and remind them that life isn’t falling apart, that things aren’t turned upside-down. … Kids respond to structure.” Routine distractions such as art class or recess or P.E. can be especially helpful. After all, as Webber pointed out, “not much happens in your frontal cortex when you’re upset and confused — kids couldn’t add or subtract today even if they wanted to.”What’s more, schools typically have staff who are trained in evidence-based practices to help children cope with and process a traumatic event and who are familiar with the range of emotions kids can feel following a horrific and confusing event, from rage to despair to paralysis. Young children, according to Webber, tend to blame themselves for what happened, particularly if they misinterpret negative messages from an adult in their life who’s likewise struggling to cope with his or her emotions; teenagers typically either explode with anger or retreat into denial. Trained counselors know how to navigate that emotional mayhem, how to target support at those most affected by the violence, how to be empathetic without overdoing it. They know how, as Dvoskin put it, to “be honest without flooding them with too much information.” They know how to deliver what experts often call “psychological first aid.”Schools are also the gathering places for a host of caring adults whose familiarity with a given child’s life often rivals that of his or her immediate family members — coaches, custodians, lunchroom servers, and school-bus drivers, to name a few. “They’re the ones who know the kids best” and can provide their own form of psychological first aid, Webber said.Of course, attending school can hurt rather than help. If the adults in a school feel unfit to provide the assurances children need, that unease will show and only amplify kids’ distress. “To the extent that adults in the [school] environment need time to care for themselves, to recover, to position themselves so they can truly convince kids that schools are normal and safe, that we’re here and we’re going to take care of you, the school should take a little bit of time” before resuming classes, said Stephen Brock, a psychology professor at California State University, Sacramento, who authored a crisis prevention and response curriculum and has conducted trainings with Clark County School District psychologists.A school can also aggravate children’s trauma if it mishandles its response by, for example, sending mixed messages to students (which can erode kids’ trust in adults) or convening them in a large assembly to talk about the event rather than doing that classroom by classroom (which can create more chaos). And a classroom that goes overboard with its return-to-normalcy campaign — by, say, giving kids an algebra quiz on Tuesday or penalizing a student who can’t pay attention — will only exacerbate the stress and anxiety that accompany an event such as Sunday night’s massacre.These caveats are real risks. School districts have made significant strides in their ability to respond to crisis, namely after a rash of school shootings in recent decades and the September 11 terrorist attacks. But devising a crisis response that’s appropriate for all children in a school district as diverse as Clark County — for children dealing with immense amounts of toxic stress as well as children who will all but forget the event in a matter of weeks — is complicated. And Gurwitch stressed that, generally speaking, school districts haven’t done an adequate job of ensuring teachers are trained in what to say and do when children ask difficult questions or express certain concerns. Such skills are especially critical because those questions and concerns will emerge at unpredictable moments and likely stretch over the course of the school year.“The consequences of community trauma are not necessarily immediate and sometimes continue for months and even years,” Dvoskin said. “When we talk about post-traumatic stress disorder, the key word there is post. ... This event is going to affect Las Vegas for a long time.”Isabel Fattal contributed research.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Death at a Penn State Fraternity, Google X and the Science of Radical Creativity"
69,BUSINESS,Ian Schrager: The Private & Public Confessions,"Dustin Fitzharris, ContributorJournalist in New York",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ian-schrager-the-private-public-confessions_us_59e4d104e4b003f928d5e8a1,"Ian Schrager's trendy office in New York's Greenwich Village is bustling with activity on a humid, late September morning",2017-10-16,<p>Ian Schrager: “I still crave the next challenge.”</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e4d1691500002600da1a15.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ian Schrager's trendy office in New York's Greenwich Village is bustling with activity on a humid, late September morning. The phone rings non-stop. Meetings run overtime. And construction outside his office building puts an enthusiastic environment on edge. Interestingly, Schrager, the entrepreneur who conceived and co-owned Studio 54 in the '70s and then redefined the hotel industry in the '80s, appears relaxed. Dressed in jeans and a gray henley with Adidas, Schrager looks youthful and is filled with more energy than half the men his age. At 71, Schrager is still driven to create. He says his constant need for reassurance that he is doing a good job keeps him striving for perfection. ""I still crave the next challenge,"" Schrager says. ""It's not the financial reward that drives me. I think, 'What's the next thing I can do to blow everybody away?' Entertainers on stage love the adulation. For me, it's very personal and very private."" Schrager's current challenge is Public, a hotel in New York's Lower East Side that opened in June. Schrager calls Public the most important idea he has ever had and says it may be the best hotel he's ever done. With rooms at an affordable rate--starting at $150 a night--Schrager says with Public he wants to create a one-of-a-kind experience that lifts spirits and makes hearts beat faster. ""I want people to feel they are part of something special in Public,"" Schrager says. ""Luxury before was for a small group of people. You don't have to be rich to have a luxury experience."" If anyone knows how to create an experience, it's Schrager. Growing up in Brooklyn, Schrager went on to study law at Syracuse University because, as he says, he really didn't know what he wanted to do. In the early 1970s, Schrager became fascinated by the nightclub business after seeing people waiting in lines to get into clubs. ""That was a fascinating time in New York. Everybody was going out. Nobody had anything to lose. It wasn't dominated by a bunch of wealthy, Wall Street guys. It was a different city,"" Schrager says. In 1977, Schrager and his best friend and business partner, Steve Rubell, opened the famed Studio 54 in New York City. It was one of the biggest, most-celebrated nightclubs of all time. For all who stepped through the now mythical velvet rope, an adult playground waited. On any given night, Studio 54 attracted entertainment A-listers including Andy Warhol, Liza Minnelli, Truman Capote, and Diana Ross. In the pre-AIDS era, inhibitions ran wild as clubgoers partied the night away. Forty years later, the legend of Studio 54 remains at the forefront of pop culture, and Schrager's memories are still as vivid as a disco ball.""It was the human ideal of having complete freedom,"" Schrager says. ""I think when you went to Studio at night, it was the closest you could come to having complete freedom. You felt protected. Everyone was experimenting. That idea of complete freedom is something we all dream about."" In 1980, freedom ended for Schrager and Rubell when they were sent to prison for tax evasion. Embarrassed by how it all ended, Schrager says for the longest time Studio 54 was something he wanted to bury. Schrager says only after being pardoned by President Obama this past January, has he been able to have closure. Embracing and reclaiming his legacy, Schrager recently released a book on Studio 54 with a slew of photographs and personal stories.After serving 13 months in federal prison, Schrager and Rubell turned their attention to the hotel industry. In 1984 they opened Morgans, introducing the concept of the boutique hotel. By the late 1980s, the duo was the largest private hotelier in New York. But for Rubell the party once again came to end. In 1989, at 45 years old, Rubell died of AIDS. Rubell's death was one more heartbreak for Schrager. At 20 years old, he lost his father to cancer. When he was 25, his mother died of a heart attack. Through each tragedy, Schrager picked himself up and pressed on. ""If you lose enthusiasm, you lose it all,"" Schrager says. Schrager's thirst for life remains intact. He says he has a good marriage and calls his five children, ranging in ages from 7 to 22 years old, his proudest achievement. Schrager says he doesn't expect his children to follow in his footsteps, but he does insist they work hard. ""They have to contribute,"" says Schrager. ""They don't have to be motivated by money, but they have to make some kind of contribution or they won't enjoy life.""As Schrager sits in his office with photographs from his past and present surrounding him, he reflects on what he'd say to his 30-year-old self who opened Studio 54.""I would say, enjoy the success more. It's been a wild ride. It's taken me down a lot of unknown paths,"" Schrager says. ""There is no destination. It's just a trip. Make sure you enjoy it.""

That’s according to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who said Saturday the government hopes repairs will bring back electricity to 95 percent of the island by Dec. 15.The government’s timeline for fixing the grid calls for 30 percent of the island to be electrified by the end of October, 50 percent by mid-November, and 80 percent by Dec. 1. As of Friday, only 17 percent of Puerto Rico had power.“This is an aggressive agenda, but we cannot be sort of passive in the face of Puerto Rico’s challenges,” Rosselló said. “We are going to need all hands on deck.” The governor added he wanted to set quantifiable goals “so that our people can have clear and established metrics.”Vital services like water purification, hospitals, and communication networks rely on a steady power supply, explaining why the Federal Emergency Management Agency has made repairing the power grid its No. 1 priority.The official death toll from last month’s back-to-back hurricanes ticked up to 48 over the weekend, after three people suffered medical emergencies and were unable to access medical care. And as Vox reports, the real death toll is likely far higher, potentially in the hundreds.“The day-to-day can unravel in an instant,” Julie McNamara, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told HuffPost last month, referring to Puerto Rico’s loss of power. She noted other basic services, like sewage treatment and food preservation, become impossible without electricity, as do more modern needs like credit cards, ATMs, and the internet. For the time being, generators are powering much of the island’s critical infrastructure, making fuel shortages a matter of life and death. A number of solar power providers have rushed to aid the island, including Tesla, which wants to prove solar can be a long-term solution there."

Lack of food is the greatest threat to international peace and stability.Fighting hunger must be a top priority for government leaders and the public on World Food Day and beyond.Today there are four nations (Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia) threatened by famine because of war. Around 20 million people are at risk of starvation. The hunger crisis goes even further.Countless other nations, including Syria and Iraq, are also facing severe hunger emergencies because of conflict. These nations need peace and disarmament, and food to bolster any agreement that ends the fighting. The U.S. Famine Warning System says this year that 45 nations need emergency food assistance.Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan and the Boko Haram affected areas of Africa have high hunger rates which contribute to the desperation and chaos that allows terrorism to thrive there.The impact of climate change has caused drought and other disasters, forcing people to migrate. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization is emphasizing the need to create economic opportunities for those left displaced and hungry by the effects of poverty and climate change.What we are seeing today is the worst hunger crisis since the WWII era.It was 70 years ago this month that President Harry Truman addressed the nation on the hunger threat facing Europe. Even after the fighting had stopped, hunger continued to threaten the war-torn nations. As former Secretary of State George Marshall said, “Hunger and insecurity are the worst enemies of peace.” America had to help.The public responded first by starting the Friendship Train, which traveled coast to coast in 1947 collecting food donations for Europe. At holiday meals a “silent guest” was given a place at the table leading to donations of food packages to the hungry overseas.The World Food Program USA and Kindworks, D.C.-area charities, are bringing back the Silent Guest fundraiser for this year because of the severity of the famine threat.World Food Day should inspire us to support agriculture, the key to ending world hunger. Sean Callahan, the CEO of Catholic Relief Services, explains:We’ve seen that investments in agriculture are paying off. The farmers we work with around the world don’t want a handout. They want a hand-up. Through simple solutions, we can give them the jumpstart they need to feed their families and, eventually, their communities.Small children in developing countries desperately need food because hunger in the first 1,000 days of life can cause lasting physical and mental damage, or death. The world must ensure every infant has access to basic nutrition so they have a chance for life.School age children must have access to food and education. A global school lunch program should remain the goal of the United States through the USDA’s McGovern-Dole program. As UN World Food Program director David Beasley said after a recent McGovern-Dole donation:School meals are a powerful incentive for families to send their children to school and for countries to build a better future through education.But many more children could be fed. The Congress should expand McGovern-Dole and other food aid programs when making the federal budget. It is imperative that Congress increase food aid funding especially when hunger threatens so many nations.During World War II, President Roosevelt stated the four freedoms necessary for true world peace, including freedom from want. We still have many people that need liberation from hunger. They should be the focus of this World Food Day.Actions you take can make a difference in feeding the hungry at home and abroad on World Food Day."

To celebrate her 4th birthday earlier this month, Amelia had a party with a “Guardians of the Galaxy” cake. Her mother, Terri Healey, told HuffPost that she received not one, but two Star-Lord (Pratt’s character) dolls. Terri’s best friend also gave Amelia a miniature cutout of Pratt. “We weren’t sure she’d put it all together but as soon as she saw it she said, ‘It’s Star-Lord! I love it!’” Terri said. Terri isn’t sure why Amelia took to Pratt so quickly, but the 4-year-old loves his roles as Star-Lord in “Guardians of the Galaxy,” Owen in “Jurassic World” and Emmet in “The Lego Movie.”“Her practicality in the matter is the best part,” Terri told HuffPost. “‘He’s just cool,’ is all she will say.”Amelia has since taken her mini actor friend to the bus stop to pick up her brothers, to the park and to go birthday shopping. “If she wants Star-Lord to go, he goes,” Terri joked. Pratt has also found fans in other members of Amelia’s family. The actor is known to visit kids in children’s hospitals and raise money to help them and their families.

The producer is one of the most thanked people in Oscar history, but despite financing and distributing the movie, Winslet refused to add his name to her long list of thank yous ― 19 in total ― due to her negative experience working with him.“That was deliberate. That was absolutely deliberate,” Winslet told The Los Angeles Times in an interview on Saturday, while promoting her upcoming Woody Allen movie, “Wonder Wheel.” “I remember being told, ‘Make sure you thank Harvey if you win.’ And I remember turning around and saying, ‘No, I won’t. No, I won’t,’” she continued. “And it was nothing to do with not being grateful. If people aren’t well-behaved, why would I thank him?”After dozens of women accused the producer of sexual harassment and assault, Weinstein was fired from his company and expelled from the Academy earlier this month. While he denies that any of sexual encounters weren’t consensual, damning reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker paint a picture of a serial abuser who exerted undue power over women for personal gain since the 1980s.“The fact that I’m never going to have to deal with Harvey Weinstein again as long as I live is one of the best things that’s ever happened, and I’m sure the feeling is universal,” Winslet said. “For my whole career, Harvey Weinstein, whenever I’ve bumped into him, he’d grab my arm and say, ‘Don’t forget who gave you your first movie.’ Like I owe him everything,” she continued. “Then later, with ‘The Reader,’ same thing, ‘I’m gonna get you that Oscar nomination, I’m gonna get you a win, I’m gonna win for you.’”Winslet stressed that her objections to Weinstein, at the time, were based solely on her dealings with him as a businessman.“He was bullying and nasty. Going on a business level, he was always very, very hard to deal with ― he was rude,” she said. “He used to call my female agent a [vulgar name for a woman] every time he spoke to her on the telephone.”Weinstein routinely interfered with production on “The Reader,” clashing with director Stephen Daldry over the shooting and editing schedule. The producer apparently pulled the plug on the project with no warning four days before the film was intended to wrap . “I can’t even begin to describe the disgraceful behavior that went on — and I’m actually not going to because it’s a can of worms that I’m not prepared to publicly open — nothing to do with sexual harassment, thankfully, lucky me,” Winslet explained. “My god. I somehow dodged that bullet.”“And again, this is just on the business side of things, but he was always, always very, very, very unpleasant to deal with. Very,” she clarified. While Winslet certainly didn’t mince words in regards to Weinstein, she has taken a softer stance about working with another alleged abuser, director Woody Allen. The actress never collaborated with Weinstein again after “The Reader,” but says she can separate the art from the artist when it comes to Allen, who stands accused of sexually abusing his adopted daughter.“Of course one thinks about it. But at the same time, I didn’t know Woody and I don’t know anything about that family,” Winslet told The New York Times in a September interview. “As the actor in the film, you just have to step away and say, I don’t know anything, really, and whether any of it is true or false. Having thought it all through, you put it to one side and just work with the person. Woody Allen is an incredible director. So is Roman Polanski. I had an extraordinary working experience with both of those men, and that’s the truth.”To read Winslet’s full interview on Weinstein and “Wonder Wheel,” head over to The Los Angeles Times. "

Jones now has $1 million cash on hand, according to the third-quarter total that was provided to HuffPost. “These fundraising numbers are the latest proof that our campaign is continuing to gain incredible momentum with grassroots support from throughout the state of Alabama,” said Sebastian Kitchen, communications director for the Jones campaign. “Alabamians know that Doug cares about kitchen table issues that are important to them and know he will stand up for hardworking families in the Senate.”More than 22,000 people have donated to the campaign since Jones jumped into the race in May, and more than 3,500 people have signed up to volunteer. As a U.S. attorney in 2002, Jones was the lead prosecutor in the case against two of the men responsible for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.He’s running against Republican Roy Moore in the Dec. 12 special election to replace Jeff Sessions, who vacated the seat when he became President Donald Trump’s attorney general. Moore defeated Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who had the backing of the GOP establishment ― including Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). It was a bruising primary, and the Senate Leadership Fund ― a super PAC that is backed by McConnell ― has said it currently has no plans to step in to help Moore defeat Jones. On the Democratic side, Jones has so far not received any financial backing from the Democratic National Committee or the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, although the groups have sent out fundraising appeals on his behalf.He is attracting attention, though ― partly because of his compelling biography, but also because he is running against Moore. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ rights organization, recently endorsed Jones. Former Vice President Joe Biden also went to Alabama and held a rally for him.There are concerns about whether Jones actually has a shot at beating Moore in the red state ― and whether national support will help or hurt him amongst voters who may be looking for someone without strong establishment ties. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore told state probate judges to ignore the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling declaring marriage equality the law of the land. He recently referred to people of color as “reds and yellows,” and once said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) should not be able to serve in Congress because he’s Muslim. Moore’s campaign did not return a request for comment on his fundraising numbers.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."

They couldn’t use brooms or “apparate” to the Cluetts, but they offered the next best thing: The Jacobite steam train, the real-life vehicle that was used to depict the Hogwarts Express in the “Harry Potter” films, would make an unscheduled stop to pick up the family.“The policeman said, ‘We’ve arranged for the next train passing to stop for you, and you’re not going to believe this but it’s the Hogwarts Express steam train. Your kids are going to love it,’” Cluett told The Associated Press on Sunday, adding that his kids — aged between 6 and 12 ― are all fans of the franchise.Cluett said he was still “slightly sad” that he lost his boat, but the train ride was just the ticket to lift his kids’ spirits. “When they saw the steam train coming, all sadness left their little faces and was replaced by excitement and fun,” he told the BBC."

Connick went on to star in shows including “Will & Grace” and movies (“P.S. I Love You”) before officially joining the judging panel on “American Idol” in 2013. After “Idol” ended ― no, he won’t be back for the new reboot ― Connick kicked off his weekday talk show, “Harry,” which is still on the air today. But all of this success doesn’t come easy, and the singer, actor and host credits a lot of his work to his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. Although he now lives in Connecticut, Connick says New Orleans not only helped shape him as a musician, but made him the person he is today. Below, Connick Jr. chats with HuffPost about his experience growing up in New Orleans, the effect it’s had on him, and why those currently dealing with hurricane damage should stay hopeful in the wake of devastation. Both your parents were lawyers in New Orleans, correct?They were both in private practice until, I guess, the early ’70s, when my dad [Harry Connick Sr.] ran for public office. He ran for district attorney and was DA from 1974 on. And then my mother [Anita Livingston], she continued on in private practice until the late ’70s when she became a judge.What kind of childhood was that for you, having parents in the legal profession and growing up in New Orleans?Oh, it was a great. A pretty normal childhood other than the fact that my dad, especially, was well-known in New Orleans, so people would recognize him on the street and say hi. We’d be at the grocery store and he would talk to people, so it was sort of being in the public eye by the time I was a kid, but New Orleans is such an amazing place and to be able to grow up there with such great parents was really fantastic.Do you have a favorite memory, or perhaps a first memory, of growing up in New Orleans?I was really interested in music, you know, so my parents also loved music. The cool thing about New Orleans is it’s a residential city, but it also has amazing spots to go hear music, eat great food, and stuff like that. So I remember going to hear incredible music from the time I was really young, and I started playing with bands, sitting in with them, when I was 6 or 7 years old. Those are some of my earliest memories and some of my finest ones.Do you think your music career was sparked by the jazz culture of New Orleans? Would you have pursued music if you didn’t grow up there?I probably would’ve pursued music only because I love it so much — I think that’s something you’re born with. But the type of music I play and the direction from which I approach music is definitely highly influenced by New Orleans, and I’m sure I wouldn’t be the person I am and musician I am had I not been from there, so I’m greatly indebted to the city.What are some of the music clubs or spots you went to or performed in that really inspired you and your style of music?Well back in the day, we used to go to a place called Tradition Hall. That’s no longer there, but that was a traditional jazz club. There was a place called Maple on Bourbon, another traditional jazz club. Mahogany Hall, Crazy Shirley’s, lots of clubs in the French Quarter that played traditional jazz, and that was the first kind of music I played. And as I got a little bit older, there were some clubs like Tyler’s and Snug Harbor and lots of places where we would play more modern-form jazz, funk music, rock ’n’ roll — we’d play just about everything. It was an amazing town to grow up in if you’re interested in music.Was there a certain person or fellow musician you met along the way in New Orleans who really helped you craft your performances or inspire you?There are too many to mention, but the two that stand out are Ellis Marsalis, he’s still down there, he’s 82 now. He was my teacher but also just had an amazing impact on me and the way I play. And there was another fella, James Booker, who died when he was very young back in 1983, and he was a really good friend and just a phenomenal musician. And both of those guys are probably my biggest influences, musically. What are your favorite spots that you have to go to every time you’re in New Orleans?Nowadays when I go home, I’m really not home for that long so the first place I go is my dad’s house because there’s always something great to eat there and if we’re not eating at his house, we’ll go out to eat. In terms of, like, music spots, I might go to Tipitina’s, but normally I don’t really go out much anymore. I’m usually spending time with my family. I have a ton of cousins down there and we’ll usually go out to eat rather than go to hear music.What are some of the meals you’ll eat at your dad’s house or some of the food you crave when you’re back home?My dad makes a great gumbo, he makes a great seafood gumbo. And just normal stuff ― scrambled eggs and grits, just regular food. Sometimes we’ll have a crawfish boil, which is a nice way to unwind and celebrate with people. But it’s all kind of basic New Orleans food — it just tastes great and it’s fun to just hang with my dad and my friends and family down there.How have you taught your daughters [Charlotte, Sarah Kate, Georgia Tatum] about New Orleans and the culture which you grew up in?They’re not technically from New Orleans, but they might as well be. They’ve been down with me so many times — dozens and dozens of times. If you added up all the days, they’ve probably spent a couple of years down there. They’re very familiar with the culture and the food, they have many, many close relatives there that they stay in contact with. Over the years, I used to take them to different places that I used to go to and neighborhoods that I grew up in, and it’s as much a part of their life as you can hope for. They’re very, very involved in New Orleans.We’ve seen a lot of devastation with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and of course New Orleans was hit badly by Katrina in 2005. How has the city changed since the hurricane, and what do you hope goes on in devastated areas after the recent storms?In some ways, New Orleans — it’s a tricky thing to say out of context, but — we benefited from Katrina. It was horrible devastation and we lost many lives, and this is not to undermine that, but what it did was get a dialogue started about not only protecting our city, which I still think we can always do more of, but just how we value our heritage and the people who make up our city. Houston has been so badly devastated and it’s impossible when you’re in the throes of that to believe it will come back. But it will come back and it will come back stronger and better. People come together in times like this, and I’m sending all my prayers to those folks — it’s a horrendous nightmare to have to endure, but they’re going to get through it just like we did.Did Katrina bring New Orleans together? Or is there something else about the city that represents unity?In New Orleans, it’s all community. I mean, [the hurricane saw] people depending on each other to get through because that’s about all we had in the beginning. I have a project called The Musicians’ Village, which was done by me, Branford Marsalis and New Orleans Habitat for Humanity― raising money, volunteering and people giving very charitable contributions ― and now we have 80 houses and a state-of-the-art recording facility and community center right in the middle of the 9th Ward, which was the badly devastated part. That was done purely by community and we continue to do it based on the generosity of others. So, people like J.J. Watt who are doing amazing things — Houston is going to be fine and as much as the government is helping from what I see and read — I’m not privy to any inside information — all of that is in tandem with the incredible contributions being made by the citizens of our country and across the world.Why or how do you think New Orleans defines America?When you look at what America is, it’s a country full of immigrants. If you take exception to the Native Americans, everybody who lives here came here from somewhere else. What makes America unique is that it’s kind of the antithesis of the homogeneous society and, as great as some homogeneous societies are, there’s nothing that can replace a multicultural society. And New Orleans is probably the strongest example of that. The influences from Europe, from Africa, from the Caribbean, all blend together to form a culture that is like no other in the United States. If you think about all these great states and places and then you look at New Orleans, you realize, “What’s going on here?” I mean the music is completely different, the food is completely different, the people are completely different, and I say unquestionably — now they have some unique cities in this country, New York, the history is unbelievable, and San Francisco — but there’s nothing like New Orleans. I’d say, arguably, it’s the most unique city in the United States, for lots of reasons, and it’s a place I’m really proud to be from.CORRECTION: HuffPost previously referenced Branford Marsalis as Brandon.
