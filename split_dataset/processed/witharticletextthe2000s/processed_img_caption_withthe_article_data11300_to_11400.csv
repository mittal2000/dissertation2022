Bush fielded questions just three days after the Supreme Court settled the disputed 2000 election.Barack Obama, similarly, met the press three days after his 2008 triumph. But Donald Trump, who has already gone 35 days without holding a press conference as president-elect, tweeted Monday night that he was postponing one he scheduled for Thursday to address the unprecedented conflicts of interest due to his sprawling business.For instance, Trump could violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution on the first day of his presidency if receiving payments from foreign governments. And though Trump tweeted Monday that his two sons would run the company, he has yet to adequately explain in detail how the company will be structured in a way that avoids conflicts. He didn’t go into specifics in his series of three tweets, writing “Busy times!” Nine hours later, the president-elect met with Kanye West. Trump told reporters during a Tuesday morning photo-op that the two reality TV stars had “discussed life.” He then headed back upstairs at Trump Tower. The president-elect next travels Tuesday night to another scrutiny-free zone. He’ll visit West Allis, Wisconsin, for the first of four more “thank you” rallies being held over five days. Trump, who only sporadically reads presidential intelligence briefings, has been holding post-election rallies featuring similar riffs and grievances uttered during 2016 election events. But as the president-elect gets public adoration from fans, the American people remain in the dark about his global business ties and how ― even if ― they’ll be unraveled before he takes office. Trump has not held a press conference since July: At that event he expressed hope that Russia’s intelligence services had hacked Hillary Clinton’s emails and would release them. The president-elect’s current unwillingness now to face scrutiny follows a familiar pattern in which Trump promises to reveal details about his business dealings only to keep dodging. When previously considering a presidential run, Trump suggested in 2011 he’d release his tax returns when Obama released his birth certificate. But even after the president did so, Trump still refused.Trump vowed in February 2015 to release his tax returns if he ran for president, before running through a series of excuses after getting in the race. Trump eventually claimed he wouldn’t release them because he was being audited, though there’s no law preventing him from doing so. In the end, he ran out the clock on the election and set a new precedent for secrecy among major party nominees. He also promised more transparency when it came to his family, only to renege. In August, Trump said his Slovenian-born wife, Melania, would participate in a press conference to answer questions about her immigration status. It never happened. Trump has done a few interviews since being elected president, including this past week on Fox News Sunday. He sat down last month with editors, reporters and columnists at the New York Times and called into the “Today” show last week after being named Time’s “Person of the Year.”But Trump hasn’t held a press conference for four-and-a-half months, a remarkable stretch considering he, his campaign team and the Republican National Committee blasted former challenge Hillary Clinton for failing to do the same. Since winning the presidency, news organizations have stepped up investigating Trump’s often opaque business dealings and raised serious questions ahead of the Dec. 19 Electoral College vote. Trump indicated he would answer such questions before then. On Nov. 30, he announced on Twitter that he would be “holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”The president-elect may have less of an incentive to meet the press given that the news media breathlessly, and too often uncritically, amplifies his claims on Twitter ― even when they have no basis in fact. Trump’s tweeted claim about severing business ties in “in total” quickly garnered headlines, even as he then punted on questions for two weeks ― and now, until the “near future.”  He’s also managed to distract the press by bringing stars through the Trump Tower lobby, holding meetings which on their face have nothing to do with how he’ll govern. Trump met with former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leo DiCaprio, two notable advocates for the environment, yet tapped climate change denier Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump now faces questions over picking Rex Tillerson, the chief of executive of Exxon Mobil who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Secretary of State. The decision comes days after The Washington Post reported that the CIA concluded Russia intervened in the U.S. election through hacking in an attempt to help Trump win.And while the country’s future top diplomat’s ties deserve media scrutiny, West provides a strategic distraction.He is a major cultural figure and meeting with the president-elect is worth reporting, though not at the expense of more consequential stories. On Tuesday morning, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC showed footage of the pair, with one anchor clearly exasperated by covering the spectacle. “No time for press conferences. No time to talk about what’s happening in Syria. But time for a photo-op and a hug-it-out with Yeezy,” said MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle. “We’re not even going to comment on this. We have to move on because that is crazy town.”"

The remainder of the excise tax goes to the state’s public school fund, while a handful of other marijuana sales tax proceeds are directed to substance abuse treatment and prevention, law enforcement and health care programs.Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) is hoping to spend some of the funds in 2017 and 2018 on an “aggressive” campaign to help curb homelessness in the state.“We spend more than twice as much ... perpetuating lives of misery by letting people live under bridges than we would getting them into housing and giving them wrap-around services ― by which I mean, job training at the top of the list, counseling for addictions and medications for mental health,” Hickenlooper told The Denver Post of the initiative late last month.Industry experts told The Denver Post’s Cannabist blog they’re projecting $1.3 billion in sales for the year. With that amount, the total economic impact in the state for legal marijuana sales would surpass $3 billion. "

Trump is expected to name Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for the top diplomatic post.Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor, had met with Trump multiple times in recent weeks, fueling speculation that he was among the final contenders for the top diplomatic post.Romney was a fierce critic of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, calling him a “phony” and a “fraud.” Since Trump’s win, Romney has sought to smooth relations with the president-elect, eventually making his way onto the shortlist for secretary of State. The two dined together in November at Trump’s hotel in New York, after which Romney praised Trump, saying he could “lead us to that better future.”"
4,WOMEN,"Carly Fiorina's Ability To Overlook Donald Trump’s Sexism Is Pretty Normal, Actually",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carly-fiorina-trump-sexism_us_58504e4ee4b04c8e2bb24cae,It’s how women have gotten along at work for forever.,2016-12-13,"Former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina speaks with Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 12, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585052141800002d00e426d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In meeting with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday, Carly Fiorina did what women with jobs ― particularly those of her generation ― have always done: She put aside the blatant, offensive sexism of the guy in charge and tried to move ahead.Of course, she got the kind of criticism that women with jobs ― especially those high up the chain ― typically receive. Not only was the former GOP presidential candidate and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard called out for backtracking on her strong criticism of Trump before he was elected, but she was also criticized for betraying all women.At first glance, it’s easy to feel betrayed by Fiorina, who reportedly met with Trump on Monday to interview for the role of director of national intelligence. After all, she gave us a pitch-perfect moment of female empowerment early in the primary season last year, one of the rare times a woman directly confronted Trump over his demeaning and objectifying comments. Remember? Fiorina was asked during a GOP primary debate if she had read or heard about the nasty remarks Trump had made to Rolling Stone about her looks. (“Look at that face!...Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!”) Fiorina was poised. Ice. “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,” she said, garnering the loudest applause of the evening, The Huffington Post’s Scott Conroy wrote at the time.Trump tried to backtrack by calling her a “beautiful woman.” But he looked the fool. “Fiorina’s face remained steely, and the moment belonged to her,” Conroy wrote.So yes, it was deflating to read Fiorina’s statement about this week’s meeting with Trump (“groveling” for a job is how some put it) ― just the latest moment of horror for women in this country who are reminded daily that the president-elect doesn’t regard them with respect. (One example: Keeping at least three men who have been accused of assaulting women by his side.)But if you consider Fiorina’s long career as a woman in the male-dominated corporate world and her history of sidestepping her gender in politics, this all makes perfect, sad, sense.The 62-year-old, one of just a few women to rise to CEO of a Fortune 500 company, knows all about the sexism and harassment endemic to the workplace. In her recent book on women leaders, Wall Street Journal reporter Joann Lublin describes how one of Fiorina’s colleagues repeatedly made sexual advances toward her after a long day of work on a business trip when she was just starting out as a salesperson at AT&T. Fiorina rebuffed the guy ― who was higher up on the chain than she ― and returned to her hotel room, only to field calls from him throughout the night. He “was angrier every time,” Fiorina writes in her memoir. She didn’t sue. Fiorina told another male colleague about the behavior and later excluded her harasser from a new project she was working on. By today’s standards, maybe her reaction seems insufficient. But it’s inarguable that Fiorina won over the long term, eventually ascending to the top at Hewlett-Packard. (Ultimately, she’d be forced out after dismal financial results.)There was also the time Fiorina forged ahead with a client meeting her colleague had set up ― at a strip club. It turns out her male coworkers were so embarrassed by the experience, they stopped scheduling business meetings in strip clubs, Vox reports.In the corporate world where Fiorina comes from, you have to ignore and rise above if you want to move up. And that was particularly true when she was starting out in her career decades ago. You had to meet clients in horrid places. You had to ignore the leers from the boss ― or, god forbid, the groping. You had to walk past pornographic images on cubicle walls. You had to stay at the office while they went golfing. Or stay home when they went on men-only weekend outings. You had to look perfect ― not too buttoned-up, not too slutty ― while they put on the same old uniforms every day. You had to be better than all that.The Wall Street Journal’s Lublin also describes her own life in the paper’s newsroom as one of its first, few female reporters: A male coworker asked her to make coffee, her male colleagues stood up when she walked into a meeting in a moment of hostile chivalry, her boss kissed her full on the mouth when her internship was over.“I fled the office,” Lublin writes in her book, Earning It. She repressed the memory for years and kept moving ahead. She’s now a revered journalist who is still nailing down huge scoops for the paper.None of this was fair. Certainly, things have gotten slightly better. But the alternative was, you quit. Complaining to human resources or speaking up in traditional ways didn’t always do much good.When Megyn Kelly was just starting out at Fox News, the big boss, chairman and CEO Roger Ailes, repeatedly hit on her. Finally, Kelly complained to her supervisor, she writes in her new memoir, Settle for More. He told her Roger wasn’t a bad guy and advised her to just ignore it, Kelly says. The advice, infuriating as it was, worked. Ailes stopped. “Most women I know have had to do this dance with a male superior at some point ― trying to reject inappropriate behavior while also trying to avoid explicitly calling him out,” Kelly writes.In a radio interview earlier this month, Kelly told NPR’s Terry Gross she had little power at the time to do more. Ailes ran the company. He was in charge of the human resources department. What could she do? If she had taken legal action, it might have effectively ended her career.It was only more than a decade later, when she had made a success out of herself, that Kelly felt like she could come out publicly with her story. The balance of power had shifted. Thanks to her and many of her female colleagues, Ailes was done harassing women at his company. Fox fired him.“Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that. Times are changing for women in this country. We’re putting up with less. Standing up for ourselves more. And making strides some never thought possible,” she writes.Back to Fiorina. She is hardly the first person to backtrack on criticism of the president-elect and prostrate themselves before him. But complicating Fiorina’s reversal is her gender. To some, she isn’t merely sucking up to Trump like, say, Mitt Romney. Fiorina must also shoulder the burden of representing all women while she does it.Here’s Wall Street Journal editorial columnist Brett Stephens, who in one tweet manages to call out Fiorina for betraying all women and setting a bad examples for “young women everywhere.”Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway was quick to call out Stephens’ tweet as sexist. That kind of criticism is pretty hard to take from a woman who has helped probably the most vile and misogynistic presidential candidate in recent memory advance to the Oval Office. She also seems to question Stephens’ right to even make this comment, which is equally upsetting. But the thing is, Conway isn’t wrong about the sexism part.When Romney met with Trump, was he setting a bad example for all the young men of the world? No one said that, Danielle Decoursey writes at ATTN:Consider why. Instead of seeing Fiorina’s meeting with Trump as a betrayal to all women and girls, let’s look at it for what it is: A career move by someone interested in advancing herself and succeeding in the field she’s been trying to move ahead in for years. A person who has, for decades, had to deal with powerful men and their covert and overt sexism.And, crucially, Fiorina is a politician who has never really made much of her gender.As a Republican candidate for president, Fiorina didn’t back the kinds of policies that are typically seen as critical women’s issues. She was against a federal paid parental leave policy, for example, claiming that companies could step in and fill the void. For years, Fiorina has tried to distance herself from the fact that she’s a woman. Many women who rise through the ranks do this. They’ll downplay their gender as a meaningful part of their identity, instead explaining how hard they’ve worked to achieve success. This reporter has asked more than a few successful women how they made it in a man’s world, and they say it just wasn’t a thing. They were too busy working. It’s part denial and part suppression; sexism is a heavy load, and sometimes you just don’t want to bear it."

Charity Buzz, the Trump transition team and the Eric Trump Foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Huffington Post. The “meet and greet” on a mutually agreeable date next year at either Trump Tower in Manhattan or the Trump International Hotel in Washington will last up to 45 minutes, according to a description on Charitybuzz, which values the auction at $50,000.The winning bid is good for two people, who must pass criminal background checks and be approved by the Secret Service. They’re also expected to “conduct themselves appropriately” with “polite manners” and “respect,” the description says. Proceeds will go to the Eric Trump Foundation, run by Ivanka’s brother, which supports St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.As of Monday, bidding had reached $23,000. The auction closes Dec. 20. The auction appears to veer perilously close to the same kind of situation President-elect Donald Trump claimed existed at the Clinton Foundation. Trump lashed the foundation during his campaign, arguing that it was a way the wealthy could curry favor with Hillary Clinton through “pay to play” contributions while she was secretary of state. In Ivanka Trump’s case, the winning bidders could curry favor with a daughter who has the ear of a president-elect — and is active herself in his incoming administration.The Charitybuzz listing describes Ivanka Trump’s business experience, including her work as vice president of her father’s Trump International company, and notes that husband Jared Kushner is a real estate developer and owner of the New York Observer newspaper. It’s no secret that Trump hopes to bring the couple into his administration — providing lawyers can figure a way to avoid breaching anti-nepotism and conflict-of-interest laws. Ivanka Trump, her husband, and her brothers Eric and Donald Jr. are already serving on the president-elect’s transition team. Ivanka Trump also has been at her father’s side at meetings with political leaders, including one with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month in Trump Tower at the same time she was awaiting a lucrative licensing deal with the Japanese apparel giant Sanei International, The New York Times reported. The meeting sparked controversy from critics concerned about the Trump family’s blurring of lines between politics and business interests.Ivanka Trump has been quick to cash in on her White House connections. After an interview with her father in November on “60 Minutes” her jewelry company sent out a press release hawking a $10,800 bracelet she wore on camera. A company spokesman later apologized, blaming the move on a “well-intentioned marketing employee.”H/T Vanity Fair"

9,THE WORLDPOST,Iran To Work On Nuclear-Powered Vessels After U.S. 'Violation' Of Deal,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-to-build-nuclear-powered-vessels_us_58506eaae4b0e411bfd42b28,A marine nuclear propulsion program would likely take decades to realize.,2016-12-13,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani takes part in a news conference near the United Nations General Assembly in the Manhattan borough of New York, U.S., September 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58506ff91800002d00e4274e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Iran ordered its scientists on Tuesday to start developing systems for nuclear-powered marine vessels in response to what it calls a U.S. violation of its landmark 2015 atomic deal with world powers.Nuclear experts said that President Hassan Rouhani’s move, if carried out, would probably require Iran to enrich uranium to a fissile purity above the maximum level set in the nuclear deal to allay fears of Tehran building an atomic bomb.Rouhani’s announcement marked Tehran’s first concrete reaction to a decision by the U.S. Congress last month to extend some sanctions on Tehran that would also make it easier to reimpose others lifted under the nuclear pact.The White House said it was aware of Iran’s order and noted that Rouhani had said any such work on the vessels would be done within the framework of Iran’s commitments.“The announcement from the Iranians today does not run counter to the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a news briefing.U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the United States was confident the International Atomic Energy Agency, which inspects Iran’s nuclear sites, would be able to analyze Iran’s compliance with the deal.“There’s a lot we don’t know about it, what it means,” Kirby said, referring to Rouhani’s announcement, at a news briefing on Tuesday. A marine nuclear propulsion program is a “massive undertaking for any nation” and would likely take decades to realize, he added.Rouhani described the technology as a “nuclear propeller to be used in marine transportation,” but did not say whether that meant just ships or possibly also submarines. Iran said in 2012 that it was working on its first nuclear-powered sub. Rouhani’s words could stoke tensions with Washington, already heightened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s vow to scrap the deal, under which Iran curbed its nuclear fuel production activities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.Rouhani also ordered planning for production of fuel for nuclear-powered marine vessels “in line with the development of a peaceful nuclear program of Iran.”But under the nuclear settlement Iran reached with the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, it is not allowed to enrich uranium above a 3.67 percent purity for 15 years, a level unlikely to be enough to run such vessels.“On the basis of international experience, were Iran to go ahead with such a (nuclear propulsion) project, it would have to increase its enrichment level,” said Mark Hibbs, nuclear expert and senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.CIVILIAN VERSUS MILITARY ENRICHMENT“That’s the point, because Iran would be looking for a non-weapons rationale to provocatively increase its enrichment level in the case that the deal with the powers comes unstuck.”He pointed out that countries with more advanced navies and nuclear programs have been working on propulsion reactors for decades. Such technology might need uranium enriched to around 20 percent purity.A Russian Foreign Ministry source told RIA news agency that a careful reading of Rouhani’s order showed he was talking only about developing power-supply units for nuclear-powered marine vessels, but not higher-enriched uranium itself, so “strictly speaking” this would not contravene the nuclear deal.But the source acknowledged that such vessels typically ran on higher-enriched uranium prohibited by the accord.Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said developing a reactor suited for higher-grade nuclear vessel fuel would take at least a decade.“(But) these are unfortunate developments. We are very concerned about the future of the (nuclear deal) under the Trump administration and any signs of erosion ... must be taken very seriously and immediately addressed by the international community,” Lyman told Reuters.Rouhani accused the United States in a letter published by state news agency IRNA of not fully meeting its commitments under the nuclear deal.“With regard to recent (U.S. congressional) legislation to extend the Iran Sanctions Act ... I order the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to ... plan the design and construction of a nuclear propeller to be used in marine transportation.”Members of the U.S. Congress have said the extension of the bill does not violate the nuclear deal that was struck last year to assuage Western fears that Iran was working to develop a nuclear bomb. The act, Congress added, only gave Washington the power to reimpose sanctions on Iran if it violated the pact.Washington says it has lifted all the sanctions it needs to under the July 2015 deal between major powers and Iran.Rouhani’s move followed recent remarks by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his hardline allies harshly criticizing the deal’s failure to yield any swift economic improvements in Iran. Khamenei said last month the U.S. Congress’s prolongation of some sanctions was a clear breach and the Islamic Republic would “definitely react to it.”There was no immediate comment from the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s nuclear program.(Additional reporting by Alexander Winning in Moscow, Parisa Hafezi in Ankara, Ayesha Rascoe, Timothy Gardner and Yeganeh Torbati in Washington; Editing by Andrew Hay and Richard Chang)"
10,POLITICS,Here's What's At Stake For The Russia Sanctions Under President Donald Trump,Mollie Reilly and Paige Lavender,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-sanctions-donald-trump_us_58503829e4b04c8e2bb221b7,Both the president-elect and his pick for secretary of state have expressed skepticism about the sanctions.,2016-12-13,Russian President Vladimir Putin and Exxon Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson in 2012.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_4_1815_851%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, has expressed skepticism over the United States’ sanctions against Russia, as his company stands to reap enormous profits if they are lifted. As secretary of state, Tillerson would play a major role in shaping the United States’ relationship with Russia going forward, and deciding whether to lift the sanctions put in place in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Lifting the sanctions would give Russia more economic power.Tillerson, who has run the world’s largest oil company since 2006, questioned the efficacy of sanctions multiple times since they were imposed by President Barack Obama’s administration nearly three years ago. According to The New York Times, Tillerson said in 2014 that his company “generally” does not support economic sanctions “because we don’t find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensibly, and that’s a very hard thing to do.” On a separate occasion, he said the company was looking forward to the sanctions being lifted. And as Bloomberg notes, he also made many visits to the White House as the sanctions were being imposed and reportedly questioned whether the restrictions would give Exxon Mobil’s European competitors an advantage over U.S.-based companies. Exxon Mobil has a huge interest in ending the sanctions, which put a halt to lucrative projects in the country ― the company has claimed the sanctions cost it up to $1 billion in revenue. In the meantime, Exxon Mobil and Tillerson have maintained strong ties with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. The company has already said it plans to return to its drilling project in the Russian Arctic once the sanctions are lifted. Tillerson was a major driver of that relationship, rising up through the Exxon ranks by overseeing the company’s Russian business interests. He’s personally negotiated deals with Putin and in 2013 was awarded Russia’s Order of Friendship award. On Monday, the Kremlin praised Trump for selecting Tillerson to lead the State Department, noting the executive “carries out his duties in a highly professional way.” Tillerson also has a personal stake in Exxon’s success. According to The New York Times, Tillerson owns $218 million in Exxon Mobil stock.Several lawmakers have expressed concern over Tillerson’s ties to Russia, calling for them to be a focal point in his Senate confirmation process. Despite Tillerson’s past pushback, the likely elimination of the sanctions against Russia won’t fall solely on him. It’s the Treasury Department that ultimately administers and enforces sanctions.Trump has expressed skepticism over the sanctions in the past, saying in July he “would be looking into” lifting the sanctions and recognizing Crimea as a Russian territory. Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, said Tuesday that the president-elect would not commit to keeping the sanctions in place.“Here’s what I would tell you: If you are going to have sanctions in place, they need to be enforced. That I can tell you for sure is something he believes in, and as far as where that product goes next, you have to just wait and see,” Priebus said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”The Associated Press noted earlier this month that Russia views Trump as a gateway to eased sanctions. Putin has repeatedly praised Trump, something Trump took heat for ― but brushed off ― throughout the general election.“If [Putin] says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him,” Trump said at an NBC forum in November. “I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, ‘Oh, isn’t that a terrible thing’ ― the man has very strong control over a country.”After investigating Russia’s involvement in the U.S. presidential election, American intelligence agencies concluded with “high confidence” the country interfered to bolster Trump’s chances of winning against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reports that U.S. intelligence officials concluded Russia hacked both Democratic and Republican Party systems prior to the election but were selective in what they leaked to the public, keeping the GOP information private while leaking the Democratic documents to WikiLeaks.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed anger over the findings, with several calling for an investigation into Russia’s actions. Mike Morell, the former acting director of the CIA, called Russia’s interference “the political equivalent of 9/11.”Trump said Sunday it’s “ridiculous” to think Russia intervened in the election.“I think it’s just another excuse,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. “I don’t believe it.”This post has been updated with information on Tillerson’s Exxon Mobil stock."

Trump",Sam Stein and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitt-romney-humiliated_us_585041d5e4b04c8e2bb23a4d,"“Mitt Romney is somebody I had respect for,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid says. ""I have none anymore.”",2016-12-13,Donald Trump after meeting with Mitt Romney on Nov. 19.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Barack Obama first decided that Hillary Clinton would make an able secretary of state, his own aides were caught off guard. David Axelrod, the president’s longtime adviser, wrote that he was “stunned” by the decision, since Obama and Clinton had had such an acrimonious primary fight. But Obama was deadly serious about having Clinton at Foggy Bottom. He’d concluded as much before asking her for a formal meeting to discuss the idea, Axelrod said. And when that meeting took place and an offer was made, it was Clinton who balked, saying she felt too exhausted from the past year. “I would characterize his conversation with her as more of an effort to recruit her than anything else,” recalled Tommy Vietor, Obama’s former communications hand, who did press for the transition in 2008.Eight years later, a very different type of courtship has taken place between a president-elect and a former political rival turned potential secretary of state.Over the past few weeks, Donald Trump made a spectacle of his consideration of Mitt Romney for the role of America’s chief diplomat. The two met at Trump’s golf course and dined over frog legs. Trump professed his admiration for his erstwhile critic, while aides trashed the idea of a political marriage between the two. On Tuesday morning, “The Apprentice: Foggy Bottom Edition” culminated in Trump announcing that he was passing over Romney for the post, choosing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson instead.The episode showed a managerial style very different than anything Obama exhibited. Where Obama was deliberate and decisive when dealing with his former foe, his successor has been theatrical, cunning and far more callous. In dispensing with Romney the way he did, Trump defanged a potential critic. He also humiliated him in the eyes of some peers. That was the conclusion Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) reached in an interview with The Huffington Post, shortly before the Tillerson nomination was made official. Reid argued that Romney, who’d called Trump a fraud during the presidential campaign, had lost any ability to criticize the soon-to-be-president by eagerly offering himself up for the secretary of state gig.“This is a man who came out big-time against Trump. Oh, the things he said about Trump. Well, that’s great, that’s wonderful,” Reid said. “Either he wasn’t telling the truth, or he’s a person with no character. After having said that, to go and do homage to this guy he said awful things about, I don’t think that shows much character.”“Mitt Romney is somebody I had respect for,” Reid said, in a somewhat dubious assertion. “I have none anymore.”It’s not just Reid. After the Tillerson news broke on Monday night, others in the Republican Party argued that a political blindsiding had just occurred, courtesy of the president-elect.And while the Trump team offered cordial, diplomatic niceties for Romney, a step removed from that orbit, the president-elect’s confidants were gloating about a former rival’s diminishment. Roger Stone, speaking to the conspiracy-theory outlet InfoWars, said that Trump had only been toying with the 2012 GOP nominee, and that he was more interested in retribution than in staffing a foreign policy team.“Donald Trump was interviewing Mitt Romney for secretary of State in order to torture him,” Stone said. “And given the history, that’s completely understandable.”Romney’s defenders have framed his decision to offer himself up for the secretary of state position as an act of patriotism. The same defenders say Reid is simply being petty. In a statement to HuffPost, Romney expressed no regret for changing his approach to a president-elect he once called a con artist. “I was indeed very critical of Mr. Trump during his campaign. But now he has been elected president and accordingly, if I could have helped shape foreign policy to protect the country I love, I would have been more than willing to do so,” Romney said through a spokesperson. “As for Mr. Reid, I lost respect for him when he repeatedly lied about my taxes and later admitted to it cheerily. Good riddance, Mr. Reid. The Senate will be better served without you in it.”As Romney noted, he and Reid have a fraught history, with the senator once infamously accusing Romney of not having paid taxes for 10 years.But it stood to reason that next to Trump’s other options for secretary of state, Reid might have found Romney the most capable of the bunch. HuffPost put that question to Reid during our interview. He replied that by showing a willingness to work for a man he so thoroughly criticized, Romney had proved himself incapable for the task of secretary of state. “I wouldn’t want someone who has the character that Mitt Romney is showing,” Reid said.Want more updates from Sam Stein?

12,GREEN,Santa's Shrinking Reindeer Blamed On Arctic Climate Change,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/smaller-reindeer-global-warming_us_584f4fa4e4b0bd9c3dfe70cd,"Animals starve when rain, not snow, falls and lichen becomes encased in ice, researchers discover.",2016-12-13,"Reindeer are starving and could face a mass die-off amid global warming, scientists warn.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584f6854120000dd00eeef47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Climate change is so powerfully affecting reindeer habitat that the animals are shrinking from hunger, scientists have discovered.Over the past 20 years, reindeer in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, north of the Arctic Circle, have grown smaller and lighter, researchers found. The reindeers’ average weight dropped by 12 percent — from 121 pounds for animals born in 1994 to just 106 pounds for those born in 2010, according to a study.That change may not seem like very much, “but given how important body weight is to reproduction and survival, it’s potentially huge,” lead researcher Steve Albon of Scotland’s James Hutton Institute told AFP news agency.Albon quipped to The Telegraph in London that Santa Claus might need twice as many reindeer now to pull his sleigh, but climate changes are presenting a dire situation for the animals, he warned. He attributes the animals’ decline to the effects of warming on their food supply. It’s not only rapidly shrinking animals he worries about but also the potential for a mass die-off.“The implications are that there may well be more smaller reindeer in the Arctic in the coming decades, but possibly at risk of catastrophic die-offs because of increased ice on the ground,” said Albon, who presented the research findings Monday at the annual meeting of the British Ecological Society in Liverpool.With warmer summers, more grass and lichen are growing in Svalbard, which is good for the animals because females then gain more weight and conceive more calves, according to Albon. But as the warmth stretches into the winter, rainfall begins to freeze in solid, impenetrable sheets on the ground, blocking access to the lichen and moss below, he says. Reindeer can reach food through snow, but it’s nearly impossible to reach it through ice.The ice problem was linked to the deaths of 61,000 reindeer in 2013 and 20,000 in 2006 in Siberia. As pregnant females lose weight in Svalbard because of the ice, they give birth to smaller, weaker calves or abort.A complicating factor is that more food in the summer sustains larger numbers of animals, so then there is more competition for the dwindling winter stores, the researchers found.

John Kasich (R) signed a 20-week abortion ban into law on Tuesday, making the state the 18th to do so. At the same time, the governor vetoed a bill that would have banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy― before many women even realize they’re pregnant. Nicknamed the “heartbeat bill,” it would have threatened doctors with up to a year in jail if they performed an abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat. The law would have been the most extreme anti-abortion restriction in the country.Ohio’s Republican-controlled House and Senate passed both the six-week ban and the 20-week ban last week. Kasich, who strongly opposes abortion rights despite his reputation as a moderate, was expected to sign the 20-week ban.The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade protects a woman’s right to have an abortion up until the fetus is viable outside the womb, around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Fewer than 1 percent of abortions occur after 20 weeks, and most women who make the decision at that point have discovered a severe fetal anomaly or health issue that had not been detected earlier in the pregnancy.Kasich said the heartbeat bill was “clearly contrary” to current Supreme Court rulings, and that the 20-week ban is “the best, most legally sound and sustainable approach to protecting the sanctity of human life.”But abortion rights advocates are more concerned about the 20-week bans than the six-week ban, because the latter has no chance of standing up in court, while the former could actually be a vehicle to overturn Roe.Reproductive rights supporters have been fiercely protesting the Ohio abortion restrictions, attaching coat hangers to the fence of the Statehouse to remind lawmakers of a time before abortion was legal when women resorted to dangerous measures to end their pregnancies.Dawn Laguens, a spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the 20-week ban is “just another shameful attempt by John Kasich to make abortion illegal.”“Kasich is on a mission to make abortion illegal in Ohio, and he’s intent on using smoke and mirrors and backdoor politics to do it,” she said. “He may hope that by vetoing a six-week ban – which would have virtually banned abortion with almost no exceptions – he comes off as moderate. But Ohio women see right through this and reject this extreme agenda. The 20-week ban will force women to travel long distances and cross state lines in order to access safe, legal abortion –– a barrier that many women simply cannot afford.”"

The actor responded to critics who called the film one of the most political in the franchise, saying that people might be “projecting” the current tumultuous political climate on the film. But according to the actor, who’s also known for his role as Nasir Khan in HBO miniseries “The Night Of,” all the hype surrounding the movie proves one important point.“So many different people, so many different backgrounds are invested in it in a time when things can get very divided and divisive right now ... but man everyone loves a Star Wars movie!” he said of the movie in the interview. “And there’s something kind of beautiful about that. So few things seem to bring us all together these days and I feel privileged to feel a part of that.” Talk surrounding the film’s possible use of political themes recently generated buzz after conservative Twitter user Jack Posobiec called for a boycott of the film. He claimed the writers said there would be anti-Trump scenes in the movie ― a statement that a representative for Disney said was completely untrue. Ahmed, who also discussed a piece he wrote for The Guardian about being an actor of Pakistani descent, went on to address the film’s diversity in the interview. This “Star Wars” film has been praised for having the most multicultural cast the franchise has ever had. And the actor explained that the “The Rogue One” is the type of movie where the characters’ identities aren’t dominated by their cultural backgrounds. “You’re playing a character where sometimes it touches on their background and sometimes it really doesn’t,” he said. “You’re just a guy ― not a cypher for well-trodden social issues associated with that type.We don’t know about you, but we’re pretty damn psyched to see this.

My dad is a coach. All four of us kids played three sports a year. So it was a way for me to kind of stay connected to my family and my youth and the way I grew up.What has presented the most significant challenge for you?The hardest part for me is I just had no clue how many voices I would hear.

Just how difficult can it be?I think I decided really early on, and this is not an absolute truth by any means, but this is what I decided for myself: I wanted to do what I could to look my best (whatever my most beautiful self is) without projecting a sexual self.

I still get people all the time ― I had an interaction at “GameDay” this week with a college student just yelling the most absurd, vulgar things. I turn around and I’m like, ‘What do I have to do?’ I am a married mother, there’s no way you have a picture of me in your room. For some people that’s just not possible.

How did you navigate your way into television, and how your internship at ESPN helped shape your career.ABC and ESPN were merging ― I was 18 living in New York City by myself, and I ended up getting an internship doing the college football studio show. At the time it was Craig James, Doug Flutie and John Saunders and so I was kind of their research assistant/intern, and I stayed on for three years. Craig James basically told me like, “Hey, you want to work in this industry, just stick around as long as you can and stay with us, soak it all up.” And so I did. I basically spent those first three years of college just hanging out with those guys and learning what I could. From there, they helped me make a demo tape on the ABC desk so everything looked super official even though I had no clue what I was doing. Then I sent that out and I got a job, covering sideline for basketball and football at Liberty because all their games were broadcast on (a local) sports network so it was this crazy opportunity to still be in school and have your games air on cable. And then after doing that for that last year of college, I got a call from an agent who reached out to the dean of communications at Liberty and wanted me to come out to LA and interview at Fox and then I started at Fox before I was even done at school.

18,HEALTHY LIVING,Pets Can Be Life-Changing For People Living With Severe Mental Illness,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pets-mental-illness_us_584ed2cbe4b0bd9c3dfdac7a,Many with long-term illnesses say pets are among their closest relationships.,2016-12-13,"Pets are an important source of emotional support for many people with serious mental illness, a new study finds. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584edad5120000dd00eeed77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Living with mental illness can be lonely. More than half of people with serious psychiatric conditions say they feel isolated, struggling with an impaired ability to make friends, a lack of opportunities to socialize, and a stigma against mental illness.Through the ups and downs of life with a mental health condition, pets offer a powerful form of connection and support. Many people living with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder say that owning pets, more than anything else, has helped them to manage their condition, according to new research. The study participants spoke in emotional terms about their relationships with dogs, cats, birds, guinea pigs and other animal companions. “When I’m feeling really low they are wonderful because they won’t leave my side for two days,” one participant, an owner of two dogs and two cats, said of his pets. “I will get up and I will let them out to the toilet and I will feed them, but I am straight back in bed ... and then they’ll just come straight back up and just stay with me until I’m ready to come out of it.”University of Manchester psychiatrists who conducted the investigation found that pets often fulfilled a function similar to that of a close human relationship. “We know that social isolation is both a cause and effect of mental illness,” Dr. Helen Brooks, a research fellow at the university and the study’s lead author, told The Huffington Post. “People in this study told us that relationships often broke down because friends and family did not understand their condition, or that they did not feel motivated or able to socialize with others because of their condition.”The study, published Dec. 9 in the journal BMC Psychiatry, looked at 54 adults living with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, all of whom had at least one pet. Around half of the participants said that they considered their pets a part of their social network.The participants answered questions about how they spent their days, where they turned for emotional support, and how they managed their mental illness. They were also asked to create “network diagrams” mapping the support structures in their everyday lives. Of those who included a pet in their social network, 60 percent placed their pet in the most important circle of that network, also commonly occupied by family members and social workers.One participant placed his 10 pet birds in the inner circle of his diagram (pictured below), along with his psychiatric nurse and social worker. Most people reported either having difficult relationships with friends and family, or having a limited social network outside of their pets. In these cases, pets provided an important source of emotional connection and companionship, taking on a function similar to that of a human relationship. “I feel that the pets ... depend on me and also I have daily contact with them,” the man with the 10 birds said. “They also give me a sense of well-being, which I don’t get from [anyone else] because most of these interactions with my Mum, Dad, [friend], are all by telephone rather than physical contact, and that’s the big difference is the empathetic physical presence.”Beyond proving emotional support and companionship, taking care of a pet was often described as instilling a sense of routine and feelings of self-efficacy. Some pet owners also said that their animal companions offered a welcome distraction from their most uncomfortable symptoms. The man with the birds said that when he was hearing voices, focusing on the birds’ singing could help him get through it. Another participant said his two cats helped him get through the most difficult moments of his illness. “When you just want to sink into a pit and just sort of retreat from the entire world, the cats force me to sort of still be involved with the world,” he said. These heartfelt testimonies suggest that pets should be taken seriously by mental health care providers as a low-risk treatment option that could truly change the lives of those suffering in silence.

Sometimes referred to as the ""Third Pole,"" the area has the third largest concentration of ice after the polar regions.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584e63161c00002f000eb07f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The glaciers of western Tibet have been stable for thousands of years. But climate change is now threatening that status quo.Two enormous ice avalanches ripped through the area in the summer, forever transforming the landscape. Global warming likely triggered the icefalls, new research suggests.Once unheard of, such disasters could become more frequent in the region, scientists warn.On July 17, more than 60 million cubic meters (or 24,000 Olympic swimming pools) of ice and rock broke off without warning from a glacier in Tibet’s Aru Mountains and hurtled down into a valley below. Within minutes, the avalanche had buried an area of almost four square miles in debris up to 100 feet deep. Nine herders were killed, along with hundreds of sheep and yaks. Satellite imagery offers a glimpse into the magnitude of the disaster. This NASA image shows the Aru range before the avalanche: This image shows the aftermath:Glacial collapses of this size are extremely rare. The July incident was the second largest ice avalanche ever recorded, only eclipsed by the collapse of the Kolka Glacier in the Caucasus in 2002.“This is new territory scientifically,” Andreas Kääb, a glaciologist at the University of Oslo, told NASA Earth Observatory in September. “It is unknown why an entire glacier tongue would shear off like this. We would not have thought this was even possible before Kolka happened.”Western Tibet has also long been considered a stable glacial region. Unlike southern and eastern Tibet where glaciers have been melting at an accelerating pace, the region had seemed relatively unscathed by warming temperatures. But then a second, similarly “massive” avalanche that hit a neighboring glacier on the same mountain range two months later. There were no reported injuries in that snowslide, but the occurrence shocked scientists and locals alike. That “one such event should occur is remarkable; two is unprecedented,” wrote geoscientist Dave Petley in an October blog post.Petley opined at the time that climate change was likely the culprit behind the two icefalls. Tibet is “warming rapidly,” he wrote. The country is heating up at an average of 0.4 degrees Celsius a decade ― double the global average, according to the Guardian.A paper published last week in the Journal of Glaciology supports Petley’s claim. Baffled by the sheer speed and enormity of the two avalanches, a group of international scientists used computer models and satellite data to figure out a possible cause.Something had lubricated the ice to make it fall so rapidly, they discovered. The most likely trigger was meltwater, formed by the melting of a glacier’s snow and ice. “Given the rate at which the event occurred and the area covered, I think it could only happen in the presence of meltwater,” said co-author Lonnie Thompson, a professor of Earth Sciences at Ohio State University.The origin of the meltwater in the Aru range is as yet unknown, but Thompson said the cause is clear.“[G]iven that the average temperature at the nearest weather station has risen by about 1.5 degrees Celsius [2.7 degrees Fahrenheit] over the last 50 years, it makes sense that snow and ice are melting and the resulting water is seeping down beneath the glacier,” he said. With temperatures continuing to rise, other glaciers in western Tibet may also be vulnerable to collapse. “If the climate warming in the region is the primary cause of the Aru Glacier collapse, then it will not be the last one,” the researchers wrote. There is currently no way to predict such disasters. This is bad news for the Tibetan plateau as a whole. The so-called “roof of the world,” which encompasses most of Tibet and parts of China and India, is home to the largest volume of frozen fresh water outside the polar regions. As the source of several major rivers, including the Yangtze, Mekong and Indus, it supplies water to nearly 2 billion people in Asia, VOA News reports. Scientists in China have warned that climate change is a severe threat to the Tibetan Plateau. The plateau’s glaciers are melting at a rate of 7 percent every year. If this melting trend continues, two-thirds of the glaciers on the plateau will disappear by 2050. "
20,POLITICS,How A Single Typo Led To The Unraveling Of Hillary Clinton's Campaign,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-typo_us_58505fe4e4b0e411bfd415e2,An obvious phishing scam and a hasty email allowed hackers into campaign chair John Podesta's inbox.,2016-12-13,A staffer's typo led to the hacking of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's emails.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585067401800002c00e4272e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the worst and most public email hacks in political history began with a typo, a report in The New York Times revealed on Tuesday.An aide to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, saw a warning email in his inbox back in March, claiming to be from Google. Podesta needed to change his Gmail password immediately, the email said.Most adult internet users know by now never to click a link in emails like this ― phishing is fairly common. Even unsophisticated tech types are hip to the scam. So, before responding, Podesta’s aide showed the email to another staffer, a computer technician.And, well, what happens next should be a lesson to anyone who types and sends emails and texts without reading them first. (That’s everybody who emails and texts.) From the Times (bolding is HuffPost’s):“This is a legitimate email,” Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, replied to another of Mr. Podesta’s aides, who had noticed the alert. “John needs to change his password immediately.”The email hack was a huge distraction at the end of the presidential campaign, serving as fodder for Republican attacks and diverting the attention of key players on Clinton’s team. The Podesta email hack was separate from an equally damaging attack on the Democratic National Committee.(There was some upside: Like getting a peek at Podesta’s risotto recipe. And seeing what an honest badass Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden is.)Any journalist who’s ever accidentally published a story on pubic policy (sorry) knows that typos can be cruel. But this was beyond that, obviously. “Most consequential typo in human history?” Sahil Kapur asked on Twitter.Others wondered if this was just someone crying typo instead of owning what is likely the biggest mistake of a career. If he had meant to type “an illegitimate” email, why did he get the article wrong and write “a legitimate” email, one Twitter conspiracy theorist wondered. Others argued it’s odd that Delevan would advise Podesta to change his password, since the phishing email was obviously bogus. Still, the advice seems reasonable. If you’re the chair of a U.S. presidential campaign and discover you’re the target of hackers, it seems perfectly rational to immediately change your password. The attackers, after all, could be pursuing multiple ways into your account. And the “illegitimate email” line could have been confused by the Times’ phrasing. Delevan could’ve meant to write this is a “legitimate attack.”Also, he included the correct Gmail address to change a password. If Podesta or his aide had used that, no harm no fowl foul."

Regulators revealed a huge scam involving sham accounts earlier this year, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Tuesday that the bank now faces sanctions for failing to show it could go out of business in an orderly way. As a result, Wells Fargo is banned from creating new international bank operations or acquiring non-banks until it shows regulators it can be unwound safely. This is the first time that a bank has faced penalties under the post-economic crisis system, which was set up to ensure that banks can fail without needing government bailouts.The punishment comes after regulators rejected the living wills of Wells Fargo and four other big U.S. bank in April. The banks all submitted their proposals, but only Wells failed to pass despite being given a second try. The bank has to submit a new plan by the end of March to avoid additional sanctions.The regulatory decision was made jointly by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. In their statement informing Wells Fargo that it had failed the living will process, they say the bank failed to address concerns that it was too complex and failed to lay out clear actions the company could take to simplify its organization and best structure itself so it wouldn’t need a bailout if it fails.Just three months ago, Wells Fargo was forced to pay $185 million for scamming customers by opening up more than 1.5 million sham checking accounts and applying for 565,000 credit cards using customers’ names and accounts. CEO John Stumpf was publicly filleted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and later resigned under intense pressure.Wells Fargo said Tuesday evening in a release that it “is committed to strengthening and enhancing its resolution planning processes.” The bank said it believes it can resolve the problems with its living will on its third try.This article has been updated with a statement from Wells Fargo."

Last week, Kristin Hensley ― who co-hosts a web series about motherhood called #IMOMSOHARD ― shared a little Santa trick on Facebook. The trick is simple: Hensley changed her sister Megan’s name in her phone to “Santa Claus,” and when her kids misbehave, she sends voice-to-text messages to report their antics to the North Pole. Hensley told The Huffington Post she came up with the idea when her two children ― 5-year-old Finn and 3-year-old Eleanor ― were screaming and acting out during bath time. The mom proceeded to change her sister’s contact name to Santa Claus and spoke into her iPhone, “Siri, Text Santa Claus.”When the kids heard Siri ask, “What would you like to say to Santa Claus,” they both stopped misbehaving and listened intently. “Eleanor is not being very friendly and is screaming in the bathtub please take note and remove any necessary toys you feel is appropriate for her actions,” the mom said. Hensley said her sister understood what was going on. She replied, “Please tell Eleanor and Finn that I will give them a second chance. They should be nice and listen to mommy.”The trick was a success, so Hensley decided to share it with the #IMOMSOHARD audience on Facebook. Her post received over 20,000 likes.The Santa Claus-Siri contact hack is “highly effective,” Hensley told HuffPost, adding, “Santa is the single greatest piece of leverage parents have all year round.”“Some might argue this is manipulation,” the mom continued. “They are correct. Just the other day my 5-year-old told me I was boring so I ‘showed him’ by taking him to a trampoline park. As you can see, it’s a level playing field,” she joked. Hensley said the response to her post has affirmed the child-rearing adage, “it takes a village.” Many parents have shared their own holiday hacks in the comments.“We have learned several tips from our awesome tribe of parents ― like, sometimes the Elf on the Shelf shows up with a cast on his leg and a letter stating ‘due to an unfortunate accident while making toys Elf will not move from spot to spot this year but will keep tabs on your behavior for Santa,’” Hensley said, adding that she also learned about an app that plays voicemails from Santa to inspire kids to behave. “But one of my favorites is a mom who convinced her son that Santa watches security footage from all of the toy stores, and if you lift one up and say ‘This one Santa!’, he will put it on his list but you can’t buy it now because he wants to bring it to your house,” Hensley continued. “Parents are ninjas.”Visit #IMOMSOHARD for more humorous parenting ideas from Hensley, her co-host Jen Smedley and their village."

But at the end of the day, there is a polish in silhouette that makes it work for the office. With footwear, in particular, my chosen pair any given day is rarely arbitrary and I’ve accumulated a large working arsenal of Adidas sneakers (mostly white), boots, and slides that satisfy my minimalist tendencies.So when I first reported the incoming Crocs trend that emerged on Christopher Kane’s stellar spring 2017 runway, I greeted the look with some ill feelings. Talk about clashing with my clean-and-simple outlook! But on the other hand, the seamless way Kane interpreted them paired with his exceptional wears led me to believe incorporating them into my own wardrobe wouldn’t be as difficult as I’d imagined. And let’s face it, I love a good fashion challenge. So, for the sake of research, I decided to test drive the trend for a week at Glamour, where I’m associate fashion writer.Obviously, I reached for the good old rubber Crocs, as Kane did for his show, along with Birkenstock’s clog-like version that Collina Strada designer Hillary Taymour used for her spring 2017 presentation. The look? Think what Heidi would wear while yodeling on a hill circa athleisure-centric 2017, but on acid. When crafting a week’s worth of outfits, I decided that the only pant shape really complements the shoe is my pair of vintage Levi’s cropped wide-leg jeans (also very 2017). This way, I’d show plenty of ankle and have plenty of volume in the leg to offset the round shape of the shoe. I’d explain further, but what transpired really needs to be seen to be believed. In many ways, I felt more chic than ever — and in others, I felt like a dumpster fire.As you can imagine, I got a lot of side glances, shady up-downs, snickers. A kid on the street even a pointed and laughed. Those reactions would cause anyone to second guess their decision to pull such an irreverent style move, but it only fueled my (dumpster) fire even further. When it comes to fashion, if people look at you like you’re doing something wrong, you’re probably doing it so right. Just after my face-off with that kid, I passed by a fellow editor friend from Teen Vogue who praised my footwear choice. In my eyes, I was nailing the ugly-pretty trend that Christopher Kane and Hillary from Collina Strada were getting at — the same one Demna Gvsalia has perfected to an artform for Balenciaga and his own streetwear label, Vetements. Come spring, I think I’ll likely swap out my monochromatic slides for some jazzy Crocs as my easy-chic shoe. Some may call it gauche, but I call it grand.More from Glamour:What’s That Salad the Kardashians Are Always Eating on Their Show?Ryan Reynolds Reveals He Fell in Love With Blake Lively While on a Double Date With Someone Else34 Times Kate Middleton and Prince William Gave Us Major Relationship Goals13 Celebrities Who Have Hot Siblings12 Photos of the Friends Cast Before They Were Famous That Will Make You Ridiculously HappyA Look at the Emmy It Girls of the Past 20 Years: Taraji P.

24,GREEN,Methane Emissions Are On The Rise. That's A Big Problem.,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/methane-emissions-rise-climate-change_us_584ef0b2e4b0e05aded4f2b0,The good news? Cutting methane could be the fastest route to mitigating climate change.,2016-12-12,"The agriculture industry is linked to a large share of methane emissions, which scientists say have risen dramatically in the past decade.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584ef20a1c00002f000eb1f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most discussions about climate change focus on the challenge of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. And rightly so: Such pollution accounts for over two-thirds of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.But new research suggests these discussions ignore a disturbing trend of surging methane emissions ― and addressing this issue head-on could help dramatically slow the warming of the planet.According to a pair of papers that appeared Monday in the academic journals Earth System Science Data and Environmental Research Letters, emissions of methane over the past decade are approaching a “worst-case scenario.”In the last two years especially, methane emissions have been climbing while carbon dioxide emissions have flattened.While the trend is alarming, it also represents an opportunity, due to the ways in which methane differs from carbon dioxide, Rob Jackson, chair of Stanford University’s Earth System Science Department and a co-author of both of Monday’s papers, explained.“Carbon dioxide lasts longer in the atmosphere, but methane acts more quickly,” Jackson told The Huffington Post. “So reducing methane is the quickest thing we can do to slow climate change.”Scientists have yet to fully understand what is causing the recent surge in methane, but they are confident that the increase has more to do with biological sources — namely agriculture — than fossil fuel sources, Jackson said.Agricultural practices yield methane in a number of ways.Livestock release large amounts of methane into the atmosphere through their digestive processes. These animals’ manure is also a contributing factor, as methane is produced when manure is stored in holding tanks or lagoons. According to the analysis, rice paddies also produce methane when they are flooded.Reducing these emissions could prove trickier than reducing emissions from fossil fuels, Jackson said, because the sources of the emissions are more widely dispersed among many smaller, individual farms throughout the world. “This is a global issue,” Jackson said. “There’s not any one country globally dominating methane emissions the way the U.S. and China dominate global carbon emissions, for instance.”Still, the opportunities to cut methane from the atmosphere are numerous.Strategies outlined in the analysis include promoting diets that are less meat-centric, tweaking livestock feed to make animals’ intestinal processes less methane-intensive and cultivating rice through processes that involve less flooding. Increased use of bio-digesters, which convert methane gas into an alternative energy source, could also have a big impact.But it’s unclear whether the U.S. will take advantage of these opportunities any time soon, given President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Scott Pruitt — like Trump, a climate change denier — as Environmental Protection Agency administrator, despite the widespread scientific consensus on global warming.Trump himself has also promised to “cancel” the nation’s participation in the Paris climate agreement, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.Despite the ominous political signs, Jackson is optimistic in the fight against emissions, particularly since data on the trend are consistently improving, so scientists can understand the phenomenon more thoroughly.That knowledge is crucial given the widespread benefits of mitigation, he said.“When we reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Jackson said, “we can reduce water use, improve air quality and save lives all at the same time.”―Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

I was particular taken by Shaq O’Neal shoe, which is huge.”“I guess it takes a champion to know a champion,” she added, referring to her former primary rival.Fiorina also toed Trump’s line on the question of Russian interference in the presidential election, calling China the U.S.’s “most important adversary.” She added that she and the president-elect discussed “hacking, whether it’s Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking” in the meeting. Trump has continued to deny intelligence assessments pinning the hacking on the Kremlin.The businesswoman previewed her about-face on Saturday at a retreat for Virginia Republicans, when she praised Trump’s “brilliant” moves as president-elect.Fiorina isn’t the first prominent critic of Trump to sell out the person they were just months ago.

On Saturday, Brown announced the launch of the International Organization for the Family, or IOF, which aims to “take the global fight to preserve and protect marriage to a whole new level,” in a blog post on NOM’s website. The new group, Brown wrote, will be focused exclusively on anti-equality efforts at the global level. Meanwhile, he’ll serve as president of both IOF and NOM, which will now “focus fully on the continuing fight here” in the U.S. Calling IOF a “great development for the international pro-family movement,” he said the group “is assembling a coalition of allies to take the worldwide lead in fighting for marriage, religious liberty, parental rights, the truth of gender and other issues.” Not surprisingly, he also praised Donald Trump’s surprise victory, and noted that he and IOF members looked forward to working with the president-elect, “the Congress and our allies in Washington and the states to pursue a wide ranging agenda on behalf of our issues.” While Brown was tight-lipped about IOF’s specifics, the group’s first project is reportedly called the “Cape Town Declaration,” Right Wing Watch notes. That effort aims to reaffirm “the dignity of marriage as the conjugal bond of man and woman” across the globe. The declaration continues: A thriving culture will therefore serve marriage—and all society—by promoting purity outside it and fidelity within; by discouraging pornography, adultery and divorce; and by firmly resisting every push to redefine marriage: to include same-sex or group bonds, or sexually open or temporary ones. Whether or not Brown’s group will find mainstream support remains to be seen (and, after what’s happened around the globe this year, anything’s possible). But with research finding that that a majority of Americans are in favor of marriage equality, here’s to hoping the conservative group remains a fringe effort."

Known for its generally progressive politics, the Washington State Legislature is unlikely to pass the bill ― but it could give ideas to other states, especially red ones that might have a greater chance of passing something similar.If it does become law, the measure would have a major effect on Seattle’s Safeco Field for the Mariners baseball team and the Seahawks’ CenturyLink Field, notes Sports Illustrated. Both facilities are on public land but are privately operated. Major League Baseball and the National Football League have strict bans on guns in stadiums.“We haven’t seen the proposed legislation but we have a policy forbidding carrying a weapon into NFL stadiums,” league spokesman Brian McCarthy told The Washington Post. The Seahawks stadium has an extensive list of prohibited items, including air horns, laptop computers and even specialty coffees. As for firearms, House Bill 1015 would eliminate the stadiums’ ability to “prohibit persons with a valid concealed pistol license from carrying a concealed pistol in any facility or on any grounds of a facility.”Current stadium restrictions on weapons are intended in part to eliminate an arsenal for heated fans to use, and in part to guard against possible terror attacks.The biggest threat could come from drunken, rowdy fans as stadium security grapples with a recent increase in violence. Sports executives are already worried that unruly fans are keeping other people away — and guns won’t help that mix.“If you are concerned about bringing your family to a game, then that [fan danger] is an issue,” Amy Trask, a former Raiders executive who has served on the NFL’s security committee, told the Post. “It’s not just an issue for one team; it’s an issue for all 32 teams. The teams know this. The league knows this.”"
28,POLITICS,Pollsters Can't Agree On How Latinos Voted In 2016,Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unclear-trumps-latino-vote_us_584ecb9fe4b0e05aded4be9e,A Latino political organization poll and exit polling showed different results for the group.,2016-12-12,The Latino electorate is being debated among pollsters after the election. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584ecdfb1800002d00e42291.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Latinos are the fastest-growing minority group in the American electorate. Pew estimates that the group has gained the most eligible voters between 2012 and 2016, and will likely continue to increase. How heavily the group continues to support Democratic candidates will factor into future election outcomes.But no one is sure exactly how Latinos voted in the 2016 election. Estimates of the vote vary from 66 percent for Hillary Clinton and 28 percent for Donald Trump in exit polls, to 79 for Clinton and 18 for Trump in a Latino Decisions pre-election survey. Both sets of numbers show Latinos heavily supporting Clinton, but it matters whether it’s an overwhelming 61-point Democratic lead or a more modest 38-point advantage.It’s not clear who is right, though. Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Research, said that one major difference between the polls is that Edison and Latino Decisions use different factors to classify Latino voters. Latino Decisions, an independent research firm focusing on Latino politics that counted Clinton’s campaign among its 2016 clients, asks a generic question about Hispanic identity. Edison Research ― which conducts the exit polls on behalf of the media consortium of CNN, NBC, ABC, Fox, CBS and The Associated Press ― asked for both race and ethnic descent.By asking a two-part question, the exit poll includes people with Hispanic ancestry who might not identify primarily as Hispanics, according to Lenski.(While many pollsters classify Hispanic as a race, the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino” refer to a person’s ethnicity, and he or she can belong to any race.)On the other side, Latino Decisions criticizes the exit poll for its lack of sampling in areas where large amounts of Latinos live, saying that exit polling groups don’t control for demographic data. At an event hosted last week by the Center for American Progress Action Fund that focused on the Latino electorate, Matt Barreto, managing partner at Latino Decisions, said the Edison exit poll will often oversample in specific precincts where it knows it’ll be close.Lenski believes it’s better to poll both Latinos who live in high-density Hispanic areas and those who are more separated in order to get a representative sample. Like other racial and ethnic groups, rural Hispanic voters shifted more toward Trump than Hispanic voters living in higher Latino-populated areas. While Latino Decisions feels that seeking out these voters is a way for Edison to make the election more dramatic, Edison says it is working to create a more accurate picture.However, both groups agree that Trump did very poorly with Hispanic voters. Trump gained the second-lowest support (by 1 point) from the Hispanic community ever. The lowest was Mitt Romney  with 27 percent of Hispanic voters in 2012, according to exit polls.Lenski also agreed with Barreto that as pollsters, they need to recognize the differences within the Latino community. It’s not just one group with one common goal. Emmy Ruiz, political advisor to the Clinton campaign, commented at last week’s panel that “we need to integrate our campaign into their community, not the other way around.”The differences in how race and ethnicity are classified and how the surveys sampled voters explain why the polls show varying estimates of how Latinos voted, and both methods are valid. We’ll have more insight into how Latinos voted in 2016 when the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey data comes out next year."

In addition to commending the Obama administration’s progressive steps to end juvenile solitary confinement and reduce the use of federal private prisons, Legend expressed his concern for what’s at stake in the future for the country’s criminal justice system.“While we hope the Trump administration and the 115th Congress will maintain this progress and continue to work in a bipartisan manner to reform our criminal justice system, it is unclear what their priorities will be and when families can expect justice,” he wrote.“Before you leave office, I would like to add my voice to the more than 2 million Americans who have asked you to use your clemency and pardon powers to bring justice to the thousands of families of non-violent drug offenders who have waited far too long for Congress to act,” he added.Over the course of his presidency, Obama has granted commutations to more than 1,000 federal inmates ― the most provided by a single president since Lyndon Johnson provided clemency to 1,187 inmates, according to Pew Research Center. Legend implored Obama to grant the release of the more than 36,000 nonviolent federal drug offenders who, he wrote, are serving sentences based on “prejudiced laws” involving crack cocaine. “I urge you to consider issuing categorical commutations to bring an end to the injustice that remains in our federal sentencing schemes... Rectifying these crack-powder disparities would not only correct the mistakes of the past, but could save taxpayers just over $150 million per year and keep with public sentiment about the over-incarceration and criminalization of drug crimes,” he wrote.Legend has agitated for inmates in the past. This summer, he launched a digital storytelling initiative, My Potential, which features stories from family members who have personally been affected by incarceration, as well the personal experiences from those who are currently in prison and juvenile detention centers.

But the law finally caught up to him and he was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud for spending the money from the St. George Bank. But he’s free today after just five months behind bars, thanks to the Supreme Court of New South Wales’ ruling that he did nothing deceptive. “It is plain that Mr. Moore behaved not only extremely foolishly but also dishonestly. He continued to borrow and consume funds, knowing that he had no realistic prospect of repaying them, and appreciating that there was a mistake in the bank’s systems,” the court concluded in its ruling.However, the court added: “There is nothing to suggest ... that Mr. Moore represented to anyone that his account with St. George was not overdrawn. And, even if he had, St. George at all times knew the truth of the matter, which was that it had lent him large amounts of money.”Moore, 29, told The Huffington Post: “I’m thrilled with the verdict, mate. I’ve had my moment in the sun. I’ve lived the high life for a bit, had my 15 minutes. Now I just want to concentrate on my studies, leading a ‘normal life’ and doing what I can to make the world a better place.”Moore stumbled into his good fortune when he opened a new account in 2010. A computer glitch allowed him to overdraw his funds and spend up to $1.5 million. He used the money to pay off a mortgage and insurance bills.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.). “The determination that the study will be preserved under the PRA has no bearing on copies of the study currently stored at various agencies.”The majority of the 6,700-page report remains classified, but its executive summary was released in 2014 by the committee. It concluded that the CIA’s interrogation program used techniques far more cruel than it had previously disclosed and misled the public about the program’s ability to produce intelligence. Eggleston added that as presidential record, the report is restricted as a classified document for 12 years. “At this time we are not pursuing the declassification of the full study,” he said. In recent weeks, a number of Democrats ― Feinstein included ― have pressed Obama to either declassify the report or make it a federal record subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Many were concerned the report would disappear once President-elect Donald Trump took office. Burr had requested that all copies of the document be returned to the committee when he first took over as chair of Senate Intel ― which some Democrats took as a sign that he would make sure the report never saw the light of day. “There are those who would like to see this report destroyed, but in the two years since its release, none of the facts in the 450-page summary has been refuted,” Feinstein said in a statement on Monday. “It’s my very strong belief that one day this report should be declassified. The president has refused to do so at this time, but I’m pleased the report will go into his archives as part of his presidential records, will not be subject to destruction and will one day be available for declassification.”White House press secretary Josh Earnest downplayed the significance of keeping most of the report classified. He said “a substantial” portion of it has already been made public, namely its executive summary.“Ultimately, the intelligence community will have to review the material that’s included in that report to determine what can be released,” he said in his Monday briefing.Pressed on why Obama wouldn’t speed up declassification of the report, particularly given that he has expressed concerns about Trump’s apparent openness to revisiting torture, Earnest didn’t budge.“I think there’s ample information included in that report on this topic that has already been declassified,” he said. “We’ve had an opportunity to wage this debate in public on a number of occasions, and I know there’s at least one official nominated to a senior position in the upcoming administration who has expressed the same kinds of views that are included in that report about the effectiveness of torturing terror suspects.”Earnest was referring to Trump’s pick for defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, who told Trump last month that he never found waterboarding to be useful.Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."

She’ll succeed fellow democrat Kip Holden. Holden served for 12 years as the first black mayor of the city.“Tonight Baton Rouge made a statement, a statement that we are a city of inclusion,” Broome said in her acceptance speech. “That we are a place of hope and optimism. A place where little boys and little girls of all walks of life know that they can grow up and lead a city no matter what their color or gender.”Broome’s win comes after a summer filled with racial tensions, bloodshed and deadly flooding in Baton Rouge. In July, residents responded to the death of 37-year-old Alton Sterling at the hands of police with protest and activism. In August, the city was devastated by catastrophic flooding that left more than a dozen dead and thousands displaced, including the mayor-elect.Broome, who previously served as state representative and state senator, ran a campaign focused on healing and unifying the city, Nola.com reports. She also highlighted the need to invest in education, healthcare, low-income communities and criminal justice reform.“Being unified is not only part of a vision for our future, it’s the backbone of the process that takes us there,” she said. “We will work for the next four years to make our city an example of how to heal and progress past the hurt that we have seen.” "

The bipartisan group made their case to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in an open letter Monday, arguing that the information is essential to their duties as electors who are tasked to “elect a president who is constitutionally qualified and fit to serve.”Citing Alexander Hamilton’s writing in The Federalist Papers, the electors argue Russian interference in the election must factor into their decision. In Federalist #68, Hamilton charged the Electoral College with preventing a “desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.”The Washington Post published details Friday of a CIA report that concluded Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election to help Donald Trump win. The Trump camp responded by dismissing the report outright, despite calls from across the aisle for a more thorough investigation.In a statement Monday, Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said he supports the electors’ efforts to seek more detailed information.“The bipartisan electors’ letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,” Podesta said in the statement. “Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed.”Podesta also said he supports the efforts of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify and make publicly available information regarding Russia’s role in the election.The electors wrote that “Trump’s willingness to disregard conclusions made by the intelligence community and his continuing defense of Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin demand close scrutiny and deliberation from the Electoral College.”The letter continues:The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations. We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday it “defies belief” that Republican politicians would hesitate to review Russia’s intrusion. Former acting CIA director Mike Morrell called the Russian interference “the political equivalent of 9/11.” "

I think we’ll have to see how the laws read.”He added: “If you look at Ivanka, she’s so strong, as you know, to the women’s issue and child care, and so many things, she’d be so good. Nobody can do better than her. I’d just have to see whether or not we can do that. She’d like to do that.”As for Kushner, Trump said: “I’d love to have Jared helping us on deals with other nations and see if we can do peace in the Middle East and other things.” CNN has reported that the couple have been house-hunting in Washington D.C. in preparation for a possible move there with their three children from New York City.What Trump is apparently trying to “work out” is how to bring the couple into his administration without breaching a federal anti-nepotism law that bars public officials, including the president, from hiring family members. The law also applies to those related by marriage.But Newt Gingrich told Fox News last month that there could be a way around the law.“I think they would have to get a waiver to the anti-nepotism law,” he said. It “might be a little tricky, although I think if they worked at it, they could do it.”The New York Times reported last month that Kushner had discussed the nepotism law with a lawyer. He believes that by forgoing a salary and putting his own real estate holdings and the newspaper he owns, The New York Observer, into a blind trust, he could take a role in the administration. Involving the couple in government could raise a whole new host of conflict-of-interest concerns. Trump has said he may hand off control of his businesses to his children to avoid his own apparent conflict of interest. But if his children are also in government the same issues arise. (In any case, experts say handing businesses to the Trump children, who can still profit from their father’s activities in the White House, does not avoid conflicts of interest, particularly if he simply reclaims them when he leaves the White House.)Ivanka Trump currently serves as the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization and also heads her own fashion brand.She said in November in a “60 Minutes” interview that she would not take a role in government, adding: “I’m going to be a daughter,” although she is “passionate about certain issues” that she vowed to “fight for.”Trump seemed to back off from his early loud boosterism for government roles for his family after he was criticized for reportedly pushing to obtain security clearances for his children. Trump, however, picked both Ivanka and Kushner to serve on his transition team (along with sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr.). Trump had talked shortly after the election about involving Kushner in peace negotiations in the Middle East.Kushner has played a key role in transition decisions. He was widely seen as responsible for blocking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) from having any role in his father-in-law’s upcoming administration. As U.S. attorney before he was governor, Christie successfully prosecuted Kushner’s father, real estate developer Charles Kushner, for criminal tax evasion. Trump and his daughter were more recently taken to task after Ivanka sat in on the president-elect’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and joined her father’s phone call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri."

Over the past eight years, Thrush has emerged as one of Politico’s standout journalists, most recently writing a 13,000-word dive into the pivotal moments of the 2016 election.He joined Politico in July 2008 after covering Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful presidential bid while at New York’s Newsday. He’s reported deeply on Congress, the Obama White House and three presidential elections. Thrush also serves as a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine and was an author of Politico ebooks during the 2012 race. “We’re thrilled that Glenn Thrush is joining The Times,” Elisabeth Bumiller, the paper’s Washington bureau chief, said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “He’s a premier political journalist, a master of breaking news and long-form story telling and a stellar addition to our White House team.”At the Times, Thrush will be reunited with former Politico stars Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman, whom he recently interviewed for his podcast. His hiring suggests that the paper is turning to reporters with tabloid roots to cover an incoming president reared in New York’s media culture. Thrush previously worked at Newsday while Haberman, who has covered both Trump’s campaign and his transition, previously worked at the New York Post and Daily News.Thrush had been considering a move for some time, according to sources, though he decided to stay at Politico through the 2016 election. The departure comes amid a series of post-election changes at Politico.Carrie Budoff Brown, who was tapped in July to be the site’s editor, officially took the helm following the election. Brown has beefed up the editorial ranks with The New York Times’ Paul Volpe, who recently became executive editor. On Wednesday, Politico added The Wall Street Journal’s Sudeep Reddy as one of the publication’s two managing editors. Politico has hired National Review’s Eliana Johnson to cover the Republican Party and announced that Tara Palmeri would be heading stateside from Politico Europe to cover the White House. Politico also recently nabbed Times Washington correspondent David M. Herszenhorn to join Politico Europe as chief Brussels correspondent. Meanwhile, Kristen Roberts, Politico’s national editor and a candidate for the top job during the summer, announced last week that she was leaving. She joined McClatchy on Monday as executive editor of its Washington operation.Bumiller and Washington editor Bill Hamilton announced the Thrush hire in an internal email Monday afternoon, along with the news that Peter Baker, a veteran White House correspondent who became Jerusalem bureau chief earlier this year, was also returning to the White House team.

But it was, at the third presidential debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584ef0241c00002f000eb1e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump claimed Monday that tracking computer hackers is virtually impossible unless they are caught “in the act” – a theory that comes as news to cybersecurity experts.“Unless you catch ‘hackers’ in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking,” Trump tweeted.“That’s just silly,” laughed John Schindler, who worked for 10 years as an analyst at the National Security Agency. “That is just simply false.”A review of forensic evidence pointed to the Russians, said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “No one expects Putin to burst into tears on national TV and confess. Ambiguity is normal in espionage, but there shouldn’t be any doubt,” he said.Trump’s Monday morning tweet ― one of two that countered fresh reports that Russia had actively tried to boost his candidacy by hacking Democratic emails ― also asked, “Why wasn’t this brought up before election?” But the issue had come up prior to the election, both in news reports and in the final presidential debate. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said Russian leader Vladimir Putin preferred to have Trump as president because he would be Putin’s puppet ― to which Trump countered, “No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet.”Phil Burdette, a researcher with the cybersecurity consulting firm SecureWorks, which analyzed this spring’s hack of the Democratic National Committee, said reviews of this kind are based on varied evidence. He agreed that pinpointing the individual perpetrator might not be possible ― “Unless you’re standing in the room with them looking over their shoulder and watching them type the keyboard commands, you’re never going to be 100 percent certain.” But he also said he was sure that Russia was behind the hacking.“The fact is, you had a foreign intelligence service attempting to interfere with our democratic process,” Burdette said.Both Trump and his advisers nevertheless continue to cast doubt on those analyses. In an interview on Fox News on Sunday, Trump said, “They have no idea if it’s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. I mean, they have no idea.”Trump previously opined that the hacker could have been a 400-pound person sitting on their bed or somebody in New Jersey.On Monday morning, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the renewed discussion of Russian hacking followed Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s request for recounts in three states and news coverage of Clinton’s 2.8 million vote advantage in the popular tally.“I think really clearly what this is is an attempt to try to delegitimize President-elect Trump’s win,” Miller said during a conference call with reporters. “That really seems to be the ― what’s going on here.”But other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, say they want the issue to be investigated. A bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, is calling for a congressional probe of the hacking, which McConnell said he supports.McConnell also said he couldn’t understand members of his party who would not support a probe. “It defies belief that somehow Republicans in the Senate are reluctant to either review Russian tactics, or ignore them,” he said.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

I want to stress that the Taiwan issue concerns China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and involves China’s core interests,” said ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.“Upholding the ‘one China’ principle is the political basis for developing China-U.S. ties. If this basis is interfered with or damaged then the healthy development of China-U.S. relations and bilateral cooperation in important areas is out of the question,” Geng told a daily news briefing.Geng said China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi, who outranks the foreign minister, had met with Trump advisers, including his pick for national security adviser, retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, during a transit in New York on his way to Latin America in recent days.“Both sides exchanged views on China-U.S. ties and important issues both are concerned with,” Geng said, without elaborating.He did not give a precise date for the meeting, and it was unclear if it occurred before or after Trump’s latest remarks on Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.Geng urged the incoming Trump administration to fully recognize the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue and uphold a ‘one China’ policy to “avoid the broader picture of China-U.S. ties being seriously interfered with or damaged”.“The China-U.S. relationship has global and strategic significance. This not only concerns the happiness of both countries and their people, it concerns the peace, stability, development and prosperity of the Asia Pacific (region) and internationally.”(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Writing by Michael Martina; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)"

It’s an attack on who we are as a people,” Mike Morell told The Cipher Brief. “A foreign government messing around in our elections is, I think, an existential threat to our way of life. To me, and this is to me not an overstatement, this is the political equivalent of 9/11. It is huge and the fact that it hasn’t gotten more attention from the Obama Administration, Congress, and the mainstream media, is just shocking to me.”The CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia interfered in the U.S. election not merely to mess around with the democratic system, but specifically to help Donald Trump win the presidency, according to a recent report in The Washington Post. “It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” said a senior U.S. official familiar with the findings. “That’s the consensus view.”During the election, emails from the Democratic National Committee and the private account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, were hacked and released on WikiLeaks. The DNC emails, in particular, caused turmoil within the party. Exchanges in those emails led supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to accuse party officials of tipping the scales for Clinton during the Democratic primary. Intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian hackers also broke into the Republican National Committee’s computer systems but did not release that information publicly.On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he supports an investigation into the hacking, adding that it “defies belief that somehow Republicans in the Senate are reluctant to either review Russian tactics or ignore them.” McConnell said that he has the “highest confidence in the intelligence community,” saying the CIA is filled with “selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people.”McConnell’s comments stand in stark contrast to those of Trump, who told “Fox News Sunday” that reports of Russian meddling in the elections were “ridiculous” and an “excuse” to undermine his victory. “No, I don’t believe that at all,” he said.“Nobody really knows, and hacking is very interesting,” Trump added. “Once they hack if you don’t catch them in the act you’re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it’s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. I mean, they have no idea.”Trump has also rejected daily intelligence briefings, preferring to receive them just once a week. He said he doesn’t need them all the time because he’s “like, a smart person.” Jason Kander, Missouri’s Democratic secretary of state and a former Army captain in Afghanistan, called Trump’s comments incredibly insulting. A growing number of senators in both parties are calling for congressional hearings into Russian election interference. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement on Sunday urging people not to make it “a partisan issue.” Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) agreed with their assessment in a tweet Sunday. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he wants an investigation into the matter, and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she thought a bipartisan congressional investigation “could be useful towards achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries.”Morell, who served as acting CIA director during President Barack Obama’s administration, said a bipartisan commission would be beneficial because it would “look into exactly what the Russians did and what we can do here at home to make sure that no foreign government can ever do this again to us.”“The commission shouldn’t look into what is an unknowable thing ― which is: did they affect the outcome or not ― we’ll never know that. We’ll never know what the Russians did, whether it affected a single vote or not,” he said. “But what we can do is figure out exactly what they did and make changes here at home as to how information is handled, how we protect information, and make sure they never do this again.”This piece was updated with fuller comments from Collins.

42,THE WORLDPOST,Syrian Army In 'Final Stages' Of Aleppo Offensive,"Laila Bassam and Lisa Barrington, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-army-aleppo_us_584e9992e4b0e05aded487f2,It was the country's largest city before the war.,2016-12-12,"Children push containers in strollers as they flee deeper into the remaining rebel-held areas of Aleppo, Syria December 12, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584f223e1c00002f000eb2d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Laila Bassam and Orhan CoskunALEPPO, Syria/ANKARA (Reuters) - Thousands of people fled the front lines of fighting inAleppo on Tuesday as the Syrian military advanced on the final pocket of rebel resistance, and a senior Turkish official said Russia and Turkey would meet to try to set up an evacuation corridor.The rout of rebels from more than half of their ever-shrinking territory in Aleppo sparked a mass flight of civilians and insurgents in bitter weather, a crisis the United Nations said was a “complete meltdown of humanity”.The U.N. human rights office said it had reports of abuses, including that the army and allied Iraqi militiamen summarily killed at least 82 civilians in captured city districts.“The reports we had are of people being shot in the street trying to flee and shot in their homes,” said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. office. “There could be many more.”Behind those fleeing was a wasteland of flattened buildings, concrete rubble and bullet-pocked walls, where tens of thousands had lived until recent days under intense bombardment even after medical and rescue services had collapsed.Colville described the rebel-held area as “a hellish corner” of less than a square kilometer, saying its capture was imminent.Turkish and Russian officials will meet on Wednesday to discuss a possible ceasefire and the opening of a corridor, the Turkish official told Reuters, who declined to be identified.But international efforts to seek a negotiated settlement to end fighting in Aleppo have shown no signs of a breakthrough, with Russia and the United States exchanging recriminations over hitches in ceasefire talks.The spokesman for the civil defence force in the former rebel area of Aleppo said rebels now controlled an area of less than three sq km. “The situation is very, very bad. The civil defence has stopped operating in the city,” he told Reuters.A surrender or withdrawal of the rebels in Aleppo would mean the end of the rebellion in the city, Syria’s largest until the outbreak of war after mass protests in 2011, but it is unclear if such a deal can be struck by world powers.By finally dousing the last embers of resistance burning in Aleppo, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s military coalition of the army, Russian air power and Iran-backed militias will have delivered him his biggest battlefield victory of the war.However, while the rebels, including groups backed by the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies, as well as jihadist groups that the West does not support, will suffer a crushing defeat in Aleppo, the war will be far from over.”FLEEING IN PANIC”Aleppo’s loss will leave the rebels without a significant presence in any of Syria’s main cities, but they still hold much of the countryside west of Aleppo and the province of Idlib, also in northwest Syria.Islamic State also has a big presence in Syria and has advanced in recent days, taking the desert city of Palmyra.The army and its allies had taken full control over all the Aleppo districts abandoned by rebels during their retreat in the city, a Syrian military source said on Tuesday.After days of intense bombardment of rebel-held areas, the rate of shelling and air strikes dropped considerably late on Monday and through the night as the weather deteriorated, a Reuters reporter in the city said.However, rocket fire pounded rebel-held areas, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, reported. Rebels and government forces still fought at points around the reduced enclave, the Observatory said.“Artillery shelling is continuing but because of the weather the aerial bombing has stopped. Many of the families and children have not left for areas under the control of the regime because their fathers are from the rebels,” said Abu Ibrahim, a resident of Aleppo in a text message.Colville said he feared retribution. “In all, as of yesterday evening we have received reports of pro-government forces killing least 82 civilians, including 11 women and 13 children, in four different neighborhoods - Bustan al-Qasr, al-Fardous, Al-Kalasah and al-Saliheen,” Colville told a news briefing, naming the Iraqi armed group Harakat al-Nujaba as reportedly involved in the killings.The military official said the rebels were fleeing “in a state of panic”, but a Turkish-based official with the Jabha Shamiya insurgent group in Aleppo said on Monday night that they had established a new frontline along the river.Celebrations on the government side of the divided city lasted into Monday night, with fighters shooting rounds into the sky in triumph.TIDE OF REFUGEESA daily bulletin issued by the Russian Defence Ministry’s “reconciliation center” from the Hmeimin airbase used by its warplanes, reported that more than 8,000 civilians, more than half of them children, had left east Aleppo in 24 hours.State television broadcast footage of a tide of hundreds of refugees walking along a ravaged street, wearing thick clothes against the rain and cold, many with hoods or hats pulled tight around their faces, and hauling sacks or bags of belongings.One man pushed a bicycle loaded with bags, another family pulled a cart on which sat an elderly woman. Another man carried on his back a small girl wearing a pink hat.At the same time, a correspondent from a pro-Damascus television station spoke to camera from a part of Aleppo held by the government, standing in a tidy street with flowing traffic.Abu Malek al-Shamali, a resident in the rebel area, said dead bodies lay in the streets. “There are many corpses in Fardous and Bustan al Qasr with no one to bury them,” he said.“Last night people slept in the streets and in buildings where every flat has several families crowded in,” he added.The International Committee for the Red Cross appealed for all sides to spare civilian lives. “As the battle reaches new peaks and the area is plunged into chaos thousands with no part in the violence have literally nowhere safe to run,” it said.

Its advances on Monday were aided by a militia of Palestinian refugees in Syria, the Liwa al-Quds or Jerusalem Brigade, the general said.The mostly Sunni rebels include groups backed by the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies as well as hardline jihadists who are not supported by the West.A correspondent for Syria’s official SANA news agency said the army had taken control of Sheikh Saeed, and more than 3,500 people had left at dawn.A Syrian official told Reuters: “We managed to take full control of the Sheikh Saeed district. This area is very important because it facilitates access to al-Amariya and allows us to secure a greater part of the Aleppo-Ramousah road.” The road is the main entry point to the city from the south.Riad Hijab, Syria’s chief opposition coordinator, said the rebels’ defeat in Aleppo would not weaken the resolve of Assad’s opponents, or push them to water down the demand that he quit.“If Assad and his allies think that a military advance in certain quarters of Aleppo will signify that we make concessions, then (I say) that will not happen,” he told reporters after meeting French President Francois Hollande.The loss of Palmyra, an ancient desert city whose recapture from Islamic State in March was heralded by Damascus and Moscow as vindicating Russia’s entry into the war, is an embarrassing setback to Assad.The Observatory reported that the jihadist group carried out eight executions of Syrian soldiers and allied militiamen in Palmyra on Monday while warplanes bombarded their positions around the city.Still, Islamic State made further advances around Palmyra, it and the Observatory said on Monday, including coming close to a military air base.Another four people, including two children, were shot dead while the jihadists cleared the city, the Observatory said.It said at least 34 people had died in air raids on an Islamic State-held village north of Palmyra, and that local officials said poison gas had been used. Islamic State accused Russia of the attack. Both Russia and Syria’s military deny using chemical weapons.CIVILIANSThe Russian Defence Ministry said on Monday that 728 rebels had laid down their weapons over the previous 24 hours and relocated to western Aleppo. It said 13,346 civilians left rebel-controlled districts of Aleppo over the same period.“Displaced people are moving,” said an Aleppo resident. Some were moving from areas controlled by the army to opposition areas, while others were going in the opposite direction. Some were staying at home waiting for the army.The Observatory said that four weeks into the army offensive at least 415 civilians, including 47 children, had been killed in rebel-held parts of the city.The Observatory said 364 rebel fighters had been killed in the eastern sector. It said rebel shelling of government-held west Aleppo had killed 130 civilians including 40 children."

But this past summer, PricewaterhouseCoopers took time out to do just that, starting a conversation that’s now reshaping the way the 45,000-person company handles hiring and promotions.PwC employees gathered in groups and one-on-one meetings around the country on July 21 and got very real about their experiences with race in America, including at the office. Black employees talked about feeling that they could not fully be themselves on the job.“You have to have one foot in and one foot out. ... Living as a black person but wanting to be accepted in a place where you are trying to be successful,” a young tax associate said in Atlanta.“You have to leave yourself at home and then try twice as hard as everybody else when you get to the office,” said an intern in Washington.Those quotes come from the accounting firm’s U.S. CEO and chairman, Tim Ryan, who wrote up what happened that day in a LinkedIn post.“More tears were shed at Pricewaterhouse than in our 120-year history,” Ryan told The Huffington Post recently.The summer of 2016 had been particularly hard on the company’s black employees, many of whom felt shook up by a spate of racially charged gun violence. Over just the first week of July, Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, with the whole event broadcast live on Facebook. In Baton Rouge, another black man, Alton Sterling, was also shot to death by police. Then a sniper in Dallas went after the police themselves at a Black Lives Matter rally.It was overwhelming, and yet black employees in particular felt like they couldn’t talk about it at the office. “When I came to work on Friday, the silence was deafening,” one person wrote to Ryan that month.Ryan was then just a few days into the role of CEO ― although he’d been with the firm for 28 years ― and he hadn’t thought that one of his first priorities would be addressing diversity and inclusion issues. Suddenly, it was. He kicked off his response in the usual corporate way, with a company-wide email. He acknowledged the tragic events and asked how people were doing.Hundreds of emails poured in from employees feeling scared and anxious and seeking to be understood. Ryan shared some in his LinkedIn post:“When I was a new associate, after my first busy season, my younger brother was shot and killed by a police officer ... he was 22 years old ... The firm in many ways helped me get through that tragic event,” a senior manager wrote.“As a black woman, who is married to a black man, I’m scared every day for him. I support the New York Black Inclusion Network (BIN) and we just had a conversation today on what we could do ... to move this country forward,” another manager said.Ryan wanted more talk like this. And so the day of conversation was conceived.Another company-wide email went out.“These conversations are not easy and sometimes uncomfortable,” Ryan wrote in the email, which he shared with HuffPost. “But one thing I’ve heard this week is that it’s also uncomfortable when the issues that are on the top of our minds are not part of the conversation at work.”It might seem misplaced to get this personal at work. It’s definitely unusual in corporate America. But having these kinds of deep discussions, opening up about how you’re doing, is simply an acknowledgement that work is where we spend a lot of our time, said Ryan.People should feel they can be themselves at the office, he said. And from the boss’s perspective, creating a supportive workplace is not just the right thing to do; it’s another way to improve employee performance. You work your best when you feel at home and your voice is heard.“Discussing these types of difficult topics is usually assumed to be the responsibility of community leaders, politicians, and activists,” Ryan wrote on LinkedIn. “But our people spend a good portion of their lives within the walls of this firm and more than anything, I want them to be able to bring their whole selves to work.”Pricewaterhouse, like its peers in the industry, has many programs on diversity and inclusion, but the openness of the July event was new. “We’ve been practicing ever since,” Ryan said.The conversations are ongoing in the PwC office in Tysons Corner, Virginia, just outside Washington, third-year associate Javier Perez told HuffPost. Although now it feels rather ordinary to talk openly at work, Perez said that his friends elsewhere are taken aback at the idea ― and wish their companies would do something similar.“They’re like, ‘That would be great,’” he said.Those stronger lines of communication helped after the presidential election, Perez said, when a group in his office gathered to talk through their shock.The November surprise of Donald Trump’s win triggered anxiety among many employees, Ryan said. Immediately afterward, he tweeted out a video emphasizing his commitment to diversity.“What we’ve done is tried to be apolitical but clear to our people ― internally and on social media ― that we are doubling down and inclusion is more important than ever,” Ryan said.A handful of other large companies, including Apple and PwC’s competitor EY, sent out similar kinds of post-election notes to employees, Bloomberg recently reported.All this talk at PwC has led to a policy shift. This past week, the company announced that people receiving promotions must now go through unconscious-bias training before they can take on their new roles. The training ― which new hires will also be required to do ― is basically watching four videos of 15 minutes to an hour, meant to help employees understand and uncover their blind spots and prejudices when it comes to gender and race.This is not a modest undertaking. PwC hires 17,000 people every year (including interns) and promotes about 7,500.Ryan had worried that making the training mandatory could fuel some resentment. There is research that seems to back up his concern. Studies have shown that the negative sentiment can even undermine the chances of advancement for minorities. Attendance at the talk event on July 21 had been optional. And Ryan was careful to note that the bias training wasn’t meant to be punitive. In some companies, it comes off that way because it’s only required after an incident. He made the decision to go ahead after actually talking to employees in PwC’s black affinity group.“After speaking to black professionals [inside the company], their strong view was this should be tied to leadership,” Ryan said. In other words, if you’re going to move up at the firm and manage other people, you must sharpen your sensitivities because the firm places a strong value on diversity.Corporate America is still struggling to move more women and people of color into its upper ranks. Even at PwC, the top five employees are all men, all titled “chairman.” Below that level, the firm’s leadership roles are filled by a more balanced mix of men and women. Among recently promoted partners, 44 percent were women and minorities, the firm said. (It declined to provide more detailed demographic data on its employees.)Bias training isn’t unique to PwC. Nearly all Fortune 500 companies offer some form of anti-discrimination program. But in recent years, the emphasis has slowly begun to shift from “here’s how to avoid getting sued” to “here’s what you need to know about your own biases.”“Suddenly you go from being completely oblivious to going, ‘Oh my God, it’s everywhere,’” is how Laszlo Bock, chief people officer at Google, described the effect of bias training to The New York Times in 2014. Someone else who’d been through the training at Google noticed that all the conference rooms in one particular building were named after men, according to the Times. Small details like that can add up to an environment that subtly tells women and minorities they don’t belong. The names were changed. Training isn’t enough, of course. Other tactics that work?Natalie Sue Johnson, a partner at diversity consulting firm Paradigm, suggested having diverse groups of employees talk to and interact with one another. "

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584f0fc11200009509eeee83.jpeg?cache=qQczp0AkTB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joseph Ax(Reuters) - The recount effort by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein in three crucial U.S. states neared an end on Monday, after weeks of legal wrangling yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin.A U.S. judge in Pennsylvania rejected Stein’s request for a recount and an examination of that state’s voting machines for evidence of hacking in the Nov. 8 election won by Republican Donald Trump.Meanwhile, Wisconsin election officials said on Monday they had completed their recount. The full numbers were expected to be available within hours, though it appeared they would largely affirm the election’s results.Stein, who finished fourth in the election, challenged the results in those two states as well as Michigan, where the state’s top court on Friday denied Stein’s last-ditch appeal to keep a recount going. All of those traditionally Democratic strongholds supported Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Even if all three recounts had taken place, they were always unlikely to change the outcome.Stein argued that the use in many Pennsylvania districts of electronic voting machines with no paper trail left the system vulnerable to hacking.In a 31-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond in Philadelphia said it “borders on the irrational” to suspect hacking occurred in Pennsylvania. He also emphasized that the deadline to certify the state’s electoral votes is Tuesday, making it impossible to hold a recount in time.While there is no evidence of large-scale voting machine hacking, U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia targeted Clinton in a series of cyberattacks on Democratic Party groups. Trump has questioned those reports.In response to Diamond’s ruling, Stein said in a statement that Pennsylvanians’ right to have their votes counted had been “stripped from right under them.”As of Monday morning, the Wisconsin recount was 95 percent complete and had narrowed Trump’s lead over Clinton by only 25 votes.Trump won Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan by more than 27,000, 68,000 and 11,000 votes, respectively.Despite winning the national popular vote by more than 2 percent, Clinton would have had to sweep those states to win the presidency under the U.S. Electoral College system, which assigns electoral votes state-by-state rather than by overall national totals.(Reporting by Joseph Ax in New York; Additional reporting by Timothy McLaughlin in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Bill Trott and Andrew Hay)"

The court didn’t provide a rationale for the denials.But Justice Stephen Breyer said he would’ve given the prisoners a chance to make their cases before the court. And in the process, he seemed to remind his colleagues of something he’s said a number of times before: that it may be time to eliminate the death penalty once and for all.“I have elsewhere described these matters at greater length, and I have explained why the time has come for this Court to reconsider the constitutionality of the death penalty,” Breyer wrote in an opinion disagreeing with the court’s decision not to hear the Florida case.Neither that case or the Ohio one had asked the Supreme Court to revisit whether the death penalty remains consistent with the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on “cruel and unusual” punishment.But Breyer pointed to systemic failings in both cases to underscore an ongoing theme in his crusade against the death penalty ― that not all death sentences are created equal.“When he was first sentenced to death,” Breyer wrote of Henry Sireci, the Florida inmate, “the Berlin Wall stood firmly in place. Saigon had just fallen. Few Americans knew of the personal computer or the Internet. And over half of all Americans now alive had not yet been born.”Sireci has been awaiting execution since 1976, when he was convicted of the murder of a used car salesman. In their Supreme Court petition, his lawyers argued that Florida’s refusal to grant Sireci a new trial — based on newly discovered DNA evidence that may exonerate him — violated his constitutional right to due process of law.Breyer observed that the time Sireci has spent waiting for his punishment is even longer than the average life expectancy of the framers who wrote the Bill of Rights.“I should hope that this kind of delay would arise only on the rarest of occasions,” Breyer wrote. “But in the ever diminishing universe of actual executions, I fear that delays of this kind have become more common.”He cited statistics from the Death Penalty Information Center, which show that executions in the United States have become much less frequent than they were in the 1990s.Romell Broom, the Ohio inmate, was nearly executed in 2009. State officials poked him with a needle for almost two hours, but couldn’t find a suitable vein into which to administer the cocktail that was meant to kill him. Broom’s lawyers argued that the failed 2009 execution, and the prospect of further suffering whenever Ohio tries to execute him again, amount to cruel and unusual punishment and other constitutional violations.“I would’ve heard Broom’s claim,” Breyer said. Justice Elena Kagan also voted to hear his case.Notably, Breyer still had in mind the execution of Ronald Smith, an Alabama inmate who was sentenced to death despite a jury recommendation that he be given a life sentence instead.Last week, Breyer and three other justices would have placed Smith’s execution on hold to review whether the Alabama system ― which is unique in allowing judges to override a jury’s determination as to a death sentence ― is constitutional. But none of the Supreme Court’s more conservative members provided the necessary fifth vote to spare Smith, and he was put to death on Thursday.These and other cases, Breyer said, “provide additional evidence” that the court may soon need to confront the larger questions surrounding the death penalty.“As I and other Justices have previously pointed out,” Breyer explained, “individuals who are executed are not the worst of the worst, but, rather, are individuals chosen at random, on the basis, perhaps of geography, perhaps of the views of individual prosecutors, or still worse on the basis of race.”"

Since Trump’s victory, Goldberg has moved quickly to strengthen The Atlantic’s politics and policy team with a string of splashy hires, including BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins and Rosie Gray and Politico Magazine’s Julia Ioffe.Now comes another: former New Republic editor Franklin Foer. In an interview, Goldberg said Foer, who had recently covered the election for Slate, will primarily write “big heave magazine stories” for The Atlantic. Foer, author of a bestselling book on globalization, How Soccer Explains the World, has most recently been working on a book about the threat posed by big technology companies. Though Foer’s focus will be writing, Goldberg said he may also help generate story ideas given his experience running a politics and culture magazine. The Atlantic already boasts a number of standout writers tackling politics and policy issues, including Ta-Nehisi Coates, Molly Ball and Adam Serwer.

The magazine’s mission then, and now, he said, is to cover American politics, culture and literature. “Politics is a core mission,” Goldberg said. “Explaining what just happened, and what is happening, is a core mission for The Atlantic.”There’s clearly been appetite for political coverage this past year.

49,PARENTS,American Express To Offer 5 Months Of Paternity And Maternity Leave,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-express-parental-leave_us_584ef60fe4b0e05aded4fbad,The company’s hourly customer care reps are also included in the new policy.,2016-12-12,"Starting next year, American Express will offer 20 weeks paid time off to all new parents working at the company.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584efbb01200009509eeee22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Starting in 2017, American Express will give employees some of the most generous paid leave benefits in the financial services industry: 20 weeks off to all new parents ― male or female, including adoptive parents or those who work with a surrogate. The majority of AmEx’s 21,000 part-time and full-time employees are eligible for the benefits, including hourly customer care reps, a spokesperson confirmed to The Huffington Post. The company is also taking the novel step of bringing on a “parent concierge” to help workers figure out how to navigate what is typically a very confusing time. Even among its peers, AmEx’s benefits stand out for generosity, Rebecca Greenfield notes in Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays offer 16 weeks off ― but only to employees who are “primary caregivers.” That designation is typically a gender-free way of saying “mother.”“We know that traditional parenting responsibilities are evolving and more LGBTQ families are having children,” Tammy Yee, vice president of U.S. benefits at American Express, told HuffPost. “We feel that this policy is more reflective of the needs of our diverse employee base, and strikes the right balance between our employees’ and our business’ needs.”AmEx used to give primary caregivers just six weeks off and “secondary” caregivers two weeks. Now, in addition to giving men and women 20 weeks under the new policy, AmEx will also give birth mothers an additional 6 to 8 weeks of medical leave to recover from childbirth.Over the past couple of years, employers of well-paid white-collar workers like Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Spotify have unveiled generous leave policies, stepping in to fill the void left by the federal government. The U.S. is the only developed country in the world that doesn’t provide some kind of paid leave for mothers. Indeed, it’s only one of a handful of countries in the world that offers no support to new parents. These employers aren’t stepping up to make a political statement, but instead have come to realize that paid parental leave is a benefit that increases productivity and raises retention rates ― women are far less likely to quit if you allow them to take paid time off to bond with their babies. So, often it’s cheaper for many businesses to fund your maternity leave than to search for, hire and retrain a replacement worker. “Longer parental leave has a far-reaching positive impact on the mental and physical health of our employees and their families, as well as women’s overall career advancement,” Yee said.A few states and cities have also passed their own paid leave benefits. Still, the majority of hourly and low-income laborers who need paid leave the most get nothing. The fact that AmEx’s hourly workers are included in the new policy offers a glimmer of hope. This year, both Chobani and Ikea also said they would give paid parental leave to their hourly workers.This article has been updated to reflect that the new AmEx policy includes hourly workers. "

Alice Gillett said she was sorting through her late husband’s book collection, which has about 6,000 titles, when she came across The Microscope and its Revelations by Dr. William B. Carpenter.She noticed the inside of the book said it was borrowed from Hereford Cathedral School, which her grandfather attended between 1886 and 1894, according to the school’s website. So she decided to return the tome to the headmaster. Gillett’s grandfather, Professor Arthur Boycott, went on to become a distinguished pathologist and naturalist, HCS said of its alumnus. His fascination with science began early, as he graduated with first class honors in natural science from HCS, and held on to a book about microscopes for his entire life. Boycott’s photo hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. The school did not impose any fines for the late return, and told The Guardian that it usually does not penalize students for late books. “We don’t want to put them off borrowing books,” a school spokesperson told The Guardian. “Our pupils are really, really good at bringing them back.”Well, maybe not all of them.Good thing the book wasn’t borrowed from Alabama’s Athens-Limestone Public Library, which announced earlier this year it really wants its books back ― or else."
51,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Labor Pick Should Know Worker Safety Laws. His Company's Been Fined For Breaking Them.,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-puzder-workplace-safety_us_584f1709e4b04c8e2bb14947,"Andy Puzder, head of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains, would be the top U.S. watchdog for workplace safety in Trump's administration.",2016-12-12,Andrew Puzder's company has been cited for violating the very workplace safety laws he would be charged with enforcing as labor secretary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584f1c25120000dd00eeeeb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In July 2013, a manager at a Carl’s Jr. restaurant in California told an employee to mop the floors using extremely hot water. The worker had to fill her bucket out of a special dispenser that was elevated on a counter and expelled water with a temperature between 180 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit. As the worker wrestled with the water bucket on her third day of mop duty, it dropped to the floor, splashing her with scalding water. The worker ended up having to be hospitalized for her burns. The parent company of the Carl’s Jr. brand, CKE Restaurant Holdings, was cited for three safety violations as a result, including one investigators considered “serious,” according to Labor Department records. This June, three years after the incident, the company agreed to pay $23,420 in fines ― an unusually high penalty following a workplace safety inspection. If President-elect Donald Trump has his way, Andy Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurant Holdings, will be in charge of fining companies like his own for workplace hazards. Last week, Trump named Puzder to be his labor secretary. If confirmed, he would be the top watchdog responsible for protecting workers from dangerous working conditions and wage theft. As HuffPost reported Friday, several Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. locations have been investigated and cited by the Labor Department for not paying workers what they’re owed during Puzder’s time at the helm of CKE. That includes a 2007 investigation that prompted the company to agree to pay nearly $60,000 in unpaid overtime to a group of more than 400 workers ― a significant case as wage violations go. Many Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. franchisees have also been taken to court for allegedly shorting workers on pay.CKE and its franchisees apparently have plenty of experience dealing with workplace safety fines as well, according to a review of inspection records with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Since 2000, the year Puzder took over as chief executive of CKE, Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. locations have racked up at least 98 safety violations, 36 of them listed as serious. OSHA defines a “serious” violation as one that could result in death or grave physical harm that the employer should have been aware of. (Some of those investigations were carried out by federal safety officials, while others, like the one in California, were done through state programs.)The original fines in those cases totaled $119,975. After talks between officials and employers, the fines were negotiated down to $67,290, likely after managers agreed to address the hazards immediately. Some of the restaurants cited were controlled by CKE itself, while others were run by its franchisees. In all cases, a complaint or injury would have prompted the investigation, since OSHA does not do random inspections of fast-food restaurants. A spokeswoman for CKE referred all questions related to Puzder’s nomination to an official with the Republican National Committee, who has not responded to queries from The Huffington Post.Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA policy advisor now with the National Employment Law Project, said she’s concerned that the agency’s enforcement would be weaker under a fast-food executive. After all, Puzder has spent his career as someone who would want to lower workplace fines, not dole them out. “He’s in an industry that has its hazards and its share of injuries. But there are other industries where people get routinely killed and routinely have amputations,” Berkowitz said. “That’s really why OSHA exists ― to do inspections, to make it clear to these employers who routinely cut corners on safety that there’s a cost to doing that. The fear here is that they’ll cut enforcement.” OSHA’s budget is small to begin with, as is the stick it wields with employers. The agency’s fines are notoriously low: The cost of a “serious” violation is capped at $12,741, and that’s after OSHA managed to raise its penalties in August for the first time in decades. The cost of an OSHA violation is tiny when compared to penalties from a body like the Environmental Protection Agency or the Justice Department.Regardless of who’s in the White House, career civil servants carry out workplace safety investigations. But enforcement is typically more relaxed under Republican leadership, as political appointees take a less confrontational stance with employers. Though rare, it’s not unheard of for a business leader like Puzder to take the reins at the agency. President Ronald Reagan’s first labor secretary, Raymond Donovan, came from the corporate world and ended up watering down OSHA enforcement and managing staff cuts at the agency. While business groups roundly applauded Trump’s decision to choose Puzder, labor groups and unions have criticized the choice as a disservice to low-wage workers. Puzder does not oppose the minimum wage in principle, but he has advised against raising it in recent years, and he’s criticized President Barack Obama’s reforms, which would bring overtime protections to millions of additional workers. In one widely cited interview, Puzder said he would rather deal with automated workers than human ones: “They’re always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,” he told Business Insider.One of Puzder’s most vocal critics is Fight for $15, a union-funded campaign aimed at raising the minimum wage and bringing collective bargaining to the fast-food sector. Workers with the campaign have said that fast-food work is more dangerous than many people suspect. Last year, two dozen workers filed a range of complaints with OSHA against the likes of McDonald’s. They cited slip-and-falls and burns from grills and grease as the most common incidents, attributing the dangers to working at such a fast pace.In 2014, one Hardee’s employee in North Carolina ended up tripping over a bucket of hot oil left in a walkway, according to OSHA records. The 18-year-old woman ended up with third-degree burns and had to be hospitalized.The restaurant was operated by Hardee’s Food Systems, a subsidiary of CKE, which was cited for one serious safety violation and fined $6,300.HuffPost readers: Have you worked for Puzder, CKE Restaurants, or Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr.?

52,POLITICS,Paul Ryan's Bizarre Response To Russian Meddling In The Presidential Election,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-russia-hacking_us_584eea68e4b04c8e2bb0cf62,"It's a serious matter that we should just ignore, he seems to be saying.",2016-12-12,"""As we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584ef9fc1200009509eeee15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After a round of news stories about House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) stopping short of calling for a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, he once again stopped short of calling for a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election.“We must condemn and push back forcefully against any state-sponsored cyberattacks on our democratic process,” Ryan’s statement on Monday promisingly began, adding that intelligence chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his committee have been working “diligently on the cyber threats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations to the security and institutions of the United States.”“This important work will continue and has my support,” Ryan added.But does that mean the speaker supports investigating how Russia reportedly hacked the Democratic National Committee and published emails in an attempt to sway the presidential election?That question still hasn’t been answered, and Ryan’s office did not respond to attempts to clarify his stance.Based on Ryan’s statement, it sounds as if he is just reiterating his support for the hearings the intelligence committee has already undertaken ― like a September 2015 panel on global threats to computer networks and a March 2015 panel on “The Growing Cyber Threat and its Impact on American Business.” Those were the intelligence committee’s only two public cybersecurity hearings during the entire 114th Congress.Nunes, who serves on President-elect Donald Trump’s national security transition team, also said nothing about investigating Russian attempts to tilt the election. Instead, he issued a statement on Friday that dedicated 43 of its 77 words to attacking President Barack Obama.“Unfortunately the Obama administration, dedicated to delusions of ‘resetting’ relations with Russia, ignored pleas by numerous Intelligence Committee members to take more forceful action against the Kremlin’s aggression. It appears, however, that after eight years the administration has suddenly awoken to the threat,” the statement read.Nunes issued a new statement on Monday saying the intelligence committee would be a “vigilant monitor” of intelligence community investigations into Russian interference.“We will also oversee the production of the report on these attacks requested by President Obama to ensure its analytical integrity,” Nunes said. “At this time I do not see any benefit in opening further investigations, which would duplicate current committee oversight efforts and Intelligence Community requests.”Whether that means they’ll hold new hearings on the cyberattacks, or simply provide oversight of investigations from other agencies, is again unclear.As for Ryan, he’s already taken a decidedly less aggressive stance toward Trump since he won. When Ryan had a chance to speak out about Trump’s decision to make Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon his chief strategist, the speaker said he was “not looking backwards,” though Bannon has personally gone after Ryan. And amid questions about how Trump will handle his businesses and potential conflicts of interest, Ryan’s answer was “however he wants to.” After The Washington Post reported the CIA’s conclusion that Russia had intervened in the presidential election, Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, issued a statement on Sunday saying that “Ryan has said for months that foreign intervention in our elections is unacceptable.”“The speaker can not comment on or characterize the content of classified briefings but he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters,” she said.That statement didn’t seem to answer anything, so Ryan came out with his new statement that simply reiterated the previous statement using more words.“As I’ve said before, any foreign intervention in our elections is entirely unacceptable,” the statement read. “And any intervention by Russia is especially problematic because, under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests. At the same time, exploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes our national security. As we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.”It’s that last sentence that’s particularly interesting. Ryan doesn’t think we should “cast doubt” on the outcome of the election ― which may indicate that he does not support a congressional investigation into how Russia played the American electorate.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), meanwhile, made it clear where she stands on investigating Russian interference.“The U.S. intelligence community has determined that Russia interfered in U.S. elections,” she said. “There must be no equivocation or ignoring the seriousness of the intelligence community’s conclusion about Russia’s actions. Regardless of the outcome of the election, the American people deserve to know the truth and a commitment to protect our democracy from foreign meddling.”Pelosi then said Congress has a responsibility to investigate “Russian hacking into our election,” and she said she supported a proposal to form a bipartisan, independent commission.“Speaker Ryan must join the bipartisan call for a formal investigation into Russia’s unprecedented assault on our democracy,” she said.This story has been updated with an additional statement from Devin Nunes."
53,RELIGION,The Little-Known Story Of The Islamic Christmas Tree,"Mariam Sheikh Hakim, ContributorMedia & communications consultant; writer on faith, gender and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-islamic-christmas-tree-the-other-perspective_us_58322a54e4b0eaa5f14d4730,Not many people know that the Quran features a tree in the narrative of Jesus’ birth.,2016-12-12,"<p>In the Islamic nativity, Jesus is born under a date palm tree.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58516fb71800001c00e42986.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was growing up, I always wanted a Christmas tree in our family home but unfortunately for me, this was an idea my parents staunchly resisted. Once, I even offered to make a homemade one but my parents wouldn’t entertain the idea because “we were Muslim.”We weren’t very strict Muslims, but we were practicing, and a Christmas tree was seen as a contradiction to our religious values back then. I wasn’t alone either; most of my Muslim friends have a similar story to tell. Fast forward years later, and the same parents are now gifting Christmas presents to their grandchildren.So what exactly was the problem back then with the Christmas tree? Upon reflection, this “no compromise” position is likely to have been wrapped up with the insecurities and identity politics of my parents being new migrants.In general these attitudes are starting to wane amongst Muslims, as it seems more are enjoying cultural elements of Christmas in the U.K. and in America too, particularly younger generations. Some see the cultural tradition of giving and sharing during Christmas as compatible with Islamic values. Given how huge Christmas is in the West (and practically unavoidable), many do not want to miss out on the fun either.However, the Christmas tree in particular is still met with resistance by many Muslim families (and non-Muslims too, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, who don’t celebrate any aspect of Christmas) as it is well known that the Christmas tree has European pagan origins. The pagan practice of bringing in something evergreen into the home was thought to ward off evil spirits, and this didn’t gain popularity as an adapted Christian custom until the 17th and 18th centuries.Because of this pagan history, some Muslims have sought to avoid having a Christmas tree in their home for fear of deifying anything other than God. This, coupled with anxieties around maintaining their heritage in a non-Muslim society, means that it is still rare to find Muslims who will put up a Christmas tree.But can religious literacy in Quranic narratives soften attitudes towards this? What many Muslims don’t reflect on (or know about) is the concept of an Islamic Christmas tree. What I mean by this is the tree featured in the Quranic account of Jesus’ birth in chapter Mary (Surah 19). In this narrative, Jesus is born under a tree, which is an integral part of the Islamic “nativity scene” and story. This is an Islamic Christmas tree of sorts; a tree that can be used to remind us of the story of Jesus’ birth.If we were to imagine replacing the traditional Christmas conifer with this tree, what would it look like? According to the Quran, the tree is a date palm, which has both Mary and baby Jesus resting beneath it. The tree is bearing fruit at the time of Jesus’ birth. It also features spring water toward its base, which miraculously appears for Mary to drink from.What strikes me is the Islamic Christmas tree and nativity scene indicate a very non-European cultural setting. This highlights how far current images of Christmas actually are from the real geographical location of the nativity story. Even in Middle Eastern countries, it’s often a European Christmas tree and version of Christmas that is celebrated in hotels or malls during December.Has Christmas as we know it in the West become disconnected with its Middle Eastern roots? Is this an example of why citizens in Western nations generally lack empathy or solidarity with issues taking place in the Middle East – because Christmas itself has become de-Middle Easternized?What if celebrations were to reconnect and “turn back” toward the birthplace of the nativity? Perhaps this could serve as a powerful reality check of the cognitive dissonance at work in Western societies during Christmas.On the one hand, we have Western nations relentlessly bombing this part of the world, adding to the biggest refugee crisis we have seen in decades. These refugees in turn have largely been met with hostility and outright xenophobia. On the other hand, during Christmas, we all engage in celebrating the story of Jesus’ birth, where we commemorate and show empathy with a migrating Middle Eastern family desperately seeking refuge.If the Islamic Christmas tree and nativity scene can help people engage further with the Middle East – and even specifically in the holy land of Jesus’ birth – this could be a force for good. Geographically, it won’t be seen in Western countries as a detached distant place with problems that are “over there.” The connection would be brought much closer to home, possibly reducing inconsistent outlooks.I am not arguing here that we should erase any European cultural Christmas practices. Nor is this an argument for Muslims to create their own ritual of getting a Christmas tree. Even the Bible seems to look down on such pagan practices, so people should choose wisely what they want for their families.What I am trying to convey is that although the “Christmas spirit” can be everywhere, the origins are not in a department store or in snowy Lapland, Finland. The origins are in the Middle East, a place with an ongoing horror story in dire need of the world’s humanitarian assistance. Maybe if Christmas wasn’t so devoid of this identity then my own Muslim parents wouldn’t have seen it solely as a Western cultural celebration, as unrelated to their Muslim background.Religious literacy of Quranic narratives can help reduce a blindness amongst Muslims around commonalities that we share with others. This can enhance an openness to positively share Islam in a way that is relevant and can bring a fresh perspective to interfaith dialogue and bridge building.The Islamic narrative of Jesus’ birth can anchor the well-known Christian one and reminds us that the Quran places Jesus and Mary beneath a “Christmas tree.” They are described in the Quran as a “token” or a “sign” for all peoples, so perhaps their embodiment of love and peace for all are Christmas presents to the world.Merry Christmas, everyone!"

In Hong Kong, Beijing’s interpretation of the Basic Law has been met with protests from citizens seeking greater democratic freedoms; Singapore is currently sorting out the seizure of its military training vehicles en route home from Taiwan; and, this week, President-elect Donald Trump suggested that the United States should not be bound by the one China policy unless it can be used to extract a favorable deal from Beijing.Each development presents a different form of exogenous threat to the one China principle that Beijing holds near and dear: namely, that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) represents the singular China and its territory, including Hong Kong and Taiwan. The one China policy recognized by the United States and Beijing’s other diplomatic allies accepts the reality of only one state called China, despite the existence of two governments in the PRC and on Taiwan (ROC) which both claim to be China. In practice, this has meant Taiwan has had to settle for unofficial or informal ties in countries around the world that have diplomatic relations with China.Any challenge to “one China” is – knowingly or unknowingly – a threat to the longevity of the Chinese party-state and the political power of the Communist Party. For those governments, countries, and leaders that test the one China policy, consequences or aggressive signaling are usually not too far behind. In Taiwan, President Tsai’s inaugural speech neither refuted nor accepted the iteration of “one China” in the form of the 1992 Consensus. Beijing has since responded in clamping down on tourist quotas to Taiwan, severing official communication channels, and continuing military training and saber-rattling – including two recent PLA aircraft flights around the island’s southern tip. Elsewhere, in countries such as Armenia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kenya, and Malaysia that follow the one China policy, Taiwanese criminals suspected of telephone fraud have been extradited on planes bound for Beijing rather than their home country of Taiwan. For better or worse, these actions have occurred in response to an acceptance, refutation, or abstention from the notion of “one China.” The choice to follow a one China policy must thus be taken with the gravity of any other political or diplomatic agreement; and, accordingly, the costs of violating or abandoning it should not be understated.Throughout the campaign and since winning the election, President-elect Trump has shown an insensitivity to diplomatic and political traditions. But the one China policy is one area his incoming administration and advisory staff would behoove to uphold. Over the last 67 years, Washington’s adherence to the one China policy has ensured a prevalence of stability in the Taiwan Strait. Refuting the one China policy or opening it up for renegotiation as a businessman may be eager to do would unwind decades of careful diplomacy and statecraft seen across Washington.To put it simply, President-elect Trump and his team need to find a different way to bargain with China. Avoiding the surprises seen over the last few weeks is but a starting point. The relationship can and should move forward – not backward – by focusing on issues of mutual concern and common ground. If Trump’s commentary on the one China policy is less about trade issues and, rather, positioning Washington for deepening its ties to Taiwan, the incoming administration should rest assured that meaningful ties can be maintained and expanded without sacrificing the policy tradition of one China.Rather than relying upon the core Chinese interest of one China as a bargaining chip, or playing hardball with China on a non-negotiable issue, the president-elect and his team should instead consider the alternative option of employing an American brand of geo-economic statecraft. The policy debate the incoming administration needs to be having is not how the one China policy can be leveraged politically to extract a desirable economic outcome from Beijing as Trump’s remarks suggested. Rather, as the bipartisan team of Robert Blackwill and Jennifer Harris advocate, the Trump team needs to develop a sound geo-economic policy toward China – an intentional and strategic calibration of the economic tools at America’s disposal to address concerns seen by the President-elect as problematic in the bilateral U.S.-China relationship.From the historic Trump-Tsai phone call to the future status of the one China policy, recent events suggest more work lies ahead as the Trump team learns to navigate the complexities of the U.S.-China relationship. The bilateral and global consequences of Washington abandoning the one China policy under Trump are, as a Global Times piece portrayed, bleak at best. It is in the interest of the next administration to find another bargaining tactic and swallow the policy pill of one China, no matter how bitter President-elect Trump may find it."

There was Brexit, in which the majority of a shamefully low turnout of voters rejected diversity and the free movement of people to retreat into a lost idyll of past ‘greatness’. Then there was the parliamentary coup in Brazil, where corrupt politicians ousted a democratically elected president—replacing her policies with the agenda of the right-wing economic elite. And then in the U.S., a mega-rich megalomaniac ‘won’ the Electoral College, an archaic system that fundamentally gives less value to an urban African American or Latin vote than it does a rural white landowning one. In each instance, the failure of neoliberalism is clear—but a downward spiral into nationalism, racism, and the patriarchy is certainly no solution.At the same time, at the opposite side of the spectrum that has been largely invisibilized, radical and democratic social justice movements are writing their own headlines—whether or not they will ever make the news. For these movements deeply entrenched in struggles on the frontlines of global crises, it has been a remarkable year of social change.Of the most inspiring of those alliances, the Global Convergence of Land and Water Struggles, is forming its first regional branch in West Africa—one of the most socioeconomically and politically fragile regions in the world. A trailblazer in that process was the Malian Convergence Against Land Grabbing (CMAT), a bare-boned movement with razor-sharp political analysis. Today, social movements from 13 West African countries are gathered in the Malian countryside, putting forward the proposals and solutions that they hope will amount to revolutionary gains won by the most marginalized. Movement building is no easy task, yet as seen in Standing Rock and elsewhere it starts with access to and control over natural resources. Below are seven emerging themes from the multi-day strategy session in Mali that are highly applicable elsewhere.1. Know the issues, meticulously – The Global Convergence of Land and Water Struggles, spearheaded by West African peasant movements in consultation with their grassroots base constituencies and transnational allies, held its first action in March of this year: a caravan than mobilized more than 10,000 people across some 2,200 kilometers of the wide-open Sahel in defense of land, water, and seeds. In doing so, the activists involved not only brought visibility to the global fight against the twin challenges of resource grabbing and climate change, but also became intimately familiar with the details at the core of contention. Making stops throughout Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal, the convergence visited with, for example, victims of violent land dispossession, and in doing so was able to track regional trends and match them with ‘official’ accounts of various land deals. Research is a powerful weapon.2. Build solutions, collectively – Even though pulling off a modern-day African caravan is a visible and concrete action, the real work is an ongoing process that takes place behind the scenes. This is what is happening here in Mali at the moment. Prior to gathering with other regional convergence representatives in Nyéléni, an agroecological organizing center outside of the village of Sélingué, Malian peasant movements held a daylong workshop on a new agricultural land law that they see as a direct threat to their rights. The activists painstakingly went through its 49 articles and offered critiques and alternatives. Now in Nyéléni—the very place where the transnational agrarian movement Vía Campesina and its environmental allies outlined the principles of food sovereignty (2007), issues related to land grabbing (2011), and agroecology (2015)—the convergence is plotting its next steps in breaking down old and new forms of enclosure. And they are clear that it starts with protecting land, water, and seeds.3. Look inward – The adage ‘act locally, think globally’ is a good one. Put another way, struggles and solutions are highly internalized processes. While intergovernmental organizations, states, and corporations impose projects and programs with little regard for the unique diversity of a given space or place, those living there know it intimately. Solutions that work, of course, can be multiplied through learning exchanges and other grassroots mechanisms. Peasant organizations regularly exchange seeds, where, for example, farmers from the northern deserts that give way to the Sahara share hearty drought-resistant varieties with peasants in climate-affected areas in which once-adequate rainfall has nearly stopped. It is a political act of resistance to the GMO seeds that are routinely dumped on West Africa from abroad. Indigenous knowledge is power.4. Reach outward – As its name suggests, the Global Convergence for Land and Water Struggles is intended to reach far beyond West Africa—even if its priorities remain unapologetically in the region at this time. Social justice movements at the transnational level are sometimes isolated from one another, even if their members share similar class and identity politics. So rather than reinventing the wheel, the new convergence is committed to working within vast networks and contributing to a movement of movements. The issues that tear apart social structures and ecosystems—capital accumulation and notions of empire—are deeply interconnected at the global level, so the resistance must be as well.5. Use frameworks that push the system – This is where charity can miss the point; the roads of Mali are literally littered with good intentions. From dried out water tanks provided by foreign governments to boarded-up microcredit booths funded by the most well-meaning NGOs, many projects have done nothing to challenge the systemic nature of inequality—but social movements are filling that gap. They are doing so, in part, by framing their struggles and political proposals in accordance with radical ideology. The Global Convergence for Land and Water Struggles is no exception, making claims for land, water, and territory, as well as food sovereignty through agroecology, and insisting upon system change. These frameworks represent cutting-edge political opportunities.6. Navigate channels of governance access – The current waves of governance trends sweeping Europe and North America are hardly new to Global South activists who have been working in the trenches under colonial structures, or likewise under oppressive experiments in privatization and nationalism (think of Pinochet’s Chile or Suharto’s Indonesia). The West Africans have seen their share of business-minded bullies as well. Although the state is a laudable political target, global governance structures and institutions have shifted its overall relevance and power. In this vein, activists have three channels through which they are able to challenge policy. First, they can do it the old-fashioned way and pressure their own governments to implement policy. Second, they can demand that their states interact with global governance to legislate policy. And third, they can supersede the state and work directly with governance institutions. All three channels are simultaneously needed where resources, and those who guard them, are increasingly hunted.7. Take it to the streets – Any of the previous forms of collective action is incomplete without the complementary tactic of nonviolent and calculated political action where possible. Popular protest for redistribution and recognition is an often-underestimated tool that has brought down governments and corporations while cutting off destructive policy at the knees. Slacktivism will not do that job. A highlight of the Global Convergence of the Land and Water Struggle’s caravan was a demonstration in Bamako, Mali where more than 1,500 locals joined the regional delegates in denouncing resource grabbing. Just a few days later across the border in Kaolack, Senegal, the convergence did it again—attracting upwards of 1,000 people to their cause and marching some three kilometers under an unforgiving sun. And this is merely one component of the nascent movement’s action plan that is cautiously optimistic about fostering political revolution in West Africa and beyond."

I’m talking of course about kids with special needs, or kids with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).Bullying can negatively affect all children in potentially far-reaching ways, like long term self-esteem issues, insecurity, and even prolonged behavioral issues. The problem is that children with special needs are even more likely to be targets of bullying, and in many cases aren’t equipped with the communication tools to respond to it, process it, or even enlist the help of parents or educators.One telling study found that 63 percent of bullied school-going children are children with special needs. Another found that special children were nearly five times more likely to be bullied than their peers.What makes kids with special needs more vulnerable?There are a number of reasons for this sad fact. Firstly, children with special needs tend to have unique or different ways of communicating, using gestures or words that others find inappropriate, odd, or threatening. They also struggle with social cues and non-verbal communication, making socializing even more of a challenge and opening them up to mockery by their peers.In addition, kids with special needs and ASD tend to be loners, which draws unwanted attention to them and makes them especially vulnerable targets. Kids who are different or keep to themselves often become excluded from the rest of the group, or worse, ganged up on.The biggest challenge for parents desperate to keep their children with special need safe is the fact that verbal communication can often be severely limited or non-existent between child and parent – creating the awful possibility that your child is being picked on regularly, but doesn’t even have the words to tell anyone about it.How to pick up on signs of bullying?There are some telltale signs which could indicate that your child is being bullied. The general rule is to be alert for any sudden change in behavior. This could include a noticeable increase in anxiety, trouble sleeping, and more frequent and intense meltdowns than usual. Sometimes your child’s angst could even be reflected in emulating the abusive behavior at home by bullying his or her siblings. Obviously, physical signs of struggle or injury are also something to be on the alert for.Another possible sign of trouble is sudden reluctance to go to school for no apparent reason. This could be accompanied by general disinterest in favorite activities and hobbies, and a sense of listlessness, depression, or withdrawal. There may also be a noticeable increase in obsessive behavior.If your child displays any of the signs above, there are devices you can use to listen-in during certain situations. For example, AngelSense not only lets parents listen to their children’s surroundings, but allows them to track where they are to check whether bullying is in fact occurring. This is especially effective if you suspect foul play at certain times of your child’s day, for instance, on the bus or during recess.What can you do to protect your child?Sometimes kids with special needs need to be instructed on the finer points of identifying friendly behavior versus hostile behavior. Children on the spectrum often can’t intuitively tell the difference between the two, and have to be told how to classify each. Some children may be reluctant to verbally discuss bullying, and what they’re thinking and feeling in general. Having them draw a visual representation of the abuse can be highly cathartic and therapeutic; in addition, it can help you understand what they’re going through.As a next step, try teaching your child how to respond to bullying. You could, for example, teach him or her to walk away and head for a teacher’s office. Another option is to encourage your child to write about or draw any incidents that make them feel uncomfortable. However you choose to teach your child to cope with this abusive behavior, it’s a good idea to write out an action plan or social story in your child’s school diary.A playgroup is an effective way for a special child to make friends. Be sure to include as many children from your child’s school as possible. You can also check if your child’s school already has existing playgroups for children that struggle with making new friends. This will not only help your child deal with bullying, but will give them invaluable social skills that will benefit them later in life.As a society committed to the prevention of social abuses, we need to ensure inclusion of the most vulnerable of bullying victims: those who often don’t have a voice to defend themselves or even describe to parents or caregivers what they are experiencing at the hands of their peers.The National Bullying Prevention Month initiative has helped special and traditional-needs families alike open that conversation and spread awareness and education on bullying in general. As parents of children with special needs, it’s up to us to make sure that these and other initiatives like it positively affect those who need them the most."

Trump’s victory, which in many ways echoed the Brexit vote, was part of an increasingly global revolt against elites—political, financial, and cultural. It was also a populist rebellion against the economic and social dislocations of a globalization process dominated by the interests of multinational corporations and exacerbated by the rise to preeminence of a neoliberal ideology of deregulation, tax cuts, privatization, reduced social services, free trade, and the unimpeded movement of capital.From Goldwater to ReaganBut the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats was also a consequence of a political crisis specific to the United States, one whose roots extend back to 1964, when the long migration of whites to the Republican Party began. As the liberal Lyndon Johnson vied for the presidency against the conservative Barry Goldwater, the New Deal coalition that had dominated American politics since 1932 began to show its first cracks. The cause was the civil rights movement, which aroused fierce opposition among whites in the deep South, leading them to abandon their historic attachment to the Democratic Party and to vote in five states—South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana—for a Republican Party led by a man who had opposed the Civil Rights Bill in the name of “states’ rights.” Though Johnson defeated Goldwater in a landslide, the “Solid South” was solid for the Democrats no more.By 1968, with opposition to the civil rights, student, anti-war, and other ‘60s movements mounting, it became apparent that the old and increasingly fragile New Deal coalition of labor, the South, northern blacks, and white liberals was in the process of disintegrating. This time the biggest shift took place in the North, where segments of the Northern working class—many of them white ethnics unsettled by the race riots and student revolts that punctuated the decade—abandoned the Democratic Party for Richard Nixon. The result was Republican victories in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Indiana—all Northern states with large working classes. Meanwhile, the movement of the South away from the Democratic Party escalated sharply, with nine of the eleven states of the confederacy voting either for Nixon (four) or the overtly racist George Wallace (five), most famous for his speech defiantly pledging “Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!”Prior to the 1968 election, a young Nixon aide named Kevin Phillips completed a draft of a brilliant and prescient book entitled The Emerging Republican Majority. In it he argued that 1968 “bespoke the end of the New Deal Democratic hegemony and the rise of a dominant new Republican coalition in rising sections of the country,” notably the “Sun Belt” states of the South and West and in “Middle America” urban-suburban districts. The great political upheaval of the sixties, he argued, was not the progressive and left movements with which the decade is often identified, but “rather a populist revolt of the American masses…against the caste, policies and taxation of the mandarins of Establishment liberalism.”The results of the 1968 election, which Richard Nixon won with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Hubert Humphrey and 46 for George Wallace, seemed to confirm Phillips’ analysis. The Wallace voters, he predicted, would in short order logically migrate to the Republican Party, giving them a clear electoral majority; a “substantial Negro vote,” he pointedly noted, “is not necessary to national Republican victory.”[1] When Nixon was re-elected in a historic landslide in 1972 by a margin of 23 points, Phillips’ case for an emerging Republican majority seemed compelling.The Watergate scandals temporarily derailed the trend towards a Republican majority, and Jimmy Carter, a centrist born-again Southerner with considerable appeal in the states of the old confederacy, managed to win a close election in 1976. But the realignment already visible in 1968 was resoundingly confirmed in 1980, when Ronald Reagan won a decisive victory—489 electoral votes to 49—over the incumbent Carter. The 1980 election did more than signal an electoral realignment, for it also marked the arrival of a transformational presidency that would fundamentally change the boundaries of both policy and political discourse.With his simple formula of low taxes, small government, and a strong national defense, Reagan had constructed a resonant alternative to the long-reigning New Deal ideology. To be sure, Reagan’s appeal was not devoid of racial dog whistles; he had, after all, chosen to launch his 1980 presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi—the very place where three civil rights workers had been brutally murdered just 16 years earlier. In any event, Reagan’s combination of neoliberal economic policy and fierce opposition to Soviet communism proved immensely popular. When in 1984 he decimated Walter Mondale, a Democrat friendly to labor unions and widely perceived as an advocate of “big government,” by a margin of 525 to 13 in the electoral college, the last vestiges of the New Deal coalition had been swept away.Dilemma for the DemocratsHaving lost four of the last five elections, three of them by enormous margins, Democrats faced a genuine dilemma: how were they to regain the White House in the face of a formidable Republican juggernaut? The answer that began to emerge in the wake of Mondale’s defeat came in the form of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), a business-friendly movement within the Democratic Party that advocated a “third way” between the right-wing conservatism of Ronald Reagan and the liberalism of the New Deal and its heir, the Great Society. Founded in 1985 and emphasizing market-based, non-bureaucratic solutions to public problems and a hardline approach to foreign policy, the DLC did not offer an alternative to the neoliberalism of Reagan and Thatcher, but implicitly endorsed its central premises. Calling for less regulation of business and reduced reliance on large-scale government programs, the New Democrats advocated reduced welfare benefits, less progressive tax policies, and tough measures to combat crime, including stiffer prison sentences. Receiving a powerful boost from the decisive defeat of Michael Dukakis, a technocratic Northern liberal, by George H W Bush in the 1988 election, the DLC’s brand of soft neoliberalism was soon to become the ideology of the dominant wing of the Democratic Party.Bill Clinton’s ascent to the leadership of the DLC in 1990 and his successful 1992 campaign for the presidency marked a turning point in the transformation of the Democratic Party into the corporate-friendly—and corporate-dependent—entity that was unable to defeat Donald Trump in 2016. Yet there is no denying Clinton’s singular accomplishment: to get elected and then re-elected after Republicans had controlled the White House for 20 of the previous 24 years.But Clinton’s personal electoral success came at a price. In 1994, the Democrats lost control of both Houses of Congress for the first time in decades, and Clinton chose to embark on a policy of “triangulation” between the Republicans and the Congressional Democrats that moved the Party to the right and alienated the activist base of the party. As part of this strategy of triangulation, Clinton sponsored and signed crime and welfare bills that, as Michelle Alexander documented, had disastrous effects on black America.As befit a New Democrat, Clinton in 1993 expended enormous political capital to gain passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) against fierce opposition within the Democratic Party. He also reneged on a major campaign pledge that linked removal of China’s “most favored nation” status as a trading partner to improvement in its record on human rights. In his second term, President Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act, a measure that repealed the Glass-Steagall Act which separated commercial and investment banking and which furthered the deregulation of Wall Street—legislation that many analysts believe contributed to the financial meltdown of 2008. And in 2000, after having successfully lobbied for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, he convinced Congress to establish permanent normal trading relations with China—an act that contributed to the loss of as many as 2.4 million manufacturing jobs in the United States. Far from repudiating the neoliberal economic policies initiated by Ronald Reagan, the Clinton presidency extended them into new domains.Obama’s Thwarted AspirationsThen, after an eight-year period of Republican rule under George W. Bush, who left office with one of the lowest approval ratings in modern history, Barack Obama won the White House in 2008 with the enthusiastic support of a multiracial coalition demanding fundamental—albeit not clearly defined—“change.” In an interview with the editorial board of the Reno Gazette-Journal ten months before he was elected, then-candidate Obama observed that “Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not, that Bill Clinton did not,” adding that Reagan “put us on a fundamentally different path.” The message was clear: unlike Hillary Clinton, his foe in the battle for the Democratic nomination, Obama aspired to be a genuinely transformational president.Eight years on, we can see that the Obama presidency proved neither transformational nor realigning. Coming into office in the midst of the gravest economic crisis since the Great Depression, his first task was to avoid a total collapse. In confronting this task, Obama departed from one key neoliberal orthodoxy, rejecting austerity and sponsoring a $800 billion stimulus package that helped avert a second Great Depression. But in other regards, he followed neoliberal dogma: studiously avoiding any policies that might undermine “business confidence” and attending solicitously to the needs of capital, including the powerful financial institutions responsible for the crisis.Thanks to WikiLeaks, we now know that Obama was seeking and following the advice of Wall Street even before he was elected; in a remarkable email dated October 6, 2008, Michael Fromer, an executive at Citigroup, wrote John Podesta, co-chair of Obama’s transition team (and in 2016 the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign), with a list of candidates for 31 cabinet-level positions as “recommended by various sources for senior level jobs.” The list bore a striking resemblance to the names that ended up in the cabinet, including Eric Holder (Attorney General), Robert Gates (Defense), Rahm Emmanuel (Chief of Staff), and Peter Orszag (Office of Management and Budget). For Treasury, the list had only three names: Timothy Geithner, Larry Summers, and Robert Rubin. In the end, Geithner became Secretary of Treasury, Summers Director of the National Economic Council, and Rubin a trusted informal advisor.Taking his cues from Wall Street, Obama advocated a policy notably friendly to the nation’s deeply unpopular major financial institutions: a gigantic taxpayer-funded bailout and a decision not to prosecute a single Wall Street executive for any transgressions committed in the lead-up to the crisis. At the same time, the Obama administration did little for the many millions of people who lost their homes and pensions as a result of the crash. In response, growing public outrage at the gentle treatment of Wall Street and the conspicuous lack of assistance offered to its victims, coupled with the rise of the Tea Party and the emergence of fierce opposition to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the Democrats suffered a massive defeat in the mid-term elections, losing 64 seats in the House of Representatives and 10 seats in the Senate.In the 2012 presidential election, Obama again succeeded in cobbling together a coalition that, like Bill Clinton’s, was just strong enough to win him re-election, though this time by a margin of under 4 percent. But Democrats again suffered serious setbacks in the mid-term election of 2014, losing 13 seats in the House and 7 in the Senate. Having been swept into office in 2008 with the largest Democratic majority in the House and Senate since 1964, Obama had by 2014 managed to lose control of both Houses of Congress by considerable margins. Signs of Popular AngerThis was the political landscape when Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for president in April 2015. The warning signs should have been evident: the Democrats had been roundly rejected in the two most recent mid-term elections, the economic recovery was still sluggish, and the emergence of the Tea Party on the right and Occupy Wall Street and other insurgent movements on the left seemed to suggest roiling popular discontent. Into this atmosphere of widespread dissatisfaction with the direction of the country stepped the former Secretary of State, Senator from New York, and First Lady—the very embodiment of the status quo at a moment of clamorous demand for change.The primary process in the Republican and Democratic parties quickly revealed seething populist anger against the Establishment on both the right and the left. But the response of party elites to popular insurgencies was very different; while the Republican Establishment, which despised Trump, proved unable to unify behind an alternative candidate and deny him the nomination, the Democratic Party establishment, deploying the ostensibly neutral Democratic National Committee and systematically enlisting major donors as well as its numerous allies in the media, succeeded in quashing a surprisingly strong left insurgency from Bernie Sanders. Nevertheless, the 74-year-old Sanders—a professed democratic socialist calling for a “political revolution”—won 22 states and 43 percent of the primary vote.For those who cared to look, by January 2016—even before a single primary vote had been cast—troubling signs about Clinton’s presidential prospects were everywhere visible: a majority of voters viewed her unfavorably, a far stronger majority viewed her as not “honest or trustworthy,” and a narrow majority viewed her as not caring “about the needs and problems of people like you”—the latter finding almost unprecedented among Democratic candidates.[2] Equally troubling, Clinton polled poorly on each of these items with independents, a group whose votes would be critical in the November election.Under ordinary circumstances, numbers like these would have been fatal for someone seeking a party’s presidential nomination. But the Democratic Party elite—its donors, its operatives, and the elected officials who comprise the “super-delegates”—had long since decided it was Hillary Clinton’s rightful turn. So, too, had President Obama, who quietly discouraged a possible Joe Biden candidacy and subtly placed his thumb on the scale on behalf of Hillary Clinton during her bitter and protracted primary battle with Sanders. What happened on November 8 cannot be understood apart from the decision of the Party Establishment to stick with Hillary in a year of mounting populist anger.‘Any sense of her core message?’The Clinton campaign was delighted to find Donald Trump as the sole remaining obstacle to the White House—he had, after all, said numerous outrageously racist, xenophobic, and misogynistic things during the primaries, and his erratic behavior had, their extensive focus-groups assured them, convinced the public that he was “temperamentally unfit” to be president. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign—unlike the Trump and Sanders campaigns—struggled to find a message, testing 85 different slogans and finally settling on the insipid “Stronger Together.” So devoid of content was the campaign that a plaintive Joel Benenson, Clinton’s chief pollster, was reduced to emailing campaign chairman John Podesta in February of this year: “Do we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be?”Though Clinton for years had her eyes on the presidency, coming painfully close in 2008, her behavior in the two years after her term as Secretary of State ended in January 2013 needlessly put at risk her chances as well as those of the Democratic Party. In less than 24 months between 2013 and the beginning of 2015, Hillary Clinton was paid $21.7 million for delivering 92 speeches—this was in addition to the $104.9 million that Bill Clinton had received for 542 speeches given since he left office in January 2001.[3] The great majority of these speeches were to audiences at some of America’s largest private corporations, and some of them—the three speeches to Goldman Sachs at $225,000 per appearance are simply the best known—were delivered at the very Wall Street firms implicated in the economic collapse of 2008.Not all of Clinton’s speeches, however, were to private corporations; one prominent example of a speech to a non-profit institution was at the financially strapped University of California at Los Angeles in March 2014. Clinton’s fee for her speech at UCLA was $300,000; when officials there requested a reduced rate for public universities, they were told by Clinton’s representatives that $300,000 was the “special university rate.”In the presidential campaign of 2012, Barack Obama portrayed Mitt Romney as a heartless plutocrat who outsourced the jobs of American workers, and this appeal helped him win enough support in the white working class to carry Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan. Donald Trump, a multi-billionaire who has a long record of exploiting undocumented workers and stiffing small contractors, was a ripe candidate for similar attacks. But Hillary Clinton, who had collected gigantic fees from corporate America and whose campaign was being heavily funded by Wall Street, was not the right candidate to make such charges stick.[4] No small part of her campaign’s ultimate failure was rooted in her inability to plausibly launch this line of attack.[5]Perhaps realizing that she was ill-suited to make a populist appeal to those left behind by globalization and de-industrialization, the Clinton campaign instead embarked on an identity-based strategy of reassembling the Obama coalition. The main target groups of this strategy were African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, millennials, and white women. But this strategy was no substitute for a clear message. In the end, the decidedly uncharismatic Clinton was unable to fully reassemble the Obama coalition, winning by strong majorities but smaller margins in virtually every group compared to Obama v. Romney in 2012: African-Americans (88-8 v. 93-6), Latinos (65-29 v. 71-27), Asian-Americans (65-29 v. 71-27), and millennials (55-37 v. 60-37).The one exception was women, and even here—despite concerted targeting and Donald Trump’s numerous egregiously sexist remarks and several highly-publicized accusations of sexual assault—the gain was a mere one point (54-42 v. 55-44). Women, who comprise 52 percent of the electorate, simply did not vote the way the Clinton campaign had projected. Though the gender gap was real, women voted more on the basis of race and class, with white women favoring Trump 53 to 43 and white women without college degrees voting for Trump by a stunning margin of 67 to 28. Even among white women with college degrees, thought by the campaign to be a key Clinton constituency, Trump lost by just 45 to 51.The Clinton campaign’s single-minded emphasis on diversity over social class was evident in a memo on the choice of vice president released by Wikileaks. In a March 17 email, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta wrote that he had “organized names into rough food groups,” beginning with Latinos, then women (all white), then African-Americans (all male). Also listed were white men (the group from which Tim Kaine was ultimately selected) and token groups of military and business leaders. But group mobilization often produces group counter-mobilization, a point emphasized by Thomas Edsall, who observed that “Clinton’s efforts to appeal to individual demographic groups fueled the retaliatory backlash that Trump capitalized on to make incremental but decisive gains.”Nevertheless, at the national level, Clinton’s strategy of assembling a diversity-based coalition worked reasonably well; she did, after all, win the popular vote by a margin of more than 2.8 million. But American elections are decided by the electoral college, and this requires winning enough states to garner 270 electoral votes. This is where Clinton’s strategy failed, and the place where it did so is clear: the industrial states of the “rust belt.”The first step toward understanding why Trump won Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan is to acknowledge that he had a clear and resonant message. Departing from Republican orthodoxy, Trump relentlessly attacked “free trade” deals such as NAFTA and TPP, the failure to secure the border and the presence in America of millions of undocumented (or, as he preferred to call them, “illegal”) immigrants, and U.S. involvement in unnecessary wars like Iraq and Libya. Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again,” his emphasis on “America First” (despite its unfortunate historical associations), and his repeated references to “forgotten Americans” were tailor-made to appeal to the white working-class populations of the upper Midwest. Sixty-four electoral votes were at stake, and it was here that he won the election.The White Working-Class RevoltsMany analysts have blamed Clinton’s loss on the pervasive presence of racism and xenophobia in the white working class, and there is no shortage of survey evidence showing that Trump supporters were more likely to exhibit racist and xenophobic attitudes than those who voted for other candidates.[6] But it is also worth remembering that an African-American named Barack Hussein Obama was victorious in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan in both 2008 and 2012, often by comfortable margins; indeed, many of the white working-class counties critical to Trump’s victory had twice voted heavily for Obama. Interestingly, even African-Americans were not immune to the 2016 trend towards Trump in these rust belt states, with the Democratic margins among blacks declining modestly in each of them.[7]But the main force behind Trump’s victory in these four critical industrial states was undeniably the white working class. In each of these states, white non-college educated men voted overwhelmingly for Trump: 71-26 in Pennsylvania, 70-26 in Ohio, 69-26 in Wisconsin, 68-24 in Michigan. And non-college educated white women, too, voted heavily for Trump, though not quite as decisively as men: 58-38 in Pennsylvania, 55-41 in Ohio, 56-40 in Wisconsin, and 57-38 in Michigan. This was a genuine working-class revolt.In an eerily prescient article written in July of this year, the filmmaker Michael Moore, himself a native of Flint, Michigan, predicted that Trump would win the election by focusing on “the four states of the rust belt of the upper Great Lakes—Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.” “From Green Bay to Pittsburgh,” he wrote, “this, my friends, is the middle of England, broken, depressed, struggling, the smokestacks strewn across the countryside with the carcass of what we used to call the middle class.” “Angry, embittered working (and nonworking) people… [feel] abandoned by the Democrats.” In truth, Hillary Clinton made little effort to speak to these people, not visiting Wisconsin even once during the campaign while making a futile trip to Arizona in search of Latino voters who failed in the end to tip this traditionally Republican state to the Democrats. Meanwhile, the objective circumstances of the working class continue to deteriorate; between 1975 and 2014, the median incomes of white male workers without a college degree declined by more than 20 percent (after adjusting for inflation), with a drop of 14 percent in the seven years between 2007 and 2014.Contempt for Trump SupportersBut the Democrats’ problem with the white working class goes well beyond its failure to enact policies that protect its economic interests. For there is a powerful cultural dimension to the flight of less educated whites from the Democratic Party that is rooted in a feeling—not without justification—that many of its leading elements look down on them. This elemental feeling that they are not viewed by Democratic elites with dignity and respect was amply confirmed by Hillary Clinton’s now-famous remarks at a gala LGBT fundraiser in New York City. In it, she said that “you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic―you name it,” adding that some of them are “irredeemable.” These comments–and the laughter from the well-heeled audience–confirmed to Trump supporters that many Democrats hold them in contempt. According to Diane Hessan, whose special assignment for the Clinton campaign was to interview 250 undecided voters and to stay in touch with them over the course of the campaign, this was the moment—more than FBI Director James Comey’s remarks, more than the emails, and more than Bill Clinton’s visit with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the tarmac—when undecided voters shifted to Trump.Having since the 1980s joined rather than resisted the move toward neoliberalism and having adopted a pro-corporate stance, the Democratic Party now finds itself in a crisis that is simultaneously political, economic, and cultural. After the electoral debacle of 2016, the Party is in a profoundly weakened state, with Republicans controlling not only the presidency, the House of Representatives, the Senate and (soon) the Supreme Court, but also 31 of 50 governorships, 35 state senates, and 32 state assemblies. The Democratic Party must now face the discomfiting reality that Obama’s two victories veiled serious underlying weaknesses; since his sweeping victory in 2008, Democrats have lost 64 seats in the House and 11 in the Senate.But political trends in the United States can reverse themselves with astonishing rapidity; Johnson’s 23-point victory over Goldwater in 1964 was followed by Nixon’s victory in 1968, and Nixon’s 23-point victory over McGovern was followed by Carter’s victory in 1976. Though the shock of defeat is still fresh, there are early signs that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party may be gaining strength. In the battle over leadership of the Democratic National Committee, a leading candidate is Keith Ellison of Minnesota, co-chair of the Progressive Caucus in the House of Representatives and an African-American Muslim. And it is already clear that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders will be among the democratic party’s most influential figures.In the United States and abroad, 2016 was a year of populist revolt. As John Judis noted in an incisive new book, The Populist Explosion, populist movements are an early warning system of real problems that the major parties have downplayed or ignored.[8] But left-wing and right-wing populism are fundamentally different. Left-wing populism is dyadic and champions “the people against an elite or establishment”; right-wing populism is triadic and champions “the people against an elite that they accuse of coddling a third group, which can consist for example, of immigrants, Islamists, or African-American militants.” In 2016, Trump’s right-wing populism was triumphant, first in the Republican primaries and then in the general election. But unlike many European countries, there was a politically viable left-wing alternative in the form of the candidacy of Bernie Sanders. And had Sanders been nominated, he might well have won. Though there is no way of knowing how a Sanders v. Trump election would have played out, a nationally representative poll of 1638 registered voters taken just days before the election showed Sanders beating Trump by 12 points, 56 to 44.[9]At Clinton’s rallies in the closing days of a campaign notably lacking in inspiration, the speakers would often blare with the sounds of Andra Day’s stirring pop anthem, “Rise Up.” The 2016 election did witness an uprising, but it was not the one that the Clinton campaign had anticipated. What Democrats now need to ponder is whether the uprising in their own party might, in this year of the outsider, have been the best path to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.***[1] Kevin P Phillips.

She was already unconscious and had stopped breathing. At the time, she was being supervised by her father, who was doing a great job with our two kids at my son’s Pokémon-themed 6th birthday party. He thought she was safe for a moment while he turned around to look at our son. In fact, she wasn’t even in the water yet. She did what he didn’t anticipate… she went under a railing and dropped straight into the pool… without a splash.In the midst of cleaning up from my son’s party, I walked over to the large pool to help a little boy find his mum, when I walked straight into the most distressing scene I had ever laid eyes upon. It was my daughter drowning, with only her pink goggles on her forehead as an indication of where she was in the pool. There was no splashing, no screaming, no arms waving, it was a silent scene. I saw my husband (her father) frantically trying to get to her, but unfortunately by the time he reached her she was unconscious and no longer breathing. In just 19 seconds.I watched in horror as he laid her down next to the pool, her body seemed lifeless. My husband who is a GP, and two other friends, a doctor and a nurse, were all tending to her as I knelt next to my little girl, my hands over my face because I could not bear to see what was unfolding in front of me. Moments before they would start CPR, she began to scream on her own. I held her, and could never imagine letting her go again. She recovered very rapidly and was eating lollies from the party bags within 30 minutes, but we were lucky. So, so lucky. If my husband had been distracted for even five more seconds, or couldn’t spot her in that sea of playing children, a different ending may have resulted.The days to follow were full of both tremendous pain for my husband and I from the guilt and the “what ifs,” as well as tremendous gratefulness that she was still here. We became immediately proactive, as I didn’t want any of us to be carrying this fear and trauma into the future. We knew the first step was to get her back into the water as soon as possible. As it turns out, my triathlon coach is also a children’s swim instructor at C-Me Swim in Cairns, so I turned to him for advice. He and Rachel Kranz were incredible with my daughter and managed to encourage her back into the pool with enormous patience, kindness, and playfulness just 5 days after the incident. By the end of the session, my little fish didn’t even want to get out of the pool with “Mr. Bill.” What a relief! In January both kids will begin swimming lessons at C-Me Swim.My daughter is 3.5 years old, and since I have begun working, finding time to continue with her swimming lessons has been difficult, and I admit, not a priority. The lesson I take from this, is a message that I have already heard a million trillion times before, but didn’t take so seriously until now:SWIMMING LESSONS ARE A PRIORITY. It is the only tool we can give our children to self-equip them for those moments when we are distracted and they are curious. You WILL BE distracted, and it will likely be for more than 19 seconds. It will happen to even the most vigilant of parents and the most obedient of children. No one is immune to what has happened to us. Equip your kids the best that you can. You see…I only saw a paddling pool, cake, and presents. I didn’t think for a moment that at my own son’s birthday party, where I had thought out EVERY single detail beforehand, that I would have nearly lost my daughter in a drowning incident. SUPERVISION requirements change depending on our environment. It turns out my daughter was sufficiently supervised for a quieter scenario, but given this busy birthday party at a busy public pool, both of my kids were under-supervised and at risk.I hope that our story is a learning opportunity for us all."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584d6763120000dc00eeeacd.jpeg?cache=3LkOO582t6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus on Sunday pushed back against reports that the RNC was hacked in a manner similar to what led to the release of Democratic National Committee emails during the presidential campaign.The Washington Post and The New York Times reported over the weekend that intelligence officials from the CIA and the National Security Agency concluded Russia had in fact intended to help get Donald Trump in the White House. They based that assessment on the fact that the RNC’s computer systems were also compromised, but the hackers did not release the information on those networks. Asked about the reports during a contentious interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Priebus, who has been named Trump’s chief of staff, denied the cyber intrusion and expressed skepticism over whether it had any impact on the election.“The RNC was absolutely not hacked,” Priebus said.“Well, it’s really simple,” he added, when asked to explain the report. “Because when the DNC was hacked, we called the FBI and they came in to help us. And they came in to review what we were doing and went through our systems, went through every single thing that we did.”“I don’t know of any employees, on any of their own Gmail accounts, that was hacked,” he continued. “So what I’m trying to tell you is the RNC was not hacked, number one.”Priebus also objected to the notion that a foreign agent’s intrusion into U.S. entities had influenced the presidential election, telling NBC’s Chuck Todd that “you don’t have any proof that the outcome of the election was changed.”“Forget about who did the hacking,” he added.Four prominent Democratic and Republican senators issued a statement Sunday calling for an investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election, maintaining it must not be allowed to become a partisan issue.“Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyber-attacks,” Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a joint statement.During a separate interview on “Fox News Sunday,” however, Trump once again dismissed the notion that Russia intended to influence the U.S. election.“I think it’s ridiculous. I think it’s just another excuse. I don’t believe it,” he said."

David Vitter.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584c5645120000dd00eeea10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republican John Neely Kennedy easily defeated Democrat Foster Campbell in Saturday’s runoff election for Louisiana’s open Senate seat, marking the official end of the 2016 election.Kennedy, the state treasurer, and Campbell, a public service commissioner, advanced to the runoff election after none of the 23 candidates who ran in November won a majority of the vote. Under the state’s rules, if no candidate wins a majority of the vote, the top two candidates enter a runoff election.The race had far-reaching implications in Washington, D.C. Republicans won control of the Senate last month with a razor thin margin. By picking off a seat in Louisiana, Democrats had hoped to deny the GOP its 52nd vote in the upper chamber and possibly block portions of President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda in the capitol. A closer margin also would have threatened some of his more controversial Cabinet picks, which are subject to confirmation by the Senate.Despite the high stakes of the outcome, Campbell never stood much of a chance. Kennedy led in every poll conducted in the deep red state, which Trump carried by 20 points in November.Even though Campbell out-raised Kennedy by more than $1 million in recent weeks ― much of it from small donors across the country ― the Democrat struggled to generate enthusiasm for his campaign among Louisianans. Even the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which helps fund Democratic Senate campaigns across the U.S., opted against investing in his long-shot bid.With their agenda possibly on the line, Trump’s team took no chances in the last few weeks, dispatching both the president-elect and Vice President-elect Mike Pence to Louisiana to stump on behalf of Kennedy.“He’s a great guy. He’s a good guy. Number one, he’s a good person,” Trump said in Baton Rouge on Friday. “If he doesn’t win, I’ve got myself a problem in Washington.”The president-elect attacked Campbell, casting him as beholden to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “I don’t mean to be rude, but if you took Secretary Clinton upside down and shook her, Foster Campbell would fall out of her pocket,” he said.Campbell played down his differences with Trump during the race, but said he would act as a check on him in Congress. His campaign enlisted the aid of newly elected Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who in a closing ad said Campbell would “stand with the new president when he’s right for Louisiana but has the courage to say no when he’s wrong.”The race seemed to fizzle in the last few weeks, however. The only scheduled debate between the two candidates was called off after their campaigns failed to reach an agreement over the inclusion of a live audience. Late in the race, an ad produced by a super PAC supporting Campbell attacked Kennedy from the right over the issue of abortion. It claimed the Republican once supported abortion. Kennedy denied that, and the ad never seemed to make an impact.Kennedy will succeed retiring Sen. David Vitter (R) in January."

His economic reforms have angered the poor, a bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood has seen thousands jailed, whilst an insurgency rages in Northern Sinai, led by the Egyptian branch of Islamic State.The militant group has also carried out deadly attacks in Cairo and has urged its supporters to launch attacks around the world in recent weeks as it goes on the defensive in its Iraqi and Syrian strongholds.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but exiled Brotherhood officials and home-grown militant groups condemned the attack. Islamic State supporters celebrated on social media.“God bless the person who did this blessed act,” wrote one supporter on Telegram.The explosion took place in a chapel, which adjoins St Mark’s, Cairo’s main cathedral and the seat of Coptic Pope Tawadros II, where security is normally tight.The United States said it “will continue to work with its partners to defeat such terrorist acts” and that it was committed to Egypt’s security, according to a White House statement on Sunday.The UN Security Council urged “all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities” to hold those responsible accountable.At the Vatican, Pope Francis condemned what he called the latest in a series of “brutal terrorist attacks” and said he was praying for the dead and wounded.The chapel’s floor was covered in debris from shattered windows, its wooden pews blasted apart, its pillars blackened. Here and there lay abandoned shoes and sticky patches of blood.“As soon as the priest called us to prepare for prayer, the explosion happened,” Emad Shoukry, who was inside when the blast took place, told Reuters.“The explosion shook the place ... the dust covered the hall and I was looking for the door, although I couldn’t see anything ... I managed to leave in the middle of screams and there were a lot of people thrown on the ground.”Security sources told Reuters at least six children were among the dead, with the blast detonating on the side of the church normally used by women.They said the explosion was caused by a device containing at least 12 kg (26 pounds) of TNT.Police and armored vehicles rushed to the area, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound demanding revenge for the attack that took place on a Muslim holiday marking the Prophet Mohammad’s birthday and weeks before Christmas. Scuffles broke out with police.A woman sitting near the cathedral in traditional long robes shouted, “kill them, kill the terrorists, what are you waiting for? ... Why are you leaving them to bomb our homes?”“EGYPTIAN BLOOD IS CHEAP”Though Egypt’s Coptic Christians have traditionally been supporters of the government, angry crowds turned their ire against Sisi, saying his government had failed to protect them.“As long as Egyptian blood is cheap, down, down with any president,” they chanted. Others chanted “the people demand the fall of the regime,” the rallying cry of the 2011 uprising that helped end Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule.Sisi’s office condemned what it described as a terrorist attack, declaring three days of mourning and promising justice. Al-Azhar, Egypt’s main Islamic center of learning, also denounced the attacks.Orthodox Copts, who comprise about 10 percent of Egypt’s 90 million people, are the Middle East’s biggest Christian community.Copts face regular attack by Muslim neighbors, who burn their homes and churches in poor rural areas, usually in anger over an inter-faith romance or the construction of church.The last major attack on a church took place as worshippers left a New Year’s service in Alexandria weeks before the start of the 2011 uprising. At least 21 people were killed.Egypt’s Christian community has felt increasingly insecure since Islamic State spread through Iraq and Syria in 2014, ruthlessly targeting religious minorities. In 2015, 21 Egyptian Christians working in Libya were killed by Islamic State.The attack came two days after six police were killed in two bomb attacks, one of them claimed by Hasm, a recently-emerged group the government says is linked to the Brotherhood, which has been banned under Sisi as a terrorist organization.The Brotherhood says it is peaceful. Several exiled Brotherhood officials condemned the bombing, as did Hasm and Liwaa’ al-Thawra, another local militant group.Coptic Pope Tawadros II cut short a visit to Greece after learning of the attack. Church officials said they would not allow the bombing to create sectarian differences.But Christians, convinced attacks on them are not seriously investigated, say this time they want justice.“Where was the security?

The recount, which had begun on Monday, was contested in court by President-elect Donald Trump and Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R).“We asked, ‘Do we have a voting system we can trust?’ And we got a resounding ‘no,’” Stein said. “We’ve exhausted what we can do here in Michigan, and I think at this point … we need to fight for those reforms. We need to fight to ensure we have a vote we can count on.”Stein called for the Electoral College to be abolished and for other reforms that would give more power to third party voters, like implementing ranked choice voting and allowing more candidates to participate in presidential debates. She also urged Michiganders to stand up and oppose a restrictive voter ID bill that passed the state House this week.“Going forward we’re going to keep up the fight,” Stein said. “We may be moving out of the court of law, but we’re moving into the court of public opinion. The public opinion is that we deserve democracy.”Anthony Battle was among the crowd of about 50 who came out Saturday to support Stein.“I think she’s the only one out here that’s truly fighting for everybody,” Battle said. He voted for Stein in Macomb County, north of Detroit. President Barack Obama won that county in 2008 and 2012, but Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by more than 11 percentage points.Stein had initiated recount efforts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, three states that Trump won by only a narrow margin. If Clinton were to be judged the actual victor in all three states, she would have enough Electoral College votes to become president. The end to Michigan’s recount has now quashed any faint hope her supporters had that the election results could be overturned, but Stein said she would still be heading to Wisconsin as that state’s recount continues.Stein raised over $7 million from donors to pay for the recounts, a requirement that she said amounted to “economic extortion.”“We shouldn’t have to hold a bake sale on steroids and raise millions of dollars in order to have the assurance that our vote actually counts,” she said.The 3-2 decision in the Michigan Supreme Court upheld the earlier decision of the state Court of Appeals. The justices ruled that Stein, who came in a distant fourth place in the national election, did not meet the state law’s standard for an “aggrieved” party who can call for a recount.Stein argued Saturday that precisely because she has no “skin in this game,” she should be the right person to challenge the election results. She also criticized Clinton for not pushing for a recount herself.“She would have been acknowledged by the court,” Stein said. “She could have assured the people of Michigan that you can have confidence in this vote, or maybe you can’t, but she could have found out and she didn’t.” Stein and others who spoke Saturday highlighted the irregularities that were found during the brief period that the recount was underway.More than half of Detroit precincts discovered discrepancies in the number of overall recorded votes. The city’s elections director blames its aging voting machines, more than 80 of which broke on Election Day, according to the Detroit News. Yet the technicalities of Michigan law actually exclude many of those precincts from a vote recount."

Instead, while pretending to search the crowd, Johnson and Fallon made their way up to the show’s control room where they called Karina’s name, almost immediately bringing her to tears from excitement.“What is happening right now?” she cried out before standing to greet them in disbelief.“I hear you’re a producer on the show and an Army vet,” Johnson told her.Karina met her husband while they were both deployed in Iraq, Johnson shared.“I personally heard that you are the most amazing person,” Johnson added after Todd crept in behind her, “and we wanted to bring your husband home for the holidays. Turn around and hug your husband.”There appeared to be no dry eyes in the control room as Karina turned to find her husband standing behind her, arms opened wide, in his uniform.After a heavy embrace, Karina expressed her shock on how something like this could have been pulled off without her knowing. One of the show’s writers, Mike DiCenzo, later Tweeted out a photo of the segment’s secret script. Its cover was disguised to look like information on Comcast benefits.“Great job by our staff to keep it secret,” DiCenzo tweeted."

John McCain (R-Ariz.) says Republicans and Democrats need to work together to get to the bottom of Russia interference in the U.S. election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584d746e120000dc00eeeaea.jpeg?cache=IK49FPaEPr&ops=crop_0_83_4821_2778%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A growing number of senators on both sides of the aisle are calling for investigations into Russian involvement in the U.S. election process.“I think we need to get to the bottom of it,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said in a Sunday morning interview with ABC’s “This Week. “And I think there should be an investigation because in order to defend ourselves against other adversarial countries, we have to protect our information.”The CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia interfered in the U.S. election not merely to mess around with the democratic system but to more specifically help Donald Trump win the presidency, according to a recent report in The Washington Post. “It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” said a senior U.S. official familiar with the findings. “That’s the consensus view.”On Sunday morning, a bipartisan group of high-ranking senators released a statement underscoring the severity of these revelations and urging Republicans and Democrats to take them seriously.“Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,” read the statement from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an Armed Services Committee member; Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming minority leader for his caucus; and Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee.“This cannot become a partisan issue,” they added. “The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security.”During the election, emails from the Democratic National Committee and the private account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, were hacked and released on WikiLeaks. The DNC emails, in particular, caused turmoil within the party as supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) accused party officials of tipping the scales for Clinton during the primary based on exchanges in the released emails. On NBC’S “Meet the Press” Sunday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said there was “no doubt that the Russians hacked our institutions.”“Plainly they were after discord and in this they were spectacularly successful. But it wasn’t alone to try and sow discord,” Schiff said. “They had a candidate with pro-Putin, pro-Russian views who belittled NATO, who was willing to potentially remove sanctions on Russia ― and by contrast they had in Secretary Clinton a candidate very tough on Russia and who they blamed ... for the protest, the mass demonstrations against the corruption in the Russian elections in 2011.”Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, also said on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday that she supports investigations into Russia.“This should be not only about protecting us going forward but this is a form of warfare for Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a bully and has the friends around the globe that we don’t want to be friends with,” she said, adding, “I’ve had briefings just this last week that indicate that this is a very serious issue for the American people to understand. And for Donald Trump to dismiss out of hand the intelligence community’s fact gathering is, frankly ― doesn’t bode well for him protecting our country.”Trump has repeatedly denied Russia interference and told “Fox News Sunday” that it was “ridiculous” and an “excuse” to undermine his win.“No, I don’t believe that at all,” he said.“Nobody really knows, and hacking is very interesting,” he added. “Once they hack if you don’t catch them in the act you’re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it’s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. I mean, they have no idea.”During the campaign season, Trump consistently praised Russia, even saying during a debate that the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, “has been a leader far more than our president has been.”Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

And wait I did, gladly, for my chance to interview the understanding, cinema-loving, intelligent, poetic and kind Masoud Amralla Al Ali -- the Artistic Director of the Dubai International Film Festival. Since my very first edition of DIFF, I knew I really needed to speak with Al Ali, I felt his insight would illuminate me on everything about this seventh art that brings me so much joy and yet remains in many ways a mystery. His gentle presence I encountered around the world, at press screenings in Cannes, early in the morning at Berlinale, and during the Venice Film Festival. It's a reassuring sign I am sitting in a movie theater waiting for history to be made, in one way or another, when Al Ali is there. Why do I feel this way? It's not something I can put into words -- strange that statement coming from me -- but I know his interview below will make you feel the same way.So, let me try to explain, a little. There is a sense of wonder in what Al Ali, along with the wondrous DIFF team put together year after year. Eight days and nights of uninterrupted cinema magic, a pulsating passion for cinema with a conscience that unites, by bringing together cultures from around the world, different cinematic genres and an array of stars, filmmakers and media that create a perfect storm of creativity. Throughout it all, Al Ali introduces films with what I've come to appreciate are his poetic prefaces, spoken in Arabic then translated perfectly by Reem Owais. In his preludes, Al Ali often talks of bridges and journeys, uses the language of dreams and his unrelenting faith in humanity speaks to me perfectly.For years I've dreamed of sitting down with DIFF's Artistic Director and hearing his own words, asking him the questions I've felt since that first festival for me. Finally, it happened, and as I imagined, it was perfect. So grab a nice cup of tea, snuggle on the couch with a blanket and join me on an interview adventure you'll remember forever.I think what draws me back to DIFF time and time again is what I feel when you talk about films and you talk about how this is a journey. When you introduce films you speak in poetic terms, and I think poetry relates so well to cinema, particularly what I call ""cinema with a conscience"". What is the way that you look at cinema when you are thinking of bringing it to DIFF, what do you look for in a film?Masoud Amralla Al Ali: I look at it in a very simple way, what is human. What talks to the inner side of you, the inner energy you feel. I started with poetry, a long time back, I have written two books. For me, I look at the details, and by details I mean in everything. In the way the director is presenting the film, in the way he framed the film, in the way he chose the dialogue, in the way he picked the subject of the film. Altogether I think a good film imposes itself on you, more than you choose it. Most of the films in the festival, they chose us. Because they have something that really makes you think that this film or this talent will be something in the future.To go back in the history of DIFF from the beginning, we chose so many short films from who today are the permanent directors of the Arab world. So you feel from the beginning that that director has this touch, which is indescribable but is a secret language that you understand without having it be very obvious, And it makes you bet on it. Maybe by watching a lot of films in my life, I have seen tons of films...I would dare say, hundreds of thousands?Al Ali: I'm not sure, my collection at home is almost 80 thousand films. It's interesting to me that you talk of filmmakers more than you talk of stars. DIFF's star power is undeniable, but we were reminded by Thierry Frémaux (pictured above) the other day that Martin Scorsese said something to the effect of when you know the actors in a film you are an audience member but when you can name the filmmakers you are a movie buff. Filmmakers really feel like the stars of this festival, in a deep way. So when do you think ""this is something we'll pass on for DIFF""?Al Ali: Maybe if I didn't find that thing, that spark I think it may not be for DIFF but maybe for other festivals or other places. When that comes, you think the festival will go in this direction and will support this type of filmmakers and films and topics. Sometimes you have films that don't have this topic, but they have other elements that help. For example some of the films from the Emirates. They may not always have that touch but you also want the industry to grow. So each film is picked for a reason. You touched on the industry, which is so important, because the film industry in this part of the world came after the festival. You started this vision -- just as Dubai began forty-five years ago with a vision of building something in the middle of the desert, now a mecca of tourism. What was the vision for the festival?Al Ali: So, the business side has grown, but then you need the culture side to grow as well in conjunction with what is happening. Dubai is moving fast, I feel like somehow we are losing some of our traditions, some of our identity, but then you go through the medium of cinema and you preserve them, you bring them back and you screen them to the wider audiences. Dubai is a cosmopolitan city, you have lots of nationalities living here, but I noticed there was no connection between the locals and the expats. It seemed like they were all in one city but different, they did not communicate. Maybe because it's the nature of the Emiratis themselves, somehow they are not connecting with the others. They are beautifully private is how I see it. In contrast to many cultures of the world including my own, where we are all busybodies, Emiratis are private.Al Ali: That's where cinema comes in, it can break into that privacy. You can see them on the screen and you can understand better how this community is. I think cinema is a powerful medium. It's important to see our stories also. I don't think we should just import the films, we need to send our stories, our images. And not just the media image which is totally different.That media image which throws the entire Arab region into one big pot, without differentiating at all. Al Ali: Exactly. And the stereotypes, are everywhere. The Egyptians have their stereotypes and the Gulf also. Once you have a real filmmaker and you have real stories coming from the heart, from creative people, from ""thinkers"". I call always filmmakers thinkers, more than just technicians. You bring those stories to the wider audience to watch a real story, that's our role in having this festival. In Dubai you now have both, the business and the culture. There is also the Dubai Film and TV commission, which is bringing Hollywood and Bollywood productions here.Al Ali: And the Dubai Film Market is doing a great job, bringing here producers, developing scripts. Many films started from the Dubai Film Connection as a script and I think this is our role, this how we saw it from the beginning, we thought what could be our niche? There are lots of film festivals around the world. There is one every day, the total number is around 5,000 but in Dubai what could we do. We thought we should focus on our identity, that's the secret to being unique, otherwise we'd be just another film festival.And then how to put this Arab content that we have into a context that is international so both can benefit. I always say this is an international film festival with an Arab heart. Something else that is different in this festival, even more in this edition I feel, is the strong presence of female filmmakers, great women's stories and female roles. So the Western media likes to say the Arab world doesn't have great women's rights and all that propaganda, but the reality I find here is very different from that narrative. Do you make a conscious choice of having so many women filmmakers or is it just the way it works out?Al Ali: You know it's very strange that when I go to an international festival, they complain that they don't have enough female filmmakers or on the juries, while as you said correctly, they look at this area thinking women are covered, we abuse them etc. The number of filmmakers who are women is enormous. I started the Emirates Film Competition in Abu Dhabi, the first film festival of the UAE, and most of our filmmakers were female and UAE nationals, which was breaking the tradition. I remember at the first edition, families came to me saying ""please cut the credits because we don't want our daughters, their name to be exposed on the screen."" That was only in 2001. Today the families they are encouraging them to come to the festival. I think there is something natural happening, the growth of female filmmakers and there is a movement -- not a movement that is organized but of women who want to express visions and their identity. It's undeniable that their presence at this festival is double or triple what it is at other festivals.Al Ali: There are reasons behind it, maybe one of them is being a young society, they are more daring, more educated, more understanding and they want to prove themselves in a way. They didn't face the challenges that we had in the past. For example, for me cinema was forbidden in the family. If I'm a male and I couldn't watch films because they were ""haram"" so I understand for women it would be even harder. But nowadays when everything has been changed and more educated young generations are coming out, I think cinema has become something in your blood, in your normal life. You are holding your mobile to record this interview, but you can also film. So the tools became easier. At the same time for me when I see a film I don't see the identity of whether it's female or male. But sometimes you feel like, wow! In this edition we have three short films directed by female Qatari filmmakers, four films by Saudi female filmmakers, more films from Emirati female filmmakers. That only shows that societies are changing and it's not the West or the East, it's about creativity and how open you are and how ready you are. I was always questioning myself, why we don't have these strong female filmmakers in the West. Why?It's so much harder to break that glass ceiling in the West.Al Ali: Why?Perhaps because there is a glass ceiling that is not present here. Perhaps as you said cinema was ""haram"" for everyone and both girls and boys, as they came forward faced the same challenges and broke that barrier at the same time...Al Ali: That leads me to another question. If you have freedom and you won't be creative, that's also a problem. But I think freedom may not always be the best environment for creativity. Throughout history, great works of art have come out of persecution. I've seen it in my own family. Creativity is fueled by a sense of struggle.Al Ali: I agree. That reminds me of a question that Louis Malle was asked, asking if he had unlimited freedom and an unlimited budget what film would he make. And he said ""nothing"". What is the first film you remember watching?Al Ali: Let me tell you, my father in the '70s was really open minded. I don't know what happened in our society that all of a sudden in the early '80s they became more conservative -- they didn't used to be like this. So my father used to take me on his back, walking down the dark alleys to go to the movie theater to make me watch movies on a very bright big screen theater. I remember this relationship between shadows and light since I was six or seven years old. I don't remember which one, but I remember very well Star Wars. How appropriate that you are closing this year's festival with Rogue One! I remember Dumbo, on a Super 8. And Ludwig by Luchino Visconti.Al Ali: And then later on, when Betamax came into homes, cinema stopped in the UAE totally. It died. Until the mid-Nineties. I was unlucky I was in that period. I could not watch movies on the big screen, I used to watch them on tapes. It was a struggle. In my childhood, I remember when I used to go to cinemas, before they shut down, there was an open air cinema in Satwa. And there smoking was allowed. My relationship with film was totally disturbed. I used to watch films through smoke. There were people in front of me smoking and you would see the film through clouds of smoke, the screen behind. I would look for the image, where is the image... Then everything stopped, and I had to watch films on video and at that time we didn't have copyright laws and films had been pirated, bad quality. All my relationship with cinema was this disturbed image, not clear, not real cinema. Until I started traveling to festivals and watching cinema around thirty years ago. Cinema wasn't my goal, it was always poetry. But then I discovered in cinema the ultimate poetry, which I didn't know, I thought poetry could only be in a text. You have virtual reality here, episodes from Westworld, all these different medium living side by side with the films. Where do you see us watching films in five years at DIFF?Al Ali: In theaters. Cinema will remain this medium, what is happening with the technology will only benefit cinema, give more possibilities to create. Personally, I'm not against VR but I'm not a fan of VR. It's like digital, when that came, everyone was against it and now everyone is shooting in digital. Is there a film you go back to when your soul needs a little bit of healing and you need a reminder of the good of humanity?Al Ali: I have a couple of films but one that still shakes me, it's Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors by [Sergei] Parajanov. This film I have always had a connection with, and I don't know why.Photos by Getty Images, courtesy of DIFF and used with permission. "
69,ENTERTAINMENT,"""An International Film Festival with an Arab Heart"": Masoud Amralla Al Ali Opens Up About Dubai Film Fest","E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-international-film-fes_b_13560356.html,,2016-12-11,2016-12-11-1481443485-2911314-150146_gal_968_645_686306427BD00025_2016_Dubai.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-11-1481443485-2911314-150146_gal_968_645_686306427BD00025_2016_Dubai-thumb.JPG,"Good things come to those who wait, they say. And wait I did, gladly, for my chance to interview the understanding, cinema-loving, intelligent, poetic and kind Masoud Amralla Al Ali -- the Artistic Director of the Dubai International Film Festival. Since my very first edition of DIFF, I knew I really needed to speak with Al Ali, I felt his insight would illuminate me on everything about this seventh art that brings me so much joy and yet remains in many ways a mystery. His gentle presence I encountered around the world, at press screenings in Cannes, early in the morning at Berlinale, and during the Venice Film Festival. It's a reassuring sign I am sitting in a movie theater waiting for history to be made, in one way or another, when Al Ali is there. Why do I feel this way? It's not something I can put into words -- strange that statement coming from me -- but I know his interview below will make you feel the same way.So, let me try to explain, a little. There is a sense of wonder in what Al Ali, along with the wondrous DIFF team put together year after year. Eight days and nights of uninterrupted cinema magic, a pulsating passion for cinema with a conscience that unites, by bringing together cultures from around the world, different cinematic genres and an array of stars, filmmakers and media that create a perfect storm of creativity. Throughout it all, Al Ali introduces films with what I've come to appreciate are his poetic prefaces, spoken in Arabic then translated perfectly by Reem Owais. In his preludes, Al Ali often talks of bridges and journeys, uses the language of dreams and his unrelenting faith in humanity speaks to me perfectly.For years I've dreamed of sitting down with DIFF's Artistic Director and hearing his own words, asking him the questions I've felt since that first festival for me. Finally, it happened, and as I imagined, it was perfect. So grab a nice cup of tea, snuggle on the couch with a blanket and join me on an interview adventure you'll remember forever.I think what draws me back to DIFF time and time again is what I feel when you talk about films and you talk about how this is a journey. When you introduce films you speak in poetic terms, and I think poetry relates so well to cinema, particularly what I call ""cinema with a conscience"". What is the way that you look at cinema when you are thinking of bringing it to DIFF, what do you look for in a film?Masoud Amralla Al Ali: I look at it in a very simple way, what is human. What talks to the inner side of you, the inner energy you feel. I started with poetry, a long time back, I have written two books. For me, I look at the details, and by details I mean in everything. In the way the director is presenting the film, in the way he framed the film, in the way he chose the dialogue, in the way he picked the subject of the film. Altogether I think a good film imposes itself on you, more than you choose it. Most of the films in the festival, they chose us. Because they have something that really makes you think that this film or this talent will be something in the future.To go back in the history of DIFF from the beginning, we chose so many short films from who today are the permanent directors of the Arab world. So you feel from the beginning that that director has this touch, which is indescribable but is a secret language that you understand without having it be very obvious, And it makes you bet on it. Maybe by watching a lot of films in my life, I have seen tons of films...I would dare say, hundreds of thousands?Al Ali: I'm not sure, my collection at home is almost 80 thousand films. It's interesting to me that you talk of filmmakers more than you talk of stars. DIFF's star power is undeniable, but we were reminded by Thierry Frémaux (pictured above) the other day that Martin Scorsese said something to the effect of when you know the actors in a film you are an audience member but when you can name the filmmakers you are a movie buff. Filmmakers really feel like the stars of this festival, in a deep way. So when do you think ""this is something we'll pass on for DIFF""?Al Ali: Maybe if I didn't find that thing, that spark I think it may not be for DIFF but maybe for other festivals or other places. When that comes, you think the festival will go in this direction and will support this type of filmmakers and films and topics. Sometimes you have films that don't have this topic, but they have other elements that help. For example some of the films from the Emirates. They may not always have that touch but you also want the industry to grow. So each film is picked for a reason. You touched on the industry, which is so important, because the film industry in this part of the world came after the festival. You started this vision -- just as Dubai began forty-five years ago with a vision of building something in the middle of the desert, now a mecca of tourism. What was the vision for the festival?Al Ali: So, the business side has grown, but then you need the culture side to grow as well in conjunction with what is happening. Dubai is moving fast, I feel like somehow we are losing some of our traditions, some of our identity, but then you go through the medium of cinema and you preserve them, you bring them back and you screen them to the wider audiences. Dubai is a cosmopolitan city, you have lots of nationalities living here, but I noticed there was no connection between the locals and the expats. It seemed like they were all in one city but different, they did not communicate. Maybe because it's the nature of the Emiratis themselves, somehow they are not connecting with the others. They are beautifully private is how I see it. In contrast to many cultures of the world including my own, where we are all busybodies, Emiratis are private.Al Ali: That's where cinema comes in, it can break into that privacy. You can see them on the screen and you can understand better how this community is. I think cinema is a powerful medium. It's important to see our stories also. I don't think we should just import the films, we need to send our stories, our images. And not just the media image which is totally different.That media image which throws the entire Arab region into one big pot, without differentiating at all. Al Ali: Exactly. And the stereotypes, are everywhere. The Egyptians have their stereotypes and the Gulf also. Once you have a real filmmaker and you have real stories coming from the heart, from creative people, from ""thinkers"". I call always filmmakers thinkers, more than just technicians. You bring those stories to the wider audience to watch a real story, that's our role in having this festival. In Dubai you now have both, the business and the culture. There is also the Dubai Film and TV commission, which is bringing Hollywood and Bollywood productions here.Al Ali: And the Dubai Film Market is doing a great job, bringing here producers, developing scripts. Many films started from the Dubai Film Connection as a script and I think this is our role, this how we saw it from the beginning, we thought what could be our niche? There are lots of film festivals around the world. There is one every day, the total number is around 5,000 but in Dubai what could we do. We thought we should focus on our identity, that's the secret to being unique, otherwise we'd be just another film festival.And then how to put this Arab content that we have into a context that is international so both can benefit. I always say this is an international film festival with an Arab heart. Something else that is different in this festival, even more in this edition I feel, is the strong presence of female filmmakers, great women's stories and female roles. So the Western media likes to say the Arab world doesn't have great women's rights and all that propaganda, but the reality I find here is very different from that narrative. Do you make a conscious choice of having so many women filmmakers or is it just the way it works out?Al Ali: You know it's very strange that when I go to an international festival, they complain that they don't have enough female filmmakers or on the juries, while as you said correctly, they look at this area thinking women are covered, we abuse them etc. The number of filmmakers who are women is enormous. I started the Emirates Film Competition in Abu Dhabi, the first film festival of the UAE, and most of our filmmakers were female and UAE nationals, which was breaking the tradition. I remember at the first edition, families came to me saying ""please cut the credits because we don't want our daughters, their name to be exposed on the screen."" That was only in 2001. Today the families they are encouraging them to come to the festival. I think there is something natural happening, the growth of female filmmakers and there is a movement -- not a movement that is organized but of women who want to express visions and their identity. It's undeniable that their presence at this festival is double or triple what it is at other festivals.Al Ali: There are reasons behind it, maybe one of them is being a young society, they are more daring, more educated, more understanding and they want to prove themselves in a way. They didn't face the challenges that we had in the past. For example, for me cinema was forbidden in the family. If I'm a male and I couldn't watch films because they were ""haram"" so I understand for women it would be even harder. But nowadays when everything has been changed and more educated young generations are coming out, I think cinema has become something in your blood, in your normal life. You are holding your mobile to record this interview, but you can also film. So the tools became easier. At the same time for me when I see a film I don't see the identity of whether it's female or male. But sometimes you feel like, wow! In this edition we have three short films directed by female Qatari filmmakers, four films by Saudi female filmmakers, more films from Emirati female filmmakers. That only shows that societies are changing and it's not the West or the East, it's about creativity and how open you are and how ready you are. I was always questioning myself, why we don't have these strong female filmmakers in the West. Why?It's so much harder to break that glass ceiling in the West.Al Ali: Why?Perhaps because there is a glass ceiling that is not present here. Perhaps as you said cinema was ""haram"" for everyone and both girls and boys, as they came forward faced the same challenges and broke that barrier at the same time...Al Ali: That leads me to another question. If you have freedom and you won't be creative, that's also a problem. But I think freedom may not always be the best environment for creativity. Throughout history, great works of art have come out of persecution. I've seen it in my own family. Creativity is fueled by a sense of struggle.Al Ali: I agree. That reminds me of a question that Louis Malle was asked, asking if he had unlimited freedom and an unlimited budget what film would he make. And he said ""nothing"". What is the first film you remember watching?Al Ali: Let me tell you, my father in the '70s was really open minded. I don't know what happened in our society that all of a sudden in the early '80s they became more conservative -- they didn't used to be like this. So my father used to take me on his back, walking down the dark alleys to go to the movie theater to make me watch movies on a very bright big screen theater. I remember this relationship between shadows and light since I was six or seven years old. I don't remember which one, but I remember very well Star Wars. How appropriate that you are closing this year's festival with Rogue One! I remember Dumbo, on a Super 8. And Ludwig by Luchino Visconti.Al Ali: And then later on, when Betamax came into homes, cinema stopped in the UAE totally. It died. Until the mid-Nineties. I was unlucky I was in that period. I could not watch movies on the big screen, I used to watch them on tapes. It was a struggle.

For more about me, visit...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-and-russia-will-any_b_13567358.html,It is now apparent that Russia's role in this election is one of the major stories that deserves attention from the media and from American citizens.,2016-12-11,"New York, NY USA - July 16, 2016: Donald Trump speaks during introduction Governor Mike Pence as running for vice president at Hilton hotel Midtown Manhattan",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb83ac4220000ba01dd48fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The revelations about Russia's role in our recent election confirm what many suspected during the campaign. The revelations answer some questions that have been raised in recent days. For example, it is now clear that Jill Stein, who is also cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin, took such an active role in calling for recounts to take attention away from the real story. Similarly, we now know that people like Senator Bob Corker and Mitt Romney, whose views on Russia are firmly in the mainstream of Republican foreign policy opinion, were never really in the running for Secretary of State, but were fodder for media speculation before President-elect Trump decided upon Rex Tillerson, a man with a close relationship with Putin, for that key position.Unfortunately, the story of Russia's involvement in the recently completed campaign raises a lot more questions than it answers. These include how we allowed this to happen, what our diplomatic response should be, whether President Obama should have made this news public earlier and to what extent this taints Donald Trump's victory. The last question is the most important one. Donald Trump won this election by fewer than 100,000 votes in three key states, while losing the popular vote by 2.5 million. In other words, the was a very close race. While we cannot know for certain that enough voters would have changed their mind about Trump if they had known the extent to which he was getting help from the Kremlin, it is a very strong possibility that the vote would have been meaningfully different. The election, however, cannot be redone. Additionally, Donald Trump cannot be retroactively docked votes and thus have the outcome changed. Instead, Trump will assume the presidency under enormous suspicion, but that was going to happen anyway. There are two avenues that can be pursued that might make a difference. The first is a congressional inquiry. Both houses of the next congress, as everybody knows, will be controlled by the Republicans, but that will make the inquiry even more important-if it happens. Already several Republican members of congress have expressed concern over the Trump-Russia connection. The next weeks and months will be the time for them to act on these concerns. If they do, it will likely be damaging to Trump personally, but a sign that there may just be some hope for American political institutions to act as a check on a new President with stated authoritarian goals.The second approach is a more immediate, but more unlikely one. Any progressive who has spent time discussing, or arguing, politics with a conservative has experienced that moment when the conservative triumphantly announces ""it is a republic, not a democracy."" Usually the conservative isn't quite sure what that means, but uses that as a way to explain away some patently anti-democratic policy or institution. For some reason, Trump supporters have stopped saying that in recent days. The reason for that, of course, is that the Electoral College, which is one of those aforementioned undemocratic institutions, meets on December 19th. Members of Electoral College, from some states, are not required by law to vote for the winner of the popular vote in their state. This has been the source of much of the discussion around faithless electors in recent weeks, and the possibility, or hope, that some members of the College of Electors from states that voted for Trump would cast their vote for somebody else because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, or simply because they don't like Donald Trump. That possibility was extremely unlikely but the Russia hacking revelations change that. It is now perhaps only very unlikely, that the Electoral College will fail to certify Donald Trump as the next president, but if this story stays in the news and gets bigger over the next few days, that too could change.It is now apparent that Russia's role in this election is one of the major stories that deserves attention from the media and from American citizens. Responsible media outlets must focus on getting to the bottom of this rather than on obvious distractions such as Rex Tillerson's management style, whether or not Kellyanne Conway will take a job in the White House or even Donald Trump's latest Tweets.The success of this Russian gambit reflects a collective failure on the part of the media, the Republican Party, the administration and the American people. It is now clear that everybody kind of knew about it and either didn't care or assumed Clinton would win and the problem would go away. That strategy did not work and what seemed like the plot of a bad Cold War era thriller is about to become American political reality. The ability of our institutions, and we the people, to respond to this, will go a long way to determining the future of American democracy and sovereignty."
72,ENTERTAINMENT,"Cannes, Popcorn and 'Lumière!': A Conversation with Thierry Frémaux in Dubai","E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cannes-popcorn-and-lumier_b_13564874.html,,2016-12-11,2016-12-11-1481469768-8653294-150153_gal_968_645_6287250201.jpg.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-11-1481469768-8653294-150153_gal_968_645_6287250201.jpg-thumb.jpg,"What if you could take a journey through space and time and find yourself back in 1895 at the very moment of the invention of something so groundbreaking and new, it may seem nearly impossible to imagine? Well, contrary to what it sounds like, this is not the tagline of the latest sci-fi movie, or another sequel to Back to the Future -- it was the easiest way I could grab your attention in presenting the wonder that is Lumière! a cinematic presentation by Thierry Frémaux. For cinema insiders of course Monsieur Frémaux needs no introduction, he is the legendary artistic director of the Festival de Cannes. He is also the director of the Institut Lumière in Lyon, which is where his passion for the inventors of modern cinema, as we know and love it today, comes from. When I use the word passion in his case, I am not throwing it around lightly. His enthusiasm for the films of the Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis, is infectious and now that he's curated them into a full-length film collection that is presented in exclusive settings with his live commentary, he has easily conquered quite a few new fans for the French inventors of the movie camera. Lumière!, which lucky audiences got to experience at the Dubai International Film Festival, is a wondrous voyage. A peek inside a society that although captured more than a century ago -- to be precise from 1895 to 1905 -- still lives on in its humanity. The short films of little boys and girls hamming it up for the camera, the ""first special effects"", as Frémaux joked commenting on a film that shows a wall being destroyed, played forward and then backwards, the Lyon of circa 1895, those glimpses feel like a precious commodity. And it doesn't hurt to be accompanied on that journey by Frémaux's wonderful soft tone and charming French accent.As an extra treat, as if watching Lumière! wasn't enough, I got to sit and chat with Frémaux in Dubai and ask him about his film, his passions and of course, Cannes. There was a moment during your screening when you talked about it being the perfect storm. The right moment in time for the Lumière to be coming up with cinema, since so many had been working towards inventing the moving image. So what is the perfect moment in time for cinema now? Thierry Frémaux: That's a very good question because when they invented cinema it was that utopia, a dream. And the dream was really to have people represent themselves by the animated images. And one century and twenty years later, cinema is not the only way to make images of the world. Because we have television and now, the internet... But cinema as an art, cinema as a social practice, is still here and it resists. It resists physically, and a young country like China -- China is a young country of films -- but it's becoming right now the most important country of cinema. It's good that China which is really looking to the future, includes in this future something like cinema. That invention, which is not only making images -- because you can make images, away from cinema -- but that invention which was an art, but also something we share together. What I was saying yesterday it was a good idea at the time because the idea of Thomas Edison was the individual machine. You'd have to put money in and that idea is American. The French guy said, ""lets put everyone in the same room"" so Edison said, ""that's crazy, because what if nobody pays..."" This (he picks up my smartphone) is an individual machine. I can watch a film on a smartphone today. But it's not cinema.Why not?Frémaux: First of all, because if I watch a film with this, and with my headphones on, it's not cinema. I prefer to be with you and say WOW! But isn't that old fashioned?Frémaux: I don't want to say that cinema is totally alone -- but it's included in a big world now. My kids, they are twelve and fourteen, the whole day are on their mobiles, but if I say Saturday night we go to the movies, suddenly they are as excited as if I say we go to the stadium. Watching a game on TV and being in the stadium, I'm talking about football, it's not the same. Cinema is the same. Today in music, because of the piracy, because of the legal downloading, people don't buy anymore CDs. So the music groups, they have to go back, even the Rolling Stones, not only in Cuba, they have to go back on stage. A concert is not a CD, so a film on the big screen is not a film on a smartphone or on my computer, or on the plane. I love to watch films on the plane, especially French films. I am crying because I am lonely, far away from my country. But it's not the same experience than being in the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard or being inside a big screening or here on opening night. Every screening room is something really specific, each country. If I go to Moscow to watch a film there or in China or Paris... When Quentin Tarantino comes to Paris, he has his own theater. It's like a need, he needs to go there. That is cinema.Do you sometimes watch films in different countries, the same film, do you like to do that?Frémaux: For Cannes you mean?Or for example watch an American film in Paris.Frémaux: Oh yeah I do that. But for example I hate popcorn, except in America. I love to have people eating popcorn around me when I'm in New York or Los Angeles, or in Chicago. I hate it in Paris, because in Paris it's an imitation of America. In America, it is America. What Netflix is doing now, long episodes of their series, do you think that threatens cinema?Frémaux: If we mention the TV series, it's the golden age of that. And it's wonderful but for two things. First, why I'm waiting for a story told in 18 hours when I can see a wonderful story told in one hour and a half? Second, it's great actors, great makers but it's a TV series. Put a TV series in a screening room and I'm not sure it works. Cinema is cinema, there is something quite demanding about being in a movie theater. One of the issues of TV will be to make films of two hours, and that would be quite dangerous for cinema. It would really be the same thing.Film and music have the biggest impact on us in our teenage years. What was your relationship to film in your teenage years?Frémaux: Like everyone on earth, everyone loves cinema when you are ten, twelve, fourteen, and you go to the movies with friends. And then around sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, little by little you are separated from your friends because they still go to watch bullshit commercial stuff and, as Martin Scorsese used to say, once you know a name of a director you are a movie buff. Because when you are young of course, you know actors or actresses but a filmmaker, as Capra used to call it, ""the name above the title,"" then you are a buff. I think cinema has a lot to say about you. But it's like other passions, like sports or rock and roll. I feel I'm part of the world because this world is mine. That's why it's always connected to your own spirit, cinema. For example in my city, Lyon, I know the city by heart because of cinemas. Even those who disappeared.Do you think filmmakers are the prophets of our times?Frémaux: Artist -- yes. Filmmakers, but also poets and writers. I think more and more. For example, if you take French politics now, and especially the left side, they lost the words and words are very important. Donald Trump didn't lose words. His own words! But he has that. And I think that yes the confrontation with the world needs artists because sometimes you need someone to tell it in another way to you. And sometimes a director, singer, poet, or writer, or even a guy in contemporary art like Jeff Koons shows you something you can't get out by yourself. I think that in every country, every government needs a man in charge of culture but like a court jester -- the ""Fou du Roi"". Out of politics, alone, independent but with money. Someone who says ""no, no Mr. Trump, let me show you something..."" Can you talk a bit about the mystical place that is Cannes, for that week and a half, once a year? Frémaux: Cannes, we forget who we are. We are in Cannes, for two weeks we are there watching films talking films. Sometimes Cannes is criticized for the red carpet, about the juries, but that is made up by people who don't go to Cannes. We all know that in Cannes, from the first coffee in the morning until the last whiskey in the night, the main conversation is cinema. And if you don't watch films during the day, you can't talk about anything. It is like flowers, they need water. Our water in Cannes is watching films. We could stay home, no I don't go to Cannes I'll stay home and watch films on my smartphone... At times it really feels like the place to be, it fills the blood desire.

He was 98 years of age. Bernie spent his life as a journalist and educator. He also authored several outstanding books. But I knew him for his career as a Monuments Man. In 2005, when I chartered a course to tell these heroes' story, Bernie was the first Monuments Man I met; the first to open up and share his wartime experiences. In the years since, I would meet, interview--and become friends with--twenty others, but like most ""firsts,"" the memory of that meeting made a lasting impression. His loss is a painful reminder that within the next five years, most of the World War II veterans--in our country we know them as the ""Greatest Generation""--will be gone. My young son will grow up in a world where these brave men who saved and then changed our world will be known to him in history books, and through recounting my stories. That is an enormous loss for our society, and in the case of Bernie and the other thirteen Monuments Men and Women who have passed, a deeply personal loss for me. My last meeting with Bernie at his home in Berkeley, CA.Born in Scotland to Jewish immigrants from Poland and Romania, Bernie spent the first eleven years of his life living in London. In 1929, following the death of his father, this eleven-year old boy traversed the Atlantic aboard a small merchant ship that passed through the Panama Canal on its way to his new home, that of his grandparents who lived in Los Angeles. Bernie's curious mind was constantly absorbing knowledge: he learned to speak German listening to the radio. His interest in journalism blossomed at a young age. While attending Los Angeles High School he wrote and edited the school's newspaper. At the University of California at Berkeley he served as editor of the university's paper in addition to founding two student magazines. After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in 1943, he began writing articles for Agenda, the San Francisco-based magazine devoted to architecture and public planning. He later moved to New York City, where his journalistic ability flourished at some of the leading publications of the times including The Nation, The New Republic, and The New Yorker.Following the United States' entry into World War II, Bernie was drafted into the U.S. Army. After working briefly in the San Francisco shipyards, he was officially inducted and attached to an anti-aircraft battalion. His unit trained in Death Valley, California, where the desert terrain was intended to prepare them for action against General Rommel's forces in Egypt and the Middle East. When I asked him why his battalion never saw active duty, he chuckled, and then told me that the only thing they ever hit was the plane towing the targets. Taper then enrolled in a thirteen-week Infantry Officer's Training School at Ft. Benning, Georgia, where he became a full United States citizen upon completion. He subsequently returned to the UC Berkeley to teach English to non-English speaking Army personnel.  Lt. Bernard TaperIn early summer 1946, Bernie become a Monuments Man stationed in Germany. He quickly put his journalistic skills to work tracking down leads to find still missing works of art that the Nazis had looted. Bernie worked alongside Monuments Men Edgar Breitenbach and Maj. Karol Estreicher, the Polish art restitution officer. His work with local German police forces created a vast network of information that helped the Monuments Men recover works of art looted from the famed Goudstikker collection, among others. He also pursued works of art belonging to the Adolphe Schloss collection, which the Nazis had stolen and stored in the basement of Hitler's Munich headquarters before mobs broke into the building and emptied it. One his more colorful cases involved hunting down works of art local townspeople in Berchtesgaden had taken from a train filled with objects looted by Nazi Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering. As too often happened during the void--the closing days before and after the official end of the war in Europe--looters had looted the Nazi loot making the work of the Monuments Men even more difficult. In 1948 Bernie visited Spandau prison, where he interrogated prominent Nazi officials including Albert Speer, Heinrich Hoffman, Baldur von Schirach, Walther Funk, Karl Haberstock, and Walter Hofer. Certainly Bernie's most prominent case remains a mystery today: the disappearance of Raphael's Portrait of a Young Man, stolen by the Nazis in 1939 from the Czartoryski collection in Kracow, Poland. Bernie and I discussed this case more than any other topic in our many hours of conversation. This painting, along with Leonardo da Vinci's Lady With an Ermine (also stolen from the Czartoryski collection), were the two most prominent masterpieces in Poland destined for Hitler's planned Führermuseum. When the Monuments Men arrested Nazi Governor-General Hans Frank in early May 1945, they found the Leonardo, but there was no sign of the Raphael. When we last visited at his home in Berkeley, Bernie shared with me his various theories and recounted additional steps he wished he had taken. Sadly, despite his many accomplishments as a Monuments Officer, the missing Raphael haunted Bernie for the rest of his life. Bernie left Germany in August 1948 and resumed his career as a successful journalist. During his service as a Monuments Man, he had continued writing and sent numerous articles back to the United States for publication. Following his years in New York City, Bernie returned to California. He worked for five years as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, during which time he received a Press Club award for his investigation of a housing discrimination case. In 1955 he returned to his academic studies and earned a Master's degree in English from Stanford University. The following year he began an almost forty-year term as a staff writer for the The New Yorker. From 1970 to 1998, in conjunction with his work with The New Yorker, Taper taught the next generation of journalists as Professor at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley.A prolific writer, Bernie wrote numerous books, articles, and columns about subjects relating to the arts, civil rights, and urban affairs. His published works include Balanchine (1963), the authoritative biography of George Balanchine, the New York City Ballet's co-founder and hallmark choreographer, The Arts in Boston (1970), Cellist in Exile: A Portrait of Pablo Casals (1962), and Gomillion versus Lightfoot: The Right to Vote in Apartheid Alabama (1962). Taper also served as editor of the anthology Mark Twain's San Francisco (1963). In 2004 he donated his collection of photographs of George Balanchine to the San Francisco Performing Arts Library & Museum.I have many cherished memories in the company of this fine man. On June 6, 2007, the 63rd anniversary of the D-Day landings, we arranged for Bernie and his wife Gwen to travel to Washington to be present when I announced the creation of the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art. Earlier that day Congress had passed a resolution honoring the Monuments Men and women. Bernie, and three other Monuments Men he was meeting for the first time--Harry Ettlinger, James Reeds, and Horace Apgar--had a chance to be formally recognized for their service by several members of the House and Senate, including Congresswoman Kay Granger, and Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Hillary Clinton. But the prized moment was our visit to the National World War II Memorial. There, walking between the fountains representing the war's two theaters, looking at the names of the most prominent battles, I watched these aged war veterans, including my father, overwhelmed with gratitude to have survived, and grief for all those who did not. In October 2015, Bernie would make one more journey before his death, once again to Washington, D.C., to attend the presentation ceremony of the Congressional Gold Medal honoring the Monuments Men and Women, our nation's highest civilian honor. Four of the seven living Monuments Men and women attended, and nearly two-hundred family members of Monuments Men since passed. Seeing them honored by the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, and praised by the leadership of both parties in Congress, fulfilled a dream I had held dear for nearly ten years. I can only imagine what it meant to them.  The Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony in Washington, D.C. On October 22, 2015 (From left to right: Speaker of the House John Boehner; Monuments Men Harry Ettlinger and Richard Barancik; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; Monuments Woman Motoko Fujishiro Huthwaite; Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; and Monuments Man Bernie Taper)That day, I was honored to be asked to speak about the Monuments Men before this august group. I closed my remarks with a thought about the importance of what men like Bernard Taper had achieved not just for their country, but for people of good will around the world. It bears repeating: ""We live in hope that the wisdom of Monuments Man George Stout, the sacrifices of Monuments Men Balfour and Huchthausen, and the dedication of all those who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives section, will not reside in our memory, rather that they will live on in our hearts to inspire us to do a far better job protecting and preserving those things of knowledge and beauty that we have inherited from the past."" Bernie hated war. Germany's smashed cities embarrassed him. But this only strengthened his resolve to do everything possible to help others by locating and returning works of art and other cultural objects to their rightful owners. Bernie believed that the work of the Monuments Men and Women was a noble endeavor, an undertaking that would reestablish the rule of law and for him at least, make some sense of the destruction that surrounded him. Yes, he was a journalist, and an educator, and an author, but he was also one of the millions of citizen soldiers who helped build and shape the world we have inherited, a world based on basic human decency and shared sacrifice. I miss Bernie; I miss that world.With his death, there are now just six living Monuments Men; four men, and two women, one British.* * *Follow Robert M.

76,BUSINESS,10 Reasons Nice Bosses Finish First,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-reasons-nice-bosses-fi_b_13355210.html,"When it comes to success as a leader, radically tough leadership styles are exceptions to the rule, not the rule.",2016-12-11,2016-12-01-1480619781-6802723-10ReasonsNiceBossesFinishFirstHP,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-01-1480619781-6802723-10ReasonsNiceBossesFinishFirstHP-thumb,"Many bosses assume that a leader needs to be aloof and tough on employees in order to be effective. They fear that looking ""soft"" will erode their employee's motivation and respect for them. To prove their case, they cite examples of brilliant leaders who modeled a tough leadership style and low emotional intelligence, such as Steve Jobs, who berated his employees.When it comes to success as a leader, radically tough leadership styles are exceptions to the rule, not the rule. Recent research has shown that overly tough bosses create significant health and motivation problems in their employees, which will make you think twice about taking the tough-as-nails approach.Overly tough bosses create stress, and lots of it, as the research shows: A University of London study found an especially strong link between heart disease and boss-inflicted stress, while a University of Concordia study found that employees who rate themselves as highly stressed added 46% to their employer's health care costs. Research from the Institute of Naval Medicine found that overly tough bosses cause people to seek jobs elsewhere, to perform at a lower level, to decline promotions, and even to quit. Finally, a survey from Randstad Consulting showed that most employees would trade in their bosses for better ones rather than receive a $5,000 pay raise. People don't leave jobs; they leave bad bosses.The thing is, nice bosses don't just prevent health and motivational problems among their employees; they create massive benefits that hard-nosed bosses can't. A California State Long Beach study found that leaders who treat their teams fairly have far more cohesive and productive teams and that the individuals in those teams perform better. Research from the University of Virginia found that leaders who were considered ""self-sacrificing"" and ""helpful"" were viewed as especially inspirational and motivational and their employees were more helpful to their colleagues and more committed to their teams. So, what exactly does a ""nice"" boss look like, and how does one pull this off without being a push over? Let's find out.  1. They're kind without being weak. One of the toughest things for leaders to master is kindness. It's a balancing act, and the key to finding balance is to recognize that true kindness is inherently strong -- it's direct and straightforward. Telling people the difficult truth they need to hear is much kinder than protecting them (or yourself) from a difficult conversation. This is weak. Also, true kindness doesn't come with expectations. Kindness is thin when you use it in a self-serving manner -- people can see right through kindness when a kind leader has an agenda.2. They're strong without being harsh.Strength is an important quality in a leader. People will wait to see if a leader is strong before they decide to follow his or her lead or not. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show strength themselves when their leader does the same.A lot of leaders mistake domineering, controlling, and otherwise harsh behavior for strength. They think that taking control and pushing people around will somehow inspire a loyal following. Strength isn't something you can force on people; it's something you earn by demonstrating it time and again in the face of adversity. Only then will people trust that they should follow you.3. They're confident, without being cocky. We gravitate to confident leaders because confidence is contagious, and it helps us to believe that there are great things in store. The trick, as a leader, is to make certain your confidence doesn't slip into arrogance and cockiness. Confidence is about passion and belief in your ability to make things happen, but when your confidence loses touch with reality, you begin to think you can do things you can't and have done things you haven't. Suddenly it's all about you. This arrogance makes you lose credibility.Great, confident leaders are still humble. They don't allow their accomplishments and position of authority to make them feel that they're better than anyone else. As such, they don't hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they don't ask their followers to do anything they aren't willing to do themselves.4. They stay positive, but remain realistic. Another major challenge that leaders face is finding the balance between keeping things positive and still being realistic. Think of a sailboat with three people aboard: a pessimist, an optimist, and a great leader. Everything is going smoothly until the wind suddenly sours. The pessimist throws his hands up and complains about the wind; the optimist sits back, saying that things will improve; but the great leaders says, ""We can do this!"" and he adjusts the sails and keeps the ship moving forward. The right combination of positivity and realism is what keeps things moving forward.5. They're role models, not preachers. Great leaders inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that integrity is important to them, but great leaders walk their talk by demonstrating integrity every day. Harping on people all day long about the behavior you want to see has a tiny fraction of the impact you achieve by demonstrating that behavior yourself.6. They're willing to take a bullet for their people.The best leaders will do anything for their teams, and they have their people's backs no matter what. They don't try to shift blame, and they don't avoid shame when they fail. They're never afraid to say, ""The buck stops here,"" and they earn people's trust by backing them up. Great leaders also make it clear that they welcome challenges, criticism, and viewpoints other than their own. They know that an environment where people are afraid to speak up, offer insights, and ask good questions is destined for failure.7. They balance work and fun. There are plenty of bosses out there who know how to have fun. Unfortunately, this is often at the expense of results. And for every boss out there who has a bit too much fun, there's one who doesn't know how to have any fun at all. It takes a kind, but balanced leader to know how to motivate and push employees to be their best but to also have the wherewithal to slow it down at the appropriate time in order to celebrate results and have fun. This balance prevents burnout, builds a great culture, and gets results.8. They form personal connections. Even in a crowded room, kind leaders make people feel like they're having a one-on-one conversation, as if they're the only person in the room that matters. And, for that moment, they are. Kind leaders communicate on a very personal, emotional level. They never forget that there's a flesh-and-blood human being standing in front of them.9. They deliver feedback flawlessly. It takes a tactful leader to deliver feedback that is accurate and objective but also considerate and inspirational. Leaders who are kind know how to take into account the feelings and perspectives of their employees while still delivering the message they need to hear in order to improve.10. They're generous. Great leaders are generous. They share credit and offer enthusiastic praise and they're as committed to their followers' success as they are to their own. They want to inspire all their employees to achieve their personal best -- not just because it will make the team more successful, but because they care about each person as an individual.""A good leader is a person who takes a little more than his share of the blame and a little less than his share of the credit."" - John MaxwellBringing It All TogetherKind leaders are dynamic; they meld a variety of unique skills into an integrated whole. Incorporate the behaviors above into your repertoire, and you'll see immediate improvement in your leadership skills.Have you worked for a nice boss?

Our ancestors the Cro-magnons men, the very first modern humans left us traces of their art and way of life. They made weapons and jewelry with shells, bone, and animal teeth. The weather was harsh (ice age) so they took refuge in caves and created beautiful art.  No fox hole.On one fateful day in 1940, four teenagers fooling around some hilly slopes in the Dordogne province of France, possibly to eye some foxes, came upon an opening in the earth. They did not know yet that their priceless discovery was more important to the human race than anything that was seen before.What they found in the valley of La Vézère was 19,000 to 20,000 years old. Drawings and engravings in the rocks above their heads and alongside seemingly endless corridors. The traces left behind by fellow humans from a very long time ago. They left us proofs and images of their daily lives and struggles. That same year, the site was declared a national landmark.The Lascaux cave is one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century. The cave displays paintings from the Paleolithic era of some 2,000 figures of men and animals in several shades of red, yellow and black, created by mineral pigments. They showed us how and what they ate, how they hunted, what their daily animals were and the battles they fought.The first original paintings of the human kind. The entrance to the cave (used always in the singular form, not the caves) starts at an altitude of 185 meters, overlooking the valley floor. The shape of the cave hints that there were several entrances. The total length of the accessible parts is 235 meters and is divided into seven sectors: the Hall of the Bulls, the Axial Gallery, the Passageway, the Nave, the Chamber of the Felines, the Apse, and the Shaft. In 1947, work began to make the cave accessible to the public. The blocked entrance was redefined and the cone of earth and rocks that had acted as a thermal buffer, cushioning the effects of the external climate on the air inside, was eliminated.  A bronze door was installed to close the site, as well as steps to ease down the way to the Hall of the Bulls. The cave floors were lowered to create an itinerary and lighting was installed alongside it. The cave opened to the public on July 14, 1948. In 1959 an air-conditioning system was installed.The discovery of some sort of green disease developing on the rocks led to the closure of the cave to the general public in 1963, as fear of human over-frequentation was polluting the environment.Lascaux II.In 1972, rights were granted for the creation of a replica to accommodate the high number of visitors' demands to witness the extraordinary legacy seen at the cave. An old nearby quarry, which was already partly underground, was chosen as the future site, baptized Lascaux II.It opened to visitors in 1983. This copy is replicating 90 percent of the cave. It has welcomed millions of visitors.The original Lascaux cave was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979, along with all of the decorated caves in the surrounding Vézère valley. Lascaux III is a traveling exhibition since 2012 that has visited Bordeaux, Bruxelles, Paris, Genève, Chicago, Houston, Montréal; currently visiting South Korea, and then Japan. With reproductions, 3D exhibits and films, the show introduces the cave to all ages with impeccable impressions and informative displays.Back to the past.Recreating the exact atmosphere inside the original cave, Lascaux IV is now completed and will offer this time a complete copy of the cave in its entire splendor. With the most advanced new techniques at their disposal, teams of scientists and rock specialists were able to copy-cat the exact figures and animals represented by our ancestors - with true colors and identical feel.At a cost of 66 million Euros, the 8,500 square meters new landscape building represents the totality of the cave.Yesterday, French president François Hollande inaugurated the new exhibit Lascaux IV, the complete copy (fac-similé in French) of the original cave, which was closed to the general public due to human contamination and damages in 1963. The official name for Lascaux IV is International Center of Parietal Art Montignac-Lascaux, it will open to the public on Dec. 15. (Parietal art is the scientific and archaeological term for artwork done on cave walls or large blocks of stone.) To recap:1/Lascaux, the original cave. 2/Lascaux II, the incomplete copy of the original (90 percent), open to the public until now, set to be shut down this month and reserved for scholars or specific groups and researchers. 3/Lascaux III is a travelling exhibit gone around the World's museums. 4/Lascaux IV, the new digital and integral reproduction that will allow more in-depth discovery of the famous paintings.More info: Lascaux.

Although Ansari was hesitant to include the semi-autobiographical “Master of None” in this category, he did say that Trump’s ascendancy from reality TV personality to legitimate presidential candidate placed the series in a “totally different context.”“I mean our show stars a brown guy, myself, that is like not everyone’s favorite thing in the first place,” he said. “It’s a story about the America that some people don’t want to acknowledge or accept. That’s what our show’s about. It’s saying, ‘Hey our story’s valid, too.’” Watch Ansari reflect on the first season of “Master of None” with Smithsonian Magazine below: "

Several politicians have voiced their alarm, however.Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chair of the Senate Climate Clearinghouse, sent a letter to President-elect Trump on Friday cautioning that retaliatory action taken against staffers on the list would be illegal.“Any politically motivated inquisition against federal civil servants who, under the direction of a previous administration, carried out policies that you now oppose, would call into question your commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful transition of power,” Markey wrote. “Civil servants should never be punished for having executed policies with which a new administration disagrees. That would be tantamount to an illegal modern-day political witch hunt, and would have a profoundly chilling impact on our dedicated federal workforce.”Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), meanwhile, compared it to the politics of the Cold War, when dissent was stifled with fear and prosecution, including the hearings led by Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.“These Cold War era tactics threaten to undo the decades of progress we have made on climate change and to dissuade a new generation of scientists from tackling our world’s biggest problems,” Foster said in a statement. “No one should have to work in fear of political retaliation.” "
