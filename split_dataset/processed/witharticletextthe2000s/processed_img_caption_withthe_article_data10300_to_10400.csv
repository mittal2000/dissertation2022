Eventually, it became necessary to venture out for milk.“I have five children, all under the age of 12, including a two year old,” Rana said on Friday. “In our family, we go through milk like oxygen.”The 38-year-old physician managed to look up a supermarket that appeared to be open, roughly a mile away, and he set out on foot.“Pretty soon I found myself in waist-high water,” he said. “I saw full-sized fish swimming through the water ― and we don’t live near any lakes or rivers.“It was almost apocalyptic.”Nearly 35,000 people have been displaced in the week since Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane. More than 70,000 people remain without power. At least 35 storm-related fatalities have been confirmed to date, according to Reuters.The catastrophic storm dumped an estimated 27 trillion gallons of water on Texas and Louisiana ― an amount that would be roughly sufficient to supply New York City for more than five decades.Once Rana was able to make it out of his neighborhood, he and other members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, an organization of young Ahmadi Muslim men, sprang into action.Rana, who’s lived in Houston since he was an infant, serves as president of AMYA and helped oversee relief efforts throughout the week. Groups of young Muslim men, many of them in their teens and 20s, Rana said, have gone out in boats throughout the city to rescue families trapped in ― and sometimes on top of ― their homes. “At our mosque we’ve also been cooking hot food ― butter chicken, lentils, rice,” Rana said. “A lot of people have been getting non-perishable food, which is great. But we found that a lot of these homeless and displaced people really crave hot food. It warms the stomach and warms the heart.”The association partnered with relief organization Humanity First, Rana said, which provided funds for things like baby food and supplies, crates of water, non-perishable food items, and gloves and masks for rescue missions. “We’d get items in bulk, and they’d vanish. The demand is so high,” he said. Amid their relief work, Rana said, many of the Houston AMYA chapter’s 140 members have been affected by the storm. And even with waves of other AMYA chapters around the country sending groups to Houston to help out throughout the week, Rana said their work is still far from complete. “A lot of the phase one has been addressed,” he said. “Next, our crew will be visiting affected neighborhoods, going door to door asking if anyone has large items that need moving from the inside to outside. After major flooding, many families are forced to throw out entire household’s worth of moldy, ruined furniture. They also have to rip up floors and gut their walls, taking pictures of everything as they work for insurance purposes. Even the strongest bodies can’t do this work alone, Rana said.“A mattress normally takes maybe two people to carry. When it’s full of water, it takes four to five people. You wouldn’t believe how heavy it is.”On Friday, several AMYA crews had already set out to help families with clean up. Fridays of every week are sacred to Muslims as the day when communities come together for weekly prayers. This Friday, Sept. 1, also happens to be one of the holiest days in the Islamic year.Eid al-Adha, the three-day Festival of Sacrifice, began on Friday and commemorates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael in obedience to God in scripture. For many Muslims, the holiday represents submission to God and the sacrifices one can make in God’s name to serve one’s community.Some celebrants mark the day by slaughtering an animal and distributing the meat to family and to the poor.Many Houston mosques and Muslim groups put their faith into action throughout the week, opening their doors to displaced residents. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, also encouraged Muslims in the U.S. to observe Eid by donating the equivalent of whatever they would spend on the sacrifice to assist in relief efforts for those impacted by Harvey.At Rana’s local Ahmadiyya mosque, Baitus Samee, much of the carpeting was soaked in the storm and needed to be ripped up. At first, he said, they weren’t sure they’d be able to host Eid services. But the community improvised, laying down temporary padding so worshippers could kneel for prayer.An imam spoke from the pulpit about the meaning of sacrifice in the context of Harvey. After the sermon, Rana said worshippers turned to one another to embrace.“Yes, the roof leaked, and yes the carpet wasn’t in the best shape,” he said. “But this is going to be an Eid we’re never going to forget.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

1,QUEER VOICES,Meet The 85-Year-Old Drag Queen Who Stars In Miley Cyrus' New Video,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miley-cyrus-vmas-drag-queen_us_59aa2fcae4b0354e440a8a3f,"James ""Gypsy"" Haake said the pop star is ""serious, fun and not to be effed with.""",2017-09-02,"“She’s a super power lady ― serious, fun and not to be effed with,"" James ""Gypsy"" Haake said of Miley Cyrus. ""She’s not a rookie, and that’s what I liked about her.” ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59aa4af81700002000287efd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Miley Cyrus brought her inner rockabilly to the MTV VMAs last week with a rollicking, 1950s-themed take on the title track to her forthcoming album, “Younger Now.” Critics applauded the performance for showcasing a more mature Cyrus, whose previous VMA appearances are best remembered for attention-grabbing antics. This time, however, it was the pop singer’s troupe of older, AARP-eligible backing dancers who stole the show. (Watch Cyrus perform “Younger Now” live above.) One of those co-stars was James “Gypsy” Haake. The New Jersey native, 85, got his start working in the Manhattan cabaret scene, before moving to Hollywood in the 1980s. Shortly after relocating to the West Coast, Haake said he was discovered by Mel Brooks on the nightclub circuit. He’s since racked up an impressive list of film and TV credits, including “The Morning After,” “Troop Beverly Hills” and “Married... With Children.” Haake’s biggest claim to fame is as a drag performer, and his Twitter bio bills him as the world’s oldest working drag queen. Though the title itself is questionable, it’s clear the actor-comedian left his mark on the entertainment industry at a time when drag and other forms of queer performance art were not a part of mainstream culture. Interestingly, Haake told HuffPost he didn’t begin wearing drag until he was in his 50s and working as an emcee at a Beverly Hills nightclub. The new gig brought him out of a brief retirement. Though Haake’s last film role was 1994′s “Clifford,” he’s stayed active on the nightclub scene in Palm Springs, California. He recently applied to be on Steve Harvey’s “Little Big Shots: Forever Young,” on NBC, but was cut from the show. It turned out to be a stroke of fate as Haake was tapped by Cyrus’ team to appear in the “Younger Now” music video, which debuted Aug. 18, after “Little Big Shots” producers forwarded his info to them. Working with Cyrus, Haake said, was an “excellent” experience. “She’s been in the business a long time, she’s a veteran and she knows what she is doing,” he explained. “She’s a super power lady ― serious, fun and not to be effed with. She’s not a rookie, and that’s what I liked about her.” He had similar compliments for Diane Martel, who co-directed the “Younger Now” video with Cyrus. “She and Miley make a dynamite team,” he said. “She gets the shots, she directs the talent, and she creates an artistic force that moves Miley’s music... she’s a force in the music video industry.” Though Haake’s interpretation of drag is different from what viewers see on “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” he said he “loves” the “new, artsy” styles showcased on the reality series, and doesn’t see newer generations of queens as competition in any way. “Lord knows the drag I do is way beyond what people really want to see,” he said. “I am comedic value, not here for my looks, just to make you laugh.” He then added, “Well, maybe my legs you will be jealous of ― but not my face.”Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that Shirley Claire was chosen for Cyrus’ “Younger Now” video after applying for “Little Big Shots: Forever Young” at the same time as Haake. She did not apply for that show, and, instead, secured her role in the video ― and the subsequent VMA live performance of it ― via one of the video’s producers.

3,POLITICS,Activists Face Rain And Security Threats As 10-Day March Against White Supremacy Continues,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charlottesville-to-dc-march-rain-violence_us_59ab1149e4b0354e440ac14f,"Dozens are walking from Charlottesville, Virginia, to D.C. to fight for racial justice.",2017-09-02,"Activists begin their 10-day march from Charlottesville, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., on Monday, Aug. 28, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ab123e1700001f00287f7e.jpeg?cache=Pw2Yl12gT5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Braving the rain, threats of violence and uncertainty over police permits, dozens of civil rights activists set out on the sixth day of their 118-mile trek from Charlottesville, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., on Saturday to protest the white supremacist ideas that inspired deadly violence in Charlottesville a few weeks ago.The 10-day journey, which organizers from progressive and faith organizations are calling a “March to Confront White Supremacy,” began on Monday with a rally in Charlottesville’s Emancipation Park and is due to conclude this coming Wednesday with nonviolent civil disobedience in the nation’s capital.With an escort from the Virginia State Police and Virginia Department of Transportation, the rain-gear-clad marchers spent Saturday walking 13 miles along Route 29 from Remington to Warrenton ― all while waving placards with messages like “Black Lives Matter” and singing racial justice-themed songs. Participation in the march varies from one day to the next, but organizers estimated that there were 80 people marching on Saturday.The marchers are calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, the removal of all white supremacists from his administration, and an end to policies that disproportionately impact people of color, including criminal justice and policing practices.“We’re marching to say enough is enough,” said Puja Datta, a 29-year-old Working Families Party organizer who traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to participate in the march.“People of color demand true liberation and equality and there’s no reason why we shouldn’t have it,” she continued. “And there’s absolutely no reason why neo-Nazis should be rising again. America already fought them once and beat them back.”The marchers have already overcome racially-motivated intimidation, the kind of which they have assembled specifically to protest. Wednesday’s leg of the march ended early after organizers received threats that an armed person was awaiting them at their destination in Madison, Virginia.The trek has nonetheless proceeded without violence ― and picked up high-profile support along the way. Hollywood star and progressive activist Mark Ruffalo joined the marchers on Friday, documenting his journey on social media.The same day, however, activists suffered a setback when Virginia State Police withdrew approval for them to walk on the road, asking that they stop or continue by car for the remainder of the day’s route, according to police.The state police cited concerns about the rainy weather and the impact of the march on traffic at the start of Labor Day weekend, which police spokeswoman Corinne Geller told HuffPost had resulted in a 4-mile backup.The decision cut the fifth day of the march short by 3 miles, and prompted march organizers to accuse the police and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) of foul play. “Today the Virginia State Police revoked our permit because of non-existent ‘rain and traffic,’ and threatened to arrest us if we marched,” marcher Ben Doernberg said in a Friday statement. “[Virginia] Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s double standard is as clear as the skies and roads, and his disregard for the rights of non-racists is appalling and shameful.” The police acted in good faith, resuming the escort on Saturday, Geller said in an e-mail message.The police are “better behaved today,” Datta told Huffpost on Saturday. Geller emphasized, however, that law enforcement reserves the right to make similar demands of the marchers in the future.“As this march advances into Northern Virginia, traffic congestion and safe passage for the marchers will become even more of an issue,” she said. “State police and VDOT are in constant communication with the march organizers to discuss what is in their best interest in regards to creating a safe environment that will enable them to achieve their intended goals each day.”The march, which uses the social media hashtag #Cville2DC, is part of a wave of progressive activism in the wake of the Aug. 12 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of anti-racist counterprotester Heather Heyer and injuries of countless other demonstrators. James Fields, a member of the so-called “alt-right” from Ohio, stands accused of killing Heyer and injuring others by ramming his car into a crowd. He now faces charges of 2nd-degree murder and other offenses.Many Americans were appalled by the white supremacist rally, Heyer’s death and Trump’s subsequent attempts to draw equivalencies between the neo-Nazi protesters and anti-racist counterprotesters who assembled peacefully. Civil rights advocates vastly outnumbered white supremacist demonstrators at a counter-rally in Boston, Massachusetts, and enveloped similar protesters in San Francisco and Berkeley, California.The groups behind this march include the Working Families Party, the Women’s March, Color of Change, Democracy Spring, the Movement for Black Lives, the Center for Popular Democracy, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, Pico National Network, United We Dream, ResistHere, the March for Racial Justice, Million Hoodies Movement for Justice and IfNotNow.Hurricane Harvey and the destruction it has wrought on southeastern Texas and Louisiana have cast something of a shadow over the March to Confront White Supremacy as media outlets and progressive allies focus on responding to the disaster.But marcher Nelini Stamp, the New York-based membership director of the Working Families Party, called the devastating storm another case study of how white supremacy affects policy outcomes, arguing in a Facebook Live video on Thursday that the government’s preparation and response to the disaster had failed Houston’s communities of color. She encouraged viewers to visit NoRedCross.org to find local aid organizations to contribute to. (The Red Cross has incurred liberal skepticism for what critics describe as a shoddy, publicity-seeking disaster response apparatus.) “What’s happening in Houston is exactly white supremacy ― the fact that President Donald Trump did not acknowledge it until much later on and he didn’t go visit any victims of the flood, the fact that he … has been defunding programs that protect black and brown communities during natural disasters,” she said. “We stand in solidarity with Houston. We’re sending love.”"

One of the more pointed complaints leveled against the polarizing pop star concerns her silence during the presidential election. Swift shared a photo on Election Day encouraging her millions of fans to get out and vote, but she declined to endorse either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Many have interpreted Swift’s absence from the political discourse as evidence of a pro-Trump stance ― but now Todrick Hall, a close friend of Swift who appears in her video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” is speaking out on her behalf. “Yeah, many people have been tweeting me, ‘She supports Trump! She probably voted for Trump!’ They’re making this huge assumption, when Taylor has never to my knowledge come out and said anything about her being pro-Trump,” Hall explained to Yahoo in an interview published Friday. “But people would still rather believe that she is the one who is pushing Trump’s agenda. That was one of the major things that was tweeted at me, and I’m like, ‘So you are mad that you think she might support Donald Trump? But you’re not mad that Kanye has been very openly pro-Trump?’ I don’t understand that.”Kanye West ― at whom Swift’s new single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” appears to be at least partly directed ― supported Trump during the election, even meeting with the then-president-elect in December. The rapper, however, later admitted that he didn’t vote and deleted all tweets in support of Trump. West’s wife, Kim Kardashian West, has been increasingly outspoken about her distaste for the current president, telling Harper’s Bazaar Arabia that “anyone can run the U.S. better,” including her 4-year-old daughter. “Look, I’m not Taylor Swift, so I can’t speak for her and why she does or does not choose to speak or not speak about any specific subject matter,” Hall told Yahoo. “All I know is that she has been nothing but a great person to me. Her family has welcomed me into their home and treated me like I was a member of the family. They’ve welcomed every single person I’ve ever brought around them. I’ve never felt like there was ever a moment that I couldn’t be myself, and talk about the fact that I’m gay or whatever.”Although Hall doesn’t go as far as to proclaim Swift a “woke” pop star, he does hint that she is more progressive than she might appear. The “Straight Outta Oz” singer recounted watching “13th,” Ava DuVernay’s powerful Netflix documentary about the history of mass incarceration in the United States, with Swift’s family over the holidays.“At Thanksgiving, we all sat around and talked about it, and there was another one of her friends there who was African-American, and we all sat down and talked about racism and watched ’13th’ on Netflix and talked about how important it was,” he said. “It was one of the most beautiful conversations I’ve ever had, because sometimes as an African-American person I feel like I can’t voice my opinion about how difficult it is to be not just an African-American person in the entertainment industry, but how scary it is to be black in America, in even 2017.”To read Hall’s full interview, head over to Yahoo.

Right: Baby carrots.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56157c381800002d00dc16ed.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It has been a while since we’ve heard President Donald Trump talk about the size of his hands, but POTUS found a golden opportunity to bring up his hand size while visiting victims of Hurricane Harvey at a shelter in Houston on Saturday.Trump was slipping on gloves to help serve food to the shelter’s residents at the NRG Stadium in Houston when he turned to news reporters and proclaimed, “My hands are too big!”Then, with both gloves successfully pulled on, Trump joined the lineup and happily handed meals to the storm’s refugees while making jokes and shaking hands.Trump reportedly loathes the ongoing jokes that his hands are freakishly small.In fact, jokes about the billionaire’s hand size have haunted him for decades, though a renewed interest in his digits spiked during his presidential campaign and, now, presidency.It started 30 years ago when Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter described Trump as a “short-fingered vulgarian” in Spy magazine. Carter said that phrase launched Trump into an ongoing mission to prove to the journalist his hands are not short-fingered. In an editor’s letter published in Vanity Fair in 2015, Carter wrote: To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him—generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. Trump continued to defend his hand size while running for the Republican presidential nominee, showing his hands to supporters and even bringing the topic up while on the debate stage. (All that after former presidential opponent Marco Rubio joked at his own rally that Trump’s “small hands” make him untrustworthy.)Trump went on to describe his own hands during an editorial meeting with the Washington Post in 2016, calling his hands “normal,” “strong,” a “good size,” “great” and “slightly large, actually. ”That last claim was proven wrong last year after The Hollywood Reporter obtained the real size of Trump’s hands from his bronzed handprint hanging at the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in New York.For the record, the president’s hands measure at 7.25 inches long ― slightly smaller than 85 percent of American men. See how your hands measure up to POTUS’ in the document below."

They will not go into those winds,” he said. “Unless it’s a really good story, in which case they will.”The media apparently considered Hurricane Harvey a “really good story” though, because numerous journalists put themselves in harm’s way to cover the disaster ― often accompanying the very service members Trump was thanking.In fact, many reporters, including HuffPost’s David Lohr, took part in rescue efforts as they encountered people struggling to survive the storm’s worst effects.Trump has a famously rocky relationship with the news media, particularly national outlets, which he frequently derides as “fake news.” At a campaign-style rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on Aug. 22, Trump spent more than 10 minutes denouncing the media’s treatment of him, complete with indictments of specific journalists and their outlets.During a visit to a shelter in Houston on Saturday, however, Trump struck a slightly more conciliatory tone. The Texans he met are “really happy” with the federal recovery efforts he is managing, Trump told reporters, adding that he was pleasantly surprised to find that even the news media was recognizing his work.“It’s been very well received ― even by you guys, it’s been well received,” Trump said."

Perry Project, which aims to educate the public about the dangers of nuclear weapons. He’s also written a book, “My Journey at the Nuclear Brink.”Perry and Scheer discuss how the expansion of NATO in the 1990s factors in to the rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia. Perry calls this expansion “the first step” in escalating tensions. The “second step,” he says, was “installing ballistic missile defense systems in Eastern Europe.”“Our response to Russia on the objections to these various actions we were taking basically was, ‘What can you do about it? You’re an insignificant power today,’ ” Perry says. “The reason Putin is so popular today is that he has taken actions that, in [Russians’] view, allow Russia to stand as a great power and overcome this humiliating position they were in … so we stand today in a position of hostility between the United States and Russia, comparable to where we stood in the Cold War. In the meantime, we still have many thousands of nuclear weapons.”The conversation concludes with a discussion on the possibility of nuclear war with North Korea.“This regime is ruthless, and reckless, but they are focused entirely on their own survival,” Perry says of North Korea. “They’re not going to be conducting a preemptive attack on the United States or Tokyo or Seoul. They’re going to use [nuclear weapons] to threaten and bluster.”Listen to the full interview and to past editions of “Scheer Intelligence” at KCRW.comFull transcriptRobert Scheer: Hi, this is Robert Scheer with another edition of Scheer Intelligence, where the intelligence comes from my guests. And I could not have a more impressive guest than William J. Perry, who has been what one might call a defense intellectual. He started as a brilliant mathematician here at Stanford in Silicon Valley, where we’re recording this. And he worked on original anti-ballistic programs, and had a long history; he worked in the Carter administration, he ended up being Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. And we are conducting this interview on, you know, a very significant day. It happens to be the 72nd anniversary of the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but this is to the day that the bombs were dropped on Nagasaki. But it’s also a day on which the President of the United States, Donald Trump, has made some very startling statements about the ring of fire, and so forth, that he will bring down to bear on North Korea should they make another belligerent statement. And that was pushed back a little bit by Secretary of State Tillerson, who said no, you can sleep at night, diplomacy is working, and this is a way of putting pressure, and so forth. So it was sort of a good cop, bad cop routine, one hopes. And I said there couldn’t be–I know he’s under great demand for interviews on this very day because of what’s going on with North Korea. But, Secretary Perry, you very early on concluded that even dropping one bomb, or the explosion of one nuclear bomb, could end or portend the end of civilization. You also have been a longtime critic of any notion that we can use these weapons, defend against them, and so forth. So you know, on this day of all days, how do you see the nuclear arms race? You did a very good–well, actually, you wrote a very important book that came out a year ago or so, [My] Journey at the Nuclear Brink, Stanford Security Studies. And Jerry Brown–the reason we’re doing this interview is because I happened to have a long conversation with Jerry Brown, and he was very much influenced by that book, and he wrote a terrific review for the New York Review of Books. It’s a book I would recommend people really read–if you just read one book, now, to understand what’s going on, you’re getting it from the guy who knows more about nuclear weapons and nuclear war fighting than anyone alive in this world. And I guess I would like to begin by asking you, you know, how did we get to this point? That we seem to be at the, maybe even a higher point of danger than the Cuban Missile Crisis.William Perry: We stand today, I believe, in greater danger of a nuclear catastrophe than we faced during the Cold War. And I can explain why I believe that, but the first point I want to make, though, is that hardly anybody understands that. And because we don’t understand it, our policies are not responsive to those dangers. During the Cold War, at least we had, we understood the danger and were taking action to try to deal with it; we had very serious arms control discussions, for example. Today, it’s so far in the background that people don’t understand it at all, particularly the new generation of people who didn’t live through the Cold War. But it’s a very dangerous situation today. And the headlines, which are about North Korea, just emphasize the danger; but the greater danger, really, is–the ultimate danger–is some sort of an exchange between the United States and Russia today. That would lead not just to a great catastrophe, it would basically lead to the end of civilization. So that’s what’s at stake here: ending our civilization, and the nuclear weapons have the power to do that.RS: So let me examine this relation to Russia and how we got to this point. Because you were in the Clinton administration, and that followed the first Bush administration. And the first President Bush came in with the end of the Cold War, and Gorbachev was in power, and what remained of the Soviet Union, and then that changed. And there was a great deal of optimism in which–in fact, Vladimir Putin has actually referred to that; he thought that Gorbachev was naive, is the word he uses. But there was a certain idea that now–I remember with the first President Bush he thought we could cut the military budget by 30 or 40 percent, that this was going to be a new era of peace, and certainly on the Russian side there was that sort of optimism. How did we get to this point now? And one thing that Vladimir Putin points out is NATO expansion. And you actually were a critic of the expansion of NATO up to the border of Russia, and yet you were part of an administration, you were Secretary of Defense in an administration, that seemed to push that policy.WP: When the Cold War ended, everybody who had lived through it, certainly myself, breathed a huge sigh of relief. We thought the danger of a nuclear catastrophe was finally behind us. And for about 10 years, that seemed to be the case. During the time I was Secretary, for example, we worked very closely and very cooperatively with Russia. Together, Russia and the United States, working cooperatively, dismantled 8,000 nuclear weapons. And we saw that as a first installment in a much greater dismantlement of weapons. We had the Russian defense minister attending NATO meetings. We had Russian troops participating in peacekeeping operations. In Bosnia, for example, where NATO sent in 50,000 troops to enforce the peace in Bosnia, one of those, a big compound of those troops, an American division of about 22, 23,000 troops, that American division had a brigade, a Russian brigade as a part of it. We had a Russian brigade as a part of an American division, reporting to an American general, working as part of the NATO operation. That’s how close we were then to having something almost close to an alliance with Russia. So I thought we really had it in our hands then, of ending this long-term enmity, and ending the danger of the two great nuclear powers being enemies of each other. But at the end of the Clinton administration, they started the process of NATO enlargement. And that was the first step towards alienating Russia from the United States. There were many other steps after that, but that was the first one. I opposed that; I argued against it to President Clinton. And when it was clear that he was going to go ahead, I asked him to call a meeting of his national security staff so I could make my case. That whatever advantage there would be in doing this, of enlarging NATO, it should be postponed for a few years until we had Russia more clearly on our side. In fact, we were even considering then the possibility of having Russia become a member of NATO. That’s how close we were to it at that time. But Clinton granted me that meeting; I made my case; I lost it, and Clinton went ahead with the enlargement anyway. That was the first step down. The second step was installing ballistic missile defense systems in Eastern Europe, which again the Russians were vehemently opposed to. Our response to Russia on their objections to these various actions we were taking, basically, was: What can you do about it? You’re an insignificant power today. So besides doing things we didn’t want, there was a humiliation aspect to it. In fact, many Russians refer to the decade of the nineties as their decade of humiliation. And the reason Putin is so popular in Russia today is that he has taken actions which allow Russia to stand, in their view, at a great power and have overcome this humiliating position they were in. He has, in effect, answered the question, what can Russia do about it; he has taken action. We don’t like the actions he took, but he has taken them in response to our question of what can you do about it. So I think we started off this series of actions which alienated the United States and Russia. In the last 10 years or so, Putin’s taken the actions. And some of them very dangerous actions indeed; his actions in Crimea, his actions in the Ukraine, his threats to the Baltics–all of those are very dangerous actions for him to be taking. So we stand today in a position of hostility between the United States and Russia, in some ways comparable to what it was during the Cold War. In the meantime, we both have, still, many thousands of nuclear weapons, and Russia has been making threats about their use of nuclear weapons, even in cases where they’re not threatened by another nuclear power. So I say that the situation really is more dangerous than it was during the Cold War, because in addition to those threats we also have the danger of a regional nuclear war in Pakistan or in North Korea, and we have the possibility of a nuclear terror attack; neither of those occurred during the Cold War. So the possibility of a nuclear catastrophe today is certainly greater than it was during the Cold War.RS: So let me just go back to the, the two, really; the decision to expand NATO to the very border of Russia, which they claim, Putin claims, has something to do with their own belligerence–WP: Yes.RS: –towards an involvement with the Ukraine and the Baltic nations. What motivated Bill Clinton, who after all was not known as a big hawk, to do this? I mean, what was the reality of this argument?WP: Well, the case for enlarging NATO to include Poland and the Czech Republic and the Baltics and so on, I think is a pretty good case; those countries wanted security, and they wanted to be tied to the Western circle. I wasn’t opposed to doing that, I always just said the timing was wrong–we need to go more slowly on that until we bring Russia fully on board– because I could see very clearly the reaction in Russia was going to be very negative, and was going to be, in the long term, costly to us. It would simply defeat the attempts we were making to bring Russia into the Western security circle, instead of standing outside of it throwing rocks at it. But my belief was that we could have done this in a time, but not then; it was, we were just moving too soon. We had to get Russia on board first. That was the most important consideration. But we didn’t do it that way, so we’ll never know what would have happened; we can’t live history twice. We set ourselves on a course which led, in a pretty predictable way, to the hostility we have today between the United States and Russia. And I think that’s a very dangerous hostility.RS: Right, but just so–and because we have so much of a, now with Donald Trump, a partisan politics where the Republicans are, at least at the presidential level, are considered to be irresponsible and, you know, extremist, and the Democrats are offered as a rational force. What’s confusing to me about that earlier period is that here was President, the first President Bush, a man of considerable experience; he’d been, you know, ambassador to China, he’d been head of the CIA, and had been a veteran in a real war; he was there when the bombs were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And he came in, and to give him his full credit, this guy–President [George] H. Walker Bush–really believed this was time for a new era.WP: Yes.RS: And he was going to do what General Eisenhower, as president, had called for, which was reining in the military-industrial complex and develop a new understanding of the world and its dangers and so forth. And then under Bill Clinton you had what I still cannot understand, and I interviewed the man at different points, but I still don’t understand, what was the reason for this heightened sense of sort of a cold–I mean, yes, you had terrorism; you had other problems in the world; you had poverty; you had instability; you had the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and so forth. There were a lot of real issues. But why expand a Cold War alliance–WP: Yeah. Let me, first of all, give Bill Clinton his due on this. The policies that George H. W. Bush pursued, beginning with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, were, I think, very appropriate policies, which included reaching out to Russia a hand of friendship. And that actually began in the Reagan era, but it continued on with President Bush. And Clinton did extend that; he reached out the same hand of friendship to Russia. It also, I think importantly, included the significant decrease of our military capability. Of our military size, I should say, not capability. And then President Bush began a program, which was followed by Clinton, of reducing the size of our military. And the plan was to reduce it by one-third, which is a pretty big cut. That was, in fact, implemented during the four years of the Bush administration and the first four years of the Clinton administration. I was Secretary at the time, and I picked up, basically, what President Bush had started and continued it on for another four years. And so over those four-year periods, we reduced the size of the expenditures of the military about four percent a year, which over eight years amounted to about one-third. That stopped after I left office, and then the military held level for a while, and then it started to come up again in recent years. But that was, in fact, done, and it was done by President Clinton as well as by President Bush. And it was done, I think, orderly and effectively; that is, I think it was done without reducing the readiness of our forces. By the time I left office as Secretary, I believed we had a highly capable and ready military force, but a force that was one-third smaller than it was during the Cold War, appropriately so. For example, we had pulled nearly all of our troops back out of Western Europe; we had had several hundred thousand there during the Cold War. So there was a big reduction in forces and big savings in the defense budget; that has since been turned around, but that was effected over both the Bush administration and the first [part] of the Clinton administration.RS: But ironically, it got turned around because of the terrorist threat. And the irony here is that the terrorist threat really was fueled in part by–well, the fighting over Afghanistan and the whole question of the Soviet involvement there. But the whole notion of NATO and ABM, and all this sort of thing, was really inappropriate to dealing with Al-Qaeda. There, you’re dealing with rogue threat of nuclear weapons, you’re much more concerned about–correct me if I’m wrong, but nuclear proliferation. So for example, Pakistan, where the scientist [Abdul Qadeer] Khan and so forth developed what was called the [Islamic] Bomb–WP: Right.RS: –and that actually has connection with North Korea and the threat now, because some of that technology is supposed to have made its way to North Korea and Iran, right?WP: That’s correct.RS: And so why would one focus on confrontation with Russia, which has its own problems with terrorists, when in fact the problem was, really, one of proliferation, of a religious fanaticism, and so forth? I still don’t understand how–unless, and you know, let me be crude about it–is this what Eisenhower was warning about? Did the military-industrial complex need a sophisticated enemy of the sort that Russia presented, and you cannot justify these complex weapons, and certainly nuclear weapons, to go get people who are in caves or in the desert, which is what Al Qaeda represented?WP: No, I think the defense changes that took place when the Cold War ended were made on the belief that Russia no longer was a threat to the United States, and that nuclear attack was no longer a threat we had to be concerned with. And so, as I said, we reduced the size of our forces and expunged our forces by about one-third, which is a pretty significant reduction. We stopped all development of nuclear weapons, both in the laboratories at Los Alamos, Livermore, and in the carriers for those weapons, ICBMs, submarine launch missiles. So we haven’t really made new nuclear weapons, or new carriers for nuclear weapons, since the end of the Cold War. That was really done. That’s just now starting to turn around. And ironically, it was started during the Obama administration. And even more ironically, the trigger for getting that started was the concessions Obama made to the republicans in Congress, in particular to Senator John Kyl, in order to get the New START Treaty ratified. That’s really ironic. But he agreed then to a modernization of the nuclear forces in order to get the New START Treaty approved. New START Treaty didn’t have anything to do with the quality of the forces, it only had to do with the number, of reducing the number of the weapons. In my judgment, that was a bad trade-off, bad decision on his part. While I favored the New START Treaty, I thought it was a modest step forward, whereas restarting the Cold War nuclear arms buildup was a major setback. So it was a bad trade-off, I think.RS: Well, let me ask you about two questions related to it. The defense of modernization of the nuclear force generally is terms of not that you can do nuclear war fighting, but that you’re making it safer, more secure and so forth, right? But then there’s also this other issue of anti-missile defense. That you can actually prevent. And the argument is stronger if we think about North Korea as, you know, some nation that has only a few of these weapons, or what have you. And in your book, and in other writings, you seem to be very clear that you actually cannot do nuclear war fighting, and that defense doesn’t work. And I want to, since we’re at Stanford, I want to bring up an incident that I happened to be in the arms control seminar that Sid Drell had, and Condoleezza Rice was there before she became Secretary of State. And at one point, I encountered Edward Teller when I came up here, at the airport. And I knew him, and I had interviewed him. And he said, “Oh, you’re going up to see Sid Drell,” he said, “at the arms control center.” He said, “Make sure Sid tells you about the great results we had on the Cottage test.” And you know, on the Cottage–I wasn’t even supposed to know the Cottage test was about nuclear weapons testing. And I said, what do you mean? I said, did you get lasing? Because I knew they were trying to get an X-ray laser. And he said, “Yes. But make sure Sid tells you about it.” Well, for one thing, in terms of classified information, I thought this was like, probably the biggest–if it was true–that they had developed an X-ray laser that they could shoot down all kinds of things–it would change the whole nature of nuclear war fighting. And then when I got up there I said to Sid Drell, I said Edward Teller told me you’re going to tell me all about–he said, no! I–what are you talking about! You know, you can’t talk about any of that. And it turned out they didn’t get the lasing; it turned out the explosion had hurt the instruments or something, so they really didn’t get this breakthrough. But Teller believed, and he convinced Ronald Reagan, that you could actually develop a shield. You don’t believe that, and you don’t believe we’ve ever been able to do that.WP: I didn’t believe that then, and I stated very clearly that I didn’t believe it then; I don’t believe it now. In general, I think it’s not possible today, or anytime in the foreseeable future, to build a defense which provides reasonable confidence you can defeat a large-scale nuclear attack. You might be able to defeat a few missiles being fired at you, with some confidence, but not a large-scale attack. Even with a few missiles, there’s a possibility that the decoys which the other side will put on those few missiles will make it look like a large-scale attack, and therefore you still can’t defeat it. But in general, I think that the belief that we can defend our country against a large-scale attack is a fantasy, and it has led us to not only spend billions and billions of dollars needlessly, but has led us to policies based on the belief that we could make, achieve that defense. The best we can say about the ballistic missile defense system we have today is that with good luck, it could defeat a few missiles being fired at us; a North Korean attack, say. And perhaps more importantly, whether or not it did that, it would have to sow a certain amount of uncertainty in the mind of the attacker, and therefore maybe deter him from making the attack. That, I think, can be said about the ballistic missile–the money we’re putting in it is giving us that return, that benefit. But not much more than that. The downside of it is, besides the money we spend, is that it instills a belief in people’s minds that we could really defend ourselves against a large-scale attack; and that, I say, is a fantasy.RS: And so why–just to tie up the previous discussion, why in the world would we want to develop ABM systems on the border of Russia if in fact, given the size of their arsenal, this is a meaningless gesture?WP: I’d make that point both to the U.S government and to the Russian government, because the Russians believe we can. Not that–they don’t believe the system we have deployed now can do that, but they have a very high regard for America’s technological prowess, and they fear that we will be able to do it at some time in the future. And therefore, they’ve been very much opposed to putting this ballistic missile defense system in Eastern Europe. The reason our government gave for putting it in was not against Russia at all; in fact, they repeatedly assured the Russian government that not only did we have not the intent to do that, but we clearly did not have the capability to do that. But they claimed it was to be done to defend Europe and the United States against an Iranian nuclear missile. Why we still continue that program after we now have an agreement with Iran on the nuclear agreements is not the question. But that was the rationale we have given with this system, is the defense against an Iranian nuclear missile.RS: So you bring to this discussion as much knowledge as any human being possesses about these weapons, what they can do, how to deal with them. I mean–WP: That doesn’t mean I’m always right, but–RS: No, no, I understand that. But I think you’re also quite modest in your writing; you don’t claim to always be right. But it seems to me that the real danger is, as you point out in your writing and in your book, that we’ve been lulled into an indifference to these weapons.WP: Yes.RS: Right? That’s your basic–WP: Yes.RS: –thesis, and the William J. Perry Project here at Stanford is–and the reason you wrote your book and you’re out there writing columns, is that you’re concerned–even before Trump. Because the book came out–WP: Yeah. Right.RS: –a year before Trump. Ah, that we are at the most dangerous moment, I gather, because we’re, A, less concerned about it; but also, there are these other nations. We mentioned Pakistan rather casually; Pakistan, as I gather, has 80 or 100 such weapons; I don’t know, but–WP: More than 100.RS: More than 100. And they actually fueled the program in Iran and Korea, and yet we dropped our embargo on Pakistan in the first Bush, in the George W. Bush administration, and we really sort of don’t care very much about it anymore. And we yet–and even now–are talking about launching a weapon. And a question I want to put to you–and you’ve lived with this issue forever–we had this policy that, to me, never–I never thought it made sense. But smart people told me it did. And that was the mutual assured destruction. And Nixon sort of refined it by saying, I guess it was the madman theory – your enemy has to think you can actually be crazy and mad. Well, we actually have a president now that I suspect many world leaders think could actually use these weapons. And it’s keeping us up at night, and when we’re doing this interview, as I say, it’s the anniversary of the 72nd year of the dropping of the bomb in Nagasaki and, a week before, Hiroshima. And we have a president who many informed people in this country feel is actually capable. So first of all, I wonder if you could walk me through it. What happens when–because you’ve been there as Secretary of Defense, and you know a lot about the Cuban Missile Crisis; you were an advisor, all of these things. So I have several questions. One, why are we still on hair-trigger alert? Why hasn’t–I mean, here Donald Trump is in the same position Ronald Reagan was in, or you know, Clinton or anybody earlier, and certainly John Kennedy during the Missile Crisis, where as you have written, we came very close to destroying civilization. Why do we still live in a world where one human being, the President of the United States, and presumably his counterpart in what remains of the Soviet Union and Russia–what happens? He gets, it’s three o’clock in the morning, and–you’ve been there. What would be, what would Donald Trump–they’d wake him up? He’d go into–could you take us through that scenario?WP: Well, there are a lot of questions wrapped together in what you just said there; let me try to address it. A first point about Pakistan. I said they have over 100 nuclear weapons; they’ve had three wars with India since the separation of the two countries. The issue which divides them is still there, which is the Kashmir; and therefore, they may have another war. If they have another war, it’s almost sure, I think, to go nuclear. I’ve just released a YouTube video, just a few weeks ago, which depicts how an India backstand nuclear war might start, and what the consequences of it would be. I just want to dwell just a moment on the consequences: not only would a nuclear war between India and Pakistan kill tens of millions of people in India and Pakistan, but the soot and the dust and the pollution that goes up, first in the atmosphere and then in the stratosphere, which would stay for years, would block the rays of the sun to a degree–to a degree that we would expect a few degrees’ drop in temperature all over the planet, which would have a profound negative effect on agriculture. So in a nuclear war like that, there’s no place to hide; everybody on the planet would be affected by a war between India and Pakistan. So that’s a point I want to make, and I invite you and others to take a look at that YouTube video that I have on the India-Pakistan war, which in five minutes sort of summarizes that situation. It’s a hypothetical scenario, but it’s based on factual information. On the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy’s view after the crisis was he believed there was one chance in three of that ending in a nuclear holocaust. Which, even with the nuclear weapons we had in those days, would have probably brought our civilization to an end. One chance in three–that’s pretty bad odds for a result that catastrophic. And I think Kennedy was optimistic, because he didn’t know when he made that statement that the Soviets already had nuclear weapons on tactical missiles in Cuba, with orders to use them against any attack. And he was being recommended to conduct a conventional attack against Cuba by a unanimous recommendation of his Joint Chiefs of Staff. Had he done that, our troops would have been decimated on the beach, and then the general nuclear war surely would have followed. We were that close to the end of civilization.RS: As another footnote, you were an advisor then, and I–WP: I was an advisor, right.RS: –I read in your writing that actually, had it not been for the fact that the head of the Soviet retaliatory force was on the submarine that was forced to rise, the commander of that sub had already decided–WP: Yeah. That was another near miss that Kennedy didn’t know about at the time. We only learned about that later. But the nuclear, the Soviets had a nuclear submarine shadowing the ships they were sending down there. And we had destroyers that were dropping depth charge on their submarine. And the commander of the submarine had decided he was going to sink that destroyer by firing a nuclear torpedo at him. Had he done that, he would have sunk our ship; and that, undoubtedly, again, would have led to a general nuclear war. He had other officers on the ship who persuaded him not to do that. The Soviet policy in those days for the use of that nuclear torpedo did not require the commander to go back to Moscow to get authorization, because the communication was so uncertain; but it did require that all three of the senior commanders agree to do that, and the other two did not agree. That’s what saved us. It was two out of three on one side instead of two out of three on the other side.The other point I want to make is that at this time–and this is a term that Jerry Brown has used, I think it’s very apt–that we’re sleepwalking, we’re sleepwalking into a nuclear war. And he used that analogy from World War I, where historians described how we were sleepwalking into World War I; nobody knew, understood what the consequences were going to be. And that seems to be what we face now. The analogy here to World War I is much more apt than the analogy to World War II; World War II, we had somebody consciously starting the war. I mean, Hitler had a plan and a set of actions, and that led to World War II; World War I, we just were sleepwalking into it. That’s what the danger is today: we will sleepwalk, we will blunder, into a nuclear war, not because either leader, any of the leaders who have nuclear weapons are consciously planning a nuclear war. An India to Pakistan nuclear war would be a result of a blunder also, not because the two presidents want to start a war, but because something happens and it gets out of control. A minor military conflict could quickly escalate into a major war, the decisions being made by commanders in the field, not by the two presidents.RS: Could that happen with Korea as well?WP: Yes, it could. The danger of Korea–I’m going to be very clear about this. Whether or not North Korea presently has the capability to attack the United States with nuclear weapons–I think the answer to that is no, but I think they will have in a year or two; but that’s not the issue. Sooner or later, they will. They have–they are not going to do that. This regime is ruthless, it’s reckless, it’s abhorrent in many ways, but it’s not irrational; it’s not crazy.RS: Now, let me just stop you for one second. Because somebody listening to this will say–oh, easy for William J. Perry to say, but the fact is, you are in a better position to assess the North Koreans than any human being in this country. Because you actually have been there dealing with them.WP: I’ve negotiated with them, indeed. I’ve negotiated with them getting rid of their nuclear weapons.RS: So why don’t you give us that background? Because the statement you just made, and the assessment of what is going on now, is probably the most intelligently informed statement–I don’t even know what you’re going to say, but it’s one that we should pay very serious attention to. So give us that–WP: I’ve been to North Korea three or four times. One time in particular, I was sent by President Clinton. This was, I was out of office at that time; I was now back at Stanford. But he asked me to come back in temporarily because he had a crisis with North Korea; we seemed to always be having a crisis with North Korea.RS: This was President Clinton.WP: President Clinton, it was nineteen–the second term of President Clinton. I was, as I said, I was out of office at that time, and he asked me to come in for a couple of months to deal with that problem for him. I went over, I teamed up with representatives from Japan and South Korea, and we put forward a recommendation which all three of the leaders of our three countries agreed to, and then I was sent over to Pyongyang to negotiate with the North Koreans. I was there about a week with a team of American negotiators, and we came back with a tentative agreement from North Korea to give up all of their nuclear weapon programs and their long-range missile program, in return for which we did a number of things. This agreement, had it been carried out, I think would have–we cannot relive history, we cannot predict for certain what would have happened–but we certainly would be in a better position than we are today, without a doubt. But in any event, before Clinton could finally get that treaty signed and negotiated, the election came and we changed presidents. And President Bush cut off all discussion with North Korea; for two years we didn’t talk with them at all. So that whole negotiation just went down the drain, which I think was a terrible loss. But what I learned in the time I was there and talking with them, was this regime is ruthless and reckless, but they are focused entirely on their own survival, the regime’s survival, the leadership’s survival. The survival of the Kim dynasty–that’s what they’re focused on. Everything we offered them was either plus or minus, but it was always measured in terms of our ability to sustain the Kim dynasty. So they would not be suicidal; this is not Al Qaeda we’re dealing with, these are not people seeking martyrdom; they’re seeking the sustain of the regime. So that’s my clear conviction on this. So we look at what they’re doing today, they’re–they have failed in the negotiation to get assurances that the regime would survive, so they’re trying to get them through their nuclear weapons. So they’re not going to be conducting a preemptive attack on the United States or Tokyo or Seoul; they’re going to use them as a threat and bluster. And that’s the good news; they’re not going to use them preemptively. The bad news is, it’s still very dangerous. Because in this exchange of words, and in this posturing, and in this saber-rattling, it’s very easy to imagine a small military conflict starting. And then it’s easy to imagine the small military conflict escalating into a larger military conflict. Any large military conflict, any second Korean War with conventional weapons, North Korea would lose. And as they lose it, as they see the regime about to be overthrown, then in desperation they might use them; it might be sort of a Korean armageddon. That’s the danger; that, again, we would blunder into nuclear war. In a sense, it’s the same danger we have with Russia today. Not that either leader would deliberately start a war, but that we would blunder into a nuclear war; that we would sleepwalk into a nuclear war, as the World War I model.RS: Yeah, in a way it’s the scariest of times, but also there are some reassuring signs. The scary thing is here our President Trump has said that if they even make another statement–at least as of the day we’re recording this–he has said if they just make another statement threatening the United States, we’ll have this incredible ring of fire and so forth, and the whole idea is we’ll destroy them. On the other hand, Secretary of State Tillerson said no, you can sleep at night, diplomacy is working, and so forth. And one reason for that optimism, it seems to me, is that this rare victory happened–and it’s hardly mentioned in the media as significant–in that both China and Russia supported–WP: Yes.RS: –the Security Council resolution, and the Chinese have, they’ve said something very interesting. They said, negotiations should start again, but you have to take regime change off the table. That is something the Chinese have said. Is that–is this a fair assessment?WP: Yes. I think, first of all, a military solution in North Korea is foolhardy and extremely dangerous, and will result in millions of people being killed, millions of people, including Americans. So we ought to do everything we can to avoid the military solution, which means we need to work harder on the diplomatic solution. The diplomatic solution is available, I believe, but it does require close cooperation with China. We cannot get it by ourselves, as we’ve demonstrated year after year. But by that, I do not mean as we’re doing, pointing to China and saying, “You solve the problem,” and China pointing to us and saying “You solve the problem.” We need to be working together with China to solve this problem. In any diplomatic agreement, you need both carrots and sticks; we’ve got the carrots, we and our allies have the carrots–economic carrots, many things we can do that North Korea really wants. But we don’t have the sticks. China has the sticks. They’re not willing to use the sticks, because they fear that we’re seeking–they fear correctly, I think–that we’re seeking regime overthrow. So we have to go to China, quietly and carefully and thoughtfully, and come to an agreement that we will pull back this threat of regime overthrow if they will cooperate with us in putting together a diplomatic package that has both carrots and sticks. I think if we had that, we could go to North Korea and get a successful agreement.RS: And so I know people give Tillerson much credit, and he was the head of Exxon, and you know, not very good on global warming and so forth. But it seems to me as Secretary of State, he is the adult watching the store; that he actually believes in diplomacy and is pursuing it.WP: I give him credit for that; I do not give him credit for the fact he hasn’t put forward a rational description of what diplomacy would be. We need that statement. And as I said, in my judgment, any successful diplomacy has to include cooperation between China and the United States, not finger-pointing at each other, but cooperation with each other.RS: OK. So let me raise this question again. I’m speaking to William J. Perry, who has been Secretary of Defense but also started as a mathematician, understanding these weapons and what they do; has lived his 70 years in this world, as an adult. And what I want to ask you about now, because a lot of us, even though Tillerson said we could sleep at night, I didn’t sleep the last few nights. And I’ve written a bit about this subject of nuclear war, and I find it hard to sleep. And I’m thinking a lot of us are focused on the instability or mental stability of Donald Trump and his rhetoric and who he is. And so, what does it mean to be President of the United States in such a moment? You’ve been there with the president, several presidents. What does it mean that there–here’s this Korean problem, and let’s say something happens, and are we still on that hair-trigger alert? How does it work? Do you go up in an airplane, you get the code? And is it really true that after so many years–I don’t know how we got this in the first place, that one human being could make that decision, but could Donald Trump basically push a button that ends life on this planet?WP: Yes, he could. And the question is how we got there–we got there during the Cold War, because we saw our primary capability in deterrence being through our ICBMs, our ground-based long-range missiles. And that each of them is in silos at known locations, and therefore they’re subject to a preemptive attack from the other side. And so all during the Cold War, we believed that our primary way of survival, which was through deterrence, depended on being able to stop a surprise attack, prevent a surprise attack. And the way we saw of doing that was we’d launch our missiles before the attack came. So we’d build elaborate and expensive and very effective warning systems, which would give us about 10 or 15 minutes’ warning that an attack was underway. And during that 10 or 15 minutes, then the calculation is made, the word is sent to the president that an attack is underway, and the president then has probably less than 10 minutes to make a decision to either launch an attack ourself, or take the possibility of losing all of his ICBMs, in that he has to assume that the missiles that are coming to the United States will be targeted at our ground forces, our ICBM forces. So we got to that position because we feared that the Soviet Union would make a surprise attack on us, and that the only way we could deal with that issue was to launch our missiles before the attack landed. And that involved two things: having a very sophisticated warning system, which we had then and we still have; but it also involved giving the president the unique authority to make the decision to launch, to make it in a few minutes, and to make it without necessarily any consultations with anybody else; or certainly, there’s nothing in the system that gives anybody the opportunity to countermand that decision. So we have today the situation where one person, the President of the United States, can give a command which nobody can override, which would launch all of our missiles, would basically start a nuclear war which could end our civilization. That’s where we are today, and that’s how we got there. That’s why we have a launch on warning policy.RS: OK. But now, let me just understand. So it’s three o’clock in the morning, or something, and Donald Trump has been awakened; he’s rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, right?WP: Right.RS: And he’s told that you have 10 minutes–and let’s assume this involves Russia.WP: The call would come to the national security advisor, who would then either call, or if he’s nearby, would actually go to the president. Probably he’s not in the same building, if it’s three o’clock in the morning, so he has to call him–advise him of that, and say, Mr. President, you have to decide in the next, whatever it is, seven, eight, nine, 10 minutes–you have to decide whether to launch our ICBMs now, or take the chance that they will all be destroyed in the silos. And the only downside to launching them right now is that if we’re wrong–if this is a false alarm–you have accidentally started World War III.RS: And ended most life on–WP: And ended most life on the planet, yes.RS: Yes. OK. Now, I have a couple of questions about that. Because again, it goes to the question of–[omission] I’m just curious about several things here. One, we don’t only depend upon the land-based missiles; we have a triad, right? We have submarines, we have airplanes. So maybe at one point you could say this sort of mad or preemptive concern was paramount, but a lot changed after that, and certainly has changed today. You know, we have arms control negotiation, we have other ways. And assuming that the conflict is with Russia, because a plane was shot down over Syria, and misunderstanding–you know, and Russian, maybe Russian troops. Or in the Ukraine, something terrible happens, and maybe it was done by terrorists, maybe it was done by accident or so forth. Basically what you’re saying is that the decision-making–you know, frankly, I think this is the most depressing conversation I’ve had as a journalist. Because this many years after MAD, after the whole thing–and with a triad of forces, with redundancy, with all sorts of–and also knowing there can be false signals, that your intelligence system can be wrong, and you don’t know–that a President Trump, or any president, but President Trump captures one’s attention, focuses one’s attention–would have eight or 10 minutes to decide whether life is going to continue. Why wasn’t that changed? Given that we have subs, given that we have forces in the air, given that we know these technical systems can be wrong–WP: It hasn’t been changed because many people believed that the greatest danger to the United States was a surprise attack from the Soviet Union. I think that was wrong then, and I think it’s wrong now. The greatest danger is not a surprise attack; the greatest danger is that we will blunder into a nuclear war, into a war. And one example of how we might blunder into it is if through a false alarm. We have had, in the United States, three different false alarms that I know of, and Russia, the Soviet Union has had two different false alarms that I know of; there may be more in both cases, but that’s at least five false alarms over about a 40-year period, so that’s one every eight years. In each case, we did not take the action, of course, or we wouldn’t be here. But in two of those cases, it was very close, a very close call; the alarm looked very realistic. And so the danger is there. Humans will still err, machines will still err, and so sooner or later we’re going to have another false alarm. And when we get that, then whoever’s the president will have that decision to make, and it’s a bad system. I campaigned to try to get, as we rebuilt our nuclear arsenal, modernized it so to speak, that we not do that with the ICBMs, we let our ICBMs phase out. Because the greatest danger, the only real danger from false alarm, comes from our ICBM forces. With the submarine forces, you can ride it out, wait to see, make sure you’re exactly right, wait for the presumed missile to actually strike the United States before you actually launch. With our bomber forces, we can cause the bombers to take off in orbit; but with the ICBM forces, it’s use them or lose them. And the temptation to use them will be very great, which means we’re taking the chance of a false alarm starting a war.RS: Yeah. And I know this is a busy day for you, because it’s not only the anniversary of the dropping of the bomb on Nagasaki, the 72nd, but we have the situation with North Korea, and you’re in great demand to be on radio and television programs. Now, you might not be two months from now and you weren’t two months ago. So the whole real question is, how–how irresponsible can we be to have created–as Einstein said, you’ve created this weapon, but you haven’t changed your thinking. That despite a changed reality, the end of the Soviet Union, despite a triad of weapons and so forth, we find ourselves at this moment in time where a president of the United States–who many people feel is unstable, OK?–has nonetheless the absolute power–you know, unless that national security advisor doesn’t make the call, and then he’s violating every rule–has the absolute power and even obligation to order an attack that would effectively destroy the human experience on this planet? And that’s considered adult, serious behavior. And it’s–I mean, is there not, at this point in your life, having lived through this, of 70 active years of involvement–you were 24 years old as a mathematician when you got involved with the issue of missile defense. And yet you know now there is no defense, the weapons–and you knew quite a long time ago–the weapons are not real weapons, they’re suicidal. And as I pointed out earlier, the reason I wanted to have this discussion with you is, a very smart politician, Jerry Brown, our governor, read your book and told me–and he’s told other people in his review, but he told me personally–you must interview William J. Perry, because he has written the most frightening book I’ve read maybe in my life. And so we’re going to wrap this up, because you’ve got to go talk to other people, and I think that’s valid. But really, what’s your assessment of, finally, what’s the takeaway? What do we need to do now in terms of our thinking about this president, this situation, these weapons?WP: The danger of a nuclear catastrophe today is greater than it was during the Cold War. But we do not understand that, and therefore our policies do not reflect adequate actions. One of the most pronounced dangers is the danger of responding mistakenly to a false alarm. That is a decision to be made by one person, which is the President of the United States, and he’ll have about seven or eight minutes to make that decision. No person, no person should have to have that responsibility. We have that system because it’s a holdover from the Cold War, where we believed that the greatest danger to the United States was a surprise attack against the United States. I believe today, and in fact I believed even then, that was not the greatest danger; the greatest danger today, certainly, is not a surprise attack, it is that we will blunder, we will blunder into a nuclear war. A prime example of how we will blunder into it is through responding falsely to a false alarm, but there are other ways we could blunder into it, too. And we have to be concerned about, for example, in North Korea, about taking actions which could lead to a small-scale military conflict, which would escalate into a large-scale military conflict, and which would blunder us into a nuclear war. So the last message I want to leave you with is that the danger today is not that one president or another president would decide to start a nuclear war; the danger is that we will blunder into a nuclear war. And a consequence of nuclear war, particularly one between the United States and Russia, could be no less than the end of our civilization.RS: Well, on the 72nd anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki, that’s a chilling message. And I would urge people who have been listening to this to get William J. Perry’s book, which is–WP: “My Journey at the Nuclear Brink.”RS: –“My Journey at the Nuclear Brink.” Stanford Security Studies. And you can get it in paperback at a fairly reasonable cost, the hardcover might break your bank, but–WP: Buy the paperback.RS: Paperback, twenty-four bucks. And as Jerry Brown pointed out in his review for the New York Review of Books–really the most important book you can read, and get past the headlines and understand really what we’re talking about. And so I want to thank you for doing this. I also–WP: Thank you, Bob.RS: Thank you. And I want to thank our producers, Joshua Scheer and Rebecca Mooney; our technical engineers at KCRW, Kat Yore and Mario Diaz; here at Stanford Video, Dan David. And let me say we’ll have, hopefully if our president doesn’t get that call early in the morning, I’ll be back with another edition of Scheer Intelligence next week.WP: Let’s thank Jerry Brown, also, for stimulating you to do this.RS: Yeah, and you know, let’s–OK, I can add a few minutes. I was really impressed, because the real problem that caught my attention–I’ve written about this subject–I actually went to Chernobyl after the explosion and wrote about it for the LA Times, so that’s a peaceful catastrophe that was frightening enough. And I was, again, I want people to buy the book, but begin by reading Jerry Brown’s review in the New York Review. You can Google it and get it. And Jerry’s an astute politician, but–and I was going to quote from his review–but he just said, this is the one book that people really have to read. And the idea that we’ve grown indifferent and even bored with a subject that, you know, that in eight minutes all life on this planet can end–well, nothing can Trump that as effectively. So thanks again."

The couple stunned at the premiere of Clooney’s new film “Suburbicon” at the 2017 Venice Film Festival on Saturday in their first public appearance together since becoming parents. The actor took the more traditional route with a black tux, while Amal turned heads in a lilac Versace silk chiffon gown. She paired the elegant look with drop pearl earrings and a perfectly coiffed bob. The Oscar winner and human rights attorney, who met in 2013 and tied the knot the following year, welcomed twins Ella and Alexander in June. The two announced the birth of their babies in a cheeky joint statement, writing that the twins were “happy and healthy,” while George was “sedated and should recover in a few days.”Clooney recently opened up about the highs and lows of parenthood, revealing he never expected to be the father of twins at his age. “Right now my job is changing diapers and walking them around a little bit. I really didn’t think at 56 that I would be the parent of twins,” he told The Associated Press. “Don’t make plans. You always have to just enjoy the ride.”“I just have to clean the barf off of my tux,” he added. “It used to be my barf but now it’s the twins’ barf. So it all works out.”Clooney returns to the big screen with “Suburbicon,” his sixth film as a director. The movie stars Matt Damon and Julianne Moore, who were also in attendance at the festival. The satirical film, which was inspired by an an unproduced script by Joel and Ethan Coen, takes aim at the undercurrent of anger and racism in 1950s suburban America. "

His phone was ringing.While he was asleep, Hurricane Harvey had slammed into the greater Houston area, bringing extreme winds and heavy rainfall. His bosses wanted him back at the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Houston ― ASAP.There was one problem, though. Brownlee, 34, was already flooded in. “Every road that I could take to get in was impassable,” he said. So his team pulled the maneuver they knew best: They scrambled a rescue aircraft and picked him up in an elementary school parking lot near his house.“I came in, put my uniform on, grabbed my gear, a crew, a helicopter,” and took off, he said, flying the first of what would be many rescue missions in the days to come.The full extent of Harvey’s devastation is still unknown. More than 32,000 residents have sought refuge in shelters after being displaced from their homes, and at least 38 people have died. But many more were saved ― including by pilots like Brownlee. So far, more than 72,000 people have been rescued. According to a U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson, at least 744 aerial rescues in the greater Houston area have taken place since the storm began.On Friday, one week after Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane, Brownlee’s unit took HuffPost reporters on a reconnaissance mission to survey flooding around Port Arthur and Beaumont, two cities among those hit hardest. Much of the area surrounding these towns is still underwater, and rescue efforts are ongoing.The sky was sunny and clear as the MH-65 Dolphin helicopter took off ― a far cry from the flying conditions that Brownlee battled during the storm. On Monday, he flew a search and rescue mission through a torrential downpour, the worst weather he’d ever witnessed as a pilot. He couldn’t see anything except the ground directly below the nose of the aircraft. “We were using Google Maps to fly above highways, because we know that there are no towers over the highways,” he said. “I don’t think I’m ever going to forget that experience.”Seen from the sky, the destruction caused by Harvey was on full display. Mile after mile brought scenes of dramatic flooding, with entire fields and neighborhoods swallowed up by water.Cows congregated on tiny sections of dry land, surrounded by water. Interstate 10, a major connecting highway, was a river. Tractor-trailer trucks stood abandoned along the road. Eric Cybulski, a flight mechanic who has been with the Coast Guard for 19 years, kept his eyes trained on the ground, looking for anyone in need of rescue. The destruction, he said, reminded him of the 11 days he spent responding to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, in 2005.“We would get the smells from downtown ― the winds would shift and the smell of death would come,” he said. “Being here, it brings back the emotions, for sure.”The only thing they had to drink during the Katrina mission was blue Gatorade, he said. To this day, he can’t stand the stuff.In Beaumont, a line of cars snaked around the block, waiting for supplies at a distribution center. Outside a housing complex, a high-water vehicle pushed through deep water. Another Coast Guard helicopter flew past, transporting a victim who’d just been rescued.Coast Guard rescue workers had been working nonstop since the hurricane made landfall. Many of them left families behind. One serviceman’s wife was in labor as he worked to aid his community. Several Guardsmen at Ellington Field lost homes and vehicles of their own, while others, such as Cybulski, were initially unable to get to the air base to help because of severe flooding. “This one caught a lot of people off guard,” Cybulski said. “I don’t think the Houston area was expecting something of this magnitude ― this much rain.”Brownlee said he was humbled after flying over Houston early on in the storm. He didn’t see any damage, and although he was ready to act at a moment’s notice, he figured the worst was over. Hours later, he’d wake up to a call demanding that he get back to his chopper.“My famous last words were, ‘Hurricane Harvey is going to be nothing,’” he said.He would save 20 lives over the course of the next few days ― three times as many people as he’d rescued since he became a pilot three years ago.

According to a U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson, at least 744 aerial rescues in the greater Houston area have taken place since the storm began.On Friday, one week after Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane, Brownlee’s unit took HuffPost reporters on a reconnaissance mission to survey flooding around Port Arthur and Beaumont, two cities among those hit hardest. Much of the area surrounding these towns is still underwater, and rescue efforts are ongoing.The sky was sunny and clear as the MH-65 Dolphin helicopter took off ― a far cry from the flying conditions that Brownlee battled during the storm. On Monday, he flew a search and rescue mission through a torrential downpour, the worst weather he’d ever witnessed as a pilot. He couldn’t see anything except the ground directly below the nose of the aircraft. “We were using Google Maps to fly above highways, because we know that there are no towers over the highways,” he said. “I don’t think I’m ever going to forget that experience.”Seen from the sky, the destruction caused by Harvey was on full display. Mile after mile brought scenes of dramatic flooding, with entire fields and neighborhoods swallowed up by water.Cows congregated on tiny sections of dry land, surrounded by water. Interstate 10, a major connecting highway, was a river. Tractor-trailer trucks stood abandoned along the road. Eric Cybulski, a flight mechanic who has been with the Coast Guard for 19 years, kept his eyes trained on the ground, looking for anyone in need of rescue. The destruction, he said, reminded him of the 11 days he spent responding to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, in 2005.“We would get the smells from downtown ― the winds would shift and the smell of death would come,” he said. “Being here, it brings back the emotions, for sure.”The only thing they had to drink during the Katrina mission was blue Gatorade, he said. To this day, he can’t stand the stuff.In Beaumont, a line of cars snaked around the block, waiting for supplies at a distribution center. Outside a housing complex, a high-water vehicle pushed through deep water. Another Coast Guard helicopter flew past, transporting a victim who’d just been rescued.Coast Guard rescue workers had been working nonstop since the hurricane made landfall. Many of them left families behind. One serviceman’s wife was in labor as he worked to aid his community. Several Guardsmen at Ellington Field lost homes and vehicles of their own, while others, such as Cybulski, were initially unable to get to the air base to help because of severe flooding. “This one caught a lot of people off guard,” Cybulski said. “I don’t think the Houston area was expecting something of this magnitude ― this much rain.”Brownlee said he was humbled after flying over Houston early on in the storm. He didn’t see any damage, and although he was ready to act at a moment’s notice, he figured the worst was over. Hours later, he’d wake up to a call demanding that he get back to his chopper.“My famous last words were, ‘Hurricane Harvey is going to be nothing,’” he said.He would save 20 lives over the course of the next few days ― three times as many people as he’d rescued since he became a pilot three years ago.

President Donald Trump has officially requested Congress approve $7.85 billion for relief efforts in Texas and Louisiana.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59aa241f1b000028005b438b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump officially submitted a request to Congress for an initial $7.85 billion in emergency funding for Harvey relief efforts in Texas and Louisiana late Friday night.The request, sent in a letter signed by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, includes giving $7.4 billion to supplement the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund and $450 million to finance a disaster loan program for small businesses affected by the devastating storm.Earlier this week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the state would need “far more than $125 billion” in federal funding to help the state recover from the massive flooding in Houston and surrounding areas.NBC News reporter Frank Thorp obtained a copy of Mulvaney’s letter and shared it Friday night on Twitter.Earlier Friday, Trump was expected to request nearly $6 billion in immediate aid, followed by another request for $6 billion, according to The New York Times.Friday’s letter, addressed to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), said that the requested amount of $7.8 billion “would enable the affected States to address disaster response and immediate recovery needs in the areas most affected by Hurricane Harvey,” including “life-saving response and recovery missions” and “addressing housing repair costs unmet by insurance; and provide low-interest loans to businesses and homeowners.”As Mulvaney noted in the letter, the request is a down payment on “Trump’s commitment” to recovery efforts, adding that future requests “will address longer-term rebuilding needs.”Mulvaney also warned that relief efforts in areas hit by Harvey could be affected if Congress does not increase the federal budget’s debt ceiling.“Indeed, if the debt ceiling is not raised, it may not be possible to outlay the requested supplemental appropriations or funds for other critical Government operations,” the letter reads.Without disclosing how much in total the Trump administration would request in funding, White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told reporters on Thursday that there is a possibility that the administration may need more than the $120 billion that was appropriated for the destruction caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, according to The Washington Post.Bossert also said Thursday that the initial request would be followed by larger funding packages as the extent of the damage is assessed.After Mulvaney’s letter was made public, Ryan tweeted Friday night saying that the “House will act quickly on [the president’s] request for emergency relief funding.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also tweeted in response to Trump’s request for funding, saying that the Senate was ready to “act quickly.”In its own analysis of satellite imagery and property data, Reuters estimated that there is at least $23 billion worth of property damage in the southeast Texas counties of Harris and Galveston.CoreLogic, a property analytics firm, predicted that 70 percent of home damage will not be covered by home insurance.There are currently 32,523 evacuees in shelters in Texas, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Friday report."
14,WORLD NEWS,Nunavut’s Capital Aims To Curb Alcoholism By Liberalizing Access,"Kassina Ryder, Arctic Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nunavuts-capital-aims-to-curb-alcoholism-by-liberalizing-access_us_59a98819e4b0b5e530fe4d84,Opening a beer and wine store isn’t an obvious approach to addressing a community’s devastating relationship with drinking,2017-09-01,Iqaluit’s liquor warehouse will be home to a new beer and wine store once the storefront is completed this summer.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a9888f1400002000fa7a19.jpeg?cache=BoyZfUSM5L&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Opening a beer and wine store isn’t an obvious approach to addressing a community’s devastating relationship with drinking. But Iqaluit is taking that step in the hope of reducing consumption of bootlegged hard liquor.IT’S BEEN MORE than 40 years since residents of Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut in Canada’s eastern Arctic, could purchase and take home alcohol, but that will change when a beer and wine store opens this summer.In a plebiscite held in Iqaluit in 2015, 77 percent of voters were in favor of operating the store as a three-year pilot project. But the debate over whether the benefits outweigh the potential for damage is far from over. In one corner are those who say Iqaluit already has bars and restaurants serving alcohol and creating the store will help curb bootlegging. In the other are residents worried that easier access to alcohol will add fuel to Nunavut’s already devastating relationship with drinking.It’s a topic so divisive that Paul Okalik, the member of the legislative assembly for Iqaluit-Sinaa and Nunavut’s first premier, resigned as minister of health and justice in March 2016. “I cannot support an institution of selling beer and wine in my community where we don’t have the facilities to support those who may not be able to combat their addictions,” he said in his statement to the legislative assembly.The consequences of alcohol addiction in Nunavut are well documented. The Baffin Correctional Centre, Iqaluit’s jail, reports that 95 percent of inmates who arrive at the jail have alcohol or drug dependencies, according to the 2017 Nunavut Crime Prevention Strategy. Nunavut had the highest rate of intimate partner violence in Canada in 2015, more than five times that of Saskatchewan, which had the highest provincial rate, according to Statistics Canada. It also had the highest rate of violence against children at six times the national rate. Front-line officers with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police estimate that up to 95 percent of police calls in the territory are alcohol-related.The territorial government aims to reduce those numbers and encourage a healthier relationship with alcohol by providing easier and cheaper access to beer and wine, with the goal of minimizing the purchase of hard liquor from bootleggers, said Dan Carlson, Nunavut’s assistant deputy minister of finance, whose department is responsible for the Nunavut Liquor Corporation. This idea has had some success in other nations, such as Greenland.“The idea is that if the government were to make it easier to access beer and wine and lower alcohol content stuff, then that might help with the main goal of helping people change their behavior towards drinking,” Carlson said. “If it’s easy and convenient to walk down the street and grab a case of beer, then maybe people will move away from buying a bottle of vodka out of a taxi cab in the wee hours of the morning.”The store will require customers to set up accounts, allowing customer service agents to check identification and ensure individuals haven’t reached the daily maximum – up to two bottles of wine and 12 beers a day. Instead of browsing shelves, customers will choose their purchases from a list in the small storefront attached to the city’s existing liquor warehouse. “The person at the front counter types in your order and a couple minutes later, it will zing out from the back warehouse on a conveyer belt,” Carlson said.Alcohol is outright banned in some Nunavut communities. In others, alcohol orders must first be vetted by a committee. And in unrestricted communities like Iqaluit, where alcohol is available in bars and restaurants, residents who wish to drink at home aren’t allowed to order alcohol from the city’s liquor warehouse. Instead, they must place an order with the Rankin Inlet warehouse and have it flown 750 miles (1,200km) across Hudson Bay. Similarly, Rankin Inlet residents must order alcohol from Iqaluit.Combined, sales through the Nunavut Liquor Corporation generated about $4.6 million (C$5.8 million) in revenue last year, Carlson said. The department estimates sales through the Iqaluit store will generate about $800,000 (C$1 million) in its first year.Ahead of the store’s opening, the liquor corporation is putting money toward social responsibility initiatives, including the Let’s Be Aware/Ujjiqsuqta campaign that promotes responsible drinking. “We think that if we can provide that help, provide that education, that basic information and that messaging, then that will help towards our goal of helping people change their approach to drinking,” Carlson said.But some believe education campaigns fall short in a place where alcohol has caused so much misery. Okalik, a recovering alcoholic who quit drinking in 1991, said Nunavut needs its own treatment center. “Those ads have been on here and there for quite some time, they never really helped me,” he said in an interview. “What helped me was treatment.” Currently, Nunavut only has a mobile addictions treatment program in Cambridge Bay. Individuals seeking residential treatment can also be sent to centers in the South.The Nunavut government issued a request for proposals in July for a company to develop ideas for a trauma and addictions treatment center. The closing date for proposals passed earlier this month.Trauma and addiction often go hand in hand, said Janet Brewster, a longtime Iqaluit resident and activist who spoke in favor of the store during public meetings in Iqaluit. Helping people develop skills to cope with trauma is the first step toward addressing alcohol addiction, she said. “If we’re going to focus on any kind of a treatment program, I think what we should be doing is focusing on trauma treatment and mitigating those risks through giving people access to ways to deal with those traumas that lead to that addictive behaviour,” Brewster said.Understanding trauma is key to understanding the role alcohol plays in Nunavut’s crime rate, said Peter Harte, a defense lawyer who spent eight years working in Nunavut before moving to the Northwest Territories in 2012. “Depending on the docket, anywhere from 75 to 90 percent of what’s in court on any given day has a connection to alcohol in one way or the other,” he said.Harte’s clients often tell him about trauma endured throughout childhood, situations that can create “hypervigilance” where an individual’s senses are always on edge, resulting in chronic anxiety and stress. “With problems like hypervigilance, a shot of alcohol is a perfect solution to the psychological discomfort or anxiety disorder that you’ve ended up with as a result of what you’ve been exposed to as a child,” Harte said. “The challenge then is that nobody ever stops with a shot amongst other things because it’s an accepted way to kind of deal with stuff, to have lots of shots.”Binge drinking in Nunavut is also higher than the national average. Brewster said she believes the combination of the store and public education will reduce binge drinking and help people foster a better overall relationship with alcohol. Carlson said the government will be monitoring the store’s data, but only time will tell if providing easier access to wine and beer is having an impact.“By the end of the pilot, over time we should have a good sense of whether it’s been a beneficial impact on the community and should be extended, or whether we learn a few things and it should be modified, or if it’s an experiment that’s not working at this time and decide what to do with it then,” he said.There is no official opening date for the store, but Carlson confirmed it would open before the end of the summer. Cambridge Bay and Rankin Inlet also voted in support of opening government-controlled beer and wine stores, but those plans are still pending approval by the Government of Nunavut.This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply, and you can find the original here.

This leaves more than 70,000 unfilled relocation slots.The 160,000 target may have been an overreach, said Susan Fratzke, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. But it was “arguably much-needed, given that there are about 50,000 people stuck in Greece,” she told HuffPost. Italy, she added, is still experiencing regular arrivals of migrants. More than 11,000 people landed in various parts of Italy in July, and an additional 3,000 people came in August, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency.Several factors contributed to the European Commission falling short of its goal. First, many member states have refused to pledge relocation spots because they’re worried that legal pathways encourage more people to try to reach Europe, Fratzke said. Hungary refused to accept any refugees as part of the scheme. Poland hasn’t relocated anyone since December 2015, and the Czech Republic hasn’t done so since August 2016. The commission started legal proceedings against these three countries in July.“Each decision to relocate groups of migrants encourages thousands or millions more at the borders of Europe, to come to Europe, to get on boats and pontoons and risk their lives to reach the European continent,” Rafal Bochenek, a spokesman for the Polish government, said in response. Fratzke also noted that the EU is running other, smaller resettlement schemes that tend to be prioritized. For example, the European Commission approved a plan in July 2015 to resettle about 22,000 refugees directly from countries of first asylum. More than 17,000 people have been resettled so far. Countries of first asylum are the places where refugees first go once they’ve fled their homeland. The EU has resettled mainly Syrian refugees as part of this program. They were taken to Europe from countries like Lebanon and Jordan in order to prevent them from undertaking dangerous journeys, like traveling across the Mediterranean Sea by raft.In addition, as part of a joint agreement with Turkey devised in March 2016, EU member states have resettled 8,812 Syrian refugees directly from Turkey. The EU also sent 1,895 Syrian refugees back to Turkey because they had been caught entering Europe illegally.“Looking at the results achieved so far, one thing is very clear: Relocation works if the political will is there,” EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said in July. Yet there seems to be much more political interest in finding permanent solutions involving resettlement from outside of the EU instead of relocation within it, Fratzke said. The European Commission is now working on legislation for a more permanent mechanism that would provide legal pathways for people in dire situations around the world.Even if 160,000 people had been successfully relocated, it would have been merely a drop in the bucket. More than 127,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, according to International Organization for Migration statistics. That number was three times higher in 2016, and more than 1 million people entered Europe the year before that. More than 100,000 people applied for asylum across the 28 EU member states in the first quarter of this year, and that number was almost twice as large last year. Europe’s “big four” continental powers ― France, Germany, Italy and Spain ― met with the leaders of three African nations in Paris on Monday to discuss solutions to manage the flow of people from the Middle East and Africa into Europe."

Because the rights of thousands of displaced Texans will soon be further impacted by the state’s draconian registration rules and courts have consistently ruled that Texas illegally and intentionally discriminates against its black and Hispanic voters. This is state-sponsored discrimination against the historically disenfranchised communities in Southeast Texas devastated by Harvey.Texas’ voter registration rules will directly impact many of the displaced and are a national disgrace. Writer Ari Berman detailed in a devastating piece last year in The Nation, Texas does everything in its power to make registering voters a crime.The perils of registering voters in Texas include a mandate that anyone circulating voter registration forms be deputized — county by county — in each of the state’s 254 counties as a voter deputy registrar (VDR). In 2011, Republicans required VDRs to be citizens residing in Texas, which will prohibit any out-of-state Harvey aid workers from registering displaced Texans. Texas also mandates VDRs to attend trainings in each county in which they register voters, places extremely strict requirements on how registrations are submitted, as well as compensation restrictions on registration workers.Failure to comply with any of these rules will subject anyone registering voters in Texas to harsh criminal penalties. As blue and red states from Oregon to West Virginia are expanding voting access broadly via automatic voter registration, Texas doesn’t even allow for voters to register online.The city of Houston illustrates the draconian effect of these rules. Houston spans into Harris, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties so registering voters citywide requires being deputized in three counties. A VDR registered only in Harris commits a felony if they register a fellow Houstonian from Fort Bend.Harsh restrictions on registration is just one of the ways Texas suppresses its voters. Federal courts have ruled that Texas has intentionally discriminated against voters of color and their communities at least seven times in rulings since the Supreme Court’s Shelby v. Holder ruling removed it from federal oversight under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.In August, federal courts ruled that Texas’ voter ID law and its state House and congressional maps discriminate against black and Hispanic citizens. In southeast Texas, the court ruled that Hispanics in Corpus Christi’s 27th congressional district have been “intentionally deprived of their opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice” by the legislature.The same Texas leaders who enacted discriminatory registration rules, district maps and voting laws to diminish the political power of the black and Hispanic communities devastated by Harvey are now responsible for rebuilding them. Will suppression prevent these displaced communities from holding Texas’ elected officials accountable for the recovery?GOP Representative Jim Murphy from Houston was the author of some registration restrictions in 2011. Murphy acknowledged the burdens placed upon those working to register voters to Ari Berman, “it’s additional work, but so is having insurance on your house if it burns down.”This week, Rep. Murphy was evacuated from his own home in a boat.While we’re very glad Murphy and his family are safe perhaps now he and other Texas Republicans will reconsider the burdens and barriers they’ve placed upon access to the ballot to those deeply impacted by Harvey and so many of their fellow Texans.The Lone Star State’s suppressive regime of voter suppression and racial gerrymandering has long been an injustice. As Americans rally to support Texas’ recovery, now is also the time to call out the state’s acts of official discrimination that will place even greater burdens upon the rights of those displaced by Harvey.As we elevate these issues that will have long-term impact upon Texas’ communities of color and other marginalized communities we must also support their urgent needs right now. Please join me in supporting one of these local organizations and efforts to provide relief in the aftermath of Harvey."

Such finds are not unusual, but rarely are the unexploded bombs so large and in such a sensitive position.The compulsory evacuation radius of 1.5 km (roughly a mile) around the bomb includes police headquarters, two hospitals, transport systems and Germany’s central bank storing $70 billion in gold reserves.Officials on Friday called on Frankfurt’s residents to clear the area by 8 a.m. on Sunday and warned the effort could take at least 12 hours.Police said they couldn’t begin defusing the bomb until they were sure everyone had left the area. They would ring every doorbell and use heat-sensing technology from overhead helicopters to help them identify stragglers, they said.Roads and transport systems, including the parts of the underground, will be closed during the work and for at least two hours after the bomb is defused, to allow patients to be transported back to hospitals without traffic.Air traffic from Frankfurt airport could also be affected if there is an easterly wind on Sunday, air traffic control told Reuters on Friday. Also, small private planes, helicopters and drones will be banned from the evacuation zone, they said.Frankfurters can spend the day at shelters set up at the trade fair and the Jahrhunderthalle convention center, police have said.In addition, most museums are offering Frankfurt residents free entry on Sunday, and a few of them will open their doors earlier in the morning than usual, the city said on its website."

So when she learned there would be a solar eclipse, she figured it would be the perfect opportunity for some breathtaking shots.

She plans to name him Hudson. The mom also has a 5-year-old son named Gavin and a 2-year-old daughter named Olivia, who was a rainbow baby following the stillbirth of her second child, Emma.When Carver and Cruikshank arrived at the maternity shoot setting, they realized it was going to be a challenge to get the photo they envisioned.Cruikshank’s lens wasn’t wide enough to get both Nicole and the eclipse in the same frame, so they decided there to make a composite of two images ― one of Nicole and one of the sun and moon (taken with eclipse glasses over the small lens).

We feel what we are, and we try to feel what others are feeling, what others are going through. We are grateful for not experiencing that which has been unjustly or at least unfairly placed on the shoulders of our fellow Americans to bear as best they can.We are such a strange, diverse, and wonderful nation, powered by an engine of dreams created 250 years ago, fueled by the blood, toil, sweat, and deaths of patriots and foes alike, and headed toward a destination still uncertain, but awaiting us nonetheless… on the distant horizon… forever, tantalizingly, out of our present reach. One has only to look at the images flowing out of Houston and Southeast Texas and Southwest Louisiana to begin to understand the deep well of human kindness from which Americans draw the strength to help others in dire straits even when they, themselves, have lost everything. The churning waters of destruction — devastating as they have been — are already yielding to the indomitable will of an army of friends, neighbors, strangers and leaders who refuse, in the American tradition, to accept defeat.It is, I am convinced, our empathy, or highly sensitive natures ― hard-wired into all but the most sociopathic, psychopathic, or otherwise damaged human beings ― that makes first responders rush toward danger, that spurs hundreds of men and women with boats to rescue total strangers, that motivates helicopter crews to press the very limits of man and machine to pluck children out of danger, that causes a random collection of men and women—of all colors—to form a human chain to bridge floodwaters and guide a hapless stranger to safety.We are good people. We are. Goodness is not about professing a faith or belonging to a charitable organization or serving in uniform or building houses for others. Those things are artifacts of goodness. They are pretty facades hung on a sound framework of goodness. Goodness is what you are when no one is looking. It is who you are behind the scenes.So where is the dichotomy?A dark mirror reflecting all of what just was described shows another America—a tiny subset of people to be sure—who for some reason still unfathomable to me, refuse to engage in the bigger story of our best hopes and aspirations. The neo-Nazis, the skin heads, the hate mongers, those who celebrate ignorance and demean knowledge, the intolerant and the black-hearted, the bullies and their silent enablers, those on the far left and the far right who simply will not accept the idea that compromise is what life itself—not just politics—is all about.I saw too much ugliness as a kid in the deep South in the early ’60s: “White Only” this and “White Only” that. Lynchings not far from home; fear in the faces of the few black people I saw; and revulsion in the eyes of whites when they passed a black person on the street. I wasn’t just looking at the world as it was; I was seeing the world as it had been for generations, and I couldn’t help but wonder, “For how much longer can we do this to ourselves?”Now, Donald Trump and are I about the same age—he’s got three years on me, but that’s not so much. The America I saw as a boy was the same America he was living in—but we did not see it through the same lenses. The America I saw was in dire need of change, was in conflict with itself, was eating itself alive and needed leaders who would arrest the downward spiral. The America Mr. Trump saw was sanitized and all ugliness and truth of the human condition was removed from his sight. Concrete and steel and boardrooms and deals formed his mindset and skillset. Leadership to Trump meant winning bare-knuckle fights. Inequality, poverty, injustice, racism, human frustration and broken spirits formed my mindset, and led me to writing and reporting and raising my children to see through the clear glass of possibilities for every man, woman and child.Mr. Trump can write all the million-dollar checks he wants (presuming he actually sends them) to help veterans or the hurricane victims in Houston, but my suspicion is that he is assuming a gift of gold equates to a gift from the heart and will be seen as a noble deed. It is not and will not. Gilt cannot cover guilt. His is a selfish act because he does not understand the America the rest of us have come to love and are willing to fight for with more than money. it must be fought for with honest, compromise-possible leadership. I would love to know, for example, how many transgender first responders in uniform were wading in Houston’s waters, or hoisting infants to helicopters or making sure food and water were being delivered to those in need? And how many gays, Hispanic-Americans (even Mexicans), Dreamers, Muslims, and people with disabilities were volunteering when they themselves were in danger of losing everything?The dichotomy between the America of greatness and inclusiveness, and the America Mr. Trump sees, must not dissuade us from our daily fight to beat back the ugly waters of hatred and seek new leaders who get who we are, who believe in us, and will help us achieve the high ground of righteousness for all.For more on similar topics, please visit my blog, But What If I’m Write?"

But on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel issued a 14-day injunction to stop the bill from going into effect ― particularly because of the bill’s ban on dilation and evacuation (D&E) abortions. A group of abortion providers in Texas ― including Planned Parenthood and Whole Woman’s Health ― filed a lawsuit against the state’s Attorney General’s office in July. The lawsuit claimed that a ban on D&E abortions would threaten a woman’s constitutionally protected access to safe abortions, and “impose an undue burden on women seeking second-trimester abortion.” D&E abortions are currently the most common procedure for second-trimester abortions. Yeakel agreed.“The act leaves that woman and her physician with abortion procedures that are more complex, risky, expensive, difficult for many women to arrange, and often involve multi-day visits to physicians, and overnight hospital stays,” he wrote. As more and more states attempt to pass strict anti-abortion legislation, organizations like Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and the Center for Reproductive Rights have worked to stop those bills from materializing. Earlier this summer, for example, the ACLU and Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit and successfully blocked an Arkansas bill that would have required women to get permission from their partners or guardians to get an abortion.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, named in the July lawsuit, is reportedly “disappointed” by the decision.“Dismemberment abortions are gruesome and inhumane, which makes it troubling that a district court would block Texas’ lawful authority to protect the life of unborn children from such a barbaric practice,” his spokesman said.Many members of the pro-abortion rights community, however, have long defended access to D&E abortions, and women have spoken up about how the procedure was ultimately the best decision for both themselves and their fetuses. In his ruling, Yeakel set September 14 as the bill’s hearing date, where he’ll then consider a more permanent injunction. "

Since the actress couldn’t find a children’s book that embraced the beauty of Latin rhythms like merengue and samba, she decided to write one with the help of her husband, “Witches of East End” star Eric Winter. The couple will release their bilingual book “Sebi and the Land of Cha Cha Cha,” which features their daughter “Sebi” as the story’s protagonist, on Sept. 5.“I realized there was no book that embraced the Latin culture when it comes to dancing,” the actress said during a live interview with AOL’s BUILD series on Wednesday. “There’s wonderful books about ballet and tap but there was nothing that would teach kids Latin rhythms.”In the book, Sebi and her best friend Keeke find themselves in the Land of Cha Cha Cha where they learn how to dance the cha cha cha, merengue and samba. Winter said having Keeke in the story was an important way of making sure boys felt they too can be dancers. “A lot of the books we would read were ballet driven, like she had mentioned, and it was catering just to girls,” Winter said. “Whereas in this [book], in Latin rhythms and in ballroom, you have a male partner who is helping lead the dance. And we really wanted this to be for boy and girls.”Sanchez agreed and sent a message to boys who were hesitant to take dance lessons for fear of being ridiculed. “I always tell people there’s nothing more sexy than a guy who knows how to do all those things,” she said. “And they’re strong, even though they look tiny, those guys are strong. So just go to dance classes, if you’re a little kid, nobody is going to tease you boy because you are going to be it at school.” Sebella will soon have a tiny boy partner of her own. Sanchez is currently 30 weeks pregnant with her second child and proudly posed with her belly before the BUILD interview. Winter and the actress first announced they were expecting a second child via social media in June. Watch the couple’s full interview with BUILD below. "

Wendell Gilliard says he received a racist and threatening email on Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a985f01700002000287d94.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A black South Carolina lawmaker advocating for the removal of Confederate monuments says he recently received a threatening email containing a racial slur and telling him to “go back to Africa.”Wendell Gilliard, a Democrat in Charleston, told local station WCIV-TV that he received the message on Thursday from a person identifying himself only as “John Calhoun.” That’s the name of the seventh vice president of the U.S., who once argued that slavery was “a positive good.”The disturbing email, sent from the account generalleeflag666@gmail.com, threatens to bring a “group” to Gilliard’s house and states, “We wear suits. No sheet.” WCIV-TV shared a screenshot of the email with the racist slur redacted. The full message reads:“We tired [sic] being understanding with you N*****s! If you don’t like the Flag and our monuments you should go back home to Africa. This our country and we both know you will not have your way. We despise you and I don’t understand why you’re fighting a losing battle. What’s your address? Maybe I will bring my group to your house. We wear suits. No sheet. How about 3AM?” Gilliard was shocked by the message, but admitted it seems consistent with the times.“Hate groups are on the rise in South Carolina,” he told HuffPost. “The Klan and skinheads are growing in numbers.”The Southern Poverty Law Center says there are 12 active hate groups in the state. Ten years ago, there were 43. However, Heidi Beirich, intelligence policy director at SPLC, told SCNow.com that much of those groups’ work can now be done online, reaching people who aren’t part of any particular organization.She points to Charleston shooter Dylann Roof, who murdered nine black people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015. “He was never a member of any hate group. He learned everything about hating black people from the web.”“Dylann Roof was radicalized online, and that makes him just like a lot of ISIS killers who have no connection to the Islamic State,” Beirich said.The threatening email came a couple of weeks after Gilliard ― speaking in the aftermath of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia ― argued that there were places for Confederate monuments other than public squares.“If I was mayor of this city, I would bring those statues down,” Gilliard told The Post and Courier, a Charleston newspaper. “Not to erase anything, but I would put them in a museum. To me, that’s the answer to all of this.”Gilliard said he believes Confederate monuments are “an economic killer” and that they discourage many people who might otherwise visit Charleston.He said he didn’t know if any friends or colleagues had received similar messages, but is hoping that law enforcement officials can track down the sender.“I’ll go on with my everyday life. This is my hometown,” Gilliard told WCIV-TV. “I believe in what I’m doing, and many other people believe in what I’m doing. We always have to stand for what’s right.”White supremacy won’t fall with just a few statues. Sign up for our email to get updated on our latest coverage."

Read more of our recent inspiring profiles at The74million.org/series/inspiring.They may not be traveling to school aboard a scarlet steam engine or learning how to turn toads into water goblets, but a few lucky students will be learning in classrooms this year that don’t look too different from the ones inside Hogwarts castle.Teachers have found inspiration in the “Harry Potter” books for every detail in their classrooms: from keeping students off their cell phones to managing good behavior to teaching literary devices.For example, at China Grove Elementary in North Carolina, fourth-grade teacher Jessica Moeller will sort her students into the four Hogwarts houses at the beginning of the school year using a sorting hat personality quiz. Those groups will be used for rewarding student behavior as well as facilitating day-to-day student group work in reading and math. “I am teaching in a very old building and when I walked into my classroom (Harry Potter) is the first thing that came to mind,” Moeller wrote in a message to The 74. “I’m a huge Harry Potter fan as well.”While “Harry Potter” hasn’t been approved as a social emotional learning tool yet (we’re sure someone’s working on it), it’s already proven useful in teaching students empathy. A 2014 study found that the seven-book series helped reduce prejudice in its readers toward communities like immigrants, refugees and LGBT groups.It’s all the more magical this school year, as Sept. 1, 2017, marks the famous “19 Years Later” epilogue of the final Harry Potter book. In this last scene, a grown-up Harry takes his children to the Hogwarts Express and waves goodbye. As it’s been 20 years this summer since the first Harry Potter book was published in the U.K., today’s young teachers grew up with the series and are just as eager as Harry to show their kids how to enter Platform 9¾.Some of the decorations are just too wand-erful:Some teachers know that the only thing more dangerous than a wizard gone rogue is a cell phone. Luckily, this prison doesn’t require dementors:This teacher is using the Harry Potter books to teach literary devices:Using the House point system to manage student behavior was somewhat effective at Hogwarts (though Dumbledore liked to subvert the system for his favorite bespectacled student), so it’s not surprising many teachers have adopted it in their own classrooms as well.And for the teachers who admire Minerva McGonagall’s classroom management style but can’t pull off her pointed hat look, there’s always this:Ten points to Gryffindor."

The letter has been signed Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Uber CTO Thuan Pham and Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green.“As entrepreneurs and business leaders, we are concerned about new developments in immigration policy that threaten the future of young undocumented immigrants brought to America as children,” the letter reads.“All DACA recipients grew up in America, registered with our government, submitted to extensive background checks, and are diligently giving back to our communities and paying income taxes,” the letter continues. The tech leaders also urged Trump to preserve DACA for the sake of the economy. The Center of American Progress estimates that ending the program would cost the U.S. $433.4 billion in GDP.“Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,” the letter states. “With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.”In addition to preserving DACA, the letter asks Congress to pass a bipartisan DREAM Act. You can view the full letter and the more than 300 signatories here.

The show’s most recent season, which skewered the 2016 presidential election and subsequent Trump administration, enjoyed banner ratings and earned more Emmy nominations than any other year since it debuted.Its not-so-secret weapon, of course, is Kate McKinnon, who portrays Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, Betsy DeVos, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Angela Merkel, Jeff Sessions and Elizabeth Warren.McKinnon has had a bustling summer. We hopped on the phone with her in June, right before her rowdy comedy “Rough Night” opened. But she was instead promoting the animated girl-power movie “Leap!,” which opened Aug. 25 and features three characters voiced by McKinnon, including a villainous blue blood. Since our conversation, the actress earned her fourth Emmy nomination for “SNL” ― she won her first last year ― and appeared on an episode of the Netflix comedy “Friends from College.” We asked McKinnon to reflect on the outgoing “SNL” season and whether she’s using the summer to decompress from all that political fodder. Plus, we chatted about the celebrity impression she was most surprised to be asked to perform.The key to your “SNL” success comes in your physical comedy. Even in a short sketch or “Weekend Update” appearance, your entire body morphs into the character you’re playing. When you’re in a studio recording a voiceover, are you still as animated?That’s an interesting question. Yes, because you have to channel whatever energy or movement you have into your voice, so my arms are flapping like an albatross. Whenever I do a voiceover, I’m gesticulating so wildly to try to get my voice to modulate in a certain way.That must be particularly applicable when you’re playing a villain. Yes, I did find that my hands turned into these sort of talons while I was doing it. I love playing villains and then doing a quiet version of it. That is somehow more menacing than straight-up screaming, so I try to mix it up a little. You get to do every line as many times as you want, so often I would just say 10 versions of it and then they pick what they like.It’s hard to avoid the aggressive news cycle right now, but do you find yourself trying to tune out politics during the “SNL” off-season since the show became so political last year?No, I’m still reading as much news. It’s sort of a breather that I don’t then have to go write about it, but I’m still reading.When you’re reading news, is your brain automatically thinking in terms of how any given topic can be satirized? That’s interesting. Yeah, if the story relates to an impression that I do, I do go there, but otherwise I just have become so fascinated by politics from being so peripherally involved in it.Do you ever imagine what encounters with the government figures you’re impersonating would be like?Hmm, well. [Laughs] I do always think of the feelings of the person I’m doing an impression of and what I’m saying. I take that very seriously and I try to be very careful, so I don’t know what would happen.They may have some choice words for you, but that’s OK, right?Sure. I mostly stay in my house with my cat.Bobby Moynihan, Vanessa Bayer and Sasheer Zamata won’t be back next year. What’s it like to see your castmates leave?It’s really, really, really, really hard. We haven’t had a big end-of-year exodus for a couple of years, so I knew this was coming, but we were all just crying all week. It was really emotional. You get so close with people that it sort of feels like you’re on a sports team. You’re working so hard and you’re learning so much about each other and you’re getting so close. You spend 80 or 90 hours a week with these people, and they move on, and it’s so exciting for all three of those incredible comedians, and I can’t wait to see what they do next. But it is really sad.Given how many high-profile impressions you’ve done, do you feel a sense of obligation to stick around to help satirize this political moment?Well, to be involved in Season 42, which just ended, was the most exciting thing I could ever imagine. I definitely want to keep being a part of that as it continues to unfold, yeah. It’s such an incredible experience.You opened the post-election episode by performing Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” dressed as Hillary Clinton. Recap the 60 seconds before airtime. I was really nervous. That felt like something that could touch a lot of people, and I just wanted to do it right. Whenever I’m playing the piano, I always mess up, so I was nervous that I would wreck it. I was mostly just thinking about that.It appeared that you got everything correct.I didn’t mess up the piano.Who have you been most surprised to be asked to impersonate?Hmm. You know, Justin Bieber wasn’t my idea originally. It was sort of a joke pitch. I think it was actually Bobby Moynihan’s idea because Colin Jost was writing something with Justin Bieber, and he said, “Who would play Justin?” I think Bobby jokingly said, “I don’t know. Kate?” I just ran with it. There you have it. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length."

The factory, operated by French multinational Arkema Inc., lost power on Wednesday after backup generators inundated with water from Harvey’s historic flooding failed. That left unstable chemicals unrefrigerated and combustible. Fifteen first responders had to be hospitalized after inhaling chemical smoke from nearly 2 tons of organic peroxides burning inside storage trailers at the factory in Crosby, northeast of Houston. On Friday, a second blaze erupted at the factory.The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said a detailed list of chemicals stored inside the facility ― known as a “Tier II” report for state and federal environmental regulators ― was not public, and could only be released through an approved public-records request to the commission. HuffPost filed a request on Friday, though state agency warned on its website that the storm may delay a response.Arkema CEO Richard Rowe told reporters on a teleconference Friday that he was balancing “the public’s right to know and the public’s right to be secure.” The company did not respond to HuffPost’s request for further comment.Texas began allowing companies to shroud their operations in secrecy in 2013, after a deadly fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, increased media scrutiny. That year, then-Attorney General Greg Abbott, now the governor, declared that state and local agencies could prevent the public from knowing the contents of inventories under a 2003 law meant to prevent terrorist attacks, according to the Houston Chronicle. “Texas made it harder for people to have that information,” Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas, told HuffPost. “We need better transparency for data, what chemicals are being stored near our homes and schools, and we should be asking the question of do we need to live with this risk, and are there alternatives that we could be using?”Arkema, which operates six plants in Texas and has received more than $8.7 million in taxpayer subsidies from the state, aggressively lobbied the Trump administration to delay Environmental Protection Agency rules that would have required it to report more extensive information to first responders in case of a disaster, International Business Times reported this week. The EPA ― pursuing an ambitious reversal of industry rules under Administrator Scott Pruitt ― postponed the rule in June until at least February 2019.The regulation, finalized in December, was a response to the West explosion, and took nearly five years to craft, during which time Obama administration officials sought input from every chemical industry trade group and major company in the country. “I personally met with plant managers and industry associations,” Mathy Stanislaus, the former EPA assistant administrator for land and emergency management during Obama’s eight years in office, told HuffPost. “It’s basically built on the best practices of the industry and recommendations of their own safety professionals.”EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham told HuffPost the rule would not have gone into effect until March 2018, so it would have had “no effect on the major safety requirements that applied to the Arkema Crosby plant at the time of the fire.”But Stanislaus said delaying the rule was part of an effort by the Trump administration to “get rid of every Obama rule without looking into the harm to local responders, harm to communities and frankly how reasonable the rule is.”  Former EPA chief Gina McCarthy corrected a CBS anchor this week after the journalist mistook the delay of the EPA’s so-called Risk Management Plan rule for another Obama-era flooding safeguard recently scrapped by Trump. Just two weeks before Harvey made landfall in Texas, the White House rescinded a federal rule requiring federal, state and local agencies to take steps to protect buildings, highways and other infrastructure from flooding.Yet a small White House agency targeted for elimination in Trump’s proposed budget could provide a critical bulwark against future disasters like the Arkema fire. On Thursday, the 47-person U.S. Chemical Safety Board opened an investigation into the factory, announcing plans for “significant document requests.” The non-regulatory agency, which reports to the Oval Office, said it had not yet sent investigators to the Crosby plant because of the danger still posed by the undisclosed chemicals inside. “While we are initiating an investigation today, our investigators are not going to physically deploy to Crosby until the emergency response activities have been completed and the facility is deemed safe for entry,” Vanessa Allen Sutherland, Chemical Safety Board chairwoman, said in a statement. By choosing to apply its selective scrutiny to Arkema, the board is suggesting the case could have widespread implications, Jennifer Sass, a chemicals expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told HuffPost.“There’s a lot of Arkemas in Texas,” Sass said. “If they can come up with what went wrong and what can be improved, they can make recommendations.” “Those recommendations, if followed, essentially raise all boats,” she added. “They identify systemic problems and make systemic recommendations for solutions.”Whether those recommendations are followed is another matter. In 2014, NPR criticized the Chemical Safety Board for being “undermanned and limited,” making nonbinding recommendations and lacking an enforcement mechanism. Sass said Chemical Safety Board investigations have been widely ignored in recent years. Still, the board could help expose flaws in industry-backed safety certifications. Arkema boasted “responsible care” status, a voluntary credential awarded by the industry lobby American Chemistry Council “designed to achieve improvements in environmental, health and safety performance.”“Some of the worst disasters we had in West Virginia were responsible care facilities,” Maya Nye, the former executive director of Mountain State-based People Concerned About Chemical Safety, told HuffPost. “It’s not adequate in protecting communities.” Nye, now a Ph.D. candidate studying occupational and environmental health sciences at West Virginia University, said Texas’s use of a terrorism prevention law to hide chemical stockpiles was concerning. Rather than reduce public access to information, she said companies could curb the risk of terrorist attacks by keeping smaller inventories and seeking safer alternatives. “That would reduce the terrorist threat,” Nye said. “Hiding information and keeping people feeling in absolute terror all the time because of what might potentially happen ― who is really the terrorist?”Ryan Grenoble contributed reporting."

The telethon is scheduled for Sept. 12.Bun B, who has consistently given back to the community in Houston, told TMZ that he came up with the idea after talking to several people about how he could make a large-scale impact. “I reached out [to Braun], he was immediately receptive,” he said in a video interview. “We reached out to literally every major television network. Everyone was like yeah, let’s do it, so literally within maybe, I would say 72 hours we put together a nationally televised telethon.” Foxx, who’s from Terrell, Texas, announced that he would be one of the telethon’s celebrity hosts in an Instagram video Wednesday.“Just wanted to let everyone in Texas know, we got you. From a fellow Texan, my heart goes out, my prayers go out,” Foxx said, adding that he has already donated $25,000 to GlobalGiving to help victims. “Houston, Beaumont and all of those different places, we’re here for you. God bless.”The one-hour telethon will be hosted simultaneously in Los Angeles by Foxx and (tentatively) Hilary Duff, in New York by Michael Strahan and in Nashville by Reese Witherspoon and Blake Shelton, TMZ reported. Bun B and Braun are expecting more celebrity participation to come, hoping that Beyoncé and Jim Parsons will be on that list. The major networks will air the telethon, according to TMZ.Bun B also told the outlet that he’d only invite the president if he’s there with former presidents as a sign of unity. “Putting Trump on by himself would send the wrong message and people wouldn’t buy the sincerity of it,” he said. “After what he did in Charlottesville, he’s not a symbol of unity and it would rub people the wrong way.”The “Get Throwed” rapper said that it’s important to unite as a country now, especially given the divisive events that occurred before the storm. “Houston is an example ... of what Americans will do. We will stand together, we will help each other in spite of the rhetoric that comes from the loudest mouths in the room, when it comes down to it, humans help humans, Houstonians help Houstonians,” he said “And that’s what this telethon is all about. We’re reaching out to the compassion and the concern and the humanity of people worldwide.”Other Houston artists are also pitching in to help those affected in their hometown. Beyoncé announced that she would be working with her nonprofit and local church to “help as many as [they] can” and Solange announced on Wednesday that she’s donating proceeds from two of her concerts to Harvey victims. Rapper Trae tha Truth launched a Harvey relief fund after helping the fire department rescue people who needed help.Harvey hit Texas last week as a Category 4 hurricane. Officials have reported at least 35 fatalities due to the flooding and winds. Though the rain has stopped, more than 200,000 residents remain without power."

I’ve spent the better part of my life telling Democrats that everything was going to be okay when Republicans were in the White House and telling Republicans that everything was going to be okay when Democrats were in the White House. Usually, that was me telling my parents, “Get off the ledge, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama weren’t going to bring an end to Western Civilization,” and that everything was going to be just fine. In this case, there are a lot of times when people ask me, “Are we going to be okay?” and I just have to say, “We’ll see.” There is a madness that’s been going on in Washington for the past seven months that respects no boundaries. Without getting too political, when you have somebody calling the press “Enemies of The People” that’s straight out of Stalin and Mao’s playbook. You have somebody that’s undermining judicial authority that’s out of Putin’s playbook. So there was this madness and as we approached this EP, instead of just going back and recording songs we’d already written, on July 4th weekend, we went in to record four songs and I decided to write two new ones. One was “Welcome To The Monkey House,” and the other was, “When Will You Go?” I guess I may have gotten a little bit of inspiration from a certain tweet the president tweeted out just a few days before about the media. It was fun and timely but that’s one of the cool things about recording today. You can write a song on a Friday, record it on a Saturday, send it to your record company on Monday, and get it released in many places.MR: On the surface, ""When Will You Go?"" could just be an angry love song. But this one has so much anger, you’re clearly taking aim at something larger.JS: I think there's a lot of anger, there's a lot of reaction, and there also is a lot of observation about certain relationships and things that you see on TV and things that you hear behind the scenes. A lot of that went into writing the lyrics. But it was a really fun song to do because originally when I wrote it, I said, ""I'd love to get a really big drum sound, a really big synth sound, throw a reverb on everything and make it sound like M83's 'Graveyard Girl.'"" I got a hold of an old amp called a Mitchell Pro 100, which is what Rivers Cuomo used on the Blue album and I said, ""Wait a second, let's kind of do a Cars/Weezer sound."" The second I started doing it, I said, ""Yeah, this is good. I think this is much better."" It was a lot of fun writing the lyrics but the music was really where we had a blast. Everybody in the band's a huge Weezer fan. When I brought it to them, I said, ""You guys know who Weezer is?"" and they're like, ""Yeah!"" So we had a sort of Pinkerton versus Blue and Green debate for the next three days.MR: [laughs] Which is your favorite?JS: Well, I am not as heavy into Weezer as a lot of the other guys in the band. If you're heavy into Weezer, you usually fall in the Pinkerton side of things. I'm more of a Blue and Green Weezer fan. What about you?MR: Blue. I’ve listened to it so many times, it's in my DNA.JS: Blue's my favorite. Green was a nice comeback even though it was only like twenty-eight minutes long. But I thought Blue was a special album.MR: Joe, what's going on in the studio with you and your musicians?JS: We're finishing up the third EP now. That's twelve songs in three months so at this point, we’ve figured out a system. It's a timely question because it's one that I can actually answer now. The first EP was me doing the basics—all the guitars, bass, and acoustic, then bringing other guys in and having them play on top of that, putting their own parts in. It's moved on to a point where I go in first with Mikhail Pivovarov, who is our bassist and engineer, and Nick [Nicholas Wells], who plays the keys and is the music director. I'll go in with an idea, tell them where I want to go with it and the sound I want, and it usually starts with the drummer, Kenny Shaw. He’ll come in, I'll teach him the drum track and play sort of a rough scratch guitar with him. After Kenny, I'll put on all my guitars, which will give everybody else guidance for where we want to go. Then we'll bring in guitarist Paul Maddison and he’ll put on his guitar parts, which are just great. He's a great guitarist. Then we'll add Mikhail's bass. On the first EP [Mystified], we brought the horns in but the horn guys are also really good guitarists. Also, the synth guy, Ben Kibby, is a great guitarist. I had no idea until like three weeks ago. He's a total synth freak! He's got all these Moogs and old Korgs. I was knocking around trying to find a sound and he heard me say, ""Oh man, I really need the synth sound from 'Best Friend's Girl' by the Cars."" I wanted that for ""When Will You Go?"" He said, ""Let me bring some of my old synths over."" That's the next thing we did for this EP was build out drum loops and synths with Ben, then we finished up with the horns and background vocals. I recorded the vocal tracks at the very end. Then Mikhail, Nick, and I went into a deep, dark cave and mixed-down, then poor Mikhail had to master it all.The crazy thing is we’re recording, mixing, producing, arranging, and mastering four songs a month, and after three months, we're looking at each other saying, ""This isn't a breeze. This is kind of tough!"" But we're having a good time and learning how to get the sound we want really quickly. I do my show [Morning Joe] and then, basically, I'm doing music. I do my show for three hours a day and work related to that for three or four hours more. Then the rest of my life is spent either in our studio or mixing with Mikhail and Nick.MR: And you've only got another 194 songs to go.JS: The problem is we're not getting through the backlog because we keep writing new songs. For September’s album, I've written two more new songs. We've already recorded fifty-one or fifty-two that are done. Any time we have the discipline to say, ""Okay, this one's good to go as is,"" it's like we're getting away with something. On the August EP, Welcome To The Monkey House, ""Catch Me If You Can"" only required a few adjustments in mixing. On the next one, we've got a song called ""Priscilla Jones"" that is in the same situation. We like it as is. Again, we feel like we're getting away with something when we think we can just find an old track, remix it, and put it up there instead of writing, producing, and building something from scratch. We're not getting through our two hundred songs very well. MR: Well, who would complain if you released EPs with six or seven songs each?JS: It's funny you say that. Sony Red [distributor] said, ""Hey, doing this every month sort of puts a stress on the system, could you do it every other month?"" My answer to date has been, ""No,"" because I just have too many songs and not enough time to get through them even if I put them out every month. I think what you just said may be a solution. I may start putting out six or seven every month. That may be a better way to get through the songs in two years.MR: And there are different concepts you could experiment with as you go along. Maybe you could explore different ways to market the music as you’re making it.JS: Yeah! And we're going to have four or five EPs and twenty-five songs or so out in 2017. We went on Colbert, played ""Welcome To The Monkey House,"" and sort of released it as a single. We're going on The View and we'll probably do something off the first EP that will fit The View better. We're not going on the 1995 model where you record an album a year, you get it ready, you put it out, and then you promote that one release for a year. We're keeping the songs coming out and if I want to go back in three months or four months to record an EP, I'll do that. If people like it, they can go on Spotify or Apple, stream it or buy it. I don’t think they really care whether it was an EP released in August or an EP released in November.MR: That’s like the She & Him or Belle & Sebastian model. They released EPs pretty often. I guess that's now the 2017 norm for creativity meeting distribution.JS: Yeah!MR: Is that Mika singing the female solo on ""...Monkey House?""JS: No, our two background singers are Roz Brown and Tanesha Gary.MR: And is that you singing all the parts of that big block vocal on ""Party Line""? JS: You mean at the top? That’s Nick Wells and me. We wanted that big sound. Originally, the song was three and a half minutes of what you hear when everything else comes in. It was very produced from the beginning to the end. I decided I wanted to get two or three parts and make it a little more interesting for listeners. So Nick and I went in and did all the parts, overdubbed about twenty times, then we did an old Beatles trick where we ran the recording into a huge room, turned the speakers all the way up, and put microphones around the room. Digital plug-ins will get you a lot, but I've never found a digital plug-in that does as good a job with reverb as an old spring reverb unit I had back in the eighties. It's always driven me crazy because reverb plug-ins that you use through ProTools or other systems have a ping to them. There's a harshness and a shrillness to them. I said, ""Hey guys, let's put the speakers out and crank it up loud! I've got wood all over the place and these right angles so it's not a square room. We'll get a nice, warm sound."" We heard it back and everybody was like, ""Wow!"" It sounds weird but you can hear the wood in that part. So we did that and then for the next part, I wanted to strip it down. I thought I was doing sort of a Beach Boys thing with stripped-down guitars and a sparse organ, but it ended up sounding more like I was trying to rip off Vampire Weekend than The Beach Boys.MR: Ha! So you've accumulated a lot of knowledge of old and new recording technologies. Do you now find yourself leaning toward one approach or another? As you’ve gotten more comfortable and expert with digital production, are you now possibly trying to include more analog elements?JS: Yeah, definitely, and I think you'll hear that in the coming months. We're really in that transition now. When I first went in and recorded the fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two songs, I was so taken by what digital technology could do—how easy it was to gate drums and how easy it was to just dial up a digital version of a Fairchild 660 that The Beatles and everybody else used in the sixties and seventies. As we're putting the EPs out, I've gotten pickier. A huge project of Mikhail's for about six months was to build a Fairchild 660 from the ground up, which was sort of The Beatles' secret sauce—George Martin's secret sauce in producing them in the early years especially. After I heard what that did to vocals, it was such a stark difference between what you got out of a plug-in on ProTools and what you actually got from the real thing. I immediately started looking for other units, whether they were compressors, limiters, everything. That's when we made the decision last month that we weren't going to use any plug-ins for reverb anymore. We're going to do what all the old acts did in the fifties and sixties. For example, they had an echo room down below Capitol Studios. It was this massive room. I was talking to Harry Connick, Jr. about it. He said it was so cool that he got to go out and use it. He said not only did they record everything through there, they also mastered everything through there! Nobody would do that today because it would supposedly muddy everything up but that's what we're doing now. We're using our own version of the echo room that has a lot of wood, a lot of angles. There is no comparison between what sound that gives you and what a reverb plug-in will give you. I'm sure a lot of people will say, ""Hey, you should try this...,"" and I'm always open to experiment with anything. But I still don't think you can ever top a natural echo room for reverb, as people used to do in the fifties and sixties especially.MR: That concept also applies to vintage instruments like guitars. In some cases, it’s the age that makes them sound better, and in other cases, it’s the older design specs.JS: You're right. The greatest bass that I've ever played in my life was while I was doing a demo a couple of years ago that I had to get to Mikhail and Nick. I was up in Boston, went in to a little studio and said, ""I need a bass. You got a bass?"" The guy goes, ""Yeah,"" and hands me his. I played it and it's a 1971 Fender Jazz bass. It was the greatest-sounding bass I'd ever heard. I said to the guy, ""I've been playing basses for forty years, I've never played anything remotely as good as this!” He said, ""I picked it up in 1971, I brought it into the studio, and I haven't changed the strings since."" It's perfect because we've got audiophiles who will sit and try to examine and perfect things, but sometimes, there's magic in forty year-old bass strings. When we did ""Party Line,"" we were up at Nick’s place. We usually record at mine but we were up there mixing things down. I asked, ""You’ve got a guitar?"" He said, ""I've just got this old, crappy Epiphone guitar. I haven't changed the strings on it for ten years."" I go, ""That sounds perfect!"" When you hear the chugging part on ""Party Line"" after the big vocal part, that's the old guitar with ten year-old strings that sounds perfect for the part. And you can get magic out of a small, little amp where the speaker's distorting in a way it's not supposed to but gives you the perfect sound.MR: Considering your current creative trajectory, do you think you might make it out to Capitol Studios to record someday? JS: I would love to! That would be a thrill. Everybody asks, ""Hey, if we keep recording every month, do you think we'll get to Abbey Road?"" Yeah, that would be great! But I'd love to go out to Capitol and see that first. Talk about legends...amazing.MR: Joe, you’ve written a few books with political and autobiographical material. Are you ever tempted to write a book with a musical topic?JS: I would love to because it's my first love! I actually talked to John Heilemann three years or so ago about approaching Paul McCartney's brother-in-law—who's also his attorney and gatekeeper—about writing the story of the Band On The Run album. It’s an extraordinary story about this huge superstar who was at a breaking point where critics were absolutely savaging him because he put out Wildlife and Red Rose Speedway, a couple of albums that even he and Linda were saying weren't up to snuff. So he just trucked it all [equipment, etc.] to Lagos, Nigeria. Poor Geoff Emerick had to avoid scorpions and snakes to build an EMI studio there! They thought McCartney had a heart attack and a stroke in the middle of recording. He got held up. Paul and Linda both thought they were going to get murdered. All of his tapes were stolen, all of his demos, and he had to start over. His band quit on the day before he flew into Lagos. So it was just he, Linda and Denny Laine, and they created, I think, one of the best albums of the 1970s and certainly his greatest work since The Beatles. Heilemann and I have been talking about writing that book for a couple of years, but unfortunately, I'm staying busy with what I'm doing and he has to keep writing these Game Change books. One of these days, we're going to do it.MR: Is this period we’re all going through pushing you to be more creative?JS: It is. I think part of the reason why I'm in this manic rush to write all of these new songs and release all these new songs may be because of the times we're living in. It's like Kurt Vonnegut wrote about in Welcome To The Monkey House. Post Charlottesville, I've started writing a song called ""Stand."" It's a really stripped-down acoustic song that may be on the next EP or the one following that. We've closed up September’s EP but we may put it on the October EP. I haven't written a lot of political songs in my life. But I don't know how anybody who loves this country that sees what's going on and who writes songs, essays, or plays... I don't know how the chaos of the moment and the danger of the moment where you have a civilization that's really standing on the edge and you've got three hundred and twenty million people in the world watching and trying to figure out which way we're going to break as a country and as a civilization, I don't know how that doesn't affect your writing. You'd have to be locked in a basement and pretty isolated not to have it impact your life. I suspect Charlottesville will subtly play itself out in several songs in the next few months, far more subtle than the direct hammer effect that we had with ""...Monkey House"" and ""When Will You Go?""MR: [laughs] I appreciate those two songs especially because of their brutal directness. In my opinion, their bluntness was like vintage Elvis Costello.JS: And ""Party Line"" was also chosen for a reason. ""See it in your eyes, break the party line. I wanna know, does love mean nothing, nothing?"" That may have been directed at some Republicans friends of mine.MR: On the other hand, you could experiment with the intimate, singer-songwriter route. You don't have to use a seventies folk sound like early James Taylor records but an Elvis Costello approach might be the right balance.JS: Yeah, and that's what I'm planning to do with ""Stand."" You're right, it doesn't have to be Gordon Lightfoot, even though I love Gordon Lightfoot songs. I suspect production-wise, it'll be a lot closer to Elvis Costello.MR: One last question. You've been releasing digital EPs for efficiency but will you ever put your music out on vinyl or CDs?JS: With Vinyl and CD, we've ordered them for the first three. I think we're going to have CDs by September. We're getting vinyl and CDs out and we're going to start having them at our shows.Transcribed by Galen HawthorneScarborough’s two EPs, presented here for your listening pleasure. PLAY IT LOUD! "

That's twelve songs in three months so at this point, we’ve figured out a system. It's a timely question because it's one that I can actually answer now. The first EP was me doing the basics—all the guitars, bass, and acoustic, then bringing other guys in and having them play on top of that, putting their own parts in. It's moved on to a point where I go in first with Mikhail Pivovarov, who is our bassist and engineer, and Nick [Nicholas Wells], who plays the keys and is the music director. I'll go in with an idea, tell them where I want to go with it and the sound I want, and it usually starts with the drummer, Kenny Shaw. He’ll come in, I'll teach him the drum track and play sort of a rough scratch guitar with him. After Kenny, I'll put on all my guitars, which will give everybody else guidance for where we want to go. Then we'll bring in guitarist Paul Maddison and he’ll put on his guitar parts, which are just great. He's a great guitarist. Then we'll add Mikhail's bass. On the first EP [Mystified], we brought the horns in but the horn guys are also really good guitarists. Also, the synth guy, Ben Kibby, is a great guitarist. I had no idea until like three weeks ago. He's a total synth freak! He's got all these Moogs and old Korgs. I was knocking around trying to find a sound and he heard me say, ""Oh man, I really need the synth sound from 'Best Friend's Girl' by the Cars."" I wanted that for ""When Will You Go?"" He said, ""Let me bring some of my old synths over."" That's the next thing we did for this EP was build out drum loops and synths with Ben, then we finished up with the horns and background vocals. I recorded the vocal tracks at the very end. Then Mikhail, Nick, and I went into a deep, dark cave and mixed-down, then poor Mikhail had to master it all.The crazy thing is we’re recording, mixing, producing, arranging, and mastering four songs a month, and after three months, we're looking at each other saying, ""This isn't a breeze. This is kind of tough!"" But we're having a good time and learning how to get the sound we want really quickly. I do my show [Morning Joe] and then, basically, I'm doing music. I do my show for three hours a day and work related to that for three or four hours more. Then the rest of my life is spent either in our studio or mixing with Mikhail and Nick.MR: And you've only got another 194 songs to go.JS: The problem is we're not getting through the backlog because we keep writing new songs. For September’s album, I've written two more new songs. We've already recorded fifty-one or fifty-two that are done. Any time we have the discipline to say, ""Okay, this one's good to go as is,"" it's like we're getting away with something. On the August EP, Welcome To The Monkey House, ""Catch Me If You Can"" only required a few adjustments in mixing. On the next one, we've got a song called ""Priscilla Jones"" that is in the same situation. We like it as is. Again, we feel like we're getting away with something when we think we can just find an old track, remix it, and put it up there instead of writing, producing, and building something from scratch. We're not getting through our two hundred songs very well. MR: Well, who would complain if you released EPs with six or seven songs each?JS: It's funny you say that. Sony Red [distributor] said, ""Hey, doing this every month sort of puts a stress on the system, could you do it every other month?"" My answer to date has been, ""No,"" because I just have too many songs and not enough time to get through them even if I put them out every month. I think what you just said may be a solution. I may start putting out six or seven every month. That may be a better way to get through the songs in two years.MR: And there are different concepts you could experiment with as you go along. Maybe you could explore different ways to market the music as you’re making it.JS: Yeah! And we're going to have four or five EPs and twenty-five songs or so out in 2017. We went on Colbert, played ""Welcome To The Monkey House,"" and sort of released it as a single. We're going on The View and we'll probably do something off the first EP that will fit The View better. We're not going on the 1995 model where you record an album a year, you get it ready, you put it out, and then you promote that one release for a year. We're keeping the songs coming out and if I want to go back in three months or four months to record an EP, I'll do that. If people like it, they can go on Spotify or Apple, stream it or buy it. I don’t think they really care whether it was an EP released in August or an EP released in November.MR: That’s like the She & Him or Belle & Sebastian model. They released EPs pretty often. I guess that's now the 2017 norm for creativity meeting distribution.JS: Yeah!MR: Is that Mika singing the female solo on ""...Monkey House?""JS: No, our two background singers are Roz Brown and Tanesha Gary.MR: And is that you singing all the parts of that big block vocal on ""Party Line""? JS: You mean at the top? That’s Nick Wells and me. We wanted that big sound. Originally, the song was three and a half minutes of what you hear when everything else comes in. It was very produced from the beginning to the end. I decided I wanted to get two or three parts and make it a little more interesting for listeners. So Nick and I went in and did all the parts, overdubbed about twenty times, then we did an old Beatles trick where we ran the recording into a huge room, turned the speakers all the way up, and put microphones around the room. Digital plug-ins will get you a lot, but I've never found a digital plug-in that does as good a job with reverb as an old spring reverb unit I had back in the eighties. It's always driven me crazy because reverb plug-ins that you use through ProTools or other systems have a ping to them. There's a harshness and a shrillness to them. I said, ""Hey guys, let's put the speakers out and crank it up loud! I've got wood all over the place and these right angles so it's not a square room. We'll get a nice, warm sound."" We heard it back and everybody was like, ""Wow!"" It sounds weird but you can hear the wood in that part. So we did that and then for the next part, I wanted to strip it down. I thought I was doing sort of a Beach Boys thing with stripped-down guitars and a sparse organ, but it ended up sounding more like I was trying to rip off Vampire Weekend than The Beach Boys.MR: Ha! So you've accumulated a lot of knowledge of old and new recording technologies. Do you now find yourself leaning toward one approach or another? As you’ve gotten more comfortable and expert with digital production, are you now possibly trying to include more analog elements?JS: Yeah, definitely, and I think you'll hear that in the coming months. We're really in that transition now. When I first went in and recorded the fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two songs, I was so taken by what digital technology could do—how easy it was to gate drums and how easy it was to just dial up a digital version of a Fairchild 660 that The Beatles and everybody else used in the sixties and seventies. As we're putting the EPs out, I've gotten pickier. A huge project of Mikhail's for about six months was to build a Fairchild 660 from the ground up, which was sort of The Beatles' secret sauce—George Martin's secret sauce in producing them in the early years especially. After I heard what that did to vocals, it was such a stark difference between what you got out of a plug-in on ProTools and what you actually got from the real thing. I immediately started looking for other units, whether they were compressors, limiters, everything. That's when we made the decision last month that we weren't going to use any plug-ins for reverb anymore. We're going to do what all the old acts did in the fifties and sixties. For example, they had an echo room down below Capitol Studios. It was this massive room. I was talking to Harry Connick, Jr. about it. He said it was so cool that he got to go out and use it. He said not only did they record everything through there, they also mastered everything through there! Nobody would do that today because it would supposedly muddy everything up but that's what we're doing now. We're using our own version of the echo room that has a lot of wood, a lot of angles. There is no comparison between what sound that gives you and what a reverb plug-in will give you. I'm sure a lot of people will say, ""Hey, you should try this...,"" and I'm always open to experiment with anything. But I still don't think you can ever top a natural echo room for reverb, as people used to do in the fifties and sixties especially.MR: That concept also applies to vintage instruments like guitars. In some cases, it’s the age that makes them sound better, and in other cases, it’s the older design specs.JS: You're right. The greatest bass that I've ever played in my life was while I was doing a demo a couple of years ago that I had to get to Mikhail and Nick. I was up in Boston, went in to a little studio and said, ""I need a bass. You got a bass?"" The guy goes, ""Yeah,"" and hands me his. I played it and it's a 1971 Fender Jazz bass. It was the greatest-sounding bass I'd ever heard. I said to the guy, ""I've been playing basses for forty years, I've never played anything remotely as good as this!” He said, ""I picked it up in 1971, I brought it into the studio, and I haven't changed the strings since."" It's perfect because we've got audiophiles who will sit and try to examine and perfect things, but sometimes, there's magic in forty year-old bass strings. When we did ""Party Line,"" we were up at Nick’s place. We usually record at mine but we were up there mixing things down. I asked, ""You’ve got a guitar?"" He said, ""I've just got this old, crappy Epiphone guitar. I haven't changed the strings on it for ten years."" I go, ""That sounds perfect!"" When you hear the chugging part on ""Party Line"" after the big vocal part, that's the old guitar with ten year-old strings that sounds perfect for the part. And you can get magic out of a small, little amp where the speaker's distorting in a way it's not supposed to but gives you the perfect sound.MR: Considering your current creative trajectory, do you think you might make it out to Capitol Studios to record someday? JS: I would love to! That would be a thrill. Everybody asks, ""Hey, if we keep recording every month, do you think we'll get to Abbey Road?"" Yeah, that would be great! But I'd love to go out to Capitol and see that first. Talk about legends...amazing.MR: Joe, you’ve written a few books with political and autobiographical material. Are you ever tempted to write a book with a musical topic?JS: I would love to because it's my first love! I actually talked to John Heilemann three years or so ago about approaching Paul McCartney's brother-in-law—who's also his attorney and gatekeeper—about writing the story of the Band On The Run album. It’s an extraordinary story about this huge superstar who was at a breaking point where critics were absolutely savaging him because he put out Wildlife and Red Rose Speedway, a couple of albums that even he and Linda were saying weren't up to snuff. So he just trucked it all [equipment, etc.] to Lagos, Nigeria. Poor Geoff Emerick had to avoid scorpions and snakes to build an EMI studio there! They thought McCartney had a heart attack and a stroke in the middle of recording. He got held up. Paul and Linda both thought they were going to get murdered. All of his tapes were stolen, all of his demos, and he had to start over. His band quit on the day before he flew into Lagos. So it was just he, Linda and Denny Laine, and they created, I think, one of the best albums of the 1970s and certainly his greatest work since The Beatles. Heilemann and I have been talking about writing that book for a couple of years, but unfortunately, I'm staying busy with what I'm doing and he has to keep writing these Game Change books. One of these days, we're going to do it.MR: Is this period we’re all going through pushing you to be more creative?JS: It is. I think part of the reason why I'm in this manic rush to write all of these new songs and release all these new songs may be because of the times we're living in. It's like Kurt Vonnegut wrote about in Welcome To The Monkey House. Post Charlottesville, I've started writing a song called ""Stand."" It's a really stripped-down acoustic song that may be on the next EP or the one following that. We've closed up September’s EP but we may put it on the October EP. I haven't written a lot of political songs in my life. But I don't know how anybody who loves this country that sees what's going on and who writes songs, essays, or plays... I don't know how the chaos of the moment and the danger of the moment where you have a civilization that's really standing on the edge and you've got three hundred and twenty million people in the world watching and trying to figure out which way we're going to break as a country and as a civilization, I don't know how that doesn't affect your writing. You'd have to be locked in a basement and pretty isolated not to have it impact your life. I suspect Charlottesville will subtly play itself out in several songs in the next few months, far more subtle than the direct hammer effect that we had with ""...Monkey House"" and ""When Will You Go?""MR: [laughs] I appreciate those two songs especially because of their brutal directness. In my opinion, their bluntness was like vintage Elvis Costello.JS: And ""Party Line"" was also chosen for a reason. ""See it in your eyes, break the party line. I wanna know, does love mean nothing, nothing?"" That may have been directed at some Republicans friends of mine.MR: On the other hand, you could experiment with the intimate, singer-songwriter route. You don't have to use a seventies folk sound like early James Taylor records but an Elvis Costello approach might be the right balance.JS: Yeah, and that's what I'm planning to do with ""Stand."" You're right, it doesn't have to be Gordon Lightfoot, even though I love Gordon Lightfoot songs. I suspect production-wise, it'll be a lot closer to Elvis Costello.MR: One last question. You've been releasing digital EPs for efficiency but will you ever put your music out on vinyl or CDs?JS: With Vinyl and CD, we've ordered them for the first three. I think we're going to have CDs by September. We're getting vinyl and CDs out and we're going to start having them at our shows.Transcribed by Galen HawthorneScarborough’s two EPs, presented here for your listening pleasure. PLAY IT LOUD! "

This Texas refinery worker and member of the United Steelworkers (USW) union has a jacked-up Suburban and a friend with a boat. There was no way he was going to let family members, neighbors or strangers drown. Like Brandon, many union members couldn’t sit still through the storm. One drove her high-riding pickup truck two hours to find baby formula for co-workers rescued from their roof with a newborn. Another used his pickup truck to rescue people whose cars got caught in fast-moving water. These are among the many workers across Texas and across the United States whose sense of community drove them to respond to the crisis created by Hurricane Harvey.Brandon’s most harrowing rescues occurred on Sunday, Aug. 27, when he joined the citizens armada, the flotilla of boats owned by civilians who drafted themselves to serve as first responders when the catastrophic size of the emergency overwhelmed professionals. The crew on Brandon’s boat was all union. His longtime friend, Kenneth Yates, a member of Plumbers Local Union 68 in Houston, owned the Bay Stealth craft. Yates’ stepfather, Robert Young, a retired member of the American Federation of Teachers, joined them on the expedition through engulfed Dickinson, Texas. They launched the boat into deep water on Interstate 45. Bands of storm clouds pelted them with rain, paused, then resumed. The flood water was about six feet deep, not quite over the front door of most homes they passed. The current was strong, making it hard to maneuver the boat. At one point, Brandon saw – just two inches below the water’s surface – an iron fence topped by arrow-shaped finials. He quickly shoved the boat away with an oar, preventing the metal points from puncturing the hull and sinking the craft. They were lucky. They saw rescue boats that were flipped over and one wrapped around a light pole. Ultimately, though, both the hull and propeller of Kenneth Yates’ boat were damaged from striking unseen underwater objects. They picked up nine people. One family came from a second-story deck. They climbed down the deck’s steps and got into the boat. Another group was on the second story of an apartment building and descended its exterior staircase to the boat. This was before evacuation was ordered, and Brandon was frightened for the people who chose to remain in their homes. He said he urged everyone he saw to leave while they could but many refused. “Because all the professional resources were being used, it might be hours before they could be rescued in an emergency,” Brandon told me last week. When it got dark, Brandon, Kenneth and Robert went home. They didn’t have lights on the boat, so it wasn’t safe to continue. Brandon wasn’t done though. That night, a family in his neighborhood needed to get out of their house after water had risen four feet inside. It was a young boy, a friend of Brandon’s 11-year-old son, and the boy’s uncle. Brandon drove as close as he could to the house, then got a guy in a boat to go in and bring them out to where the car was. That is how Brandon started rescuing people – with his car, which would end up with damage to the steering system, differentials and wheel bearings from driving in high water. He first put his car into service Saturday night, Aug. 26. He was headed home from his brother-in-law’s house where he’d watched boxer Floyd Mayweather defeat Conor McGregor. Rain was pouring down and lightning flashing. He saw people walking along the swamped road, drenched. Some had lost their cars in the rising water. Some had parked, afraid to drive further. Brandon picked up about a dozen in his high-riding, 1990 Suburban and drove them to their homes, most to the neighborhood where his brother-in-law lived. By Sunday, Aug. 27, the roof of Brandon’s house in League City, Texas, was leaking, and he and his wife and three children had taken in flooded out in-laws. Still, he told his wife that he wanted to go out and help people. “She wasn’t too happy, but she understood that I needed to do that,” Brandon recounted. “I have been in situations where people have helped me. Why wouldn’t I go and help other people?”That morning, he drove to a neighborhood in hard-hit Dickinson, where nearly every house was flooded. He found hurricane refugees walking through deep water carrying plastic garbage bags of belongings over their heads. This is dangerous because people can step in the wrong place and suddenly slip under water. That’s because there were deep ditches on both sides of the road and floods push manhole covers off. He piled people into his Suburban and drove them to a bar that was still on dry ground. Other volunteers ferried them to shelters from there. On Monday, Aug. 28, Brandon drove his truck through high water to get to a donation center in Galveston. He picked up cases of water, food, toiletries and other supplies. He distributed them in his neighborhood because many elderly residents had refused to leave their homes. “I went door to door giving out water and food. A lot of people turned me down. They said they didn’t want to take what others needed.”The supplies were crucial because even when people with high vehicles like Brandon could get out, they found stores closed and gas stations out of fuel. Brandon continued checking on his neighbors and handing out provisions through Wednesday, when water started receding and he had to go to work at the LyondellBasell refinery in Houston.Like Brandon, Felicia Weir of Santa Fe, Texas, is a USW refinery worker with a high-riding truck. Even after her home flooded, she drove for hours on Wednesday, backing up constantly to circumvent flood-closed roads, to get baby formula and clothes for a couple who had been plucked from their rooftop with an infant granddaughter and two other young grand kids. Marcos Velez, a USW staff member from Pasadena, Texas, drove his pickup truck through flood waters to rescue a refinery worker whose car was inundated by three feet of fast moving water in Baytown, Texas, as he tried to drive to his job before dawn. Then Velez turned around and, despite blinding rain, rescued another dozen people whose cars were bobbing in the fast-rising water in that same neighborhood.Meanwhile, the Texas AFL-CIO set up a charitable organization, the Texas Workers Relief Fund to aid working families, and local unions from across the country began donating. The National Nurses United Registered Nurse Response Network, an organization of volunteer unionized nurses, deployed its first unit to Houston on Thursday. Three Texas USW local unions handed out food and water to first responders and the public.These efforts won’t stop when the rain does. This Labor Day, workers from across the country will be volunteering. They’ll be helping victims of Hurricane Harvey recover. And they’ll continue donating their services for months."

Although the group said they had gathered to pray, they appeared to be showing solidarity with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. It was one of the largest such demonstrations since Kaepernick began the controversial ritual in 2016, in protest of the continued oppression of people of color in the U.S. He later called specific attention to the high-profile killings of black men by police officers.Kaepernick is now a free agent, and many believe his inability to find a spot on an NFL roster has more to do with his outspoken advocacy for justice than his talent.The hazards of mixing sports and activism are now on display in Cleveland, where members of the city’s Police Patrolmen’s Association have opted out of an NFL pregame tradition in which an assortment of law enforcement, military personnel and first responders typically unfurl a gigantic flag across the field during the playing of the national anthem. Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association president Steve Loomis suggested leaders with the Browns and NFL were to blame for not taking a more aggressive stance against the types of demonstrations exhibited by Browns players and Kaepernick.“[I]f the ownership of the Browns and the league are going to allow that type of stuff to happen, and then come to us and say, ‘We want you to help us with the flag,’ that’s hypocritical,” Loomis told Cleveland’s Fox 8. “We’re not gonna participate.”In a statement addressing the players who kneeled before the game against the Giants, the Browns organization said it had “profound respect” for the national anthem, flag and U.S. service members, but also respected “the great liberties afforded by our country, including the freedom of personal expression.”At the final preseason game on Saturday, Browns players changed course, standing in a line with their arms linked during the anthem.But the union had informed the Browns of its decision ahead of that game, and Saturday’s display hasn’t changed their mind, Thomas Lascko, second vice president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association, told HuffPost.The president of a union that represents EMTs and other first responders has also pulled out of the event, citing similar reasons.“The NFL brags about how they love the military and safety forces and everything that we do for this country, but obviously they don’t show it because they’re not setting forth any rules about [the national anthem],” Daniel Nemeth, president of a local branch of the Cleveland Association of Rescue Employees, told HuffPost.Nemeth went on to say he’d be “an ignorant fool” to deny that racial injustice and police misconduct were legitimate issues. But he doesn’t support professional athletes using their platform to shine light on “politics.”“I don’t believe in using your position and where you’re at to make it a big thing,” said Nemeth. “From what we came from, what this nation came from, to what is now, is it a better place? Heck yeah.”City officials have reportedly weighed the possibility of finding military personnel to replace the protesting members from the police and EMS unions, according to Fox 8. But officers from the Cleveland Police Department may still end up taking the field on Sept. 10, regardless of the union’s position.“The union does not speak for the Division,” public information officer Jennifer Ciaccia told HuffPost. “The Division of Police is in no way boycotting the Browns, nor denying participation in events with our officers.”"

The statistics regarding the storm are staggering, with an unimaginable figure of 27 trillion gallons of water dumped over Texas and Louisiana over the course of more than two days. Thirty-five people have so far been confirmed dead, 35,000 others have been forced out of their homes, and 225,000 customers lost power.While this storm has hit all residents of Texas hard, for the estimated 600,000 undocumented immigrants who live in Houston, conditions are especially harsh, especially as the state has actively contributed to the anti-immigrant hysteria that the Trump administration has unleashed.Earlier this year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed SB4, one of the most punitive laws ever seen in this country against sanctuary cities. The bill would allow police officers to ask residents about their immigration status and would grant authority to suspend or remove elected officials from office for non-compliance.Fortunately, the racist SB4 law that Gov. Abbott signed was blocked two days before it was set to go into effect.U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia said, “There is overwhelming evidence by local officials, including local law enforcement, that SB 4 will erode public trust and make many communities and neighborhoods less safe, there is also ample evidence that localities will suffer adverse economic consequences which, in turn, harm the State of Texas.”Now the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that gave a work permit and legal status to 800,000 undocumented youth is at risk due to the threat of a lawsuit from 10 state Attorneys General, led by none other than the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.Now those same undocumented immigrants who have been living with anxiety and fear because of Donald Trump’s and the state of Texas’ anti-immigrant policies are especially vulnerable after the catastrophe they are enduring in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.Even as people prepared to evacuate as Hurricane Harvey barreled toward Texas, U.S. border patrol released a statement saying that the agency was not planning to close roadside immigration checkpoints north of the Rio Grande Valley.“Border Patrol checkpoints will not be closed unless there is a danger to the safety of the traveling public and our agents. Border Patrol resources, including personnel and transportation, will be deployed as needed to augment the efforts and capabilities of local-response authorities,” the agency said in a statement.The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas criticized the agency for this regrettable decision.“Safety should be a priority regardless of immigration status,” said ACLU policy strategist Astrid Dominguez. “This is very concerning for the community. It sends a wrong message.”While Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released a statement clarifying that routine enforcement would not be conducted at shelters or food banks, the anti-immigrant climate that has been fomented in Texas has led many to distrust the authorities.There are reports that people are avoiding shelters in Houston due to the presence of Border Patrol agents and Border Patrol boats on flooded streets has caused panic in the community.These are the consequences of scapegoating an entire community of people for cheap political gain. People are putting their lives at risk at a time when they need services most. This in turn makes the job of rescue and law enforcement agencies harder because people are justifiable afraid to seek help.The people of Texas need to focus on rebuilding in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Criminalizing and persecuting immigrants will only sow distrust between the authorities and the community, making the healing process all that much harder.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

40,POLITICS,Virginia Republican Channels Donald Trump In New Campaign Tone,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ed-gillespie-donald-trump-tone-virginia_us_59a9d29be4b0354e440a715b,A populist primary opponent put pressure on Ed Gillespie to shift further right.,2017-09-01,"Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for Virginia governor, is revving up the populist rhetoric in his fight against his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a9d3c31400002000fa7b02.jpeg?cache=GZXZSVgGQN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a new negative ad and revved-up rhetoric, Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for Virginia governor, has begun to echo the right-wing populism of President Donald Trump in his bid to defeat Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam in the November election.Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is known as a mild-mannered fiscal conservative, is slamming Northam in a new ad for allegedly casting the “deciding vote in favor of” so-called sanctuary cities. In fundraising emails to supporters, Gillespie has also taken a tougher line against the removal of Confederate monuments, and he used red-meat rhetoric to malign The Washington Post. He has even hired a controversial former Trump campaign staffer. It’s all part of the delicate balance Gillespie must strike as he courts swing voters along with the GOP base that turned out for Corey Stewart, Gillespie’s populist primary opponent who nearly pulled off an upset win in June, according to Mark Rush, a politics professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.“If the primary hadn’t been so close, he could have been more moderate. Now he needs to work to get the Stewart voters as well,” Rush said.Quentin Kidd, a Virginia politics watcher at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, described Gillespie’s attempts to excite the Republican base while winning over moderate constituencies, such as college-educated women in northern Virginia, as a “geometry problem.”“He needs to appeal to his base and the median voter at the same time, and Gillespie’s base is more demanding on him than Northam’s is on him,” Kidd said.“Sanctuary cities” is a broad, frequently politicized term used to describe cities that limit their cooperation with federal authorities on immigration enforcement, most commonly by refusing to detain someone on behalf of the federal government for possible immigration violations. They often cite the chilling effect that this type of cooperation has on undocumented immigrants’ willingness to report or help solve crimes and the legal challenges inherent in holding someone without an arrest warrant.Gillespie’s ad about a vote on these localities is at once his most striking use of the immigration-driven politics that elected Trump and his least-significant policy shift.Gillespie had already declared his opposition to cities restricting immigration cooperation while running against Stewart in May. And in July he proclaimed his commitment to “eradicating” gangs and restrictions on cooperation with federal authorities.Still, the 30-second ad Gillespie released Wednesday, “Ralph Northam’s Risky Policies,” is notable for the tough tone it takes and its omission of key nuances about Northam’s vote.“Ralph Northam cast the deciding vote in favor of sanctuary cities that let illegal immigrants who commit crimes back on the street,” the narrator says in the ad.In fact, rather than voting “in favor” of so-called sanctuary cities, Northam merely cast the tie-breaking vote against a bill in the Virginia Senate that would have forbidden Virginia localities from restricting cooperation with federal authorities on immigration matters. And Northam only had the opportunity to vote on it in February because Republican Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment’s initial vote against it created a tie that forced Northam, as lieutenant governor, to cast a politically fraught vote against it. In a subsequent iteration of the legislation, the Senate passed the bill with Norment’s support. Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe vetoed it.Gillespie has also sharpened his rhetoric in support of Confederate monuments. In a fundraising email to supporters this week, The Washington Post reported, the Gillespie campaign invited respondents to show their support if they agreed with him that “these statues should stay right where they are and we should teach history — NOT erase it.”Gillespie had previously stated that it was up to local communities to decide how to deal with Confederate monuments, a stance shared by Northam, a multi-generation Virginia native who has nonetheless expressed his disdain for the statues in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville in August. Northam also had promised to be a “vocal advocate” for their removal.And in another email blast this week, Gillespie tried to raise money off of critical coverage in The Washington Post, which he dubbed an “out-of-state media outlet ... working overtime to elect Democrat Ralph Northam as Virginia’s next governor.” The email even echoed Trump’s attacks against the Post’s owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, calling him a “Seattle billionaire.”(Although the Post is headquartered in Washington, it is a regional newspaper that closely covers Virginia politics with a bureau in the state capital, Richmond.)Finally, Gillespie’s campaign this week hired Jack Morgan, the Trump campaign’s southwest Virginia field director, to do similar grassroots organizing. Morgan, an evangelical Christian preacher, has a history of fiery right-wing rhetoric, including recent remarks calling the push for the removal of Confederate monuments “nothing but pure communists trying to come after America again.” He supported Stewart in the primary, warning that nominating the “lobbyist” Gillespie would be a “disaster.”David Abrams, a spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, insisted that Gillespie’s ad on sanctuary cities and recent comments about Confederate monuments and The Washington Post were unremarkable reflections of his long-standing positions. Gillespie still believes that removal of the monuments is a decision best left to localities but he personally opposes removals, which he has expressed in the past, Abrams said. In addition, Abrams highlighted previous occasions when Gillespie had criticized The Washington Post on Twitter and in a blog post. As for Morgan, the campaign is “thrilled to have him on the team,” Abrams said. “Ed is laser-focused on putting forward policies that will create jobs, raise take-home pay, help people lift themselves out of poverty, improve our public schools and ease traffic congestion,” he said.Liz Mair, a libertarian-leaning Republican strategist based in northern Virginia, was untroubled by Gillespie’s immigration ad and hiring of Morgan, noting that alumni of successful campaigns are often hired by politicians from the same party with differing views.She suggested, however, that if Gillespie is too vocal about the Confederate monuments in the final months of the campaign, it risks coming off as inauthentic.“That just doesn’t read as Ed Gillespie,” she said.The Northam campaign sees in Gillespie’s new tone an opportunity to tie him to Trump, whose popularity in Virginia has been steadily declining.“Ed Gillespie is abandoning any pretense of being the moderate Republican he once portrayed himself to be because he’ll say and do anything to get elected, principles be damned,” said Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel. “The Trumpification of Ed is moving full steam ahead, and he’s not stopping the train for anyone.”Democrats are eager to put wins on the board in Virginia’s elections this November. It is one of two states ― the other is New Jersey ― where state-level elections give the party a chance to make a comeback after its devastating losses in 2016.Party leaders view Virginia, where Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by 5 percentage points in November, as an especially ripe place to consolidate gains made there in recent years.Gillespie has kept the race very close thus far, however. The lieutenant governor led Gillespie, 42 percent to 37 percent, among likely voters, according to an August poll conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a9c91f1700001f00287e6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most Americans think President Donald Trump is “too extreme,” a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.A 52 percent majority say that Trump is too extreme, and just 31 percent that he isn’t. But the condemnation of the president hasn’t carried over to his party. If anything, it may have made the rest of the GOP seem moderate in contrast. Instead, Americans are currently split on the Republican Party, with 36 percent viewing it as too extreme, but 34 percent saying that it isn’t. The percentage who view the party as out of the mainstream is down not only from the 42 percent who said so in April, the 48 percent who said so last spring and the 50 percent who said so two years ago, but even from the 43 percent who said the same just after the GOP’s victory in the 2014 midterms.While 88 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s election think Trump is too extreme, a relatively modest two-thirds say the same of the GOP. Non-voters and those who backed a third party are also more likely to describe the president using that term than they are to say the same about the Republican Party as a whole.Views of the Democratic Party, meanwhile, have remained relatively consistent throughout that time, with the percentage who call it too extreme ranging between 38 and 41 percent.Other GOP figures are also now viewed as significantly less extreme than Trump. The public is split, 30 percent to 28 percent, on whether or not House Speaker Paul Ryan qualifies for that label, with the rest unsure. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who’s been floated as a potential primary challenger to Trump in 2020, is even less well-known, but is viewed by just 18 percent as too extreme, and by 28 percent as being within bounds.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:MORE OF THE LATEST POLLING NEWS:LITTLE SHIFT IN CONCERN OVER RUSSIA - Since March, there have been plenty of developments regarding President Trump’s relationship with Russia during last year’s campaign.

42,POLITICS,Pence Is The Latest Trump Official To Be Doing Stuff A President Used To Do,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pence-outsource_us_59a9deabe4b0b5e530fec737,"From hugging disaster victims to speaking out for human rights, Trump is outsourcing much of his job.",2017-09-01,"Vice President Mike Pence hugs a woman during a trip to survey the damage from Hurricane Harvey in Rockport, Texas, on Aug. 31. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a9df861400001f00fa7b22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – What do you do when your boss either doesn’t enjoy or isn’t capable of some of the demands of the job?If you’re a senior Trump administration official, it increasingly means you simply do it for him.At the United Nations and around the world, it’s been U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley advocating for human rights and democratic values, not President Donald Trump. On TV screens across the country this week, it was White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert telling Americans how to contribute to Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts.And then there was Vice President Mike Pence, providing the language and imagery traditionally reserved for a president following a natural disaster – drawing a contrast that could not have been more stark.When Trump visited Corpus Christi and Austin on Tuesday, he met exclusively with emergency managers and state and federal political leaders. The only time he addressed everyday residents was when he delivered an impromptu campaign-style speech to supporters who had gathered outside the fire station where he had staged his meeting.Two days later, Pence spent hours touring actual damage from a helicopter, visiting a damaged church and speaking with and embracing storm victims. He even donned work gloves and helped clear broken tree limbs from a front yard in Rockport under the blazing sun.“It’s almost as if Trump didn’t want to get dirty or like he didn’t want to catch a virus ― like he didn’t want to touch any actual storm victims,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at storm-damaged Rice University in Houston. “It wasn’t Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing or Obama singing Amazing Grace after Charleston or Reagan after Challenger. There was no Trump moment.”Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential bid last year, said Trump simply lacks empathy. “He doesn’t seem to understand other people’s suffering because he has a hard time relating to anything that doesn’t affect himself,” he said.White House officials insist that the administration has a coordinated plan, all of it directed by Trump himself. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders at Thursday’s press briefing said that Pence was in Texas at Trump’s request ― a point reinforced by Pence himself. Speaking to reporters at the Corpus Christi airport following the visit, Pence mentioned Trump 11 times in his brief opening remarks.And Sanders pointed out Friday that Trump is heading back to Texas on Saturday, to flooding epicenter Houston, followed by a visit to Lake Charles, Louisiana, on the way back to the White House, to “visit with storm survivors and tell them personally that the federal government is here to help in any way that we can.”Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said who went where and when ultimately won’t matter much ― so long as the federal government manages the storm competently. “The reality is that Trump being there and Pence being there accomplishes nothing. This is all symbolism,” she said.She added that a far more interesting phenomenon is the pattern of top administration officials presenting messages at variance or even in direct opposition to what Trump has been saying.In recent weeks, Defense Secretary James Mattis has said the military will let transgender service members remain in place pending a formal review, notwithstanding Trump’s wish to ban them entirely. Top economic adviser Gary Cohn publicly criticized Trump’s equating neo-Nazi demonstrators chanting anti-Semitic slogans with the counter-protesters opposing them in Charlottesville, Virginia.Jamieson said previous presidents have given their top officials high-profile responsibilities ― Dwight Eisenhower let Secretary of State John Foster Dulles address the nation. “What’s unprecedented is having so many different voices,” she said.Haley, for example, has continued to speak out for human rights as a U.S. priority, even criticizing ally Saudi Arabia, while Trump specifically delivered a speech there downplaying human rights and has cozied up to authoritarian leaders in Turkey and the Philippines.For the first months of the administration, these divergent messages were accompanied by open, at times over-the-top flattery of Trump himself.On the Air Force One flight back to Washington following Trump’s July European trip, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster praised Trump’s “powerful speech” and leadership before explaining that Trump’s “America First” slogan “doesn’t mean America alone” – an interpretation that does not necessarily square with statements Trump himself has given before or since.At a May 27 press briefing at the G-7 meeting in Sicily, Cohn described Trump’s earlier visit to Saudi Arabia this way: “The president was able to make some of the most amazing deals that have ever been made by an administration, ever.” He then proceeded to describe the negotiations regarding U.S. participation in a climate change agreement as a complicated matter – when Trump had previously called it a bad deal and climate change itself a hoax.That pattern, though, appears to have been broken with the violence in Charlottesville, where a woman was killed and nearly two dozen injured when a neo-Nazi drove a car into a crowd. Cohn gave an interview in which he admitted he had considered resigning over Trump’s subsequent remarks that blamed people “on both sides” for the violence. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, meanwhile, told Fox News that Trump was not speaking for all Americans with those statements, but only for himself.Trump was reportedly angered by both men but so far has not moved to dismiss either of them."

He mentioned Annise Parker, the city’s former and openly gay mayor, who Swanson describes as a “very, very aggressively pro-homosexual mayor.” He also cited how Texas state legislature failed to pass a bathroom bill “that would have prevented cross-dressing men from using the women’s restrooms” because “they wanted to encourage the abomination of men attempting to dress like women and women attempting to dress like men.”He continued:“I think that the entire state of Texas and the entire United States of America needs to take note of this,” Swanson warned. “And realize that there is a God in heaven, He brings His judgments and He calls nations to repentance, as He is doing right now.”Swanson also noted that the remnants of Hurricane Harvey are now heading towards New Orleans, as the city prepares for its annual LGBTQ festival “Southern Decadence” this weekend. “Timing seems to be perfect,” Swanson said. He then argued that God is giving the city a “head’s up” before it hosts “the largest sexual perversion event in the country.”Swanson isn’t alone in citing the LGBTQ community when speaking about the catastrophic natural disaster that Houston suffered.Ann Coulter tweeted on Monday that “Houston electing a lesbian mayor” is a more likely reason that the city was struck than climate change. You can listen to Swanson’s comments above."

Hurricane Harvey had flooded the city, leaving many roads impassable and stranding thousands of people in their homes.It had already been three days since the storm hit. For dozens of his young patients, going multiple days without treatment could be deadly.Braun’s center is one of the country’s largest clinics for children with kidney failure, providing care for babies through young adults. His patients rely on dialysis, a treatment that filters blood to remove waste and excess fluid, to stay alive. They need the treatment three to four days a week, with a maximum of two days between sessions. And without it, they can suffer severe consequences: hypertension, headaches, chest pain, vomiting and ultimately death.He called Dr. Rita Swinford, the medical director of the pediatric dialysis unit at Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital, which is located just four blocks away in an area of southwest Houston known for its medical facilities. Swinford was also panicking. Between their two units, they cared for virtually every child on dialysis in southeast Texas. Braun’s patients had gotten their last treatment on Saturday, before the worst of the storm hit the city; Swinford’s had been treated on Friday. Time was running out, and they needed a plan. Thirty-three of their patients were critically overdue for dialysis and desperately needed to get to a unit. They’d have to find a way to transport those children and their families, who were spread all over the region, to the centers, in just one day.“Many, many families were flooded in, either their homes were flooding or flooded, or they were trapped in their neighborhoods and they couldn’t get out,” Braun said. Six of the patients were under age 2. Some of them were on ventilators, and others had medical complications beyond kidney failure.He called the Coast Guard and gave them a list of patients, addresses and phone numbers. Their mission was to track down all 33 and help them get to the hospital for dialysis ― before it was too late.Lt. Brad Bryan, the Coast Guard liaison to the Texas State Emergency Operations Center, said they immediately started working with the Texas Department of Emergency Management to create a map of Houston that pinpointed the location of each child, with color coding based on their criticality.“We very quickly realized that we had 33 children randomly scattered all across Houston in locations that were basically islands surrounded by rapidly rising flood waters,” Bryan said. “This was mission impossible, because it was such a logistical nightmare.”But they were quickly able to deploy a sweeping rescue effort that included first responders from the Houston police and fire departments, the Coast Guard, a Federal Emergency Management Agency rescue team and the United States Air Force. One of the patients they were able to save was 16-year-old Inesty Thomas. By Monday evening, she had been waiting for treatment for two days, and she was feeling weak and achy. Thomas, her mother and her siblings had been forced to evacuate from their rapidly flooding home in Crosby over the weekend and were staying at her aunt’s house in Channelview, Texas.Her mother, Rachel Richard, 34, said she was beginning to feel hopeless. She didn’t know how she would get her daughter to the center for much-needed dialysis.“I called the Coast Guard, the National Guard, the news,” she told HuffPost from a hotel room on Thursday. She even tried taking her daughter to a dialysis unit for adults, but they were unable to help her.By Tuesday evening, Thomas hadn’t had dialysis in more than three days ― longer than she’d ever gone without treatment. Then they got a call: A medevac helicopter was on its way. They walked outside to find the rest of the neighborhood was already there, waving their flashlights to get the attention of pilots.“These people didn’t even know my daughter,” Richard said through tears. “When I saw them all outside waving, I started crying.”One harrowing helicopter ride and a trip in an ambulance later, Thomas was back at Texas Children’s Hospital getting the life-sustaining dialysis she desperately needed.By 2 p.m. Wednesday, every single dialysis patient had made it back for treatment at the two centers, Braun said ― either through a daring rescue like that of Thomas, or because the roads eventually opened up and they were able to drive there.“What these families have been through, it’s mind-boggling,” he said. “These are parents who are extremely resilient, they are used to dealing with difficulties and complex medical care issues. They were all aware that if they couldn’t get to us, potentially their children could die.”For the Coast Guard servicemen who coordinated the rescues, the news that their mission was successful was worth every sleepless minute. Both Bryan and Coast Guard Ensign James Gardner, who spent hours on the phone with the families throughout the mission, are planning to meet up sometime next week with the children whose lives they helped save. Gardner, who has been in the Coast Guard for only six months, turned 24 on Tuesday, as the daring rescue mission was still rapidly unfolding.“Hearing all these kids were going to be with their parents, and they are going to survive, is the best gift I ever could have got,” he said.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

47,WOMEN,One Of The Last Clinics To Offer Late Abortions Just Quietly Shut Down,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-of-the-last-clinics-to-offer-late-abortions-just-quietly-shut-down_us_59a982b9e4b0354e4409eecb,It is under contract to be purchased by an anti-abortion group.,2017-09-01,Dr. LeRoy Carhart is one of few doctors in the country who perform abortions later in pregnancy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a99fcd24000032004badbc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Sue*, 41, made the decision to get an abortion 28 weeks into a pregnancy that had been very much wanted and planned, her options were scarce. Tests showed the baby-to-be ― a boy ― had Down syndrome, as well as a severe congenital heart defect and tumors. Sue was 38 at the time and she and her husband felt they could not bring a child into the world knowing the overwhelming challenges he would face.“I couldn’t think of leaving him alone in the world with Down syndrome and a huge heart defect ― knowing he may not even get a heart replacement ― and tumors,” she told HuffPost.Although the ultrasound tech who first discovered the fetal abnormalities told her it was too late to get an abortion, a genetic counselor Sue met with in the following days said she would make some calls. If the couple could come up with money quickly ― somewhere in the ballpark of $10,000 ― she might be able to get them in to see one of the few remaining providers in the country who performs later abortions, Dr. LeRoy Carhart. They did, and Sue drove two hours from Virginia to Maryland where she stayed in a hotel while the four-day procedure was completed.That was three years ago. Last week, news quietly emerged that the clinic where Carhart has been a provider since 2010 ― Germantown Reproductive Health Service in Maryland ― has permanently closed. The Washington Post was the first to report that the Germantown clinic is under contract to be purchased by the anti-abortion group the Maryland Coalition for Life, leaving women like Sue with even fewer options. The Post reports that the group raised funds to make an offer to buy out the current owners of the property who also ran a second clinic that did not offer later abortions.“The Germantown clinic is one of only three in the country that provides abortions later in pregnancy,” Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, an OB-GYN and member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, the advocacy group, told HuffPost. “The women who need these services often have lethal fetal abnormalities or other extenuating life circumstances and did not learn about the pregnancies until late,” she said. “This will mean that women who are in need of abortions later in pregnancy will have even fewer options, and will likely be unable to travel the distance to get to them.”Most states in this country prohibit abortions in the later stages of a pregnancy, though what “later” means varies. Seventeen states currently prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, for example. Just this week, a federal judge temporarily blocked a Texas law that would restrict the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions, another legislative tack used to limit later abortions.Estimates suggest, however, that only about 9 percent of women who get abortions in the United States do so after the first trimester, and just 1 percent of abortions are performed at or after 21 weeks. As one of the few remaining providers to perform later abortions, has been the subject to threats and violence. He has long bee open about the work he does, and was featured in the 2013 documentary “After Tiller,” about the murder of abortion provider George Tiller in 2009. Carhart has reportedly vowed to open a new clinic in Maryland in order to continue to provide later abortion services, as well as to train other physicians. “For the last few years, Dr. Carhart has shared his vision with allies to create his own facility in Maryland to address the dearth of training available to medical professionals in later abortion care,” Diana Philip, Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland, the reproductive rights advocacy group, said in a statement. She said that the clinic’s closure had not come as a surprise to Maryland-based abortion providers, and that it had been known for some time that the clinic’s owner was considering closing it.But former patients like Sue, the news is sad. Though she said went into “survival mode” during the abortion procedure, trying to stay as calm and detached as possible so she did not break down, she says the care she received was warm and supportive. Carhart, she believes, did his best to make the worst time in her life bearable. “Please tell me he is going to reopen somewhere else,” Sue wrote in an e-mail to HuffPost after she learned the clinic had closed. “This is awful.”* Name has been changed to protect privacy.

Castile, who was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in July 2016, was the nutrition services supervisor at J.J. Hill Montessori Magnet School in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was adored by many students. A new fund in his name, “Philando Feeds The Children,” is raising money to cover student lunches for kids who aren’t eligible for free lunch but can’t afford meals.The idea was pitched by Inver Hills Community College professor Pam Fergus, who said she created the fundraiser on YouCaring.com to help clear lunch debts for students at J.J. Hill. “His death changed who I am,” Fergus told WCCO. Koppen said lunches for one student across an elementary school year can cost up to $400. Fergus initially set the goal for the fundraiser for $5,000, but after raising $3,500 in just one week, she doubled the goal and has raised more than $16,600 in donations. Castile’s mother, Valerie, has agreed to match the final total, according to the fundraiser page. “She said, ‘The only thing I want for my son is for people to remember him with honor and dignity,’” Fergus said. Castile left behind 395 students at J.J. Hill, many of whom have been deeply affected by his death. Castile would often hand out high-fives to the kids, who made up a diverse student body; forty-seven percent of the students at the school are Asian, black or Hispanic. Many were forced to face uncomfortable truths about the circumstances that led to Castile’s death. “He has the same question a lot of us have: How does something so awful happen and no one is accountable for that?” one mother of a student at the school previously told HuffPost about how her son is coping with the loss and the officer’s acquittal in Castile’s death. “How do you kill Mr. Phil and nothing happens?”"

The actress posted a tearful video on Thursday calling for “transformative social change” after receiving backlash earlier this week over tweets condemning the “alt-left” and violent protests. “I’m making a video because my heart is very heavy,” Chastain said. “I’ve learned so much the past few days about the trauma many people are experiencing in our country. I’ve had the opportunity to listen, more than to speak, and it’s really hard for me to express my feelings, my thoughts, in 140 characters.”“I wanted you guys to know that I hear you,” she continued “I want you to know that I’m committed to creating transformative social change, that I’m committed to dismantling systems of oppression. I share in the sense of what is happening in the country.”“I hear you,” she concluded. “You may never have met me, but I love you.”Although it’s not clear why Chastain decided to post the video, the actress, who regularly speaks out about political matters and shares her distaste for President Donald Trump on social media, has stepped on some toes as of late.Things between the “Molly’s Game” star and some of her followers started to sour after she shared a Time Magazine article about why the “alt-left” is a problem, writing, “If we resort to violence as a way to combat hate, we become what we are fighting.”She also had recently engaged in a heated exchange after posting a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about non-violent protests.When one follower hit back with another excerpt from a speech by King, about being disappointed by the “white moderate,” Chastain refused to back down. “If the color of my skin is going to cause you to generalize, perhaps you should look back over whether or not I’ve been silent to injustice,” she wrote. The same follower continued to encourage Chastain to stop and “listen to people without your privileges” before suggesting that her fans not fight back against attacks from the “alt-right.” “Nonviolent protest has NOTHING to do with self defence,” Chastain responded. “Please look at the last article I posted. Data shows that nonviolence works better.”The social media user attempted to the continue the discussion, but Chastain stopped responding before uploading the video hours later. "

Superior Court on Friday. Chief Judge Robert E. Morin previously tossed out a jury’s guilty verdict against Fairooz in July because the government had improperly argued that her laughter alone was enough to convict.This story begins in early January, way back when Sessions was still on Donald Trump’s good side and was the president-elect’s nominee for attorney general.Sessions, a hard-line conservative whose nomination as a federal judge had been rejected by the Senate back in the 1980s over concerns about his views on race, had drawn opposition from civil rights organizations and progressive groups concerned about his positions. Fairooz, a retired librarian and demonstrator associated with the group Code Pink, was seated in the audience for his Senate confirmation hearing.While introducing Sessions, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) claimed his colleague had a “clear and well-documented” record of “treating all Americans equally under the law.” Fairooz found that laughable. So she laughed.A rookie Capitol Hill police officer who had never made an arrest nor guarded a congressional hearing before then decided to take Fairooz into custody. Fairooz objected, at first questioning why she was being arrested, then voicing her opposition to Sessions as multiple officers escorted her from the room.Fairooz was charged with disorderly and disruptive conduct and demonstrating inside the Capitol. She went to trial in D.C. Superior Court in May. A jury convicted her on both counts, but members of the jury told HuffPost they were focused on Fairooz’s conduct after an officer took her into custody. “She did not get convicted for laughing,” the jury foreperson said. “It was her actions as she was being asked to leave.”The government, however, had explicitly argued during the trial that Fairooz’s laughter, in and of itself, would have been enough to find her guilty. Morin, the judge overseeing the trial, rejected that assertion and tossed out the jury’s verdict, calling the government’s argument that laughter alone was sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict “disconcerting.” He ordered a new trial.Coverage of Fairooz’s trial went viral after the case was first reported by HuffPost, sparking jokes by late-night comedians and attracting the attention of Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, who wrote that “substantial questions exist with respect to the application of law” in Fairooz’s case.Despite the criticism, the government has indicated it wants another shot at convicting Fairooz and plans to start over again. The whole process ― impaneling yet another jury, recalling witnesses, etc. ― will eat up several days of the court’s calendar. A trial date has been set for Nov. 13-14.Judge Morin said on Friday that he believed it was clear what he thought about the government’s previous theory of the case that laughter was enough to convict.This time around, the government will have to be more careful if it wants the jury verdict to stand. Because they cannot argue that laughter was enough to sustain a conviction, government lawyers essentially have to concede to the jury that Officer Katherine Coronado, the rookie cop who approached Fairooz, made a mistake. They’ll have to argue that, even if the officer was wrong to arrest Fairooz, she didn’t have the right to loudly object to her treatment, or at least didn’t have the right to make political statements that briefly interrupted Senate proceedings.Even if she’s convicted yet again, Fairooz is highly unlikely to receive any substantial punishment, though jail time is theoretically possible. Two fellow demonstrators who went to trial alongside her received suspended sentences, meaning they wouldn’t have to serve jail time unless they violated certain conditions.But the second trial still raises the question of whether putting Fairooz on trial yet again is a wise use of government time and resources. Fairooz said it is “absurd,” “ridiculous,” and a “waste of tax dollars” that she’ll have to go through this process again.Fairooz told HuffPost on Friday that she had rejected the plea deal because it would amount to an admission of guilt, and she does not believe she should have been arrested for laughing in the first place.

The co-host of “The Real,” who is mom to 2-year-old Ariah Talea Housley and 4-year-old Aden John Tanner Housley, told People that one particularly challenging experience on a plane with her son motivated her to be extra supportive of other traveling families. Mowry-Housley explained that when Aden was 2-and-a-half, her family traveled on a plane together, and he was not into having his own seat since he was used to sitting on his parents’ laps. The co-host and lifestyle blogger said she remembers getting a few stares from people as she calmed her son, but reminded herself that she was trying as hard as she could to handle what was happening.“You get a couple of stares at you that aren’t very welcoming, but in that moment, all you have to do is remember if you’re doing your best, who cares what anybody else thinks?” she told People.The “Sister, Sister” star credited her husband, Adam Housley, for helping with the situation and keeps the experience in mind when she sees other families struggling while traveling with their kids. “I return the favor now,” she said. “When I see a toddler having a meltdown on a plane, I look at the parent, give them a little smile and say, ‘I’ve been there, you’re doing great.’”In 2014, after her son turned 1, Mowry-Housley spoke with Essence about the ups and downs of motherhood and how it’s impacted her life. “I have had some of the most blissful days as well as some challenging in my life,” she said. “But as a result, it has molded me into the person I am today. As I teach my son, he teaches me. You learn so much about yourself when you become a mom.”"

The settlement brings the possibility of millions of dollars of relief to the approximately 60,000 students who were victimized decades ago by Wilfred—and by the department’s lax oversight of for-profit schools—and have been suffering ever since.For-profit schools have exploited students for many years, and continue to do so today, but Wilfred was especially nefarious. It enticed vulnerable people, mostly young women, many with limited English abilities, to enroll in search of a better life, and then flagrantly lied to the Department of Education in order to draw student loan dollars to fund those individuals’ tuitions. Specifically, Wilfred falsely certified to the department that these students met the eligibility requirements for the student loans, when they did not. (A recent New York Times article paints a stark portrait of the devastating and lasting impact of this fraud on just two of the school’s victims.)Eventually, the department wised up to these practices and, along with the Department of Justice, investigated Wilfred for its fraudulent acts. Outcry over rampant violations by schools like Wilfred led Congress in 1992 to enact a statutory remedy: full discharge, or forgiveness of their loans for students who had been “falsely certified.”When the falsely certified students either graduated from Wilfred (or as often happened, dropped out in frustration), having obtained a useless so-called “education” and with no job prospects at all, they were saddled with debt. Following Congress’s action, the majority of them were eligible to have their loans fully discharged, but there was a big problem: none of them had any idea this was possible. And the only body with the ability, and the obligation, to notify them—the Department of Education—didn’t. In fact, it did the opposite. Year after year, decade after decade, the department, and guaranty agencies holding the loans, continued to collect on these loans from Wilfred borrowers, including forcibly, by intercepting income tax refunds and garnishing wages.For years, we had helped individual Wilfred borrowers apply for discharges of their loans. In 2013, as a result of a brief mention in a local TV spot, we received calls from 30 Wilfred students in a short period of time. On behalf of a group of borrowers, we formally demanded that the Department of Education fulfill its duty to notify these individuals of their rights, but the department refused. We brought Salazar v. Duncan (now called Salazar v. DeVos) in 2014 to prod the department into action. After several years of hard-fought litigation, the department has now agreed, through the settlement approved this month, to tell all Wilfred borrowers about the possibility of relief from these debts.Over the next several months, thousands of letters will go out to these borrowers, along with discharge applications. At the time the Department of Education sends these letters, it will suspend collection on the loans for borrowers not in default. If borrowers in default file applications for discharge within 60 days after receiving the letter, collection will be suspended for them too. All suspensions will continue until the department adjudicates the application. By Dec. 9, 2018, the department will have discharged the loans of all applicants found eligible, and by June, 2019, will have refunded all their loan payments.The value of this relief cannot be overstated, but it’s an after-the-fact fix. The real work for the department is still ahead. As we write this, scores of schools like Wilfred are continuing to defraud student borrowers and the taxpayers, by enticing vulnerable students to enroll and to take out federal student loans, incurring huge debt to pay for worthless educations that they are falsely promised will lead to jobs. Most of the for-profit schools are able to exist only because of the availability of federal student loans.The department has the tools to crack down on these abuses, yet does not exercise meaningful oversight—with the result that more and more students will find themselves in the same situation as the Wilfred borrowers: finances ruined, and unable to obtain relief from the government agency that was supposed to protect them. We urge the Department of Education to fulfill its obligation to students and U.S. taxpayers by refusing to allow sham schools to participate in the federal student loan program, and establishing meaningful borrower protections when it lets bad schools slip through the cracks."

It wasn’t an easy time and it was about the only good thing I had going for me. She was going through her own struggles, having just lost her job and dealing with custody issues with her son. I had also lost my job, but as long as I got another one I figured we’d be back on our feet in no time. I had a bunch of interviews lined up and a few of those jobs I could see turning into a career.Then I got sick. I’ve always been a healthy person. I’ve never come down with anything too severe and when I got sick usually I got better again very quickly. That changed when I got shingles. Few people get it as young as twenty-four, but stress lowers your immune system. I must’ve been pretty stressed because a few days later I woke up with a severe migraine. Eventually, it became unbearable. They did a spinal tap and found extra white blood cells in my system. I had viral meningitis and had to be hospitalized. The cause was unclear, as meningitis is quite rare. I had many doctors and med school students hovering over me trying to get an answer, but the best one was that the shingles jeopardized my immune system, which was already lowered because of stress.It seemed like just my luck that I would get something so rare at such a hard time in my life, when I had to completely fend for myself. But actually I found I wasn’t alone. Each day my fiancée was by my side. As I lay there those four days, nauseous and exhausted all that went through my mind was that I couldn’t help her. I didn’t have a job so I couldn’t support her financially. I couldn’t even work if I wanted to. I couldn’t parent because I wasn’t allowed to see my stepson because of the risk of giving him the disease. I couldn’t be intimate with her because I was too weak. She had to shower me and hold a mirror up while I sat in the bathtub and shaved. The one thing that has always been there for me is my physical fitness. I’d stayed in shape and done manual labor all my life, but after meningitis I couldn’t stand for more than a few minutes without feeling sick. I didn’t feel like a man.The weird thing was, despite all these things going through my head I still felt like I could get up the next day and be just fine. I wouldn’t admit to myself, no matter how much pain I was in, that I was in a vulnerable state that would require me to rest and focus on taking care of myself and letting others take care of me in the process. It was truly emasculating in every sense of the word.I was stuck in a Catch-22. I had to be less stressed to help my body heal and not healing made me more stressed. I had meds that needed to be taken every four hours that I wouldn’t have kept track of without my fiancée. I had a picc line in my arm so they could get the antiviral in my system as quickly as possible and injecting it was a tedious process that had to be done every six hours. The rent was stacking up and I got eviction notices. I couldn’t walk my dog or do the dishes. I had to lie down to write, but couldn’t focus long. All the interviews I had lined up had to be canceled. Eventually I was able to walk around and I actually got a job just to lose it the first day because I had such a bad migraine. Everything that gave me my self-worth was taken from me and while it hurts my pride to admit this, I was in pain. See, I was conditioned to be stoic, to brush off pain and not show it, that if you did show pain you were a wuss, a wimp, less of a man. I got pretty good at it. I worked manual labor jobs from and taught martial arts from a young age. No matter the job I had to prove myself, like Spartans proving their manliness by going through rigorous training. “You were in so much pain,” my wife says when she reflects upon this period in our lives. But I always brushed it off until recently, now that I’m healthy again I realized just how bad it was.But eventually I got better. The migraines ended, I got another job and my fiancée was able to move in with in with me along with her son when she got a job. I lost that job the week Donald Trump was elected president (worst week ever), but in the end it was a good thing because during that time off I got a lot of writing done and was able to stay home, clean, and take care of my wife and stepson. It was a hard year, but by the end of it, we were married and a few months later we moved into a new house five minutes from her job. After that, I landed my current job.This summer has been much happier. Things have been stable with very few ups and downs. Money is always a trouble to a certain extent, but we’re making out far better than we ever have in the past. Things could get rough again. I’m bracing myself. But after what I’ve gone through, I know now that no matter how bad it gets, eventually things do get better. And that if you do need help and support from others, you’re no less of a man.Previously published as ‘A Long, Hard Summer’ in James’s OTHER FATHER column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays:The Darkness of Trump’s America by Maria BehanWhy Jesus Would Want Us To Speak Out Against Prejudice by Reverend Rachel KesslerHow My Mother Saved Summer by Irena IoannouThe Lessons My Family Have Learned From the Past by Annie Mark-Westfall"

Sahar Speaks gives a rare and revealing look into Afghan women’s lives, as reported by Afghan women on the ground. Several years ago, Anita Haidary returned to her home country of Afghanistan after studying for a degree at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. “The homeless people on the street moved me in ways that I was not used to,” she told me of her return as we sat in front of a large window on the second floor of a coffee shop. The crisp Afghan winter sun is shining on us. Though she has a rewarding job as a national policy consultant at the World Food Program, she is constantly reminded of the hurdle of being a woman in her native Afghanistan.“For two weeks I didn’t want to go out, it was so horrible,” she said, detailing the widespread street harassment that plagues Afghan women’s everyday life. “They invade your personal space and privacy, telling you that you need to wear this or that, or need to lose weight. It was so shocking.”Reverse culture shock is a growing problem for the Afghan elite who study abroad but must return once their education has finished. Returning home is often difficult, whether it’s getting used to the garbage, pollution and child street beggars, or the renewed violence that is sweeping the country.After returning home, Afghan returnees miss their international friends, memories, classroom environment, being able to go to parties, have fun, and experience new cultures and festivals. They could dress the way they wanted and walk freely through the streets without harassment, even at night. Aalam Gul Farhad, 27, who studied political science at the American University of Central Asia in Kyrgyzstan, said she had forgotten how the constant blaring of car horns in Kabul could sound. She returned to Kabul two years ago. In Bishkek, she rode in cars on neatly paved roads and was almost never harassed by male passersby. “The drivers use their horn for nothing here! Even if a girl is walking to the other side of the street, they just keep beeping it. It’s so irritating!” Reverse culture shock does not only apply to women. When Nasrullah Hussaini first returned to Kabul two years ago from India, where he studied engineering, he missed his independence and the solitude he had enjoyed. In Kabul, he is constantly surrounded by his large extended family, with whom he lives. Being educated abroad has given the 23-year-old respect, he noted, saying that locals come to him and ask him to weigh in on disputes and decisions. “I try to not let them down,” he said. Mohammad Hussain Bigzad, 25, who studied for five years at Mongolia’s International University, found himself defending his actions when people assumed his faith had changed while abroad, asking him if he had picked up a girlfriend or if he fasted during Ramadan. “I thought they’d have questions about my education, but instead they were just interested in seeing what had changed in me, looking for negative things.”Some of the returnees face depression and a disjointed sense of displacement. “I was struggling with how to deal with the dual expectation of myself verses the reality of the situation in Kabul,” Haidary said. While men are often revered when they come home after studying abroad, women can be viewed with suspicion in the deeply patriarchal society. Getting used to wearing a hijab again has taken some time, she said, and she needs to be more careful in the way she dresses when she visits her relatives. When Haidary first returned, she said, she could hear locals whispering about her, “Dokhtar Americayee shoda” (“the girl has become Americanized”), which does not have particularly positive connotations. Farhad said she needed to explain to other Afghan women why she was acting the way she did, and she tried to challenge the social norms. Luckily, her father is well-respected in their community, and she was able to secure a job as a program officer in the Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society, a nongovernmental organization.  Not all students struggle, though. Zahra Ghulami, 26, was given the opportunity to stay on after earning her bachelor’s degree from the National University of Mongolia, but patriotism and missing her family won against the possibility of escaping war. “It was not as difficult as I thought, and after only a few weeks of staying at home, I found a job very quickly.” She now works as a researcher in public policy. If these students had studied in Afghanistan, they know their lives would be remarkably different. For the women, they say they would most likely be married by now and already have children. But seeing a world away from the conservative Afghan viewpoints made them grow into more interesting people, they say. Now they hope to use their experiences to improve their country, in both their private and public lives. "

Sahar Speaks gives a rare and revealing look into Afghan women’s lives, as reported by Afghan women on the ground. Several years ago, Anita Haidary returned to her home country of Afghanistan after studying for a degree at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. “The homeless people on the street moved me in ways that I was not used to,” she told me of her return as we sat in front of a large window on the second floor of a coffee shop. The crisp Afghan winter sun is shining on us. Though she has a rewarding job as a national policy consultant at the World Food Program, she is constantly reminded of the hurdle of being a woman in her native Afghanistan.“For two weeks I didn’t want to go out, it was so horrible,” she said, detailing the widespread street harassment that plagues Afghan women’s everyday life. “They invade your personal space and privacy, telling you that you need to wear this or that, or need to lose weight. It was so shocking.”Reverse culture shock is a growing problem for the Afghan elite who study abroad but must return once their education has finished. Returning home is often difficult, whether it’s getting used to the garbage, pollution and child street beggars, or the renewed violence that is sweeping the country.After returning home, Afghan returnees miss their international friends, memories, classroom environment, being able to go to parties, have fun, and experience new cultures and festivals. They could dress the way they wanted and walk freely through the streets without harassment, even at night. Aalam Gul Farhad, 27, who studied political science at the American University of Central Asia in Kyrgyzstan, said she had forgotten how the constant blaring of car horns in Kabul could sound. She returned to Kabul two years ago. In Bishkek, she rode in cars on neatly paved roads and was almost never harassed by male passersby. “The drivers use their horn for nothing here!

It's change, education and acceptance, too.",2017-08-31,"The employees of the Banoo travel agency are women, as are many of their customers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598c8f7f22000044001a55d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Afghanistan is teeming with the untold stories of half of its population. Sahar Speaks gives a rare and revealing look into Afghan women’s lives, as reported by Afghan women on the ground. Marjana Sadat and her friends did a lot of thinking before they set up Afghanistan’s first female-run travel agency. It wasn’t easy, but she wanted to show that women in Afghanistan can do the same things as men. Banoo travel agency was set up in August last year and employs 10 women. Its customers can book flights and tours to countries in Asia and Europe.“I wanted to prove that women can work as salespeople just like men, like in the bazaar. In our society, it’s common for people to think only men can set up businesses,” said the 21 year-old, her eyes brimming with both struggle and confidence.She carefully fixed her hair, making sure it was concealed under her scarf. We were sitting in the travel agency where a lot of people come and go throughout the day. In Banoo’s neighborhood, there are many travel agencies managed by men. We could see some of them from Sadat’s shop window.Before launching Banoo, Sadat worked at a private radio station in Kabul, where she faced the sorts of problems familiar to many working women in the country, including discrimination by her male peers and verbal abuse. Often in Afghanistan, women who work are scorned by society and even by those closer to home. Of the women who do work, many have gone to great lengths to secure permission from the men in their families. After five years at the radio station, she decided to do something different, so she took the opportunity to bring change specifically to the situation of women in Afghanistan. She assembled a team of 10 women and started to build the Banoo company.Sadat thought about the idea for about 10 months. She had to think how to choose a safe place for the women she would employ. She wanted to find a place that was near the street, where lots of people could see what was going on. While this seems like a security risk, Sadat wanted to show off her women’s independence as well as lure female customers. She shared her idea with her parents, and they immediately backed her. “I started the business when my father invested in my idea and supported me,” Sadat said. At first she was unsure whether her idea would be accepted. What would people do when they saw her working in a place like a bazaar, like a man?“At first we were anxious, I felt under pressure and worried it couldn’t be done in a patriarchal society,” she said. She felt both love and doubt. Love for starting a different work for women, and fear of people’s reaction.Afghanistan’s women have come a long way since the brutal Taliban regime was toppled by NATO-led forces in 2001. But a weak government combined with a security vacuum caused by the pull-out of most foreign troops means the country is struggling. The Taliban now control large swaths of the country, and the Islamic State has made inroads. The situation for women’s rights is worsening.According to the government-run Afghanistan Investment Support Agency, there are over 1,400 women registered as independent business owners in Afghanistan, or about a tenth the number of Afghan men in the role.At the beginning, Sadat and her colleagues overheard that people would refer to them as “shopkeeper girls,” which carries a negative connotation. It was viewed as odd that in a travel agency there could be two or three women giving the same service they were used to getting from men.“I now get lots of messages from people. They commend us, and I am proud of what we have achieved,” Sadat says. Her colleague Zahra, who gave only her first name, agreed. “People respect us now,” she said.Sadat now wants to expand what Banoo offers. She has been promoting the company and traveling around the region, including a recent trip to India, and has appointed a representative in Turkey. Banoo is also adventurous: In a country mired by violence, the company offers historical tours. Last year a group of 35 Iranian students visited ancient Afghan sites across the country.She hopes that the travel agency will hearten other women to launch their own businesses and do the work traditionally done by men in Afghanistan. Besides housework, many Afghan women do have micro-businesses, and there is a bustling trade in home-sewn dresses and scarves. The only difference is these wares are sold in the bazaars, by men for women. But Banoo is different. Sadat said she wanted to create a place where women provide services to both men and women. “If we only catered to women, it wouldn’t prove that we can do the same work as men. Instead it would be viewed as women helping women.”In the spirit of goodwill and sustainability, Banoo also helps with women’s education. Sadat managed to procure 37 scholarships from Istanbul University for final-year high school students who passed their exams. She is trying to get similar scholarships for studies in Moscow. Banoo has been surprisingly buoyed by Afghanistan’s poor security situation. “The worse the security, the more people want to get out of the country and buy tickets.”"

This is happening at the same time that support for charter schools across the nation is in steep decline, probably because of Donald Trump’s endorsement of charter schools and private-school vouchers. According to a recent public opinion poll the growing opposition to charter schools is bipartisan. Support among Republicans declined by 13%. Democratic support for charter schools dropped by 11%.The Network for Public Education and New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) are organizing parents, teachers, and the public to flood the SUNY Trustees and the SUNY Charter Schools Institute with protests against the certification waiver proposal. Their opposition to the waiver is supported by the Deans of Schools of Education at eighteen colleges in the State University of New York system. Comments can be submitted online or mailed to Charter Schools Institute, State University of New York, 41 State Street, Suite 700, Albany, NY 12207 by September 10. You can also sign the NYSUT email letter. More information is available at the United University Professionals website.The Charter School teacher “decertification plan” is under review by political appointees on a sub-committee of the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York (SUNY). The SUNY Charter Schools Institute is interpreting its authority to ensure the “Governance, structure and operations of SUNY authorized charter schools” as authorization to eliminate teacher certification requirements. It calls the proposal alternative certification, but it allows charters to declare anyone they want to be a teacher. In a series of Huffington Posts I explained why this decertification proposal is a threat to public education and the political forces and financial donors behind the charter school plan. In this post I examine whether the people hired under this waiver are qualified to teach children.The SUNY Charter Schools Institute is mandated to authorize, oversee, and assess charter school applications and performance. It is supposed to approve and renew charter schools that demonstrate “they can improve student performance and operate in a fiscally and organizationally sound manner,” requirements that suggest decisions will be made based on hard data, not political expedience. Below are excerpts from the proposed Teacher Certification Compliance waiver. My comments, in italics, follow each section.1. Education corporations may submit to the institute an Instructional Program . . . for teachers that meets the requirements of this Section. The requirements of an approved Instructional Program under this section are to be considered equivalent to the certification requirements applicable to other public schools of the state . . . Are they equivalent?2. If the institute has denied an application or revoked or closed an Instructional Program, the applicant must wait at least 120 days before any reapplication . . . Failed charter school networks and totally inadequate certification plans can reapply for the waiver every four months.3. At least one of the applicant’s schools must have received a renewal of at least three years; or if none of the applicant’s schools has been renewed, but at least one school has completed its third year of operation, such school must demonstrate that it: as met 75 percent of its accountability plan measures; or, if that standard is not applicable, is on track for at least a renewal of three years as determined by the institute . . . The entire charter school network can be failing, but if one of the network’s schools looks like it may satisfy 75% of its accountability plan, the network can get the teacher certification waiver.4. The applicant shall maintain high standards for candidates including completion of a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution with a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher (or the equivalent thereof). Provided that, an exception may be made for extraordinary candidates with a cumulative grade point average below 3.0 . . . You can hire anyone you want as long as you call them “extraordinary.” The grade requirement for teacher certification does not apply to your employees.5. 30 instructional hours of classroom instruction, including content core study and pedagogical core study, which shall provide the necessary knowledge base, understanding, and skills for teaching students in the respective grade levels, and in the respective subject area(s), for the certification being sought . . . Equivalence? University-based teacher certification programs for Master’s degree candidates who already satisfy content area requirements are 250 hours plus 100 hours in conjunction with course work plus full-time student teaching of approximately 450 hours of supervised by people who are certified to teach in the area. 6. 100 hours of field experience appropriate to the certification being sought, with the candidate primarily responsible for classroom instruction, and under supervision of an experienced teacher including someone who has successfully completed an Instructional Program approved by the institute . . . uncertified teachers . . . and people who have two years of satisfactory experience through the Teach for America or similar programs . . . . Field experience supervisors do not have to be certified teachers.7. Instructional Program instructors must . . . be an uncertified teacher with three years teaching experience who possesses a track record of success based on student outcomes; or, be an administrator of the applicant . . . Instructors can be uncertified teachers or your boss who may have never taught or taken an education class.8. Assessment methods may include, but need not be limited to, testing, portfolio reviews, or demonstration of pedagogical knowledge and skills, and shall include a final assessment utilizing one or more such method to determine whether the candidate has satisfactorily demonstrated the competencies included in the Instructional Program . . . Waiver “teachers” can be exempted from state certification exams.9. Applicant shall obtain a signed affirmation from each candidate acknowledging that the candidate has been informed by the applicant and is aware that the certification the candidate will receive pursuant to this Section is not transferrable to any education corporation / charter school not authorized by the board of trustees or to any district school, and may not be recognized as a teacher certification under regulations of the state commissioner of education . . . This is not a genuine teacher certification so you will not be eligible to use it to teach in regular public schools.No grade requirements. No exams. No real classes or supervision. Not real certification. Not qualified teachers. This is not done for the kids.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

Warner Bros. is making this all-female “Lord of the Flies,” capitalizing on a recent movie trend that’s already given us a gender-swapped “Ghostbusters.” We’ll also soon see an “Ocean’s” heist caper starring eight A-list women, a “Splash” update with Channing Tatum taking over Daryl Hannah’s mermaid role, “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” starring Rebel Wilson and Anne Hathaway, and a gender-reversed “Overboard” featuring Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez. Given “Lord of the Flies” is a story about the savagery of machismo, it’ll take a delicate hand to transpose such dynamics onto a group of prepubescent girls. Of course that means Warner Bros. hired two men ― Scott McGehee and David Siegel, who collaborated on “The Deep End,” “Bee Season” and “What Maisie Knew” ― to write and direct the movie.We’ll see how this goes. Maybe it’ll be interesting! But can you imagine a tribe of girls yelling, “Kill the beast! Cut her throat! Spill her blood”? Well, OK, maybe you can. We’ve all seen “Heathers,” right?“Flies” has already been adapted for the big screen twice. In 1963, theater director Peter Brook made a faithful rendition of Golding’s novel. The second version, a 1990 update directed by Henry Hook, faced criticism for taking liberties with the source material. Ironically, that iteration was written by a woman, “Cabaret” scribe Jay Presson Allen, though she was dissatisfied with the final results and used a pseudonym in the credits. Initial reactions on Twitter mostly pointed out that a female “Lord of the Flies” defeats the purpose, because duh.“We want to do a very faithful but contemporized adaptation of the book, but our idea was to do it with all girls rather than boys,” Siegel told Deadline. “It is a timeless story that is especially relevant today, with the interpersonal conflicts and bullying, and the idea of children forming a society and replicating the behavior they saw in grownups before they were marooned.”You could just watch a “Real Housewives” reunion instead."

For instance, over time we age – a negative. In this age of technology, we’re impatient for instant gratification. But there cannot be time constraints placed on art. It’s already subjective, and it takes time to bring the vision in your mind to life. Sometimes, you’re not even quite sure what your vision is until it happens, but you do know when something isn’t quite right.It used to be that time spent on a project was an indicator of the work that went in to making the best version of something, a labor of love if you will. Take Maxwell Perkins as an example. Perkins, who began his career working for The New York Times, was an editor at Scribner’s and to this day is known for discovering some of the most quintessential classic American authors including Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe.Before Perkins, editors didn’t normally get so involved in shaping author’s work. He changed the meaning of the job in large part because of his working relationship with Thomas Wolfe. Though ingenious, Wolfe was stubborn. He lacked discipline, overwriting his stories by hundreds of pages, and fought Perkins’s edits at every word. But ultimately, the two men understood that art took time, creating your vision took time, and that was never a bad thing back then.I first read Deborah Moggach’s Tulip Fever nearly 17 years ago. It was before the book had been published and I fell absolutely in love. I had already read a review of a factual book about the tulip fever of 1630s Amsterdam and was fascinated by the concept of this mania and how it was the first example of the futures market. It was the first time that money was represented in metaphorical terms, like certificates and tulip bulbs. Then I read Debborah’s manuscript and I knew I had found something truly special. The imagery and her characters were so captivating and the romantic storyline was so thrilling. It all instantly fit together.I immediately bought the option and fewer than two days after I had sent it out, I had received offers from the industry’s greats. Stephen Spielberg, Ridley Scott and Harvey Weinstein were all interested. I felt like I was dreaming. But then the whirlwind slowed. I was devastated initially because I thought we’d missed our opportunity. Little did I know the zeitgeist would only become more applicable. The recession that we were experiencing when I first optioned this book was only the start of a series of financial consequences that we’ve been suffering globally ever since. If anything, it’s a lot more relevant now then it was then.The entertainment industry is continually in motion, constantly cranking out the next big project. When people hear how much time has passed between the option of the manuscript and the release, it automatically colors their perspective. The immediate instinct is that something is wrong. If you go into something with your mind made up, the chances of it being changed are incredibly slim.Earlier this year, we screened the film for a host of best-selling authors including Amor Towles, Anthony Doerr, Dan Jones, Jodi Picoult, Philippa Gregory, M.L.

For instance, over time we age – a negative. In this age of technology, we’re impatient for instant gratification. But there cannot be time constraints placed on art. It’s already subjective, and it takes time to bring the vision in your mind to life. Sometimes, you’re not even quite sure what your vision is until it happens, but you do know when something isn’t quite right.It used to be that time spent on a project was an indicator of the work that went in to making the best version of something, a labor of love if you will. Take Maxwell Perkins as an example. Perkins, who began his career working for The New York Times, was an editor at Scribner’s and to this day is known for discovering some of the most quintessential classic American authors including Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe.Before Perkins, editors didn’t normally get so involved in shaping author’s work. He changed the meaning of the job in large part because of his working relationship with Thomas Wolfe. Though ingenious, Wolfe was stubborn. He lacked discipline, overwriting his stories by hundreds of pages, and fought Perkins’s edits at every word. But ultimately, the two men understood that art took time, creating your vision took time, and that was never a bad thing back then.I first read Deborah Moggach’s Tulip Fever nearly 17 years ago. It was before the book had been published and I fell absolutely in love. I had already read a review of a factual book about the tulip fever of 1630s Amsterdam and was fascinated by the concept of this mania and how it was the first example of the futures market. It was the first time that money was represented in metaphorical terms, like certificates and tulip bulbs. Then I read Debborah’s manuscript and I knew I had found something truly special. The imagery and her characters were so captivating and the romantic storyline was so thrilling. It all instantly fit together.I immediately bought the option and fewer than two days after I had sent it out, I had received offers from the industry’s greats. Stephen Spielberg, Ridley Scott and Harvey Weinstein were all interested. I felt like I was dreaming. But then the whirlwind slowed. I was devastated initially because I thought we’d missed our opportunity. Little did I know the zeitgeist would only become more applicable. The recession that we were experiencing when I first optioned this book was only the start of a series of financial consequences that we’ve been suffering globally ever since. If anything, it’s a lot more relevant now then it was then.The entertainment industry is continually in motion, constantly cranking out the next big project. When people hear how much time has passed between the option of the manuscript and the release, it automatically colors their perspective. The immediate instinct is that something is wrong. If you go into something with your mind made up, the chances of it being changed are incredibly slim.Earlier this year, we screened the film for a host of best-selling authors including Amor Towles, Anthony Doerr, Dan Jones, Jodi Picoult, Philippa Gregory, M.L. Stedman, Philip Kerr, Sally Bedell Smith, Daniel James Brown, Emma Donoguhe, and Ruth Ware. Each of these incredibly talented authors watched this gorgeous film and when they shared their feelings I was filled with such an enormous sense of pride.

It is one of two annual feast festivals Muslims celebrate and coincides with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca known as the Hajj.The timing of the holiday in many parts of the world depends on when Saudi Arabian religious authorities see the new moon at the start of the Dhu al-Hijjah month, according to the Islamic calendar.Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha to commemorate Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael in obedience to God in scripture. Today, some celebrants mark the day by slaughtering animals to feed the poor.According to the Quran, when Ishmael (known as Isma’el in Arabic) was 13, his father, Abraham, or Ibrahim, began having dreams in which God instructed him to sacrifice Ishmael (Quran Surah 37). Unbelievable as the dreams were, Abraham decided to follow Allah’s instructions — but not before asking Ishmael if he would agree to this. This year, the Council on American-Islamic relations is urging Muslims in the U.S. to donate the equivalent of whatever they would spend on the sacrifice to assist in relief efforts for those impacted by Hurricane Harvey."

Gish was at the hospital due to episodes of confusion that were attributed to dementia and his pain medication. Marcy, her boys Chase and Travis, and her daughter Ava were there by his side.A week after making the request, Gish died. To pay tribute to her beloved granddad, Marcy posted this on the Love What Matters Facebook page: My grandfather was in the hospital last week and while admitted he was having intermittent episodes of confusion. Some of it was related to his mild dementia and some of it was the pain medicine.The beautifully told anecdote has garnered over 13 thousand “reactions” on Facebook and it’s left plenty of people teary-eyed. “OK, I immediately burst into tears,” one woman wrote. “What a wonderful gift you and your boys gave him. What a wonderful gift he gave them.”Another added: “An autographed ball by Babe Ruth could not be worth half as much as this ball is.” In an interview with HuffPost, Marcy, who lives in Overland Park, Kansas with her family, said she was “humbled” by the response to the post. She also shared more about the significance of baseball to her boys and their great grandparents. Their great grandma Mary died from cancer in 2012. Before that, though, she and Jim could be found cheering on the boys at all their baseball games. “My oldest son was the first great grandchild and, much like myself, had an instant bond with both of my grandparents,” she said. “During his first year of baseball my grandparents won an award for the most dedicated fans. They never missed a game, even after my grandmother’s cancer diagnosis.” Chase and Travis' decision to sign the baseball and leave it with their great grandpa floored their mother. “After such a significant loss, it was a breath of fresh air to see them wanting to honor him in such a thoughtful way,” Marcy said. “I am overwhelmingly proud of the sweet gentlemen my sons are becoming.” "

Every year, reliably, something big happens on that day. This year is no different. The new Apple iPhone will launch on September 12th. Hillary Clinton’s book, What Happened, hits bookstores, NASA is launching its Expedition 53 Launch Mission on September 12th. And it’s even National Milk Shake Day.Why do marketers and brand managers embrace September 12th? It’s a day that marks the start of the fall season — full of hope and promise as the weather begins to change and kids return to school.But that’s not the real reason. September 12th means that we can put September 11th in the rear-view mirror for another year.Every year, I find I need to write about 9/11. September 11th is no longer a “current event”. But it’s not yet history, either; that will come with time.But each year, in the days leading up to 9/11, I find myself asking people, both friends and strangers “where were you on 9/11?” The question seems more relevant, more urgent, as we find ourselves asking some very painful questions about our American democracy. What are we fighting for and who is a “real” American?So here’s my story.On September 11th, I was on my company's roof deck, looking downtown at the smoke and flames. Firemen, police officers, and ambulance drivers, all acted with selfless bravery that defies explanation. I’m forever humbled by their unflinching efforts to save people in those terminally wounded towers.I’m a documentary filmmaker. And for me — almost without a moment’s hesitation — I knew what I had to do. I had to capture, to document what was happening in my city. Historians have the benefit of time to look at evidence, piece together facts, and find truth in the details. On 9/11 we had no such luxury — we had to record the images, stories, and details, or risk them being lost. The week after the attacks, people were numb. The images of the towers being hit, burning and falling were seared in our minds. And as the city mourned and began to think about recovery, I found myself trying to contribute with the tools and skills I had. I had a story to tell. So, I made a film.The film was titled “7 Days in September.” In the weeks after 9/11, New York proved itself to be a truly global community. Faces and voices came together. The site clean-up began. An open call for memorial concepts found a young Israeli architect named Michael Arad. His beautiful and meditative design, “Reflecting Absence,” was selected to memorialize the 2,983 individuals that died in the attacks. But of those almost 3,000 names, how many would today be considered Americans? How many would today have their name etched in bronze around the one-acre memorial pools, as we close our borders and consider replacing our golden door with an impenetrable wall? More than 100 undocumented immigrants — delivery men, waiters, cleaners, cooks — killed by terrorists at the World Trade Center 16 years ago could have been condemned to eternal anonymity if not for the efforts of an immigrant community group. Dozens of volunteers answered phones and accompanied the relatives on grim pilgrimages to city hospitals and morgues, according to Joel Magallán, a former Jesuit brother from Mexico who is Asociación Tepeyac executive director. “It was an intense job, there was no time even to cry” said Magallán.Another 372 foreign nationals — just over 12% of the total number of deaths — perished in the attacks.As we approach another September 11th, we’ll think about the towers, and those who perished, and the pride with which we focused on protecting our shared American values and the remarkable collection of immigrants from around the world that came here to build this country.On September 12th we’ll buy iPhones, and dive headfirst into the politics that has put the very nature of our democracy and our nation up for a daily referendum. No doubt you’ve got feelings about this. Even as 9/11 comes, and then recedes, it may be that this year 9/11 is a good day to think about the diversity of our collective cities and towns — and do our part to support the essence of what has made this nation great. America is a nation of immigrants, and 9/11 can serve to remind us of that, even as we remember and memorialize those that we have lost."

And historically, I like following my instincts,” Trump said. “But all my life I’ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office ― in other words, when you’re president of the United States.”He went on to say that he would be sending more troops ― estimates have suggested around 4,000 ― without committing to any deadlines for pulling out.Trump’s U-turn came as bad news to Erik Prince, founder of the private security company formerly called Blackwater, whose employees were accused of committing a number of crimes during the Iraq War, including the killing of 14 Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square, Baghdad, on Sept. 16, 2007. The incident sparked numerous federal investigations, and Prince sold the company in 2010.Now he’s the chairman of Frontier Services Group, a logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates, and he feels newly emboldened by Trump’s election. In May, the 48-year-old former Navy SEAL wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal advocating a completely different solution in Afghanistan. Prince’s five-point plan suggested that, instead of sending U.S. troops, private contracted soldiers ― including U.S. and NATO veterans, Prince has said elsewhere ― should be used alongside U.S. Special Forces troops. They would serve under the command of a “viceroy,” who would coordinate all military strategy and report to the president.“There are too many cooks,” Prince wrote, outlining the financial waste (approximately $1 trillion) and the massive damage to U.S. lives (around 2,000 deaths and 20,000 injuries) since the war began 16 years ago.Prince’s views are popular with some inside the White House and on Capitol Hill, where he is scheduled to meet with 50 members of Congress next week. I met with him on Monday in Washington, D.C., to discuss how close he came to convincing the administration to go his way and what he plans to do for the rest of Trump’s tenure. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Your Wall Street Journal piece got a lot of attention in Washington. Did you ever speak to the president about it?We didn’t meet about it, but he read it, and I’m told he circulated it around. I wrote it for an audience of one, and it worked.This was after [national security adviser] H.R. McMaster had asked for 70,000, 80,000 troops. McMaster basically wanted a redo of the Obama surge, where we have tens of thousands of Americans come back to Afghanistan and do the fighting there. I think that’s a bad idea. I think the president did, too.So Trump reads it. Then what happens?Well, I get calls from McMaster and from [then-White House chief strategist] Steve Bannon. They say, “Hey, the president saw your article. Please come in and tell us what you were thinking.” So I came in, and I gave a presentation [to Bannon, McMaster and then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus] that fleshed out more of the points made in the op-ed and hit the notion of vetting contractors and all the rest.Your use of the word “viceroy” in the op-ed stirred up a lot of controversy, raising questions of colonial power and accountability. Surely, the Afghans would not want to answer to a viceroy?To be very clear, when I say a viceroy, that is not to rule over Afghanistan, but rather to harmonize what has been a very chaotic U.S. policy. Between the Department of Defense, the Department of State and the CIA in Afghanistan and Pakistan, there has been no unity of commands. Seventeen commanders in 16 years. Come on. It’s a joke. It’s embarrassing.Talk me through the timeline. You write the piece. You get called in to talk with McMaster and Bannon and Priebus and …And H.R. automatically hates it.Does he say that to you?Pretty much.In other words, he’s called you in because the president is interested in your ideas, not because he wants to meet you.Correct. I went through the slides, and he completely discounted it. The nature of the questions he asked made it clear that it was going to be an all-Army solution, period.Give me an example.I pointed out the challenge of deploying U.S. troops the way they had been for 16 years, where they go for six or nine months and they leave and all that local knowledge leaves with them.Here’s the thing. Every U.S. trooper is statistically at the highest risk for the first 60 days they’re in country, because most of those guys, it’s their first deployment and they’re figuring it out. Meanwhile, the same Taliban that have been there for 16 years, the ones that have survived, are the smartest, most capable fighters.They see the Americans come and go every six to nine months. They know exactly how they patrol. They know exactly how they clear mines. They know exactly how they communicate. They know exactly the response times for aircraft. They know the deal, so doing the same thing for another 16 or 17 years means the outcome is going to be the same. It’s like the last two kids that were killed two weeks ago, blown up in a roadside bomb in their fully armored vehicle. Terrible. What a loss. What a waste.What was McMaster’s response to that argument?He largely just refused to answer, and I wasn’t there to debate him. I was there to pitch an idea.What happened after the meeting?Steve and Reince liked the concept. They saw it as something the president would or should consider. A couple weeks later, I got a call from Steve saying, “OK, lay it out. Figure out what that costs. And tell me exactly because the typical Beltway pundits will discount a low number.”So I did a very hard number: 91 aircraft, 84,000 flight hours, all the food, fuel, ordinance, man days, insurance, 3,200 ground mentors [Special Forces members or contractors who attach to Afghan army battalions], the whole thing. It comes out to about five and a half thousand personnel. It was 7 percent of what they’re spending now, way less than $4 billion.Still, if you got what you suggested, you’d get a big cut from that, no?What I’d say is that Elon Musk advocates for private space flight. Is he demonized for that? I would be very happy to compete for a solution that saves American lives and saves the taxpayers $40 billion a year. I will not apologize for that in any way. You wrote about the vulnerability of air power in Afghanistan. Presumably you also mentioned that in your meeting?Yes. The U.S. has completely failed to deliver on this. There is no adequate Afghan air force, ranging from maintenance deficiencies to pilot training shortages to operational support capability.My old company, we used to have 26 aircraft in Afghanistan doing that kind of support for the U.S. Army. So even as large as the U.S. military is ― and it’s the most expensive military in the world ― they still had a requirement for extra aviation capacity. So they rented it from the private sector. I thought, Why don’t they let the Afghans do the same thing?The premise of what I’m laying out with ground mentors and with the air package is that they serve as an adjunct in the Afghan forces, wearing an Afghan uniform, Afghan rules of engagement. The premise of this is a true Afghan-ization.One big question is what happens if something goes wrong, like it did in Iraq with Blackwater. Who is accountable?Sure, if the guys do an evil act, they can be held to account under the Uniform Code of Military Justice with a trial held in Kabul. I thought long and hard about that. A cell of JAG [Judge Advocate General] lawyers can be detailed to handle this for the contractors that are there, just like they’re there for any active duty forces.I assume your position on this is related to the yearslong case against a few Blackwater contractors for the killing of 14 people in Iraq.Well, a week and a half ago, the appeals court threw out the murder conviction [of Nicholas Slatten, who had been sentenced to life in prison], and they threw out the sentences of the other guys. It was a pretty stinging review of the federal government. They still have to be resentenced. I think they’ll get time served.The issue there was this: If the government had asked us, we would have preferred to be under the Uniform Code of Military Justice [which regularly tries military crimes where they occur], because all the guys that were doing that job were former military veterans. They know the deal. Having the trial close to battle makes way more sense than [having it] 7,000 miles away in a D.C. courtroom with people who have fortunately never seen the aftereffects of a car bomb. But the State Department prohibited that because they didn’t want their people [civilian government employees] held under that standard.Why?Don’t get me started on the State Department.Why?It was a turf issue between the agencies. Leave it at that.OK, back to your discussions with the administration. After Bannon and McMaster and Priebus, who did you talk to next?I saw [Defense Secretary Jim] Mattis three weeks after that first meeting at the White House, and he just fired away with questions ― practical questions ― for an hour. They were questions like: How could the men operate? Under what authority? How would they be accountable? Basically, how would this actually work? He is a historian. He gets it, He was not as quick to discard [my ideas] as many in the Pentagon bubble would be.But he also pushed back. He said, Why do you say we have to change the rules of engagement [so a viceroy could have greater autonomy]? I showed him pictures of open-air Taliban victory parades in Afghanistan, dozens of captured U.S. vehicles, hundreds of Taliban fighters with their Taliban flag beating their chests, hoorah. They’re winning.I later heard from multiple people at NSC [the National Security Council] that Secretary Mattis said at a national security Cabinet meeting that I gave the best analysis of the root problems that have to be fixed in Afghanistan of any he’s seen.Who were you picturing as a viceroy? A civilian? A military person?Absolutely not a general. We have enough generals. I was thinking about a guy who had a military and intelligence background in his early career, who spent a long time in business, was very successful at it, and who’s also done something very senior in the intelligence community.It’s not for everybody because that job will, of course, be vilified. You’re making difficult decisions. He’s going to leave a life of total luxury here and go live in a place where he’s worried about being blown up.Do you know many people like that?I know one.Who?I’ll just say that I floated a name to Steve [Bannon]. He liked it. I took him in and he met him.You took the viceroy candidate to the White House?Yeah, but again, it’s a moot point.Did he meet the president?No, but the president knows him and his wife pretty well. And we’ll have to leave it at that.The weekend before Trump made his Afghan announcement, he went to Camp David with many members of his Cabinet and national security teams. I heard you were supposed to be there, too.I was called by three or four reporters saying they wanted comment because they heard I was supposed to go. That was news to me. We were actually at that time hosting a bunch of wounded veterans at my family’s ranch out in Wyoming.But I think it was a sliding door moment because my concern is that the only people in that room who challenged the consensus were Attorney General [Jeff] Sessions, who I understand spoke passionately about the need to just leave because it’s a mess, and [Office of Management and Budget director] Mick Mulvaney, who as the budget guy said, “Don’t keep signing up for $50 billion forever.” If there’d been another voice there who could have spoken rationally on a cheaper way to accomplish the mission without having to have a whole bunch of uniform forces to do it, it might have carried the day. If Steve Bannon had not been fired, he would have been the voice.Why do you think the president made the decision he did on Afghanistan?I think it was partly because of the fiasco in Charlottesville and all the media heat from that. I don’t think the president wanted to take any more pounding doing anything different in Afghanistan, so he went with the most establishment-type position. [Republican Sens.] Lindsey Graham and John McCain are praising him for it. That’s pretty much the Beltway establishment.Do you have thoughts on Charlottesville?We’ll narrow the scope of the interview and leave that out of it. I’m not going to give you multiple avenues to attack me. I still remember that recorder’s running.Do you think that Trump will ever change course in Afghanistan?I think the Afghan war has largely been ignored for the last eight years, and now that it’s Mr. Trump’s war, every casualty, every loss of an Afghan base will be reported, and they will hang it around his neck.So the door isn’t closed for you and your ideas?I don’t know. I would say, politically and operationally, the president needs to figure out how to end this thing. It’s his supporters who are doing the fighting and dying. I just saw a study that said that casualties were one of the big issues that swung voters to Trump in districts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. They liked that he was outspoken. “Hey, let’s stop the same insanity we’ve been doing.”Did you and Steve Bannon ever talk about using private contractors in areas beyond Afghanistan?I’ve given other suggestions of places.Where did you suggest?That’s for next time. I’ll just say that there are a lot of places [where] the fires of insurgency have to be put out because these constant failed states export terrorism and refugees. That’s bad.Have you ever met the president?I’ve met him. I certainly met him during the transition. It was at an event; it was not preplanned. But I never met him on this.What are your feelings about his presidency so far?I still have high hopes that as a businessman who has restructured problematic or failing efforts, that he’s still going to come to the right conclusion on this.Let’s move to the report in The Washington Post that claimed that the UAE, where your firm is based, set up a meeting in the Seychelles in January between you and someone close to Putin, with the idea that you’d create a “back channel” between the incoming Trump administration and Russia.That was honestly a private business meeting that came about because [a Middle Eastern businessman I was talking to] said, “Hey, there’s this Russian guy you should meet.” I had a beer. I think he had a vodka. It was a quick meeting. I can drink a beer fast.So the allegations of you setting up secret back channels …Zero, totally baseless. The bizarre thing is, it’s connected to the left’s whole fantasy about this Trump-Russia election collusion, right? So I met with some Russian investment manager whose name I don’t remember in January, which is two months after the election. So if this grand conspiracy is true, why the hell would I need to meet with any Russians for any back channel stuff?And the thing that really bothers me about it is the only reason The Washington Post got the story ― and I have zero doubt about this ― is from signals intelligence that the Obama administration was leaking. [Editor’s note: No proof of this has been reported.]I don’t want to live in a bureaucratic super state with unlimited surveillance powers. There should be certain rights and privileges a citizen enjoys, and having your private business communications leaked by the security apparatus by a political party for political ends, that is full-stop wrong.Did you write anyone to complain?There are some electrons not worth wasting.You seem very aware of the fact that you became a villain during the Iraq War.Look, in Vietnam, the hard-core anti-war left went after the troops. In Iraq, they went after the contractors. It was politics. Blackwater represented everything they loved to hate and I was the sole owner. I didn’t have a board with a bunch of former generals. I didn’t pay all the Republican Party and the Democratic Party fundraising apparatuses, but it was a business group that executed exactly what the customer needed us to do. We grew and performed. It was actually built on merit, and politics always trumps merit.It seemed as if you disappeared after the war ― at least until the WSJ op-ed.Here’s the thing. In the Obama administration, I stopped trying. There was no point. Now, there’s a chance for a fair hearing.You must enjoy feeling like you’re back in the game.Well, I put everything else on hold to push a different approach in Afghanistan, and it’s been a big goose egg so far.Do you think you’d revive Blackwater domestically?Maybe. I still own the name. But I have no plans to start a U.S. defense contracting business.Still, I would encourage any objective observer of all the insurgencies going on around the world to ask which one of them has the U.S. actually, directly assisted in ending. Which one?Let the record show the witness said zero.Language has been adjusted due to a slip of the tongue: Prince meant to say that the hard-core left criticized the troops during the Vietnam War, not World War II.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) called single-payer health care the ""right thing to do"" on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a814d41700002000287a1c.jpeg?cache=VXWq29gIz8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Wednesday became the first senator to announce that she would co-sponsor legislation adopting a national, single-payer health insurance system that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) plans to introduce in the coming weeks. Speaking at a town hall in Oakland, California, Harris called single payer “the right thing to do,” drawing sustained applause from the crowd of hundreds that had gathered to hear her speak.The junior senator’s revelation is a win for left-leaning activists in two key ways. It adds high-profile support to the “Medicare for all” proposal that has become a top priority for restive progressives. And in allying with the activist base of the Democratic Party, Harris, often shortlisted for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination, is signaling her desire to assuage the concerns of her skeptics on the left.“This is about understanding, again, that health care should be a right, not a privilege. And it’s also about being smart,” Harris said, explaining her stance at the town hall after the applause died down. “It is so much better that people have meaningful access to affordable health care at every stage of life, from birth on. Because the alternative is that we as taxpayers otherwise are paying huge amounts of money for them to get their health care in an emergency room.”Harris had previously suggested she viewed single payer favorably, but did not commit to specific single payer legislation. At a July rally, Harris said she was supportive of single payer “as a concept,” but that “we’ve got to work out the details, and the details matter.” She made similar comments on the Pod Save America podcast in May.Single-payer health care, in which the federal government insures all Americans through one, Medicare-type program, garnered major national attention thanks to Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, where it was one of his chief policy promises.At the time, the proposal drew mockery from more mainstream figures in the Democratic Party.Hillary Clinton, who went on to defeat Sanders for the nomination, famously declared in January 2016 that single payer would “never, ever come to pass.”But with the election of President Donald Trump and the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which combines private and public health insurance, the push for single payer has gained steam. The framework has picked up the verbal support of Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.) (None of them has yet to officially co-sponsor Sanders’ bill). In the House, a bill introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) enjoys the backing of a majority of the Democratic caucus ― the most support it has ever received.Progressive advocates of single payer have long argued that a for-profit health insurance system is doomed to failure, because of how difficult it is to earn a profit without depriving the costliest patients essential care or providing it only at exorbitant prices. They have seized on the struggles of the Obamacare exchanges, which offer private options, and the relative success and political resilience of its more progressive Medicaid expansion as evidence backing their views.For Harris, the announcement shored up her progressive credentials weeks after coming under increasing scrutiny from activists.Some supporters of Sen. Sanders in particular expressed concern in July that party leaders and donors had begun grooming Harris for the national stage to circumvent more independent figures that the grassroots might be more inclined to rally behind. Critics pointed to Harris’ decision, during her tenure as California’s attorney general, not to prosecute Steve Mnuchin’s bank for illegal foreclosures against the advice of her department’s Consumer Law Section.And at the same July rally where Harris said she backed single payer as a “concept,” the senator declined to weigh in on a fight in the California legislature over a state-level single-payer bill. Single-payer legislation backed by the influential National Nurses United labor union passed the California state senate in June. But later that month, California state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D) refused to bring the bill to a vote in the lower house, sparking the ire of activists.Winnie Wong, a co-founder of the People for Bernie, who has cast aspersions on Harris in the past, applauded Harris’ support for Sanders’ legislation ― and expressed hope that it would advance the state-level bill in California as well.“Not all Democrats embrace it, but savvy democrats understand that single-payer agenda is THE topline issue leading into the midterms,” Wong wrote in an e-mail message. “So It’s great to see the JUNIOR Senator from California meeting her constituents where THEY are.”Virtually all other developed nations enjoy some form of universal coverage, and a single, government insurance program is among the most common ways they achieve it.Still, implementing such a system is likely to be politically difficult in the United States since it would, among other disruptions, eventually force the 49 percent of Americans who receive insurance through their job to abandon it and join an expanded government plan. It would also require major upfront tax increases to fund this expansion in exchange for the promise of a reduction in overall costs.In the near term, Sanders’ legislation could expand the bounds of the health care debate, making other progressive proposals seem less radical by comparison. Earlier this month, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who is up for re-election in 2018, introduced a bill that would enable people aged 55 or older to buy into Medicare. Last week, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) announced plans to introduce legislation allowing all Americans to buy into Medicaid.Republicans are already trying to use the single-payer push to brand Democrats as proponents of a government health care takeover paid for by a massive tax hike. The Republican National Committee plans to tie Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), and nine other vulnerable senators up for re-election in 2018, to single-payer legislation with digital ads that highlight the funding he has accepted from Sen. Warren.Polling suggests there is broad popular support for expanding Medicare, though it appears to depend on how the policy is framed. Sixty percent of American voters support “an expansion of Medicare that would make it available to any American who wants it,” according to a Quinnipiac University poll published on June 28.Sanders insists that he is not interested in making support for single payer a “litmus test” for Democrats.“Is this a litmus test? No, you have to look at where candidates are on many issues,” Sanders told the Washington Post. “But you’re seeing more and more movement toward ‘Medicare for All.’ When the people are saying we need health care for everyone, as more and more Americans come on board, it will become politically possible.” "

You could say this is down to,2017-08-31,"<p><em>Bunmi is a dedicated and passionate sober companion at The Sober Advantage. She helps career-minded individuals, most notably minorities, who struggle with alcohol and other addictions, to create a new sober lifestyle. </em> </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a84c1424000019004baae1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ethnic minorities in Britain have a very high rate of teetotalism compared to white people. You could say this is down to religion, as a proportionally higher percentage of people of colour follow a religion in some way, but the potential reasons to abstain from drink can be much deeper than that.The government published Adult Drinking Behaviour in Great Britain, based on the latest Census data. It showed that 56 percent of the ethnic minorities were teetotal, compared to 15.7 percent of those who classify themselves as white. Indeed, this could be down to religious beliefs and stricter family values.But what happens when you do have a drinking problem and you’re part of an ethnic minority? Interestingly, a paper published in the Psychological Bulletin found that although black African ethnic minorities typically “report later initiation of drinking, lower rates of use, and lower levels of use across almost all age groups” there is a much higher rate of social disapproval when someone does have an alcohol problem. The study revealed that African-Americans are more likely to get in trouble with the law, even if they’ve been drinking the same amount as white ethnicities. African-American men are at much higher risk for alcoholism and substance abuse issues due to racism, financial instability and difficulty with finding the right help.There seems to be a bigger element of shame in ethnic minority communities when it comes to alcohol addiction ― which can discourage sufferers from seeking help or even admitting they have a problem in the first place. So why is this? Alcoholism, although low in ethnic minorities, is seen as a significant stigma ― which was certainly my experience as a former alcoholic from a Nigerian background.One intriguing theory to explain African descendants’ attitude to alcohol could involve the view of drinking adopted by tribes in pre-colonial Africa. In general, alcohol abuse and addiction was very rare in these communities because it was only consumed as part of certain ceremonies. To be intoxicated, even in religious and secular ceremonies, was deemed extremely unacceptable and a sign of great weakness.That brings me to the word “weakness.” The black community has, and still does, struggle for equality. One theory that springs to mind is when black slaves abstained from drinking in the U.S. This is so they could keep a clear head and fight for their right to freedom. In fact, black leaders were known to say, “To keep sober is to strike a blow to slavery.” It seems that if a black individual did not follow this mantra, they were viewed as a traitor to the anti-slavery slavery movement, because it seems remaining abstinent was, indeed, for the greater good. This may have been carried forward by black generations both in the U.K. and the U.S. Although slavery has long been abolished, we still continue to push forward and fight for our rights to equality.Perhaps the ethnic minorities generally still frown on alcohol for fear of being intoxicated and misrepresenting the entire race ― a bold statement to make, but I think it’s a fair theory. African-British parents, as well as Asian-British and Middle Eastern parents, are very likely to educate their children on negative stereotypes and discrimination, as well as ethnic pride. The children are more likely to avoid alcohol altogether so they can keep in check with their actions and emotions in order to avoid these negative stereotypes. If the child grows up and develops an alcohol problem then there is a big chance they’ll be shamed or outright estranged from their own family. The shame from the family, although understandable from a historic perspective, only adds pressure to the mix. What these individuals need is the right care and support where they can craft their own healthy attitude towards teetotalism.Dr Bunmi Aboababunmi@thesoberadvantage.comNeed help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

When Mr. Trump said, “We are not nation-building again... we are killing terrorists,” he was catering to an American citizenry grown weary of this never-ending war. But help with nation-building is precisely what Afghanistan needs most.First, here are the good aspects of the new strategy: a U.S. president finally is warning Pakistan that it won’t be able to support radical elements with its own security establishment and still get billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to “fight” terrorists. Also, Mr. Trump has sent a strong message to the Afghan government that the era of the blank check is over. Too much cash meant to help the people of Afghanistan has ended up in foreign bank accounts of corrupt Afghan officials or unscrupulous foreign contractors.But here is where Mr. Trump misses the point: like presidents before him, he has opted for a military solution to a socioeconomic problem. As long as Afghanistan teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state, the men of its disenfranchised younger generation will be easy bait for the Taliban and other insurgencies.The Trump plan is based on a sound military assessment that any rapid withdrawal would lead to a total collapse of Afghanistan’s relatively democratic system. The country would become a breeding ground for international terrorism.But no amount of artillery and death can miraculously turn Afghanistan into a prosperous nation, free of socioeconomic ills and political sclerosis. More guns and killing will only prolong this nightmare.Mr. Trump eschews “nation building,” but imagine if $5 billion a year were spent on building roads, clinics and major infrastructure instead of weapons and soldiers. We know that the U.S. isn’t responsible for fixing Afghanistan’s socioeconomic problems, but if the collapse of Afghanistan into terroristic chaos presents a clear and present danger to the U.S., why not pull out the root of the problem, instead of just trimming the leaves?We need to use our soft power to build Afghanistan from within. The military option not only doesn’t work, but exacerbates the problem. Guns and soldiers merely give the insurgency a cause for jihad against the “invaders” and solidifies their base. Increased American military operations also inevitably lead to more civilian casualties, which harms the American image.U.S. troop escalation raises tensions in neighboring countries and prompts U.S. adversaries to further help the insurgency. It could heighten the rivalry between Pakistan and India, tempting Pakistan into further use of the Taliban as their proxy to counter the Indian influence in Afghanistan.The soft power of nation-building would work because, despite 16 years of violence and setbacks, many Afghans still view the U.S. as an ally and friend, not as the invader they once viewed the Soviet Union during its occupation in 1980s.The generation of Afghans who were in their teens when the U.S. liberated Afghanistan from the yoke of Taliban are now in their 20s and 30s. They have tasted freedom of expression and the right to peaceably assemble. Women are now members of cabinets and Afghan parliament. None of that would have happened under the Taliban. U.S. values have taken root and grown in Afghanistan, and that’s why we don’t see mass demonstrations on the streets against the U.S. or Afghan government. The new generation appreciates the fact that there is no going back, and they want to preserve what has been accomplished. These successes are a result of American soft power.There is no correlation between the number of NATO troops and the level of peace in rural areas. In places like Helmand, where the bulk of NATO forces is concentrated, violence levels are much higher than in areas where there are no foreign troops. Why? Because in places without troops, the villagers take matters into their own hands and defend themselves against Taliban.Afghan media reports that in the Mirzaka district of the Paktia province, village elders and tribal leaders impose hefty monetary fines on any who support or give sanctuary to insurgents. Some who violate this decree have been punished by the burning of their homes.So, Mr. Trump, the facts strongly show that it’s time for a shift from military options to some nation-building. Yes, politically, it will be a hard sell in the U.S. Why would taxpayers support job creation in Afghanistan when their government is struggling to do the same at home?But if they think of this as simply a shift in the allocation of funds that are already being spent, it makes sense. Americans did the same thing after World War II, nation-building in Japan and Germany, and it led to generations of peace that remains to this day.Afghans must accept that this would not be a free lunch. If they fail to fulfill their responsibility to fight corruption and restore accountability, all the good will and money the U.S. can offer would fail. Afghans should prepare for more sacrifices and tighten their financial belts to help the U.S. help them.Dropping the Mother of All Bombs may kill more insurgents, but it will do nothing to address the cause of the problem."

The focus right now must be on helping the victims of Hurricane Harvey survive and recover. But this latest in the growing list of weather disasters should be sending a strong message to those who could do something about global climate change but deny that it is real. We should not be surprised if on his next trip to Houston, the Denier-in-Chief tells flooded families that they are the victims of a Chinese hoax rather than a storm made catastrophic by global warming. Hurricane Harvey has put some of our elected skeptics on defense as climate experts repeat that global warming is making the weather more violent and its impacts more severe. Several factors consistent with climate change contributed to this storm, including the unusually warm water in the Gulf of Mexico that gave Harvey more energy. It is another example of how weather disasters that statistics say should occur once every 1,000 or 500 years are becoming the new norm. After visiting Texas this week, Donald Trump said he was “heartbroken” at what was happening there. But his brand of heartbreak is like feeling sorry for a cancer victim while opposing research to cure the disease. Trump’s emasculation of federal climate science, his plug-pulling on websites offering information about global warming and its impacts, and his vendetta against all of the climate-action policies and programs initiated by Barack Obama are not only negligent. They are cruel.In the first six months of this year, there were 49 weather, climate and flood disasters that caused at least one death and at least $3 million in damages in the United States. Data from the reinsurance company Munich Re show that the number of disasters here was second only to the 59 weather disasters that took place in the U.S. during the first six months of 2012. Munich Re’s experts attribute the high number of severe thunder storms to “abnormally warm water” in the Pacific Ocean, not unlike the unusually warm water in the Gulf.It is not enough for the President of the United States and Members of Congress to fly over one devastated region after another to show their sympathy and to praise the efforts to save people on the ground. Sympathy is not a solution. This disaster, like most others, teaches lessons about where and how we build our cities. But it should also send a message to elected officials: Their days in public office are numbered if they don’t finally do something about climate change.For Donald Trump and his crew, that means restoring all of the federal policies, programs and science they are destroying, and putting the United States back in the Paris climate accord. If they don’t, we and generations to come can thank Trump and the denial camp for their contributions to the many record-setting disasters that lie ahead. "

The UAE defends its approach as a pillar of the fight against terrorism and extremism.Yet, several interviews in which senior UAE diplomats make no bones about their defense of autocracy and the fact that their country’s alignment with the United States is based on interests rather than shared values is just as applicable to Qatar, which advocates greater political freedoms for others rather than itself.At the core of the dispute in the Gulf are different strategies for regime survival as Gulf autocracies are forced to diversify and rationalize their economies and rewrite social contracts that no longer offer citizens cradle-to-grave welfare in exchange of surrender of political rights. The different strategies are rooted in perceptions of how to come to grips with a post-9/11 world and a region whose fundaments were rocked by the 2011 popular revolts.Qatar’s embrace of the rise of political Islam and the quest for change that exploded onto the political scene with the uprisings that toppled four Arab leaders, constitutes, despite naively assuming that the Gulf state itself can remain immune to transition, a direct challenge to survival strategies adopted by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt.Among the four, the UAE has been the most radical and consequential in its effort to ensure the survival of its rulers. More than any other Gulf state, the UAE opted to discard past sensitivity to public empathy with Islamic causes in favour of wholly aligning its counter-terrorism policies with those of the United States, positioning itself as an indispensable military ally, and brutally suppressing dissent.The policy overhaul aimed to ensure US military support for a country whose sense of security has in part been shaped by Iran’s continued occupation of three Gulf islands, Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. Iran seized the islands in 1971, two days before the UAE achieved independence. The policy change also constituted a response to the rejection on national security grounds by the US Coast Guard and Congress of a 2006 bid by Dubai Ports World to take over the management of several major American ports. “Having a company right out of the heartland of Al Qaeda manage those ports…is madness,” US Representative Peter King thundered at the time.The rise of US President Donald J. Trump with his apparent empathy for Arab autocracy and lack of interest in the traditional US promotion of democratic values, has emboldened UAE officials to be more forthright about the political philosophy that informs their system of government.”We have our own style of democracy. We have something called the majlis system, which is open forums where people address their leaders, where they voice their grievances and they come and they say, ‘I need this’ or ‘This is a problem’ or ‘My son’s school isn’t working,’ and this is the Bedouin style of democracy. Is this the Jeffersonian style of democracy? No. But it works for us, it works for our culture, it works for our identity,” Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE’s influential ambassador to the United States, recently told The Atlantic magazine.“If you asked the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and Bahrain what kind of Middle East they want to see in 10 years, they would have opposed that of Qatar,” Mr Al Otaiba said in a separate television interview. Instead, he said, Qatar’s detractors were pushing for “strong, stable and prosperous secular governments.”Mr. Al Otaiba’s promotion of Western style-secularism appeared in contrast to the lyrics of the UAE’s national anthem that embodies Islam as part of the country’s identity. “You have lived for a nation whose religion is Islam and guide is the Qur’an,” the anthem says.The arrest in Abu Dhabi only days after Mr. Al Otaiba’s remarks and sentencing to a year in prison of two Singaporeans, a man and a pre-operative transgender woman, on charges of cross-dressing suggested that the ambassador’s notion of secularism was more akin to public norms extolled in the anthem than any notion of secularism. The sentences were subsequently reduced and the two Singaporeans allowed to return home.In yet another interview, Omar Ghobash, the UAE ambassador to Russia, was equally blunt in his defense of autocracy. “We do not claim to have press freedom. We do not promote the idea of press freedom. What we talk about is responsibility in speech.” Ghobash appeared to justify the UAE’s position on the same argument implicit in Mr. Al-Otaiba’s statements: the country’s rulers rather than its citizens know what is best for them. “Speech in our part of the world has a particular context, and that context can go from peaceful to violent in no time simply because of words that are spoken,” Mr. Ghobash said.Messrs. Al Otaiba and Ghobash’s portrayal of the UAE’s political philosophy seemed more in line with a decades-old news clip in a music video entitled ‘$heikh it’ by Kuwaiti-American hip-hop group Shafiq Husayn & the Sons of Yusuf than with a cutting-edge, 21st century state. “A man torn between two worlds. He’s an Arab sheikh who was born in an old Arabia and will die in a new one. He worships Allah, loves the desert, and is one of the richest men in the world. His forefathers ruled the world from the back of a camel, he rides it in a limousine. But he remains, as they were, the centre of tribal life. He’s the man you serve, the man you hunt with, and the many you fight for. Above all, he’s the man who leads,” the news reader intoned.To be fair, the news reader’s portrayal of change in the Gulf is equally true for Qatar, where the Gulf crisis has sparked a new wave of nationalism that centres on support for the country’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Like his counterparts in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Tamim is “the man who leads” and brooks no dissent. Time will tell whether that is a political model that can withstand far-reaching economic reforms, the radical rewriting of social contracts, and unstoppable technological advances. So far, however, it has allowed Qatar to stand its ground in a dispute in which the protagonists have beyond their differences much in common.Dr. James M. Dorsey is a senior fellow at the S.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a6e4751700001f0028772d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Donald Trump moved into the White House in January, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka hoped that labor leaders like himself would find common ground with the new president. Several union officials from the building trades even met with Trump for a photo-op during his first week in the Oval Office.But seven months later, Trumka says there is little hope left that unions will have a fruitful relationship with Trump.“I think a significant amount of the optimism has faded away, because we haven’t seen an infrastructure bill, we haven’t seen the renewal of manufacturing, we haven’t seen the things that we were hopeful about that we could work with him on,” Trumka said Wednesday at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. “There’s no question that the optimism of a lot of people ― our members, of all the sectors, not just the building trades ― a lot of the optimism is fading,” he added.For all Trump’s talk about the working class on the campaign trail, his domestic policy agenda so far has looked a lot like a wish list for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. His agencies have been busy stalling or repealing regulations at the behest of the industries they are supposed to police, including many worker protections important to the AFL-CIO. Trumka said the White House has done little that his union federation would approve of so far.He pointed to a few of the regulatory rollbacks that have bothered him most, like the silica standard protecting construction workers, or the stalled overtime reforms that would affect millions of salaried employees. Trumka said he has had several meetings with administration officials in which he tried to lobby in favor of these regulations, to no avail.He offered his own theory on why the prospect of favorable policy for organized labor has soured.“You had two factions in the White House. You had one that actually had some of the policies that we would have supported on trade, on infrastructure, but [they] turned out to be racist,” Trumka said. That was likely a reference to members of the Steve Bannon-nationalist wing of the administration, many of whom agreed with the AFL-CIO that trade deals like NAFTA have been a raw deal for U.S. workers. “On the other hand, you had people who weren’t racist, but they were Wall Streeters,” Trumka went on. “And the Wall Streeters have come to dominate the administration, and moved his agenda back to everything that I think they fought against in the election.”When Trump was inaugurated, Trumka said he would give the president a fair shake and call “balls and strikes” on his policy initiatives. (In Trumka’s analogy, Trump is the pitcher.) So far, he said, “the bases are loaded with walks.”Trumka added that his union federation is already taking that message to its members, including the union workers who cast ballots for Trump last year.“What we have done since day one is tell the truth: Here’s what he promised, here’s what he did,” he said. “You’re beginning to see a lot of people come back across the bridge.”"

83,POLITICS,FEMA Chief Hailed As The Man For The Job In Texas. Trump Just Needs To Let Him Do It.,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brock-long-fema-hurricane-harvey_us_59a5593be4b0446b3b865a39,"Brock Long is probably one of the ""best prepared"" people in the country for this task, a former FEMA official says.",2017-08-30,"FEMA Administrator Brock Long speaks Tuesday at a firehouse briefing on Hurricane Harvey in Corpus Christi, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a5be6924000036004ba506.jpeg?cache=fGR7z05Cge&ops=crop_21_700_4507_2535%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — In an administration where inexperience runs rampant and it’s acceptable to vehemently oppose the very agency you’ve been tasked with running, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator William “Brock” Long stands out as exceptionally competent. In an event like Hurricane Harvey, Long is “probably one of the best prepared (people) that the country could ask for,” Mark Merritt, a co-founder of a disaster cleanup consulting firm and a former FEMA official under President Bill Clinton, told The Associated Press.The man who oversees the federal government’s response to natural disasters has received accolades from environmentalists, who see him as someone who will work toward better preparing the country for climate change-driven extreme weather, as Bloomberg reported in June. During a Senate confirmation hearing, Long said, “If we ultimately want to reduce costs in the future for disasters, we have to do more mitigation.”Long has nearly two decades of experience working in emergency management and planning, including numerous natural disasters and Alabama’s response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. Before serving as director of Alabama’s Emergency Management Agency from 2008 to 2011, he worked at FEMA as both a regional hurricane program leader and an evacuation liaison team leader. Long was nominated by President Donald Trump in April to lead FEMA, and he was confirmed in June on a 95-4 Senate vote. For the first time in Trump’s tenure, Long and the Trump administration are being tested with a major natural disaster. Since slamming into the Texas Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane late last week, Harvey has continued to pummel Texas and Louisiana with record-breaking rain and catastrophic flooding. If his first several days in the spotlight are any indication, Long appears up for the monumental task.On Friday, as the storm barreled toward Corpus Christi, FEMA activated a response coordination center in Denton, in North Texas, and several support bases in Texas and Louisiana. Long didn’t mince works about the threat, saying in a statement that “this storm poses a very real danger to those in its path.” Later that day, at the request of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Trump signed a disaster proclamation, a move the president said “unleashes the full force of government help!” As the disaster has unfolded, displacing tens of thousands of people, Long has spoken plainly about the persistent threat — “We have not seen an event like this,” he said Sunday. “You could not draw this forecast up.” — and the long-term recovery that will follow for places like Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city.“FEMA is going to be [in Texas] for years,” Long told CNN during an interview Sunday. “This disaster is going to be a landmark event. ... While we’re focused on response right now and helping Texas respond, we’re already pushing forward recovery housing teams. We’re already pushing forward forces to be on the ground to implement the National Flood Insurance Program policies and doing the inspections that we need. We’re setting up and gearing up for the next couple years.”Trump praised Long on Monday for his “outstanding” work. And on Tuesday, during a visit to Texas to meet with officials and assess the damage, Trump noted that Long “has really become very famous on television over the last couple of days.”Aside from showing face and signing a disaster declaration, as is common practice, Trump is doing little to make things easier on the residents of Texas, his FEMA chief or the communities that will be hurt by future natural disasters. Under the president’s 2018 budget request, FEMA’s grant funding for state and local programs would be slashed by $667 million. Among the programs targeted is the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program, which assists states and local communities in preparing for natural disasters, including hurricanes and floods. Trump has also proposed a $62 million cut in National Weather Service funding and $190 million from the National Flood Insurance Program to update U.S. flood maps. And earlier this month he scrapped an Obama-era rule requiring federal, state and local agencies to account for rising sea levels caused by climate change — Trump has called climate change a “hoax” — and to construct buildings, highways and other infrastructure to withstand flooding.Along with the threat of budget cuts, numerous key leadership posts at FEMA, including deputy administrator, have yet to be filled. Asked by CNN about those vacancies, Long said, “I don’t even have time to worry about it right now.”“But what I have seen inside my agency is, I have got some of the most dedicated people in the entire federal government, great lines of communications with the president,” he added. “He’s extremely concerned, incredibly engaged.”Trump, on the other hand, claimed Tuesday that unfilled positions are part of a larger, conscious effort to downsize government.During a Tuesday segment of “Fox & Friends” on Fox News, conservative commentator Laura Ingraham questioned the lack of manpower at FEMA and other agencies, saying, “We can all look at these horrific pictures, and we can conclude that a federal government does need staff. We see it acutely in need of staff in a crisis like this.” In a response post on Twitter, Trump said he is not looking to fill many of those jobs: “Don’t need many of them — reduce size of government.” FEMA estimates that more than 30,000 people will be displaced due to the storm and will need temporary shelter. Trump has faced backlash in recent days for his seemingly insensitive response to the Texas disaster. On Friday, as the hurricane was making landfall near Corpus Christi, the White House announced that Trump had signed a memo banning transgender individuals from enlisting in the military and had pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona. And over the weekend, as deadly flooding forced Texans from their homes, Trump posted a slew of unrelated and self-congratulatory tweets. Responding via Twitter to a Trump post Sunday about the continued need for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Daniel Watson, a former FEMA spokesman under President Barack Obama, noted the danger in distracting the media, which plays an essential role in disseminating safety information. “During a disaster, #1 rule for @POTUS is do no harm,” Watson wrote. In the end, Trump is confident Texas will come out on top.“Nothing can defeat the unbreakable spirit of the people of Texas and Louisiana. Right now, every American heart sends its love and support to those whose lives have been upended ― totally upended ― totally ― by this very horrible storm,” he said during a joint press conference Monday with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö. “We will get through this,” Trump added. “We will come out stronger. And, believe me, we will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before. The rebuilding will begin, and in the end it will be something very special.”In an editorial Tuesday, The Houston Chronicle urged Trump to stay focused on the task at hand — rather that spend his time promoting books — and ensure Texas gets the federal funding it will need to rebuild. “Mr. President, our worry is that this attention from the White House will recede along with the floodwaters,” the editorial said. “If we truly want to come back stronger than ever, then the federal government has to step up with funding and leadership, and the buck stops with one man: President Donald J. Trump.”"
