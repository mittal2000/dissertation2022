4,POLITICS,Domestic Violence Victims In NYC Could Get Paid Time Off To Recover From Abuse,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paid-safety-leave-new-york_us_5813617de4b0390e69cf89d3,Proposed legislation would let victims take care of their health and safety needs -- without worrying about losing their job.,2016-10-28,New legislation announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio would allow domestic violence survivors paid time off from work.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58137ad1170000aa025ba60a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Victims of domestic violence in New York City may soon benefit from paid “safe leave” if they need time off from work to seek services related to the abuse.The proposed legislation, introduced on Wednesday by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYC Council Member Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, would allow domestic violence survivors to take paid leave to attend to their safety needs ― without the scary prospect of losing their job. “No woman should have to decide between her safety and her paycheck,” de Blasio said at a press conference announcing the measure. “We need to make sure that work will be protected, not interrupted; that pay will be protected, not interrupted while a woman pursues justice ― while she takes care of things she needs to ensure her safety.”He added that on average, the New York Police Department receives one domestic violence report every 2 minutes. “That is an unacceptable state of affairs in the greatest city in the world, and we aim to change it,” he said. The Paid Safe Leave legislation would amend the current paid sick leave law, which requires that some businesses provide up to five paid days off each year for workers to use if they or their family members fall ill.Under the new legislation, victims could use those five days as paid safe leave to seek medical help, file an order of protection, meet with law enforcement or an attorney, relocate, enroll a child in a new school, or access other related services. While it’s well understood how domestic violence negatively affects a victim’s physical and mental health, abuse can also take a significant toll on a person’s financial security. A 2005 study found that female domestic violence victims reported an average of 7.2 days of work-related lost productivity per year due to the abuse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, domestic violence costs the U.S. at least $8 billion a year in lost productivity and health care costs.Marium Durrani, public policy attorney at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, noted that personal safety and economic security are tightly linked.“For many victims, inability to provide financially for themselves or their families is a reason for staying or returning to an abusive relationship,” she said. Currently, five states ― California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Vermont ― and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring employers to provide paid safe leave to employees if they are victims of domestic violence. A growing number of municipalities and counties also offer paid time off for victims. Other states have laws that protect victims of domestic violence from losing their job or being penalized if they need to take time off from work to deal with matters related to domestic violence, such as appearing in court.“Unfortunately, the majority of states do not offer paid leave for victims of domestic violence,” Durrani said. “Victims of domestic violence face a difficult choice every day ― take time off to stay safe or lose a paycheck or their job.”Linda A. Seabrook, general counsel at Futures Without Violence, a nonprofit that has helped organizations across the country address how domestic violence affects their workforces, called the legislation a crucial step in the right direction. But she said there’s lots more that employers can do.“Work is a huge part of our lives — we spend more time working than any other waking activity — and at the same time, millions of women are victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking each year,” she said. “If we don’t deal with these issues in workplaces, we’re missing a major opportunity to help women move from victims to survivors.”She said all employers should take proactive steps, such as offering prevention and awareness education, referrals for services and flexible leave policies.“For victims of domestic violence, the workplace can represent a place of safety ― away from the violence experienced at home,” Seabrook said. “An employer having policies in place, resources, and other support for a worker experiencing violence can literally save her life.”______Need help?

He has campaigned vigorously for Clinton in her race against Trump, a New York real estate tycoon and former reality television personality who has never run for office.The vice president said at a campaign event for Clinton in Pennsylvania this week that he is frequently asked whether he wished he had been debating Trump, who has insulted women, Muslims and immigrants and thumbed his nose at political norms.“No, I wish we were in high school. I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish,” Biden said, prompting a similarly pugilistic retort from Trump a couple of days later.In excepts from an interview released from CBS’ Sunday program “Face the Nation,” Biden made it clear he wanted to continue his public service.“I’m not going away. I’m, you know, everything from this issue of violence against women, to income inequality, to the cancer moonshot, I’m gonna devote the rest of my life to this.”(Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Paul Simao)"

His hotel in New York City received $18,014. And his hotel in Las Vegas was paid $79,044.The FEC filings cover the first 19 days of October and do not specify precisely what services were provided. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post’s queries.The payments for the New York hotel were over a number of days and were described as “lodging.” The Las Vegas total was a single payment made on Oct. 17, and may have been for the campaign’s visit to the city for the third presidential debate on Oct. 19. It also was described as lodging.The payment to the new Washington hotel at the Old Post Office site, a few blocks from the White House, also was made on Oct. 17 and was for “rental/catering services.” The hotel hosted a Sept. 16 Trump press briefing that turned into a tour of his property.Trump held a “grand opening” ribbon-cutting ceremony there on Wednesday that was far more elaborate. Its costs, though, do not have to be disclosed until the FEC filing that’s due a full month after the Nov. 8 election.Trump’s campaign further paid $8,544 to his golf resort in Potomac Falls, Virginia, and $6,040 to his son Eric Trump’s winery in Charlottesville, Virginia.These payments were on top of his monthly rental payments of $9,000 to the Trump Plaza and $169,758 to Trump Tower. The Trump Tower rent jumped fivefold in July over what it had been for most of the campaign, even though the number of employees working there has no more than doubled.That rent increase coincided with the signing of a joint fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee that started sending Trump tens of millions of dollars in donors’ money for the first time.Trump’s staff has justified his insistence on using his personal Boeing 757 jet and renting campaign office space at Trump Tower despite the attendant high costs because of his $2 million per month contribution to his own campaign. (The Clinton campaign rents two floors in a Brooklyn Heights office building at a per-square-foot rate that’s a fraction of what Trump pays.)But Trump so far in October has contributed zero cash to his effort ― only $31,000 of “in-kind” contributions in rent and payroll, meaning office space and staff he was already paying for, but which now is being used for campaign purposes.Trump has claimed he’ll wind up spending $100 million of his own money on his race. But so far, the actual total is only $56 million, according to the FEC filings. To hit $100 million, Trump would have to spend $44 million in the remaining days before the election.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Sandusky, now 72, was not arrested for 10 more years.He was tried and convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.Paterno was fired for his role in the Sandusky scandal and died months later. McQueary never worked anywhere of note after his dismissal, he said, because other schools viewed him as damaged goods. He had ostensibly lost his job because the new head coach, Bill O’Brien, did not want him.McQueary also claimed in his lawsuit that former Penn State president Graham Spanier defamed him in a public statement in 2011 that publicly defended Curley and Schultz.Elliot Strokoff, a lawyer for McQueary, told Reuters earlier Thursday that he would not be able to comment on the verdict because Judge Thomas Gavin has a gag order in place. Penn State attorney Nancy Conrad told media much the same. A university spokesman also declined to comment.In an unusual arrangement, the jury ruled on defamation and misrepresentation claims made by McQueary against Penn State, but Gavin himself will rule within 30 days on the whistleblower part of the lawsuit.McQueary “should not have been a scapegoat,” Strokoff said during closing arguments Thursday morning. “They said that he is the villain and that he is only in court because of his own failures.”Conrad told jurors in closing that McQueary was not defamed by Spanier in 2011 and argued that his failure to find a job since 2012 was his own fault, not Penn State’s.“He was not damaged by any actions of the university,” Conrad said. “If he was harmed, it was by national media and public opinion. He failed to find a position because of his own shortcomings.”McQueary’s lawsuit took four years to come to trial."
8,POLITICS,Tim Kaine Thinks Donald Trump Will Help End Our Nation's Partisan Gridlock. Here's How.,Sam Stein and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-kaine-interview-huffpost_us_5813cbd0e4b0390e69d06363,It sounds naive -- and a bit like Obama -- but the VP candidate really believes the fever will finally break.,2016-10-28,"Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) sat down with The Huffington Post for an interview in Columbus, Ohio. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5813d27b17000006035ba79b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"COLUMBUS, Ohio ― When he first ran for the White House in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) promised to usher in a post-partisan era, in which competence took precedent over ideology, and the bickering that defined the Clinton and Bush years gradually faded away. It never happened. But that didn’t stop Obama from saying it would. In subsequent elections, both he and his aides predicted that Republicans would eventually soften their instinctive opposition to his agenda. The “fever,” he predicted, would break.As the Obama presidency comes to a close and a Hillary Clinton presidency looks to succeed it, few politicians still believe it. But Tim Kaine, Clinton’s vice presidential nominee, is one. And he credits Donald Trump for his optimistic disposition. “I think there’s going to be an obligation to show that Trumpism is not a complete equivalent for GOP,” he said in an interview with The Huffington Post Thursday. “And I think, in that moment, when they’re trying to demonstrate that, there’s going to be some opportunities to get some wins right out of the gate.”“They’re going to need to show GOP does not equal Trump,” he said. And does he think the fever will break?“I believe it will,” he said.Kaine is a self-proclaimed optimist. So his confidence in the ability to govern constructively in the near future was not out of the ordinary, though perhaps aided by the IPA he sipped while sitting in the warehouse of the Land-Grant Brewing Company in Columbus, Ohio.  Watch the full interview above.Kaine prefaced his confidence with caution, noting that neither he nor Clinton was taking their election for granted (he spoke a day before the FBI announced that it was investigating several emails that could be pertinent to its initial investigation into Clinton’s private account). But he allowed himself to imagine areas where he thought progress could be made. That included reforming the Affordable Care Act, agreements he envisioned could be made on enhancing small business tax credits, pursuing Medicaid expansion in states that hadn’t previously done so, and encouraging more market reforms to reward outcomes instead of procedures. To get to a place where lawmakers forge compromise on items as contentious as Obamacare, however, will likely take more than just the electoral humiliation of one Donald Trump. Modern governance rewards politicians who play to their base. And often, it is the influence of money rather than the recognition of sound policy that plays a motivating factor in the legislative process.Kaine noted that Clinton has called for a series of reforms to get money both out of politics and, when impossible, shed light on where those contributions are going. But he pushed back forcefully on one proposal aggressively championed by Trump. Term limits for members of Congress, he said, were a “bad idea,” based in part on his experience as a term-limited governor of Virginia.“It sounds good, but I think if you do term limits, you would really increase the power of lobbying,” he said. “I’ve been in 40 states as a candidate, and I interact with a lot of state legislators who are in states where there’s term limits. And here’s what they say to me: ‘OK, it sounds good, but boy, I tell ya, you do term limits, then the only people who don’t have the terms are the lobbyists.’ And so the permanent institutional expertise class is now no longer the legislators, it’s the lobbyists who don’t have term limits and are there forever.” If nothing else, Kaine understands how lawmakers think, work and operate. He’s held office on the local, state and federal level ― occupying perches in the legislative and executive branches. It’s a bio that comes with complications in an election where the other side is running against “career politicians.” But it’s one he seems comfortable touting.Because of this background, he has perhaps a more informed perspective than most on where the line should be drawn between executive and legislative powers. One of his big causes in the Senate was to bring the powers to declare war back under Congress’ purview. And he repeated that should Clinton win, her administration will push for an authorization for use of military force in the campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “The big-picture issue constitutionally for me is, get Congress on board to initiate war as a way of sending a message to troops that are overseas,” Kaine said. “We’ve already lost 20 people in the war against ISIL, and Congress hasn’t had the guts to even cast a vote.”But Kaine also made the explicit case for executive branch authorities. Though Obama has confronted legal challenges and setbacks for some of the actions he’s taken on immigration and pollutant controls, Kaine spoke approvingly of both those objectives and the steps used to achieve them. “It’s important to use executive orders,” he said. “Every president since Washington has. And the thing about an executive order — there has never been an executive order that a Congress couldn’t say, ‘You know, we don’t like that so we’re going to do something else,’ if there is a majority in Congress to do something else. So sometimes, you know, you have a court ruling that this or that executive order went beyond authority. But almost always, executive orders are within an authority and always within the purview of Congress to change if they want to legislatively change it.” Should he be elected, Kaine would have a unique purview over the ground where Congress and the executive meet. The vice president’s role is twofold: both the second in command and the president of the Senate. The current occupant of that position, Joe Biden, has been one of Obama’s best dealmakers on the Hill, occasionally to the chagrin of liberals. Kaine said he would seek to model his tenure off of Biden. He wants, he explained, be Clinton’s “chief adviser” and “the last person in the room”; someone who gives advice, learns and takes on “a few projects.” For him, those projects would dovetail with his past work: economic revitalization of cities and states, and enhancing relations with Latin America (Kaine volunteered with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras before entering politics). “I’ll say about Joe, I have really learned a lot from him,” Kaine said. “Some, because of things he’s told me, but some just watching the way he’s done his job. This is a supporting job that gives you an enormous ability, but you also have to be really loyal.”Video produced by: Senior producer: Sharaf Mowjood; Producer: Omar Kasrawi; Editor: Adriane Giebel; Director of photography: Chelsea Moynehan; Cameras: Dan Fox, Shane Handler; Audio: Mike Caravella.Full transcript of The Huffington Post’s interview with Kaine:SAM STEIN: Welcome to Land-Grant Brewing Company here in Columbus, Ohio. I’m Sam Stein.AMANDA TERKEL: I’m Amanda Terkel.STEIN: And we are joined by Tim Kaine, senator of Virginia, former governor, current vice presidential candidate and, I guess, in recent weeks, America’s dad. So, thank you very much for joining us.SEN. TIM KAINE: Dads and beer, I mean it goes right together.STEIN: Dads and beer. Cheers. I appreciate it. So we wanted, I guess, we wanted to have a conversation about how government works, and maybe why it doesn’t work, which is a big frustration for a lot of people. And I want to go back to 2007. You’re one of the first people out of the state of Illinois to endorse Obama, and the premise essentially is, he can bring a bit of competence to government, he can get us behind, or past, the partisan rancor. And I think Obama himself has said that is one of his shortcomings, and one of his failings. So eight years later, how do you diagnose where it went wrong and why it went wrong?KAINE: Well, first, I don’t ― I won’t accept the premise that it, you know, went wrong, because the president has also had some transformative achievements. Twenty million people have health insurance who didn’t before. It was Teddy Roosevelt who first said he would do that, and Harry Truman who first introduced it, and, so ― and I could do, obviously, a number of things. Two of the three frozen relationships that the U.S. had in the world, Cuba and Iran, are in a different chapter. STEIN: Yeah, but those are like executive things, right? I mean, it was with Congress that was sort of the problem, right?KAINE: Look, Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank. There are a number of things with Congress. But you’re right, President Obama would say the thing that he probably feels the most regret about is he really thought ― not really his election, but the times we were in, that we were in the worst recession since the 1930s, and we had two wars that were kind of open-ended at that point ― that that would have compelled kind of almost like a national unity, like when Churchill did the National Unity Government after, you know, Britain got into the war. I think President Obama felt like this would be a time when we can do it. And he would say that that is probably what he really regrets ― that there’s still an awful lot of division.STEIN: So what went wrong?KAINE: You know, boy, we’re a closely divided country.STEIN: This is why we’re plying you with alcohol.KAINE: I mean, can I tell you? We’re a closely divided country. This is my ninth race. I’ve never had an easy one. I’ve never had one that it wasn’t closely divided and tough. But what we’ve got to figure out is a way to be closely divided before an Election Day, but then pull together after an Election Day.STEIN: Well maybe the question then is not what went wrong, but how does, how does Hillary Clinton, if she were to be elected president, how does she go about breaking through that impasse that Obama tried ― and occasionally did ― but by and large couldn’t really figure it out?KAINE: Well, it’s, it’s important. I mean, one of the reasons Hillary asked me to be on the ticket is, I was a Democratic governor with two Republican houses. She knows that I’ve got a good track record in the Senate of working across the aisle, and Hillary, as both first lady and senator, had some major bipartisan accomplishments. So, I think that she’s going to use what she already brings to the table. So she knows from eight years as first lady, eight years senator, four years secretary of state, she knows an awful lot of the players; she knows what motivates them, what they really care about, what the trip wires are that she probably doesn’t want to run across. That knowledge will come in handy. I mean, I’ll, you know, we don’t take anything for granted. I think there’s a good chance though that there’ll be a Democratic Senate, with a majority leader that is very close to Hillary. They were colleagues together, she and Chuck Schumer of New York. And then, I’ll say this: Not every Democrat agrees with me, but I was on the Murray-Ryan budget conference committee in 2013, and saw, you know, Paul Ryan and Patty Murray ― who are very different people politically ― say, “We gotta get a deal for the good of the country. I don’t have to set aside my ideological leanings, but we gotta get a deal for the good of the country.” And I think ― STEIN: You had the sequester coming down, you need to get rid of it somehow, yeah, that type of thing.KAINE: And then, Ryan did it again with respect to the approps bill at the end of 2015, and, you know, I was involved in that to some degree.STEIN: So do you think the fever breaks a little bit, though? KAINE: I believe it will. STEIN: I mean, that’s the constant mantra from Obama, is that the fever will break after this election. Why will this election be any different than any past election, even if you win the Senate majority?KAINE: Yeah, well let me, let me give you two things that I think will happen, and I wouldn’t be doing this if I weren’t an optimist, right? STEIN: I have noticed that. KAINE: So, but here are two things I think will happen. We’re getting a lot of GOP support. So in terms of bringing people together, I think it starts with, we’ve got GOP folks who are supporting us right now. When John Warner, who’s the archetypal Republican in Virginia, stands up and says, “I’m supporting Hillary,” and he doesn’t mention anything about Donald Trump ― “I’m supporting Hillary because I worked with her in the Senate.” So that starts the bridge-building process right away, when you have folks who have come across and said, “Hey, I’m trusting you, I think you’ll do a good job.” So that’s number one. And second, look, if we win, and I think we’re going to ― we don’t take anything for granted, not presuming ― but if we do, I think they’re, we’re going to have the burden of governing and governing for everybody. But I think the GOP’s going to have a burden too. They’re going to need to show GOP does not equal Trump.STEIN: OK.KAINE: And I think there’s going to be an obligation to show that Trumpism is not a complete equivalent for GOP. And I think, in that moment, when they’re trying to demonstrate that, there’s going to be some opportunities to get some wins right out of the gate. And then, you know, look, in life, success begets success. You know, you spend your time blaming the other for what’s not getting done and you actually do a couple things, and then you switch to, “Hey, let’s instead compete about who gets the credit for what we just did.” And that’s a lot more fun.STEIN: You are an eternal optimist. What is going on here?KAINE: It must be in this IPA.STEIN: Yeah, that IPA’s got something in it.TERKEL: So you mentioned Obamacare, and that seems to be one issue where you could maybe use some bipartisan consensus. Premiums are going up now, so where do you think the middle ground is to sort of help fix some of these problems with Republicans?KAINE: Yeah, no, great question. Let me tell you where we were when I came to the Senate in 2013 on Obamacare, and where we are today. Really interesting shift in the dynamic.When I came in in January 2013, the Democrats were like, “We can’t do anything to touch it or fix it, because that would be to admit that it’s not perfect.” And the Republicans are, “We don’t want to do anything to improve it. We want it to fail.” There was zero reform caucus. Absolutely zero. And I remember getting frustrated at some of the Dems, and I’d say, “There’s some obvious fixes here.” And I remember telling them once a story in a Democratic caucus lunch, when I was governor, at the end of every session, there would be about 1,100 passed bills on my desk that I would have to sign, veto or amend. And I noticed my first year that 850 of them were fixes to existing law, and only 250 were new. The job of a legislator is much more fixing existing law, revising it, improving it, than it is passing something that doesn’t exist. And I remember saying that to my folks but, you know, anyway, they weren’t listening. But, the Healthcare.gov roll-out glitch took a lot of the Democratic complacency and said, “OK, I guess ―”STEIN: It’s kind to call it a glitch, but ―KAINE: And it made them think it’s not perfect, I guess we better fix it. And then 20 million people with health insurance, you know, you can’t rip it away from them. There’s a lot of Republicans, “OK, we’re not going to repeal it.” Even the repeal-and-replace formulation is sort of an acknowledgement, “I guess we can’t repeal it.” So now you’ve got actually a working possibility of reform, and I think the reforms are likely to be, you know, in a couple of areas. One: The small business tax credit is something that Hillary talks about a lot. You know, I mean, like this, you know, Land-Grant Brewing here in Columbus. We had a tax credit for small businesses. Not that many small business have taken advantage of it. There was a goal that many would, but the fact that they haven’t means it’s probably not robust enough, and it’s also probably too administratively complicated for a small business to take. So that’s something that we, we definitely need to fix, and why wouldn’t Republicans want to do something good for small business, and we would want to make it easier to access. Second, we’ve got to work with the 18 or 19 states that haven’t done the Medicare expansion. Virginia is one. We got a Democratic governor that wants to do it, Republican houses that don’t. But Virginians are paying taxes and they’re not getting coverage, and I always analogize this to, when Medicaid was passed in ’65, the last state that got on board ― because it was optional, it’s mandatory now ― the last state that got on board was Arizona in 1982. It took 17 years. It was interesting, when the Affordable Care Act passed, Arizona did it immediately, even though they had two Republican senators, a Republican governor, Republican legislature. They were like, “What did we get by being the caboose on this effort?”STEIN: Also, it’s good economics for the state, right?KAINE: It is. And so, I think that, if we can, you know, make these remaining states ― work with them to get the expansion, that’s good. We need to work on drug costs, and there’s things we can work on on drug costs, especially Medicare Part D, to bring drug costs down. And the last thing, and this is the big one, what the Affordable Care Act started was a change in the American health care system from paying for procedures to paying for outcomes, paying for health. Other nations have already made that move. We pay for procedures and we get the best procedures in the world and we get the most procedures in the world, and then we spend a huge chunk of our GDP on health care, but we don’t have the best outcomes. Nations that pay for outcomes and health actually spend a lower percentage of GDP, and they have better outcomes. And so the Affordable Care Act is starting to make that migration, but we’ve got to keep down that path, and we’ll improve outcomes and reduce cost.TERKEL: So, one area where Republicans are already indicating that they’re not going to cooperate with a future Clinton-Kaine administration is on the Supreme Court. You had Sen. McCain say that they are likely to oppose any nominee you put forward for the Supreme Court. Ted Cruz said that there’s plenty of precedent for not having nine justices, for having eight or fewer. So, what do you do about that?KAINE: Well, Ted Cruz, I think, is being slightly disingenuous. The Constitution doesn’t set the size of the Court. It sets a maximum, I think, of 15. But since the Judiciary Act of 1869, it’s been a nine-member court. That’s what the statute says. We take an oath to uphold the law, that’s what we’re upholding. Congress could change it, if Congress wanted to and had the votes, but Congress won’t. So until Congress does, that’s the size of the court. And the battle is, do we want a lawfully constituted full court, or will we let the Republicans have a hobbled, limited and weakened court? And this really is unprecedented, and the thing that’s unprecedented about it is this: Senate has to advise and consent. That doesn’t mean you have to vote yes; you can vote no. It’s not a rubber stamp. But what these guys are doing is, “Wait a minute, we don’t have to vote yes or no, and maybe we can trick our voters into not holding us accountable for not voting yes or no.” And so, I’ll tell you what ―STEIN: What’s to stop them? I mean, honestly, what’s to stop them?KAINE: Well, the voters are going to stop them, or we’re going to stop them. And when I say “we,” I am a U.S. senator and I’m going to be a U.S. senator through the end of the year and maybe beyond. But I mean, I’m a U.S. senator. I have a prediction. This is not a guarantee, and I’m not revealing inside intel, but ―STEIN: That’s all right, I’m writing it down. Go on.KAINE: I was in the Senate when the Republicans stonewalling around appointments caused Senate Democratic majority to switch the vote threshold on appointments from 60 to 51. And we did it on everything but a Supreme Court justice.  If these guys think they’re going to stonewall the filling of that vacancy or other vacancies, then a Democratic Senate majority will say, “We’re not going to let you thwart the law.”  And so we will change the Senate rules to uphold the law, that the court will be nine members.STEIN: So it sounds like you’re predicting Harry Reid will follow through on what has been, so far, sort of a subtle, veiled threat to change the filibuster rules for the Supreme Court. KAINE: I am predicting that if the Republicans continue to stonewall, then I think that will happen, again I’m not revealing inside intel. This is a prediction.STEIN: No, no, no, I know, it’s what Reid has talked about basically, recently, yeah. KAINE: And I think that, you know, after an election, people will think about it, and I think there’s still a significant likelihood that Merrick Garland will get a vote before the end of the year. But we’ll see.STEIN: And you’d be happy with a Merrick Garland vote?KAINE: If I am in the Senate and Merrick Garland comes up, I’m voting yes, because, the way the character and fitness test for advise and consent positions was set up, it’s just supposed to be, is the person a fit character? He gets so far over that hurdle. I don’t know that anybody would get over that hurdle higher than Merrick Garland will. So I’m voting for him, if he comes up. STEIN: You don’t think he’s bored waiting around at this point, waiting to go back to law practice? KAINE: I mean, I’m sure he is. TERKEL: Just flipping through magazines.STEIN: What is he doing at this juncture?KAINE: The good thing about him is he has a job. He’s on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. If he was in law practice, they would’ve held a congratulations party for him the day after he got nominated. He’d be sitting in his office for months. STEIN: So, one of the things that everyone basically says is partially responsible for why government doesn’t really function that well is just the sheer amount of money, right? And the influence.KAINE: Yeah, I agree. STEIN: But you guys have put out, you want to overturn Citizens United, you want to do the Disclose Act. Don’t want to get into it, but it’s essentially it would ― KAINE: No secret money, no secret money.STEIN: So, there’s two reforms that your opponent, Donald Trump, has introduced in the past couple weeks that would go even further than that.KAINE: Yeah.STEIN: One is to term-limit members of Congress.KAINE: Yeah.STEIN: And the other is to put a five-year ban on members of Congress and executive officials from turning around after they leave office or their positions and lobbying the agencies that they were associated with. So, why is he wrong?KAINE: Well, look. Let me take them in reverse order. The ban on the revolving door, I don’t think that’s all bad. And there are current limitations on it. Now, how do you structure it? Because what happens is, OK there’s a ban on being involved when you get out of Congress, but then some say, “OK, well I don’t lobby, but I’ll do, you know, strategic advice” or something like that. So how do you define it so that there really isn’t a revolving door? Look, there’s already rules about it, and can we make the rules better? I’m really open to that. Term limits, I think it’s a bad idea.STEIN: Why?TERKEL: Because you had them in Virginia, for governor.KAINE: It’s a bad idea. I had a one-term governorship in Virginia, which I think was bad for the state. It was good for the family, but it was bad for the state. But here’s why I think it’s bad for Congress. I worked DNC chair and as a candidate now. I’ve been in 40 states as a candidate, and I interact with a lot of state legislators who are in states where there’s term limits. And here’s what they say to me: “OK, it sounds good, but boy, I tell ya, you do term limits, then the only people who don’t have the terms are the lobbyists.” And so the permanent institutional expertise class is now no longer the legislators, it’s the lobbyists who don’t have term limits and are there forever. It sounds good, but I think if you do term limits, you would really increase the power of lobbying. If you want to decrease the power, you can do revolving door stuff or you can do campaign finance reform, which is what we really want to do. And that would be more likely to check lobbyists’ power than term limits.STEIN: Fair enough. One of the things you’re known for with respect to the Congress, even if they’re not term-limited, is you tried really hard to get the war powers away from the executive back to the legislative branch. And I know you recently said — why don’t you elaborate on why you think Hillary Clinton should do that going forward, if she were to be elected? What is the point? Don’t you think ― now you’re going to be vice president potentially, don’t you want all those powers?KAINE: No. No.STEIN: Why not?KAINE: I’m going to talk to you about the issue generally, then I’m going to talk to you about the battle against ISIS right now. Use that as an example.The issue generally. I’m a Virginia guy, so I like James Madison. And Madison wrote the ―STEIN: Jefferson’s not happy with us. KAINE: No, I like Jefferson, too. Jefferson and Madison both agreed on this. STEIN: Just want to make sure. Who’s number one?KAINE: I’m not going there. I’m actually going with Madison. Bill of Rights was Madison, I’m going with Madison.  STEIN: Wow! We’re making news here.KAINE: Right. So, so their thought was, they surveyed the history of the world, and they said war is for the king, the sultan, the monarch, the emperor, the executive — that’s who war is for.STEIN: Sure. KAINE: We’re going to change it. And we’re going to make the initiation of war for the people’s elected legislature. And then, once initiated, the president will prosecute the war — commander in chief. The reason that they did that was, they looked at history and they thought executives overreach and wage wars that they don’t need to — and I think history is filled with examples of that.But also, there’s another moral value that’s really important. People are in the military. It’s a risky line of work. I’ve got a boy in the military deployed overseas right now. Before you order them onto the field of battle, there ought to be a political consensus between the executive and the legislature that, this is in the national interest. We’re putting our thumb print on this mission and say, it’s in the national interest. If the executive does it but the legislature is like, “Ah, we’d rather not vote” ― it’s immoral to ask people to risk their life. So, the big-picture issue constitutionally for me is, get Congress on board to initiate war as a way of sending a message to troops that are overseas. We’ve already lost 20 people in the war against ISIL, and Congress hasn’t had the guts to even cast a vote. STEIN: Let’s move it away from ISIS and foreign policy, and just talk generally about balance of powers between legislative and executive branch.KAINE: Yeah, but I want to say one more thing about this.The reason it’s important, and that Hillary agrees with me on this ― we look at the legal Article I v. Article II, we look at it slightly different, but we reach the same punch line, which is: We are in a war against ISIS right now. We’re moving on Mosul, maybe moving on Raqqa. But we’re using an authorization that a Congress passed on Sept. 14, 2001. By the time the next Congress swears in, probably 70 percent of Congress was not here when that was vote was given. So it’s on autopilot. We got people risking their lives and dying, and Congress is like, “Why do we have to declare?”And Hillary says we have to take stock of what this fight against non-state terrorism is, and there is a dialogue that goes on between an executive and legislative that educates the public and then we send a message to adversaries, a message to allies, a message to our troops, and I do think that that’s really important. OK, so now. STEIN: OK so, if the idea here, and I think I’m getting this right, is you need to show solidarity with missions as grand as ISIS and wars. KAINE: Yeah.  STEIN: Certainly, to a certain extent, you can say, OK on domestic policy there are some issues where you want to show the legislative and the executive branch have a solidarity. Sure. Now, President Obama has been criticized for using his executive authorities on climate legislation, immigration reform, and so on. So, you know, you’ve been an executive, you’ve been a senator, you’re hoping to be in the executive with purview over the Senate.KAINE: I mean ― a hybrid. STEIN: So, what’s your 30,000-foot picture on where this line should be in terms of a balance between these two branches?KAINE: Yeah. Well, I do think the president’s best role is usually as the sort of initiator. If you think of big, legislative accomplishments, most of them kind of get initiated with the president putting something out there and Congress working on it.If you think, what was the last really big, big accomplishment for the nation that came purely out of the legislature? It might be the Americans with Disabilities Act. I mean that really was a legislative creation. But usually the president is kind of the initiator of the idea, then Congress makes it work. And then, you know, in the war powers area, it’s well, Congress does the budget — you know, the approps, that’s not the president. The president doesn’t get a line-item veto, so all the budgetary approps stuff is with Congress. The executive order thing — look, it’s important to use executive orders. Every president since Washington has. And the thing about an executive order — there has never been an executive order that a Congress couldn’t say, “You know, we don’t like that so we’re going to do something else,” if there is a majority in Congress to do something else.And so sometimes, you know, you have a court ruling that this or that executive order went beyond authority, but almost always, executive orders are within an authority and always within the purview of Congress to change if they want to legislatively change it.  TERKEL: So you’ve talked about how a Clinton-Kaine administration could show a strong woman leading and a strong man supporting the woman in charge. So, how worried are you, though, that we could see something like we saw under Obama, where a woman, the first woman is elected to the White House and we see an increase in sexism. We elected the first black president and we saw a lot of, you know, a lot of divisions in terms of race relations. How worried are you about that?KAINE: Well, here’s the way I look at President Obama’s election — and I was a civil rights lawyer in the capital of the Confederacy for 17 years. His election and his re-election demonstrates that we are progressing and getting better. It didn’t create any new racial hostility. It may have brought to the surface some that was there, but I don’t think it created it. I think it normalized the idea that an African American could be president, and it is a step forward. It’s not at the end of the race in overcoming racism, but it is a step forward.And I think we will look at this when President Obama is gone and say that in the area of race and normalizing acceptance of others around the table of leadership, we’ve taken a big step forward. We’ve still got a ways to go.So, Hillary, if you think it through, yeah maybe some people who don’t like the idea of a woman leader will be more vocal about their feelings, but that election is going to be a big step forward in Hillary’s legacy.I was talking to a college audience at Kenyon today and I’ve been saying this thing that, when President Obama was elected, the moment they called him the winner, before he had done anything else, suddenly, a whole group of people who could never see themselves as president said, “I can be president of the United States, and if I can do that, I can do anything.” And Hillary’s election is going to do the same thing. Before she takes the oath of office or does one bill, immediately — “I can be president of the United States.” They each are creating a group of successors who had never been able to see themselves as president. That’s a step forward, but it’s not the end of sexism, it’s not the end of racism. We’re human. But it’s a step forward. STEIN: We have two very fun questions. TERKEL: Quick questions.KAINE: OK, I’ll take one of them.STEIN: Nah, you get two, otherwise you can’t finish the beer. First one, you’re a Bob Dylan fan.KAINE: I am a Bob Dylan fan. STEIN: He wins this Nobel Prize in Literature. KAINE: I know!TERKEL: Do you think he deserved it?KAINE: Oh, yeah, oh completely. Absolutely. I’m so in the tank for this. I think this is great.STEIN: You know, Philip Roth is a huge fan of this [show].KAINE: Well, and Philip Roth, I mean, anybody who can write The Plot Against America, American Pastoral ― he deserves a Nobel Prize.STEIN: That book is a little weirdly prescient in this election.KAINE: Especially the somewhat optimistic ending, or so I’m hoping.STEIN: All right. Why has Bob Dylan not picked up his prize? Have you been following this? He just won’t pick it up, what’s going on?KAINE: So, who would be the equivalent of a Bob Dylan? Marlon Brando for an Academy Award, and I think there had been one or two other literary Nobel Prizes like Jean-Paul Sartre. I don’t think he picked his up.STEIN: OK, sure, this is weird, you can admit. I know you like the guy, but it’s weird.KAINE: No, it’s weird. It’s weird. But isn’t that part of why Bob Dylan won the prize, and why we like him?TERKEL: Yeah, although it was controversial that he won.STEIN: It was very controversial.KAINE: I mean he’s not Robert Zimmerman, he’s Bob Dylan.STEIN: Fair enough, although I would like if he went by Robert Zimmerman. It’s good for the Jews. All right, last one. The guy you’re trying to replace, Joe Biden, has for some reason said he’d like to take Donald Trump out back and fight him. What’s the deal with that? Is that productive? It feels like it’s playing to the lower common denominator than maybe ― If the mantra is, if they go low we go high, is that?TERKEL: Or do you want to fight Donald Trump too?KAINE: I’m a lover, not a fighter. I am a lover, not a fighter.TERKEL: You’re from Virginia!STEIN: Is this productive though, what’s going on here?KAINE: You know what, I mean, I have no way of knowing this to be true, but my intuition is not that Joe Biden’s speechwriter thought about that and put it in the speech.STEIN: What gave that away?KAINE: One of the reasons people love Joe Biden is he just kind of says what he thinks. He’s a guy whose heart is on his sleeve, and that’s one of the things people love about him. And I’ll say about Joe, I have really learned a lot from him. Some, because of things he’s told me, but some just watching the way he’s done his job. This is a supporting job that gives you an enormous ability, but you also have to be really loyal.STEIN: Sure.KAINE: I’ve been a lieutenant governor to a great governor, Mark Warner, I’ve been a DNC chair to a great president, Barack Obama. Both are supporting roles. So I have had supporting roles like the role I may go into. STEIN: Is that the model you want to follow, the Biden model?KAINE: Yeah. The Biden model really has been the model, sort of, since Mondale, and that is, let me be your chief adviser, the last person in the room, give you my best advice, but it’s also two-way, I’m going to give you my best advice, but also learn from you. And, let me take on a few projects. I have some projects based on being mayor and governor and living in Latin America and doing a lot ―STEIN: I’m going to get killed by your advisers, but what are your projects you want to take on?KAINE: Well, I mean, no surprise, and Hillary has talked about this too, but one of the first two bills out the gate is an economic acceleration package to grow jobs. No bill works if it doesn’t work in a zip code where somebody lives. I’ve been a mayor and governor doing economic development deals. I was also a civil rights lawyer caring about the fairness and equity of the justice side of this, so I think I could do some things in connection with the economic development effort to really make it work, you know, where people live.And then the second thing is, having spent time in Central America, and having Spanish fluency, and knowing that secretaries of state usually fly east-west all the time ― you know, we have 37 nations in the Americas and Caribbean, a billion people, we are without war, really, for the first time in our recorded history, other continents can’t say that. I think there are a lot of opportunities in the Americas that matter deeply to 45 million Latinos in this country, and I would hope to be able to work to maybe elevate the profile of the Americas in our discussion about American global leadership. STEIN: When you say we’re without war, you meant in our North-South Hemisphere, right?KAINE: Yeah, even after the referendum failed in Colombia, the U.S. helped that Colombian peace process end the civil war, then the referendum to ratify it failed, but both sides have said they’re not going back to war. We’re going to have to work on the legal status, but peace should be our future. And when that ceasefire went into place, and in the Americas there are other challenges ― we’re human, obviously ― but to have no war for the first time in history, as far as I can determine, that’s a big deal.STEIN: I would love to talk to you about the referendum on the Colombian civil war, but Karen Finney will literally rip my head off. KAINE: Yeah, I mean, of course, because we’re in Colombia! Cause we’re in Colombia! No, I’m sorry, Columbus.TERKEL: Thank you, it was great having you, thank you.STEIN: Sen. Kaine, America’s Dad, and perhaps, the future vice president. And thank you of course, to the Land-Grant Brewing Company for hosting us."

But do they know the full extent of their choices? Yes, the media has made everyone aware of the fact that numerous humans are running to serve as commander in chief. But the media has raised just as much awareness of how imperfect all of them are, forcing everyone to have to accept something less than ideal.But what if there was a candidate who promised to end all of that? As it happens, there is: the Sweet Meteor Of Death. On this week’s edition of “So That Happened,” we reached into the depth of space to secure an interview with the Sweet Meteor, who maintains both a trajectory that will collide with the planet Earth and a Twitter account.As the Sweet Meteor is the first celestial body to run for president, it offers up a lot of genuinely outside-the-box ideas about the future of America, such as swiftly killing everyone who ever used the term “outside the box” or, indeed, had any sort of interaction with a box at all. With the Sweet Meteor, there are no facts to check, no policies to evaluate, and no worries about whether it’s being influenced by outside money or a corporate agenda. Just a bold and unbreakable promise, as it says, “to offer a better alternative in the form of the end of human civilization.” (Of course, a meteor is nothing more than a fragment from an astroid or meteoroid that enters Earth’s atmosphere. Pieces that strike the ground are meteorites.) You can listen to our interview with the Sweet Meteor of Death by clicking below. (Interview begins at the 41:00 mark) Learn all about the Sweet Meteor of Death’s path to victory (unrelenting, through space) and its plans for its first 100 days in office (there won’t be 100 days).Elsewhere on this week’s edition of “So, That Happened”: With the election winding down, Donald Trump is running out of creative ways to spend Republican money on himself. But the wily old grifter has still got it, and now people who thought they were donating to a presidential campaign have actually bought copies of The Art Of The Deal. We’ll take a look at Trump’s ability to rook gullible Republican donors.Meanwhile, the 2016 election cycle has been a real boon for the fact-checking industry. Interest in fact-checking among readers is seemingly at an all-time high. And thanks to Donald Trump, there is a never-ending supply of material. And yet, it doesn’t seem that it makes much of a difference. Joining us to talk about how fact-checking is still losing the battle of confirmation bias is New York Times columnist Emma Roller, who wrote about this conundrum this week.Finally, the media has been having a debate about Trump’s voter base. On one side you have people who believe it’s entirely driven by racial resentment. On the other, you have those who insist it’s all rooted in economic anxiety. But what if the real problem is that we’ve all just taken sides in a dumb debate? Joining us to travel to a middle ground is University of Connecticut history professor James Kwak.“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week: University of Connecticut history Professor James Kwak, New York Times columnist Emma Roller, presidential candidate and pending extinction-level event the Sweet Meteor Of Death, as well as HuffPost reporters Zach Carter and SV Date.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

But less than half is controlled or headed to committees under Trump’s direction.Trump’s campaign had just $16 million cash on hand. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee is sitting on $51 million. The two joint fundraising committees raising money for Trump also had $52 million in the bank at that same time. It’s unclear, however, how much of that money will be transferred to the Trump campaign, and how much will be spent on further fundraising expenses.Cash on Hand (10/19) for Hillary Clinton & Donald TrumpTrump’s precarious cash situation is nothing new for his campaign. He has run far behind Clinton in the amount of money raised and spent for the entire 2016 election cycle.Overall, Clinton has raised $509 million for her campaign ― double Trump’s $255 million. When combining candidate fundraising with their central party committees and their joint fundraising committees, Team Clinton has raised $947 million, compared with Team Trump’s $669 million.Clinton has used her huge fundraising advantage to deluge the airwaves with ads and build a massive field organization that is swamping Trump and Republicans in states that allow early voting.Democrats have already improved their position from 2008 and 2012 in terms of absentee and early votes in numerous battleground states, according to CNN. As of Oct. 18, Clinton was surpassing Trump in advertising by a 3-to-1 margin, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. Pro-Clinton outside groups, like her record-setting super PAC, continue to air more ads than pro-Trump groups.Total Fundraising for Hillary Clinton & Donald TrumpOn outside group spending, it’s notable that the RNC is nowhere to be seen. The main Republican Party committee has spent only $321,531 on independent expenditures against Clinton, and, even more surprisingly, only $60,506 on coordinated party expenditures. Coordinated party expenditures allow the party to share the burden of some candidate advertising costs. In 2016, parties are allowed to spend a maximum of $23.8 million on these coordinated expenses with their presidential candidate. The RNC has spent basically nothing.In 2012, the RNC spent the maximum allowed on coordinated expenditures to support Mitt Romney. The party dropped an additional $42 million on independent expenditures to boost Romney and attack President Barack Obama. The RNC had $51 million cash on hand on Oct. 20, and had spent less than $400,000 on either coordinated or independent expenditures to support their 2016 candidate. Most of those expenses were incurred more than a year ago ― before Republican voters chose Trump as their standard-bearer.The Democratic National Committee has spent little on either coordinated or independent expenditures, but it hasn’t had to. Clinton’s campaign has always maintained a massive cash, advertising and organizational advantage over Trump, and she has rarely trailed in public polling. Further, Trump’s propensity to routinely put both feet in his mouth made it possible for the DNC to spend its money in other ways ― or, perhaps for the first time in years, end the campaign in the black.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Veterans who had left the service from three to 12 months earlier had almost triple the suicide odds of current members of the military.“Family members and community can be proactive to reach out to veterans if they recently experienced stressful events – not just limited to the stressful events we can capture in the data such as divorce or separation from the military,” said lead study author Yu-Chu Shen, a researcher at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.“In addition, clinicians should be aware that deployments may increase suicide risk independently of underlying mental disorders, and so asking patients about deployment history is advisable,” Shen said by email.To assess how different types of experiences during military service and afterwards might influence suicide risk, researchers analyzed data collected on almost 3.8 million current and former service members from 2001 to 2011.Overall, there were 4,492 suicides in the study population.The strongest predictors of suicide were current or past diagnoses of self-inflicted injuries, major depression, bipolar disorder, substance abuse or other mental health conditions, researchers report in The Lancet Psychiatry.Compared with service members who were never deployed, those who were currently deployed had a 50 percent lower risk of suicide, the study found.However, in the first quarter following deployment, service members had a 50 percent higher risk of suicide than their peers who didn’t experience deployment.The study didn’t examine why the suicide risk was lower during deployment than afterwards. But it’s possible service members benefited from the positive psychological impact of belonging to a group with a shared mission during deployment, Shen said, then had more time to contemplate any negative feelings about their experiences when they were no longer on the mission.When they left the military, the risk of suicide remained higher than for current service members for several years. Six years after leaving the military, veterans had a 63 percent higher risk of suicide than those still in the service, the study found.One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on mental health disorders diagnosed after separation from the military, the authors note. They also lacked data on civilian experiences like divorce, unemployment, financial hardship or housing insecurity that could all influence mental health and the risk of suicide, the researchers point out.The study also doesn’t account for the frequency or intensity of combat experiences, noted Dr. Charles Hoge, a senior scientist at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research who wrote an accompanying editorial.Still, the findings suggest that veterans may need mental health services long after they return home.“Unfortunately, despite numerous efforts to reduce stigma and other barriers to care, stigma remains pervasive in society and many veterans still do not seek help when needed,” Hoge told Reuters Health by email.“There are a number of warning signs for underlying mental health problems that may require treatment, such as withdrawal from family and friends, noticeable changes in functioning or behavior, talking about suicide or death, giving away belongings, increasing alcohol or substance use, or expressions of hopelessness or worthlessness,” Hoge added.One immediate resource that is available 24/7 is the national suicide prevention lifeline 1-800-273-8255.

Ashby faced up to 48 years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in 5 years and must also pay a $10,000 fine, according to a tweet from Rob McCallum, a spokesman for Colorado courts. Jacquez’s family believes the judge was lenient.“It took me a couple of hours after the verdict was read (for it to settle in),” Jacquez’s father, Jack Jacquez Sr., told the Denver Post. “I was content at first and then started rethinking the whole situation and realized this man got off easy. If you ever want to commit a murder, go to Rocky Ford.”Ashby reportedly confronted Jacquez on the night of Oct. 12, 2014, while Jacquez was skateboarding along a highway. Ashby initially claimed Jacquez responded to his questioning with profanity, but a civilian who was riding along with Ashby at the time later told detectives that Jacquez only said he was on his way home.Investigators say Ashby then followed Jacquez, who was Hispanic, into a house belonging to Jacquez’s mother. Ashby claimed he believed Jacquez was a burglar or trespassing on the property.When Ashby entered, a confrontation ensued and Ashby fired two shots.An autopsy later revealed that a single bullet entered through Jacquez’s back, perforating his lung and three of the four chambers of his heart and severing his spinal cord.Jacquez had gotten engaged to his pregnant girlfriend shortly before his death.The shooting rocked the small farming town, sparking marches and a candlelight vigil. Less than two months earlier, a police officer had fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, bringing issues of race and policing into the national spotlight.The coverage surrounding Brown’s death ― and the eventual decision not to charge the officer responsible ― led to increased scrutiny of the process by which officers are held accountable for using lethal force. Ashby’s conviction and sentencing are a rarity, running counter to the general trend of officers escaping legal repercussions after fatal encounters with civilians.Ashby is the first officer to be convicted of murder in an on-duty shooting since at least 2005, according to data compiled by Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminology at Ohio’s Bowling Green State University. This does not include officers convicted for off-duty incidents not related to police work.By Stinson’s count, 77 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter resulting from police-involved shootings since the beginning of 2005. Given that police kill around 1,000 civilians every year, according to Stinson’s estimate, most still avoid prosecution entirely. Of the 77 who were charged, 27 officers so far have been convicted ― and Ashby was the only one to be convicted of murder. A number of other cases are still pending and the rest have ended in non-convictions, either through acquittal or dismissal.Although prosecutors have been able to secure a handful of murder indictments for officers involved in fatal shootings, judges and juries almost never convict them on such severe charges.In 2014 and 2015, no officers were convicted of either murder or manslaughter. A handful of officers have either been convicted of or have pled guilty to manslaughter charges so far this year, which carry significantly lighter sentences.But these outcomes are still incredibly rare, especially for cases that go before a jury.“Juries are very reluctant to second-guess police officers in violent encounters, especially shootings when an officer is on duty,” said Stinson. “We don’t know what juries really do behind the closed doors of deliberation, but it seems that they tend to think about it as if that was a family members of theirs who was a police officer.”“They don’t want to believe that police officers could commit a murder,” he added."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5813c578190000ec02c2fb0d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LISBON, Maine ― Attendees at Donald Trump’s campaign rally here Friday reacted with a mix of optimism and cynicism to news that the FBI was reviewing a new batch of emails related to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server when she was secretary of state.“Hopefully, they indict her before Election Day,” said Trump supporter William Cozens. “I don’t know if it’s going to benefit Trump, but it’s not going to bode well for Hillary.”The FBI news arrived just as Trump, his poll numbers dwindling as the election approaches, badly needed a jolt. And judging from the Lisbon crowd, he got one. Indeed, many Trump supporters at the rally said they thought the revelations could lead to criminal prosecution of Clinton that may tip the election in Trump’s favor. Trump himself capitalized on the news, hailing it as “bigger than Watergate” during a speech earlier in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.But Cozens, like others in the Maine crowd, wouldn’t allow himself to get too enthusiastic. “I think the mainstream media is going to spin it,” he said. “I think they’re going to say, ‘Oh, well, it was the Russians.’ I think they’re going to downplay it just like all her other crookedness.”Melissa Stinchcomb, an undecided leaning toward Trump, said the news made her feel less favorable about Clinton.“It’s all been negative with her,” Stinchcomb said, adding that she was underwhelmed by both candidates. “You have to pick out the cleanest pair of dirty underwear from the pile,” she said. Stinchcomb added she would like to see Trump “stop being him.” Katie Fox, from nearby Poland, said the news reinforced much of what she believed about Clinton. “It just proves that she’s lying,” Fox said. “I wasn’t going to vote for her anyway.”Many people said the FBI announcement surprised them ― in part because of their distrust of the government.“It’s about time that the FBI started doing something,” said Wendy, who asked that her last name not be published. “Everything she done has been illegal,” added her husband, Michael, referring to Clinton. “It’s amazing she hasn’t been accounted for yet.” Harold Brooks, from Hebron, said he was hoping for the worst for Clinton. “They may indict her. They may do an emergency indictment,” said Brooks. “I don’t think the political system wants the cover-up on her to keep going. Hillary’s been able to manipulate the political system, so the political system covers her every time she does something wrong.” Brooks said he anticipated the news would revive enthusiasm for the Trump campaign. “I think his energy level at this thing today will be through the roof,” he said of the GOP nominee. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

But as the Washington Post reported, they make up a relatively small percentage of the nation’s educational institutions:Today the thousands of charter schools — which are funded with public money but allowed to operate independently of public school districts — educate about 6 percent of all public school students in various states and the District of Columbia. Eight states have no charter schools, and five have fewer than 10.The NAACP said its decision is based on its strong support for public schools, and noted its history of denouncing “movements toward privatization that divert public funds to support non-public school choices.”Legend, who recently welcomed a baby girl with wife Chrissy Teigen, has a strong passion for education reform and other social issues. In 2007, he launched the Show Me Campaign, a nonprofit with initiatives focused on education and mass incarceration. He sits on the board of Teach for America and is the vice chairman of the board of Harlem Village Academies, a charter school network in New York City. The Grammy Award winner mentioned New York in his Essence article:“What’s shortsighted about the NAACP’s decision is that it’s ignoring the many successful charter schools that are delivering results for many communities,” he wrote. “In New York City, third grade charter school students outscored students at district schools in math and in English. Charters here are closing the achievement gap between economically disadvantaged Black students and their more affluent white peers.”For Legend, issuing a moratorium on new charters isn’t the solution to fighting poverty and empowering children to succeed.“We have to do better. I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the NAACP in the fight for equal opportunity, social justice, and against the poverty that plagues too many of our neighborhoods,” he said. “I want to stand with them on education, too.”"

17,POLITICS,Been Stiffed On Wages? Hurt On The Job? The White House Wants To Help.,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/workers-rights-website-workergov_us_58126206e4b0990edc3012dc,"A new website, Worker.gov, seeks to make it easier to protect your rights.",2016-10-28,"President Barack Obama is trying to boost workers, with or without Congress' help.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581262b8170000b0005ba308.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the secretary of labor, Tom Perez spends a lot of his time explaining workers’ rights. Yet when he talks one-on-one with workers of all kinds, he’s noticed that many of them still aren’t aware of the legal protections they have.Whether it’s the right to overtime pay when they toil more than 40 hours in a week or the right to take unpaid time off after having a child, “they don’t know what they don’t know,” as Perez put it to The Huffington Post.The White House is hoping to change that. On Friday, the Obama administration unveiled a new government website, worker.gov, that’s meant to help people understand their rights under the hodgepodge of U.S. workplace laws that are enforced by a range of agencies.Unlike the typical federal website ― which tries, and often fails, to put complicated statutes into plain English (and Spanish) ― the new site begins with the worker. If you visit the site, you’ll be asked to identify your job and perhaps your problem on the job. The site will then tell you how different laws apply to your situation and how regulators might be able to help if a law is being broken.In other words, you won’t have to know that a certain law exists to learn about its protections.“If you’re a low-wage worker, you shouldn’t have to know what the Fair Labor Standards Act is,” said Perez, referring to the law that guarantees a minimum wage. “You should be able to go to one stop, type in what you do for a living, and it’ll give you a primer on what your rights are and where you can file a complaint.”Perez concedes that a new website won’t move the needle much when it comes to improving wages and working conditions in the U.S. But he sees it as part of a broader White House effort to boost employees’ bargaining power in piecemeal ways ― given the lack of cooperation from a Republican-controlled Congress.President Barack Obama was criticized by many labor leaders for sitting back early in his presidency. But over the past few years, he has let loose a flurry of executive actions related to the workplace. These include directives to expand overtime protections to millions of salaried workers, finalize safety regulations that were decades in the making, and force federal contractors to pay higher wages and offer better benefits to low-wage workers. Republicans opposed all those maneuvers, but weren’t able to stop them because they were carried out through executive power.The White House has also tried to augment its more ambitious moves with smaller improvements. For instance, the administration was unable to get a bill through Congress guaranteeing paid family leave for workers, so the Labor Department doled out grants to states and cities to explore the costs of local paid-leave programs. The grants are modest ― the District of Columbia received one for $96,000 ― but they can help spur actual legislation. D.C.’s city council and mayor are now haggling over the details of a paid-leave proposal, and a new law could arrive as soon as next year.Perez argues that this adds up to more than just nibbling around the edges ― although he acknowledges there’s no substitute for passing federal laws the president can sign. “There are a lot of singles and doubles being hit,” Perez said. “I think we’re making progress in very real ways.”A year ago, the administration hosted a summit titled “Worker Voice,” bringing together labor unions, nonprofits and corporate executives to discuss stagnant wages and other problems facing workers in the modern economy. Since then, it has hosted similar regional summits in places like Minneapolis, Los Angeles, New York and D.C.According to the White House, feedback from those events went into the creation of the Worker.gov site, which was developed with the help of the Presidential Innovation Fellows program. The site draws material from the Justice Department, the Labor Department, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board. Officials said they expect some kinks and want feedback from users. (HuffPost, like everyone else, recalls the disastrous Healthcare.gov rollout, and we haven’t played around with Worker.gov enough to vouch for its usability.)Perez said hopes for the new site are straightforward: If you’ve had wages withheld unfairly, if you’ve been hurt or discriminated against on the job, or if your right to unionize has been trampled on, Worker.gov will show you where you can find help. The current version of the site, which is still in beta testing, focuses on a few particular types of workers: office employees, day laborers, and workers in restaurants and nail salons. But the White House plans to expand the site to include jobs of all kinds. “It’s been exciting to see workers around the country starting to understand that they do have control over their lives and jobs,” Perez said, “but there’s a lot of work to be done.”"

(See: serial killer Aileen Wuornos.) For her next project, she’s once again gained weight to play ― drumroll, please ― an average human being.The “Mad Max” actress is currently filming “Tully” with her “Young Adult” collaborators, director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody. In the film, Theron plays Marlo, a mother of three children who develops a relationship with the titular nighttime nanny hired by her brother to lighten the load. According to People, Theron gained 35 pounds for the role.At the amfAR Inspiration Gala in Los Angeles on Thursday night ― a benefit for AIDS research ― Theron walked the red carpet in a more loose-fitting gown than we’re accustomed to seeing her in. But she looked stunning nonetheless because, that’s right, she’s still Charlize Theron.However, with friend Chelsea Handler first poking fun at Theron’s new curves, her weight apparently became the running joke of the evening, E! News reports. Theron ran with the comedian’s quip as she accepted an Inspiration Award for her tireless HIV/AIDS prevention work in Africa.“Yes, I am very fat right now,” she reportedly told the crowd. However, the actress quickly moved on to more pressing matters, like the importance of advocating for those most acutely effected by HIV/AIDS ― women, people of color, LGBTQ people and sex workers.“Despite our best intentions, sometimes people are still falling through the cracks and too many are not being seen,” Theron said. “It’s tough to admit that, as much progress as we’ve made, sometimes it feels like we’re failing the ones that need us the most.”“We need big, bold messages to fight apathy in our governments and in our own communities. And if we’re going to end stigma, we’re going to have to check our own biases and ask who are we missing when we talk about end[ing] AIDS?”This (and many other reasons) is why we love you at any size, Charlize.

Pence told reporters that no one was injured in the incident.The device credited with stopping the plane after it “overshot” the 7,000-foot-long runway is called an “arrestor bed.” What exactly is this technology, and why haven’t you heard of it before?Arrestor beds are made of blocks of “lightweight, crushable cellular cement material” that will collapse under the weight of the plane to slow it down or stop it. These beds have been installed at more than 100 runway ends at airports like Boston Logan, Chicago Midway and San Diego International. As of February 2016, arrestor beds had safely stopped 10 aircraft that overshot the runway. In a statement released earlier this year, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acknowledged that runway safety areas are not up to code in many older United States airports. Runway safety areas are typically 500 feet wide and extend 1,000 feet beyond the end of the runway, reducing the risk of damage if airplanes overshoot, undershoot or veer off the runway. But in airports that were built before this standard was adopted, like LaGuardia, creating an RSA of this size simply isn’t feasible. The FAA began researching this problem in the 1990s. They introduced engineered material arresting systems, or arrestor beds, to safely stop an aircraft that skids off the runway. Here’s hoping there are some arrestor beds waiting for Pence at the end of Donald Trump’s campaign on Election DayCORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated arrestor beds have been installed at approximately 1,000 runway ends at airports. According to the FAA, as of February 2016 they’re installed at approximately 103 runway ends at 61 airports in the United States. "

The foggy vision makes her look like a dream, inaccessible to mere fans.The portrait was taken by Marilyn Minter, an artist whose photorealistic paintings center on glamour, fashion and femininity. Since the 1980s, Minter’s work has depicted both the allure of magazine-touted beauty and the grimy realities that lie beneath it. She captures polished toenails and muddy feet, glittery lips and slurping mouths.Decades’ worth of her work is on display at The Brooklyn Museum starting Nov. 4 in an exhibition called “Pretty/Dirty.” There you’ll find portraits she took of her mother ― a glamorous addict who embodied the paradoxes that Minter has come to represent. You’ll find videos of tongues brushing against some kind of goopy green product, commentary on consumption in all its forms.But you won’t find her most recent work ― the portrait she took of Cyrus looking misty and contemplative, taken for a project to help raise funds for Planned Parenthood.“[Miley] is one of the few celebrities to back Planned Parenthood. Most of them won’t touch it, because they don’t want this very small but vocal minority to troll them,” Minter said. “I don’t care. You know, what are they going to do? Not buy my art? Artists are pretty fearless when it comes to that. But people can boycott a celebrity. They can make life uncomfortable.”Minter’s admiration for Cyrus is clear. “She’s an activist. She’s an animal rights person. And these are all things I am, too,” she said, adding that millennial feminists are “totally aware” of the importance of reproductive rights and sex-positivity.The latter point is an important one for Minter, whose work wasn’t embraced by feminists in the ‘80s. She was rejected by the art world as unserious, rejected by the fashion world as too grotesque, and rejected by feminists for her portrayal of pleasures that might be considered oppressive or unsavory.In 1989, Minter began her “100 Food Porn” series, consisting of over 100 paintings of hands working to prepare drippy, buttery meals. She wanted an artistic endeavor that had some financial promise. “I needed something to bargain with, because I didn’t have any money,” she said. Eventually, she purchased 30-second ad spots during commercial breaks for “Late Night with David Letterman,” “The Arsenio Hall Show,” and Ted Koppel’s “Nightline” to promote the paintings.But what began as a bid for commercial work resulted in a project that subtly worked to promote equality.“I went through cookbooks and most of them were male hands, and I turned half of them into female hands by putting long, red fingernails on them,” Minter said. “No one’s ever noticed that. It’s all female hands tearing food apart.”This idea of inserting feminine pleasure into popular imagery is common throughout Minter’s work, including a 1992 painting of a woman touching herself through lace underwear, and another from the same year of a woman taking a disembodied penis into her mouth. They’re undoubtedly scenes drawn or directly culled from porn, a medium of sexual expression dismissed wholesale by feminists at the time. Minter says her aim with these paintings was to ask whether it was possible for women to “recapture images from an abusive history, and claim them and make images for their own amusement and pleasure,” adding that, “nobody had politically correct fantasies.”Minter says her work better reaches contemporary viewers, because the internet has de-stigmatized pornography, revealing it to be a complicated medium that can both oppress and empower.“Feminists were pretty isolated when it came to sexuality. And there was such an abusive history, they had such an adamant anti-sex point of view. And I wasn’t that kind of feminist,” Minter said. “Of course, my side won, so it doesn’t really matter. But I was ostracized at the time. It was really painful. Everyone wants to think that they’re communicating, and here I was making people run out of a room.” Now that explicit portrayals of feminine sexuality aren’t automatically considered derogatory, Minter’s work confronts another stigmatized medium of expression: the worlds of fashion and glamour. A series of paintings from the aughts picture close-ups of women’s eyes and lips, doused in paint, glitter, and imperfections.A woman with a dusting of red freckles and imperfectly plucked eyebrows wears aqueous-looking eye shadow, a blue-green sea twinkling across her lids. The juxtaposition of excessive beauty and human flaws paints a rich portrait of femininity.“Fashion and glamour is this billion-jillion dollar industry. It’s one of the only places where women have been able to create power structures in the world,” Minter said. “These are giant engines for the culture. And we have such contempt for them. It just never made sense to me.”So, Minter’s paintings and photographs, while highlighting bodily realities like pores and pimples, aren’t critiques of our product-fueled attempts to cover up blemishes, either. Ropes of pearls are shoved uncomfortably into mouths full of bleach-white teeth. Metallic paint drips from parted lips. In a photo of Tom Ford for New York Magazine, she captures the back of the designer’s neck, wet with unidentified moisture. Is it dew, or something more repellent, like sweat? The ambiguity, Minter explains, is part of the point.“Everything I do, I’m hoping that there are multiple reads. I’m never trying to tell you what to think as much as making a picture of that paradox,” she said. “I think what I do is just take what’s already there and push it to the extreme. Like with Tom Ford, he had $16,000 alligator shoes, and I just had him splashing in mud, because that’s real life. Even with very expensive shoes, you’re going to get them dirty on a rainy night. Everyone gets rained on.” Minter says the dueling imagery of glamour and gunk is captured by contemporary artists she admires, too. She cites K8 Hardy and Petra Collins as women whose aesthetic works with the same paradox.“It’s a backlash to this robotic, Photoshop bullshit. I love Alicia Keys not wearing any makeup on ‘The Voice.’ I love that there’s a backlash. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with trying to make yourself look as good as you can, but this constant grooming is just so time-consuming,” Minter said. “The models now, it’s so sad. They’re all anorexic. Or 15. Just these gawky, adolescent little babies. That kind of imposition, it’s so unhealthy. No pores. You can’t have any pores. Everyone has pores!”“Marilyn Minter: Pretty/Dirty” will be on view in the Brooklyn Museum’s Morris A. and Meyer Schapiro Wing from Nov. 4, 2016, through April 2, 2017. "
21,POLITICS,Supreme Court To Hear Key Dispute Over Transgender Rights In America,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-transgender-rights_us_5813a635e4b064e1b4b2664b,"The case centers around 17-year-old Gavin Grimm, who's been barred from using the boys' restroom at his school.",2016-10-28,"Gavin Grimm, 17, left, is photographed with his mom, Deirdre Grimm, in Gloucester, Virginia, on Aug. 21, 2016. The transgender teen has sued the Gloucester County School Board.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5813a67e170000aa025ba6e1.jpeg?cache=81EjzhdX4y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A short-handed Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear the case of a transgender student from Virginia who has been caught in a years-long battle over bathroom access at his local high school, where he is forbidden from using the boys’ restroom.The 17-year-old, Gavin Grimm, now stands to become the face of the so-called transgender bathroom wars, which have been raging in several courtrooms across the country as states and localities seek clarity on whether existing federal civil rights law requires them to accommodate trans students.“If the Supreme Court does take up my case, I hope the justices can see me and the rest of the transgender community for who we are — just people — and rule accordingly,” Grimm wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday.At its core, Gloucester County Board v. G.G. is a sex discrimination case, one in which the justices will have to determine how much leeway the Obama administration should be given to adopt an expansive reading of an anti-discrimination statute that doesn’t explicitly cover gender identity. Relying in part on a major appeals ruling in April favoring Grimm, the federal government has taken an aggressive stance to protect transgender students across the country ― issuing guidance to public schools on how to best make the school environment as inclusive and welcoming as possible to their needs.In that earlier ruling, an appeals court sided with Grimm and agreed that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ― which the U.S. Department of Education has interpreted to cover discrimination against transgender students ― meant the school could not relegate Grimm to a separate single-stall bathroom apart from other boys.The Gloucester County School Board had done exactly that in 2014, approving a policy that barred Grimm from the boys’ bathroom because he was not a “biological” male. This prompted the teen to partner with the American Civil Liberties Union and sue the school board, alleging that officials engaged in “sex” discrimination under the federal government’s interpretation of Title IX and related regulations.The Supreme Court will now decide if that interpretation is correct and potentially binding for schools nationwide.That’s very much an open question that’s still vexing states, parents and religious advocates in more conservative parts of the country, which have initiated litigation against the federal government for overstepping its authority under Title IX.In August, a federal judge in Texas agreed with a group of 13 states that sued over the transgender guidelines and issued an order prohibiting the Obama administration from enforcing them or threatening schools opposed to them with loss of federal funding. That ruling is now on appeal, as are lawsuits presenting related issues in Nebraska, North Carolina, Illinois, Minnesota and New Mexico, to name a few.The technical legal dispute that runs through these cases doesn’t fully capture the human toll the uncertainty can have on transgender students, including Grimm himself. Before the start of his senior year in September, the Supreme Court added to the teen’s stress when it put his April court victory on hold while it gave the school board an opportunity to file a formal appeal.Now that the appeal has been added to the court’s docket, Grimm will have to wait for many months ― possibly until June, when the court tends to issue a number of key rulings ― to know whether he’ll be able to use the boys’ restroom like other teens at his school.By the time he finds out, he may have already graduated. And the prospect of a 4-4 ruling, a likely outcome due to the current vacancy on the court, would leave in place the earlier appeals ruling but offer no guidance on similar disputes bubbling up in lower courts.In an interview with The Huffington Post earlier this month, while the court was still considering his school’s appeal, Grimm explained what he wanted the justices to learn about him.“I’d like them to know what kind of mental duress the situation has put me under, and how positive it would be for my mental health to go back to using the correct restroom,” he said.This story has been updated with more background about the Grimm case and similar cases nationwide."

While some celebrated the app by remembering the best Vines ever made, others praised Vine for the way it’s helped amplify the voices of countless marginalized people. In particular, many folks on Twitter noted how the end of Vine marks a severe blow to the creators of color who helped make the service what it was. Vine, which allowed users to make six-second video loops, was beloved by people everywhere ― but it held a particular importance for black people, who were among its most active users. The app, which was purchased by Twitter in 2014 and has an average of 200 million active monthly users, was dominated by millennials, many of them African-American. Users like King Bach and Alphacat and young funny women like Simone Shepherd are among the most popular black Viners, and the app gave them a reach that took their careers to a whole other level.Over the years, Vine grew into a sensational display of often startlingly funny videos. Black creators, who remain underrepresented in the entertainment industry, used the platform to show each other, and the world, just how many forms black creativity and black excellence could assume. Through humor and joy, Vine allowed users to redefine blackness on their own terms and through their own reflections; it allowed them to show off sides of the black experience that don’t usually make it to air on national TV.And when black people needed the world to see scenes of violence and injustice, Vine was there to help, serving as an invaluable communication tool during Black Lives Matter protests over the unjust killings of black men and women. Deray Mckesson, one of the movement’s more prominent activists, credited Vine this week for allowing him to share his experiences during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri.Chaz Smith, a widely popular black Viner and a former Huffington Post video host, said he appreciated the app for the way it let users broadcast silliness as well as seriousness to the world.“Vine was the perfect platform for making light of and finding humor in some very serious topics and situations affecting the black community in a very short amount of time, and that will definitely be missed,” he told HuffPost. However, Smith says other social media platforms, like YouTube and Instagram, also provide a space for the same influencers who thrived on Vine to share their work and expand their reach. “I believe that the transition to those platforms will be very smooth for many,” he said. Still, there was something about Vine that served as both an escape from and a response to the hostilities and dangers that people of color face every day. The contrast was especially clear when looking at some of the content that circulates on other social networks ― including Vine’s parent company, Twitter, which is letting users down with its haphazard approach to the ongoing problems of harassment, threats and hate speech.This, among other things, is what makes the news about Vine’s fate so sad to hear. Twitter, whose executive board is majority white, didn’t give any particular reason for discontinuing the app, but some have speculated it’s because Vine faced monetization issues. To be fair, in the 10 years it has existed, Twitter has helped African-Americans to share their own stories and to have a greater voice in the national dialogue. In many ways, this is what has allowed Black Twitter to reclaim the black narrative by ensuring that it is told by those who know it best. Vine was like this in many of the same ways. It became a space where black users helped to craft a cultural force that changed the way people created and consumed video content. Hannah Giorgis, a black journalist who now works at BuzzFeed, once wrote in The Guardian: If the most static characteristic of the internet itself is its malleability and Vine steers the influence engine that is social media, then the power of its trend-setting black users is particularly prescient. Black Viners have birthed countless memes and accompanying sociolinguistic phenomena, from “or nah” to “hoe don’t do it” to “do it for the vine”.Vine has boosted ― and, in some cases, made possible ― the careers of black creators who only needed a way to show the world their skills. And while there are other platforms that offer similar possibilities, Vine was made up of a vibrant community, mostly consisting of people of color, that helped to define its greatness. As journalist Goldie Taylor pointed out on Twitter Thursday, “Who you gone do it for, it you cain’t do it for the Vine?”"

Executing this extremely difficult task would involve figuring out how to transplant new neurons into brain tissue. But neurons form precise connections with each other, and are guided by physiological signals that are active during early brain development ― meaning that you can’t sow a fistful of new neurons into mature brain tissue and expect them to grow the way they should. But scientists are making progress.Embryonic neurons transplanted into the damaged brain of mice formed proper connections with their neighbors and restored function, researchers wrote in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.By the fourth week, the transplanted young cells became the type of cells normally seen in that area of the brain. They were functional and responded to visual signals from the eyes. Moreover, the cells didn’t develop aberrant connections, something that could lead to epileptic seizures.“What we did there is proof of concept,” said neuroscientist Magdalena Götz of Ludwig-Maximilians University and the Institute of Stem Cell Research at the Helmholtz Center in Munich, Germany. “We took the best type of neurons, chosen at a specific time, and then we put them in the lesioned brain,” she said. “That was to find out how well can it work.” The finding is an important step forward for someday repairing brain injury by using replacement neurons, other researchers said. Still, there are many challenges left. “I’m excited about this study,” said Sunil Gandhi of University of California, Irvine, who wasn’t involved with the research. “This is evidence that the brain can accept the addition of new neurons, which normally doesn’t happen. That’s very exciting for its potential for cell-based repair for brain.”But with complicated human biology comes complicated questions. What if the new cells become cancerous? What if the trauma of brain surgery causes more harm than the good a transplant might bring?“In the case of stroke, there are therapeutic avenues that involve behavioral rehabilitation that can help to some degree,” Gandhi said. “It is true that the options are limited and frustrating. But the alternative is that we may end up going too fast and have unwanted harmful side effects.”Neuroscientist Zhiping Pang, of Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, agreed.“This is absolutely an interesting and exciting paper,” he said. “Nevertheless, translating this to human stroke patients, safety will be a concern. A lot more work needs to be done, like the current study, before we can realize this exciting cell-replacement strategy in restoring proper brain functions of a stroke patient.”The new study is promising, Götz said, but acknowledged that things are a lot messier outside the lab. Injuries to the brain are not clean-cut. They can occur in various sites, involve different types of neurons, and are accompanied by inflammation and other meddling signals. But Götz is hopeful that these problems can be solved.“We are doing this now in more realistic models, in models of traumatic and ischemic brain injury and all I can say is that it looks pretty good,” she said.Another challenge is to account for glial cells in the brain, which form scar tissue when an injury happens. That’s why Götz and her team are exploring the potential for turning these glial cells into new neurons that can replace the lost ones.That approach could also solve the problem of supply, as using cells from fetuses is not a practical option for human patients.Some forms of neuron transplantation have been done before. People with Parkinson’s disease suffer from a death of dopamine-producing cells deep in the brain, and it’s possible to transplant into their brains new neurons that secrete dopamine and help with certain symptoms. These neurons, however, don’t need to become a part of the existing circuitry. They don’t even need to be human cells ― the first transplant of this kind was done using brain cells from pigs.Other groups have turned to induced pluripotent stem cells, or adults cells ― from a patient’s skin, for example ― that can be reprogrammed to an embryonic state and then directed to grow into a desired type of neuron. “What’s going to be important now is to demonstrate that neurons that are grown from pluripotent stem cells can be coaxed to wiring up into the brain,” Gandhi said.

But neurons form precise connections with each other, and are guided by physiological signals that are active during early brain development ― meaning that you can’t sow a fistful of new neurons into mature brain tissue and expect them to grow the way they should. But scientists are making progress.Embryonic neurons transplanted into the damaged brain of mice formed proper connections with their neighbors and restored function, researchers wrote in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.By the fourth week, the transplanted young cells became the type of cells normally seen in that area of the brain. They were functional and responded to visual signals from the eyes. Moreover, the cells didn’t develop aberrant connections, something that could lead to epileptic seizures.“What we did there is proof of concept,” said neuroscientist Magdalena Götz of Ludwig-Maximilians University and the Institute of Stem Cell Research at the Helmholtz Center in Munich, Germany. “We took the best type of neurons, chosen at a specific time, and then we put them in the lesioned brain,” she said. “That was to find out how well can it work.” The finding is an important step forward for someday repairing brain injury by using replacement neurons, other researchers said. Still, there are many challenges left. “I’m excited about this study,” said Sunil Gandhi of University of California, Irvine, who wasn’t involved with the research. “This is evidence that the brain can accept the addition of new neurons, which normally doesn’t happen. That’s very exciting for its potential for cell-based repair for brain.”But with complicated human biology comes complicated questions. What if the new cells become cancerous? What if the trauma of brain surgery causes more harm than the good a transplant might bring?“In the case of stroke, there are therapeutic avenues that involve behavioral rehabilitation that can help to some degree,” Gandhi said. “It is true that the options are limited and frustrating. But the alternative is that we may end up going too fast and have unwanted harmful side effects.”Neuroscientist Zhiping Pang, of Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, agreed.“This is absolutely an interesting and exciting paper,” he said. “Nevertheless, translating this to human stroke patients, safety will be a concern. A lot more work needs to be done, like the current study, before we can realize this exciting cell-replacement strategy in restoring proper brain functions of a stroke patient.”The new study is promising, Götz said, but acknowledged that things are a lot messier outside the lab. Injuries to the brain are not clean-cut. They can occur in various sites, involve different types of neurons, and are accompanied by inflammation and other meddling signals. But Götz is hopeful that these problems can be solved.“We are doing this now in more realistic models, in models of traumatic and ischemic brain injury and all I can say is that it looks pretty good,” she said.Another challenge is to account for glial cells in the brain, which form scar tissue when an injury happens. That’s why Götz and her team are exploring the potential for turning these glial cells into new neurons that can replace the lost ones.That approach could also solve the problem of supply, as using cells from fetuses is not a practical option for human patients.Some forms of neuron transplantation have been done before. People with Parkinson’s disease suffer from a death of dopamine-producing cells deep in the brain, and it’s possible to transplant into their brains new neurons that secrete dopamine and help with certain symptoms. These neurons, however, don’t need to become a part of the existing circuitry. They don’t even need to be human cells ― the first transplant of this kind was done using brain cells from pigs.Other groups have turned to induced pluripotent stem cells, or adults cells ― from a patient’s skin, for example ― that can be reprogrammed to an embryonic state and then directed to grow into a desired type of neuron. “What’s going to be important now is to demonstrate that neurons that are grown from pluripotent stem cells can be coaxed to wiring up into the brain,” Gandhi said.

27,POLITICS,Patagonia Is Completely Shutting Down For Election Day,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patagonia-election-day_us_5813af65e4b0390e69d04160,The outdoor apparel maker is pushing its customers to vote with environmental issues in mind.,2016-10-28,"Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard has described himself as a ""reluctant"" businessman, whose real passion lies in outdoor activities.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5813b98a17000006035ba732.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Patagonia said Friday it plans to shut down most of its operations on Nov. 8 in hopes of spurring its customers and employees to vote.The upscale outdoor gear giant, famous for its environmental activism, said it feared that voters turned off by this election’s vicious mudslinging would neglect to cast their ballots during a pivotal year in the battle against climate change. As such, the retailer plans to close all 29 stores across the country, as well as its headquarters, distribution and customer service centers. “During a time of catastrophic environmental crisis, when America needs strong leadership to confront the fundamental threat of climate change, voter turnout threatens to reach historic lows as people are turned off by the ugliness of politics,” Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario said in a statement. “As a business, we have a unique ability to take a stand and choose to prioritize the health of the planet over profit, and I think it’s important we take that opportunity when it truly matters.”The move expands on a marketing campaign, launched last month, called Vote The Planet. As part of the campaign, the company held voter registration rallies at its stores, where it began distributing voter guides detailing where local and national candidates stand on environmental issues. Patagonia also gave $200,000 to two nonprofits: NextGen Climate, founded by the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, and HeadCount, a group that registers voters at concerts. In all, the company said it spent more than $1 million this year hosting almost 60 events at its stores.Founded in 1973 by rock climber and environmentalist Yvon Chouinard, the privately held company has built its brand on sustainability, donating 1 percent of sales each year to green causes and urging customers to avoid waste by buying fewer of its items. The Ventura, California-based firm insists its efforts are nonpartisan. But given the Republican Party’s history of questioning the science behind climate change, Patagonia’s political stances appear to fall firmly on one side of the political divide. For the last 26 years, employees at the company have given a total of $51,122 to the Democratic Party, according data collected by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets project. The Republican Party received just one $500 donation in 1990. “We want to do everything possible to empower citizens to make their voices heard and elect candidates up and down the ballot who will protect our planet,” Marcario said.

Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and former Democratic President Bill Clinton. Thanks, guys!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5813b909150000b7005307ad.jpeg?cache=UgJrE6dOdG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The first U.S. presidential election to feature a woman nominee from a major party is being dominated by news of men behaving badly.On Friday, the FBI made a bombshell announcement: it had uncovered new emails relating to its earlier investigation of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Unconfirmed reports soon said the emails had been recovered from a device that belonged to former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged spouse of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI had been investigating Weiner, whose most recent scandal allegedly involves sexually explicit exchanges with an underage girl.It’s only the most recent news this month related to the sexual impropriety of a high-profile man. The first big October surprise was a 2005 hot mic recording of Donald Trump bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy,” aggressively kissing them and getting away with it because he’s a star. “This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago,” Trump said. “Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close.”Trump had already dredged up allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, but his damage control strategy after the tape came out was to dig even deeper. He invited Clinton’s accusers to the second presidential debate, including Juanita Broaddrick, who said Clinton raped her 1978.After Trump denied that he himself had committed sexual assault, more than a dozen women came forward to say he had, in fact, sexually assaulted them. Another accuser emerged this week, but the campaign has continued to deflect. Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich displayed the strategy in a Tuesday interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly, who had asked Gingrich about the assault accusations against Trump.Gingrich pivoted the conversation to Bill Clinton.“Do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator?” Gingrich said, refusing to be drawn on Trump. Hillary Clinton has not been accused of sexually assaulting or harassing anyone. Other than Trump’s offhand remark that he doesn’t “think she’s loyal to Bill,” she hasn’t been accused of sexual impropriety, either.Trump and his supporters say Bill Clinton’s bad behavior is fair game because she enabled his abuse. Trump also claimed that Hillary Clinton “viciously attacked” her husband’s accusers, but there’s no evidence that she did on any large scale. Most women voters are siding with Hillary Clinton. The gap between men and women in this year’s election could be the biggest it’s been in more than 60 years, thanks to a larger-than-normal split between men and women in favor of Democrats, according to FiveThirtyEight. As for Weiner, Abedin had stuck with him through several prior scandals, but the couple separated after the most recent sextings came to light in August. A year ago, Trump made what now seems like a prescient observation when he tweeted that Weiner was a “perv sleazebag” who could be a security risk. It seems like the FBI may agree. Either way, 2016 is definitely the “perv sleazebag” election. "

Its most recent report, filed with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, shows the group raised $18 million in the first 19 days of October. This is the super PAC’s last disclosure before the next month’s election, but it’s not the final total for the campaign.The record figure for Priorities USA Action continues the trend of escalating super PAC fundraising. But it’s the first time a group supporting a Democrat has claimed the title. Priorities USA Action’s haul tops 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s super PAC, Restore Our Future, which raised $154 million for the campaign that he lost to President Barack Obama. The third-largest sum raised by a super PAC in one election cycle was the $117 million collected by American Crossroads in 2012.Priorities USA Action has aided Clinton’s campaign in burying Republican nominee Donald Trump in a torrent of negative advertising. Clinton’s position in national and state polls are so good that Priorities USA Action, run by longtime Democratic operative Guy Cecil, has begun to attack down-ballot candidates in swing states. In the past week, the group has launched attack ads against Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) that tie them to Trump.Super PACs were created in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and a subsequent, related lower court ruling. Citizens United allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on elections so long as they were independent of candidates. The lower court ruling expanded this right to individuals, and the FEC followed up by allowing individuals to pool their unlimited contributions into political committees that came to be known as super PACs.These committees quickly became vehicles for candidates and political parties to collect unlimited contributions from the super rich. In this year’s election cycle through the end of August, donors giving more than $500,000 accounted for 74 percent of the $955 million raised by super PACs.Almost all of the money raised by Priorities USA Action has come from seven-figure donors. Of the group’s total $176 million haul, $157 million ― 89 percent ― has come from just 42 donors giving $1 million or more.The largest super PAC donor supporting Clinton’s election is hedge fund billionaire S. Donald Sussman. The Virgin Islands resident and longtime Democratic donor has put $20 million into Priorities USA Action so far this election. He recently told The Washington Post that his main goal in political giving is his deeply ironic desire to overturn Citizens United and its related decisions to get rid of super PACs.“It’s very odd to be giving millions when your objective is to actually get the money out of politics,” Sussman told The Washington Post. “I am a very strong supporter of publicly financed campaigns, and I think the only way to accomplish that is to get someone like Secretary Clinton, who is committed to cleaning up the unfortunate disaster created by the activist court in Citizens United.”Clinton, despite receiving the support of the record-setting Priorities USA Action, has endorsed campaign finance reforms that include a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and other campaign finance-related court rulings, public financing for congressional elections, and disclosure rules for politically active nonprofit groups.The hotel and real estate billionaires Jay and M.K. Pritzker combined to give more than $15 million to Priorities USA Action. Pro-Israel donors Haim and Cheryl Saban gave $10 million.Fred Eychaner, a media mogul and LGBTQ rights supporter, donated $10 million. The media-shy Democratic megadonor has been a major backer of the party’s super PACs. He hosted Clinton for at least one fundraiser this election.Other eight-figure donors to the super PAC were hedge fund billionaire James Simons and his wife Marilyn. The couple have also given $10 million to the group.Other top individual donors include George Soros ($9 million), S. Daniel Abraham ($9 million), Laure Woods ($5 million), Henry and Marsha Laufer ($5 million), Steve and Susan Mandel ($5 million), Dustin Moskovitz ($5 million), Herb Sandler ($4 million), David Shaw ($4 million), and Bernard Schwartz ($2.5 million).Clinton also has received super PAC support from labor unions. Working for Working Americans, a super PAC funded by a variety of unions, gave $5 million to Priorities USA Action. Other union contributions came from the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters ($4 million), Laborers International Union ($4 million), American Federation of Teachers ($2.5 million), International Union of Operating Engineers ($2 million), National Air Traffic Controllers ($1.85 million), Teamsters Union ($1.5 million) and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ($1 million).While super PACs are supposed to be independent from the candidates they support, the FEC’s lax interpretation of campaign finance law provides wide latitude for the groups to work with campaigns. This has certainly been the case for Priorities USA Action and the Clinton campaign.Priorities USA Action was founded in 2011 to help re-elect Obama, whose campaign initially was reluctant to embrace the unlimited money world created by the Citizens United decision. The president had criticized the Supreme Court decision in his 2010 State of the Union address. His team eventually came around and gave the group his blessing, even sending surrogates to help raise money.In 2014, the Clinton campaign-in-waiting took over the reins of Priorities USA Action from Obama’s allies. They began to work out what the future campaign could and could not do to support the super PAC’s efforts. Many of these deliberations are laid out in emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that were illegally hacked and posted online by Wikileaks, which opposes Clinton’s election.A memo prepared in March 2015 by Clinton and Priorities USA Action lawyer Marc Elias provided a detailed walkthrough of how the campaign’s surrogates could help raise money for the super PAC. The two big takeaways were: Whenever a campaign surrogate asks a donor for super PAC money, they must make a “hard ask” for a maximum contribution of $5,000. And if they make this “hard ask” then they can speak freely about the campaign’s support for the super PAC. A suggested line from memo reads, “We cannot win this election without [Preferred Super PAC]. You should support them.”The campaign had numerous top surrogates appear at Priorities USA Action events and place phone calls thanking donors for their super PAC support. After Clinton’s victory in the Iowa caucuses over her primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Podesta was given a donor call sheet that included three super PAC thank you calls. They were to go to top donor Sussman, Swanson Street Associates CEO Ken Goldenberg, and Laborers’ International Union President Terry O’Sullivan. Notes for these calls included the explanation that the Laborers’ Union was a supporter of repealing the so-called Cadillac health plan tax included in the Affordable Care Act.Finance director Dennis Cheng was also provided a list of Priorities USA Action donors to thank in August 2015. They included Trey Beck, a former managing director at hedge fund D.E. Shaw; James Pugh, a Florida developer; and Mike Roberts, a $50,000 donor who attended a Little Rock, Arkansas, super PAC fundraiser.The call list included talking points in case the donors asked questions about further super PAC donations. If the donor wanted to know how their donation will be spent, Cheng was to respond:“As you know, we cannot coordinate with Priorities on how they spend their funds. However, they have a demonstrated record of spending funds wisely to keep the White House in Democratic hands and I am confident that will be the case in 2016.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

His team eventually came around and gave the group his blessing, even sending surrogates to help raise money.In 2014, the Clinton campaign-in-waiting took over the reins of Priorities USA Action from Obama’s allies. They began to work out what the future campaign could and could not do to support the super PAC’s efforts. Many of these deliberations are laid out in emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that were illegally hacked and posted online by Wikileaks, which opposes Clinton’s election.A memo prepared in March 2015 by Clinton and Priorities USA Action lawyer Marc Elias provided a detailed walkthrough of how the campaign’s surrogates could help raise money for the super PAC. The two big takeaways were: Whenever a campaign surrogate asks a donor for super PAC money, they must make a “hard ask” for a maximum contribution of $5,000. And if they make this “hard ask” then they can speak freely about the campaign’s support for the super PAC. A suggested line from memo reads, “We cannot win this election without [Preferred Super PAC]. You should support them.”The campaign had numerous top surrogates appear at Priorities USA Action events and place phone calls thanking donors for their super PAC support. After Clinton’s victory in the Iowa caucuses over her primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Podesta was given a donor call sheet that included three super PAC thank you calls. They were to go to top donor Sussman, Swanson Street Associates CEO Ken Goldenberg, and Laborers’ International Union President Terry O’Sullivan. Notes for these calls included the explanation that the Laborers’ Union was a supporter of repealing the so-called Cadillac health plan tax included in the Affordable Care Act.Finance director Dennis Cheng was also provided a list of Priorities USA Action donors to thank in August 2015. They included Trey Beck, a former managing director at hedge fund D.E. Shaw; James Pugh, a Florida developer; and Mike Roberts, a $50,000 donor who attended a Little Rock, Arkansas, super PAC fundraiser.The call list included talking points in case the donors asked questions about further super PAC donations. If the donor wanted to know how their donation will be spent, Cheng was to respond:“As you know, we cannot coordinate with Priorities on how they spend their funds. However, they have a demonstrated record of spending funds wisely to keep the White House in Democratic hands and I am confident that will be the case in 2016.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

31,POLITICS,Clarence Thomas On Supreme Court Gridlock: Washington ‘Is Broken In Some Ways’,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-broken_us_58120e00e4b064e1b4b0b913,The 68-year-old justice offered Republicans in Congress a lesson on how to do your job.,2016-10-27,"“You took an oath to show fidelity to the Constitution, you live up to it,” Justice Clarence Thomas said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581210a3170000b0005ba165.jpeg?ops=crop_0_446_2259_1474%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Justice Clarence Thomas gave a frank assessment Wednesday of how he feels about the political standoff over Supreme Court confirmations ― a subject that has gripped Washington since the death of his close friend Justice Antonin Scalia.Thomas said “there’s always hope” to fix the process, which has been at a standstill for more than seven months since President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat.But Thomas’ outlook was grim, even as he offered pointed remarks that could be read as a veiled rebuke of Republicans who seem intent on hamstringing an entire branch of the federal government.“This city is broken in some ways,” he told a group of supporters at the Heritage Foundation, which hosted a conversation with the justice on the occasion of his 25 years of service on the nation’s highest court.The 68-year-old justice did not directly address the Garland gridlock, which is breaking historical records since Senate Republicans vowed in February to not grant any hearings to any of Obama’s nominees.But echoing remarks last week by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, he said that his work at the nation’s high court struck a different tone ― providing him an opportunity to talk and reason and disagree with his colleagues and still do the work he’s been called to do. “I think that we have decided that rather than confronting the disagreements and the differences of opinion, we’ll just simply annihilate the person who disagrees with me,” Thomas said, in an apparent nod to dysfunction elsewhere in Washington. “I don’t think that’s going to work. I don’t think that’s going to work in a republic or in a civil society.”His remarks came just as Republicans are signaling that they might be willing to go to war over future Supreme Court nominees with Hillary Clinton, who is leading in the polls and is likely to make a number of appointments if elected president.One of the senators floating an even longer blockade was Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a fan of Thomas’ who on Wednesday indicated he might be open to leaving the high court understaffed for a while longer.Might Thomas agree with further obstruction?“At some point,” the justice said in the same segment, “we have got to recognize that we’re destroying our institutions and we’re undermining our institutions. And we’re going to destroy them. The day is going to come, if it’s not already here, that we’ll need the institutions and the integrity of the institutions.”Since Scalia’s death, the Supreme Court has done its part to keep its distance from the political fray ― going about its daily work of hearing cases, issuing rulings and reaching compromise whenever possible to avoid 4-to-4 splits.That hasn’t always been possible, and sometimes the decision-making does reflect sharp differences among the justices. But Thomas said the court is doing its part to “earn” the confidence of the public by upholding the oath they once made.“You took an oath to show fidelity to the Constitution, you live up to it,” he said. “You took an oath to judge people impartially, you live up to it. Yeah, in this city, this doesn’t go for much. You take heat for it or whatever. But that’s part of the job. You’re supposed to be beaten for it. You’re supposed to do your job.”"

The “Last Week Tonight” host spoke at the gala, which honored filmmaker Dawn Porter and author Isabel Allende.To kick things off, he greeted the crowd with a reference to the third presidential debate, saying, “Good evening, gentlemen and nasty women,” garnering cheers from the crowd. With his trademark intelligent wit and humor, Oliver also addressed The Donald’s views on abortion and women’s rights. During the final debate, the GOP presidential candidate claimed, “In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.” In response to Trump’s rhetoric, Oliver had this to say: “His discussion of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of women’s bodies and a very poor sense of grammar as well, so I guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. If you ask Donald Trump to draw a fallopian tube, I cannot imagine what you would get back, other than a child’s drawing of a cobra.”We couldn’t have said it better ourselves.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
33,ENTERTAINMENT,How Really Bad CGI Almost Ruined '80s Disney Horror Flick 'Watcher In The Woods',Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/really-bad-cgi-watcher-in-the-woods-disney-horror_us_57ffc2cde4b0e8c198a6b7d5,"We'll never forget NERAK, though.",2016-10-27,"Starring Carroll Baker, Bette Davis and Lynn-Holly Johnson.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5812225c17000070005ba1b4.jpeg?cache=oPEbXCinOl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1980, a New York press screening of Disney’s horror “The Watcher in the Woods,” starring Bette Davis, ended in near laughter. A bad sign, executives knew, even for a scary movie for kids. The company immediately pulled the film and set about trying to fix it. But what was wrong with it?As a creepy live-action flick, “The Watcher in the Woods” was a departure for Disney at a time when it wasn’t producing very many of what would become its classics. Based on the Florence Engel Randall novel A Watcher in the Woods and directed by John Hough, it featured Lynn-Holly Johnson as Jan Curtis, who moves into an appropriately ancient English mansion with her parents and sister, Ellie, played by Kyle Richards. Next door is the strange old Mrs. Aylwood (Davis), whose daughter Karen mysteriously disappeared years ago.Jan notices horrifying things around the house. She sees glowing shapes and a zombie-like blindfolded girl in mirrors, which then shatter. Meanwhile, her young sister begins acting possessed. Ellie writes “NERAK” on the inside of a dirty window, claiming it’s the name of her new puppy, but, from the other side, it gives townies who read “KAREN” a fright. Eventually Jan learns that Karen disappeared after a seance performed during an eclipse by her now middle-aged friends ― swapping her, somehow, with an entity from another dimension. She reckons she can reverse the process by repeating it, and, in the end, Karen is freed.So, again, what was the problem? (Aside from the whole NERAK bit?) Aliens. Aliens were the problem.While we weren’t able to get in touch with Hough, we did track down an out-of-production copy of “The Watcher in the Woods” with his director’s commentary. In the film shot by Hough, Karen is taken by an alien (the “Watcher”). When Jan saves her, the monster envelops her in its batty wings and zips off to another world ― except Jan is allowed to come back with Karen. According to the director, though, the quality of animation (involving computerized graphics and what looks like an animatronic contraption) was unforgivable.“The animation was out of my control. I had no say,” Hough says.“The last four minutes undid all the good work of the previous 87 minutes when the monster came out,” he continues. “It moved in a very stiff way, and it really wasn’t up to what we were later going to see in later films.”We’d have to agree:Yikes.When the monster showed up onscreen looking like shredded trash bags hot-glued to a Halloween mask, Hough says that “everybody started laughing, practically” in the New York theater. And so a new ending was shot with fewer special effects. (Even that wasn’t so simple; producers had to choose from over 100 other options.) In the ending that aired in select theaters the following year, the Watcher is a vague entity that appears as a burst of bright light.“It’s a pity. The other ending was far more interesting,” Hough says.The film had other problems, though. According to Hough, Disney executives considered the entire original film “too dark and threatening and black.” They hired another screenwriter, Rosemary Anne Sisson, to lighten the mood, and the result is a jumbled mix of horror tropes ― creepy house, creepy woods, the occult, a crusty caretaker of sorts ― that feels wonderfully out of place in Disney’s cinematic record.We’re not mad about it. We’re just glad that movie graphics has come a long, long way.Hit Backspace for a regular dose of pop culture nostalgia. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581240b3190000b800c2f673.jpeg?cache=DO7kYnMiEF&ops=crop_0_499_1312_950%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"America’s oldest brewery has come under fire from a number of customers and a local politician after its owner voiced his support for Donald Trump. On Monday, Dick Yuengling Jr. told Trump’s son, Eric, that he and his employees were “behind” the Republican nominee, the Reading Eagle reports. The remarks came after Eric Trump toured D.G. Yuengling & Son’s brewery in Pottsville, Pennsylvania while campaigning on behalf of his father. “We need him in there,” Yuengling reportedly told Trump during the tour.News of Yuengling’s endorsement infuriated some patrons, who took to Twitter and other social media outlets to express their distaste for the move. Among them was Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia), who called himself a “former customer” and blasted the brewery for using “my dollars to bolster a man, and an agenda, that wants to punish me for being a member of the LGBT community and punish the black and brown members of my community for not being white” in an Oct. 26 Facebook post.Later on Wednesday, Sims posted a photo of the brewery’s owner posing with Eric Trump on Facebook, accompanied by a caption asking Philadelphia’s gay-owned establishments to boycott Yuengling products. “Our communities know a thing or two about voting with our dollars,” Sims, who became his state’s first openly gay elected state legislator in 2012, wrote in the post, “and I won’t be using my hard-earned dollars to give power to any company or person who hates me.”The Democrat elaborated further in an email sent to The Huffington Post, saying that like all Americans, Yuengling is entitled to support the presidential candidate of his choice, but that customers “have just as much of a right, perhaps an obligation, to decide if we agree and want to continue funding it.” “In the era of Hobby Lobby and Citizen’s United, dollars that we spend now have the potential to be used against our interests and our values,” he said Thursday. “Why would anyone give money to a company that would pass it along to those who want to strip them of their rights, torture their children, belittle their family members and neighbors, or denigrate their relationships?” Whether or not the boycott will succeed remains to be seen. For now, however, those soured by Yuengling’s Trump endorsement can look to Philadelphia-based blog Billy Penn, which has compiled a comprehensive list of brews that have thus far steered relatively clear of politics. There’s also Bud Light, which celebrated the one-year anniversary of marriage equality in the U.S. with a cheeky commercial starring Seth Rogen and Amy Schumer in June.

The 19-year-old isn’t all that interested in politics, although he follows the news on Twitter and sometimes watches clips of debates on YouTube. But he couldn’t not vote, especially this year, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. And especially since Erika has been pestering him about it for months. “For the past week, it’s probably been every day,” he said at their house in North Las Vegas ahead of the early voting period in Nevada, which began Oct. 22.Erika and their parents are undocumented. They moved to the U.S. from Mexico when Erika was 3 years old ― she’s 27 now ― before Alejandro was born. Erika is allowed to work and obtain a driver’s license under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which Trump has promised to strip from people like her. Erika, like other undocumented immigrants, can’t vote. But she can have an effect on the election anyway, in the same way other undocumented immigrants are ― organizing, knocking on doors and making smaller-scale efforts, like urging U.S. citizen friends and family to take advantage of their right to vote. Nevada is a prime location for this. With an estimated 210,000 unauthorized immigrants, it doesn’t have the largest undocumented population in the country ― California, for example, has more than 10 times that number. But undocumented immigrants in Nevada make up the largest proportion of the population of any state, at 7 percent to California’s 6 percent. California isn’t a swing state; Nevada is. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Trump in Nevada by only about 2.5 points, according to HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates publicly available polls.Alejandro is supporting Clinton, who has vowed to protect and expand DACA, along with pushing for a path to citizenship for other undocumented immigrants. “I vote because I know it’s important because of my parents,” he said. “I do it for my parents.” Erika and Alejandro live with their mother in a two-story house with a Spanish tile roof and a small backyard. They have a big age gap and different interests ― Erika likes to hike and be outdoors, while Alejandro prefers going online and watching TV ― but largely similar lives. They both attend a nearby community college, and spend a lot of time with their family. The biggest divide between the two is over immigration status. Erika has known something was going on with her family since she was 6 or 7 years old, when she, her mother and her aunt were walking home past a 7-Eleven and saw Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detaining an older man wearing work clothes. Her mother froze and started to cry. Her aunt, who had a work permit, told them to run home, and they did.It really hit Erika when she started high school that she was undocumented. One of her friends was also undocumented, but they didn’t talk about it much. They were too ashamed. It affected her life in other ways, too ― when she tried to enroll in college several years ago, a staffer told her inaccurately that she wasn’t allowed to because of her immigration status. She and her parents didn’t talk about their immigration status much around Alejandro, but he figured it out around sixth grade, and then realized the significance and that he could lose his parents a couple of years later. He feels bad sometimes that Erika’s potential is held back by her undocumented status and his isn’t. She gets frustrated by the same. “Sometimes it’s hard,” she said. “It’s hard because even though he understands, he can still go about his life. .... We’re the same, but he’s a citizen and I’m not. I think that’s the hardest part.” Thanks to DACA, Erika is able to do many of the things she hoped for: she has a full-time job at a nonprofit, and attends school full time at a community college. Alejandro goes to the same community college part time.But there are still things Alejandro can do that Erika can’t. Their uncle’s wife in Mexico was very sick over the summer and they wanted to go visit. DACA recipients can get permission to leave the country under certain circumstances, but Erika wasn’t granted it in time. Their aunt died, and Alejandro traveled to visit their family and attend the funeral without his sister. Erika is able to participate in the election, sort of, through Alejandro, although she doesn’t dictate how he votes. She told him about when she went to a Trump rally last December out of curiosity, and the rally ended up in the news after an audience member shouted “Light the motherfucker on fire!” as security guards removed a protester from the event.They also discuss the presidential debates, including the one in Las Vegas last week, which Erika watched from a party where Clinton ended up making a surprise appearance. Erika got to shake her hand and told her she did a great job at the debate.Earlier this year, Erika took Alejandro to the polls for the Nevada primary. She was excited to see it, but it was also a little hard.“I was emotional because it was his first time voting, and also because I wished I could vote, but I couldn’t,” she said. “Being so close but still so far.” HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Orlando’s Amway Center, the Magic’s home arena, is located less than two miles from the gay club where 49 people were killed and 53 were injured on June 12 by an American-born gunman who had pledged allegiance to ISIS. The Magic announced this month that the team would dedicate its home opener to Pulse victims. Magic CEO Alex Martins predicted before the game that fans were in for an emotional evening. ``Quite frankly, I will be shocked if there’s a dry eye in the house,’’ he told OrlandoMagic.com, adding that he expected the ceremony to include around 300 survivors, family members of victims and first responders.During warmups, Magic players took to the court wearing #OrlandoUnited shirts with rainbow heart logos.Martins said prior to Wednesday’s game that he was proud of how the Orlando community quickly rallied after the shooting to show that love will prevail in the face of hatred.``This was an event that shook our community and shook our country ― we’re talking about the largest mass shooting in the history of our country,’’ Martins told OrlandoMagic.com. “So it shook our community, but it also brought our community together. I think tonight will be symbolic of how our community has come together since then and how it continues to remember those who were the most impacted.”The team and the family of billionaire team owner Richard DeVos earlier donated $500,000 to the OneOrlando Fund, a nonprofit established to assist victims’ families.DeVos’ donation was met with backlash from those who pointed to his long history of supporting anti-LGBTQ efforts.The Magic lost Wednesday’s game to the Miami Heat, 108-96.

Human beings can easily match patterns and identify outliers that can be difficult if not impossible to teach machines to do.Hansen added how important it’s been having private citizens uncovering new spider regions on Mars.“We have new findings and new questions to answer, thanks to all the help from volunteers.”If you’re interested in participating in this Martian research, register at the Planet Four: Terrains site and start looking for spiders!

Some flat-out refuse to participate, and one group of creationists is even urging followers to hand out fake dollar bills that tell trick-or-treaters they’re going to hell.But at least one expert in evil spirits says there’s nothing to worry about. Father Vincent Lampert, a Vatican-trained exorcist, told Catholic Online that it’s fine to celebrate Halloween.“Ultimately I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the kids putting on a costume, dressing up as a cowboy or Cinderella, and going through the neighborhood and asking for candy; that’s all good clean fun,” Lampert told the website. The one caveat? The faithful shouldn’t glorify evil or practice witchcraft, even as a joke, he said.“(T)hat would be the danger of Halloween that somehow God is lost in all of this, the religious connotation is lost and then people end up glorifying evil,” he was quoted as saying. Lampert’s comments weren’t inconsistent with Catholic teaching; to date, the Vatican has not taken a formal position for or against Halloween. While anthropologists trace the origins of Halloween to Samhain, a Celtic harvest celebration that dates back some 2,000 years, the Catholic Church lays claim to at least some parts of the holiday. All Saint’s Day was established in the 7th century as a celebration of the saints. Originally in May, the holiday was eventually moved to Nov. 1 with another celebration, All Hallows’ Eve, taking place the night before. The change of date also caused the holiday to overlap with Samhain. It’s believed that some of the Samhain traditions remained even as some of the celebrants turned to Christianity. That amalgamation eventually helped to shape the modern Halloween. "
41,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Has A New Plan To Combat The Bullying Spurred By Donald Trump,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-bullying_us_581222a8e4b0390e69ce8574,Teachers say that Donald's Trump campaign has led to an increase in school bullying. Hillary Clinton has a plan to change that.,2016-10-27,Hillary Clinton at a rally in Florida in late October. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When New Hampshire educator Anne McQuade’s refugee and immigrant students first arrive in America, she says they are “hopeful.” They’ve been told about the American dream, and its ideas of opportunity and social mobility contrast the violent, war-torn countries they are often fleeing.But lately, these students haven’t received the warm welcome they expect. Because of Republican nominee Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant and Islamophobic rhetoric, children are fearful that their family members will be deported or their new country will ban Muslims from entering, said McQuade. After getting off the bus recently, one of her young Muslim students was yelled at by a community member who told the student to “go home, you terrorist.”McQuade, who spoke to reporters while on a call for the Hillary Clinton campaign, says she has witnessed an increase in racially and ethnically charged bullying as a result of Trump’s campaign. Other educators have too. Teachers around the country recently reported more vicious and divisive schoolyard bullying in a paper compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The report calls the increase the “Trump Effect,” positing that the Republican nominee’s divisive rhetoric is impacting how children treat each other.Clinton announced Thursday that she is invested in fighting this effect. She revealed a new initiative that would provide federal money for states to help combat bullying.The plan, called “Better Than Bullying,” would give $500 million in new money to states that develop comprehensive anti-bullying plans, which should address issues like cyberbullying and provide resources for children who have been harassed or victimized.“Hillary believes that no child should face bullying or harassment, and she believes we all have a responsibility to our kids to act,” Clinton senior policy advisor Maya Harris said on the call. Clinton discussed the plan at a rally in North Carolina on Thursday, while appearing with first lady Michelle Obama. “We have to make sure all our kids know America has a place for you. The American dream is big enough for you,” said Clinton at the rally in Winston-Salem. “I can’t think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our children knows they are loved just as they are.”As part of this initiative, states could get $4 for every $1 of new money invested in fighting bullying. While 49 states currently have anti-bullying laws, most are not comprehensive, said Clinton policy advisor Corey Ciorciari. Data from the U.S. Department of Education shows that rates of school-based bullying have dropped in recent years. But as a result of the Trump Effect, these numbers could be on the rise, said Tony Coelho, former chairman of the President’s Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities.“All of a sudden we have a national figure, who is bullying, who is mocking, who is doing all these things,” Coelho said on the call.McQuade, who teaches English-language learners in Manchester, a federally mandated refugee relocation site, said the data has not yet caught up to what is taking place in schools and communities. “These kids come to our country to find a better life, and we say, ‘Welcome to America,’ and then they watch television and they’re exposed to angry social media that sends a different message,” McQuade said. “Children, I believe, should be focusing on adjusting to the new country, not worrying about being deported or having a father disappear.”The nation’s largest teachers union, which has endorsed Clinton, swiftly put out a statement supporting the initiative.“Like our educators, Hillary Clinton understands that kindness, collaboration and cooperation are important in school and in life,” said National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García in a statement. “The rise in vitriolic speech in classrooms and the anxiety created by Donald Trump illustrate that students need this support now more than ever.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The Republican presidential nominee has refused to say whether he will accept the results of the election on Nov. 8, and he’s encouraged his supporters to sign up as poll observers on Election Day to help him “stop Crooked Hillary from rigging this election.”Although voter fraud is extremely rare, Trump’s claims have resonated with many of his supporters. In Louisiana, voting officials have been inundated with calls and emails from outraged residents who demand explanations for the real estate mogul’s claims.“We have never seen this amount of calls. We spend an inordinate amount of time … responding to people,” Republican Tom Schedler, secretary of state for Louisiana, said at an event hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center on Thursday.Schedler said he and his staff are pulled away from their work daily to address concerns about a rigged system.“There is no validity to that whatsoever,” he said.“Unfortunately, most people we’re responding to, it makes no difference what you show them to debunk the theory — they don’t believe it,” Schedler added. “It has been floated around dominantly by the conservative side, and this has caused a lot of disruption in the voting place.”Both Schedler and Natalie Tennant, secretary of state for West Virginia, are eager to explain to voters why and how outside influence is virtually impossible in this election, but it’s a tough task to take on when the GOP nominee urges his supporters to distrust everyone who says otherwise, including leaders in his own party.“[We] explain and give you the facts and processes, but there are going to be talking heads at rallies that say, ‘The elections are rigged,’” said Tennant, who is a Democrat. “It’s going to negate everything we’ve done. Define ‘rigged’ for me.”Both Schedler and Tennant said they have done everything they can to maintain the integrity of the elections in their states. In Louisiana, the state’s 10,000 voting machines are stored in 64 warehouses “under lock and key and camera,” Schedler said, adding that it would take an extremely time-intensive, sophisticated operation to hack into their system. The hackers would also have to accomplish the task undetected. “It would be easier to get them engaged to go vote to change the outcome of the election,” he said.During voting, no one can hack into the machines themselves, Tennant said, because the machines are not connected to the internet or to each other.Still, recent cyberattacks in Florida, Illinois and Arizona have only added to the anxiety surrounding Election Day. During the attacks — which federal investigators have attributed to Russian hackers in at least one case — the personal data of tens of thousands of voters were likely stolen. That said, both states will have heightened security on Election Day, and officials will be on high alert. Tennant urged voters to trust American democracy and their state officials instead of “taking it into your own hands.”“It has not been fun doing this,” Schedler said. “It’s a time-consuming issue, and this has been off the charts. I’ve never seen an election like this, and I never want to see another election like this, quite frankly.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-clemency-drug-sentences_us_581256dee4b064e1b4b149b3,Obama's clemency total now stands at 872.,2016-10-27,"President Barack Obama wielded his clemency powers on Oct. 6 as part of his end-of-term push to spur action on criminal justice reform, offering 102 federal inmates the chance to leave prison early. He reduced the sentences of 98 others this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama commuted the sentences of 98 federal prisoners on Thursday, meaning he has shortened the sentences of 872 individuals over the course of his presidency.The individuals granted clemency on Thursday were imprisoned for drug crimes. Dozens of them had been sentenced to life imprisonment, meaning they would have died behind bars without Obama’s intervention.The president reduced the sentences of 102 inmates earlier this month, which brought his total clemency number to 774. He had granted clemency to 214 federal prisoners in early August and another 111 inmates in late August, shortening the sentences of 325 people in a single month. With Thursday’s announcement, he has now commuted 200 sentences in the month of October.Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said Thursday’s announcement was “part of our ongoing commitment to bring fairness” to the criminal justice system. “These grants reflect the Department’s accelerated progress in prioritizing and reviewing petitions that fit the President’s Clemency Initiative. As we’ve said before, the Department of Justice remains committed to reviewing and providing a recommendation on every petition submitted by August 31 of this year that involves a drug crime. And we will continue to prioritize the review any drug related petitions that have been submitted since that time,” Yates said.Jessica Jackson Sloan, national director of #cut50, a criminal justice reform initiative that seeks to reduce the incarcerated population in the U.S. by 50 percent over a decade, applauded Obama’s announcement but said it was “imperative” that he keep the promise he made to those “serving unjust and overly harsh sentences” for drug offenses.“While today’s announcement means some families will be made whole, many more petitioners were denied ― the vast majority denied with no explanation,” Sloan said. “The clemency process is sorely lacking in transparency ― with little regard for the emotional impact these decisions have on individuals and their families. For those who were neither denied, nor granted mercy, time is running out. Each passing day brings heightened desperation and anxiety. Some are beginning to lose hope as the clock continues to tick.”As The Huffington Post has reported, the Obama administration’s clemency initiative has fallen short of expectations: While the number of commutations granted during the Obama administration are historic, many advocates had hoped that thousands of individuals would be granted clemency under the initiative, which is aimed at shortening lengthy drug sentences that were often a result of federal mandatory minimums. Former Attorney General Eric Holder has said he expected as many as 10,000 prisoners to be granted clemency. Rachel Barkow, a New York University professor, told The Huffington Post that around 1,500 federal prisoners met the criteria that the Obama administration laid out for the initiative. Still, Thursday’s announcement was huge for federal prisoners lucky enough to be granted their freedom, especially those who had expected to die in prison. HuffPost reported on how some of them reacted in June:Jason Hernandez, whose life sentence was commuted in 2013, told HuffPost that he’d been worried he’d find out a family member had died when he was summoned to the warden’s office. Instead, he was told the good news.Brittany K. Byrd, campaign manager for #cut50, hoped the announcement was a sign of more movement in the final months of Obama’s presidency.“I can only hope that there’s more to come, because there are so many more people that are very deserving,” Byrd said. “It was a wonderful day for those 98 and their families, and I’m super happy about that, but there are a lot more to go. But it is hopeful.”Many of those granted clemency on Thursday are now scheduled to be released in 2017 and 2018, but others have additional years left on their sentences. For example, one man’s 2008 life sentence was shortened to 30 years in prison, meaning he still has two decades left until his release."

A typical Pashtun market, with everything from sides of mutton to secondhand clothes, it has a half-dozen men for every woman, most of whom are dressed in so-called “shuttlecock” burkas.Increasingly, there are fewer men or women at the bazaar. Regulars say trade is down by half in the past six months as hundreds of thousands of Afghans – its main customers – leave Pakistan ahead of a government deadline to return home, regardless of conditions in Afghanistan.The drop in trade is clear at Imran’s burka shop, where the full-length garments hang from three walls in a mix of greens, blues and blacks – some embroidered, others plain.“I pay 20,000 rupees ($200) as the [monthly] rent for my shop. During the good times, I could earn as much as 45,000 rupees ($450) but now my sales won’t even cross the 20,000 mark,” said Imran, an Afghan with refugee status in Pakistan.Unable to afford the rent for the first time in the 20 years he has been in business, Imran said he has no choice but to cross the border. He plans to move to Jalalabad, the first city on the Afghan side, but admitted he has never been there.“My reason to move is not just about the financial losses,” Imran added. “Police have been harassing me continuously for the past many weeks.”His daily commute has come to include a gauntlet of questions from police. Even though he has a valid identification card, he is asked about his business, his movements and what he knows about the activity of terror groups. Imran said he feels like a suspect.“It’s like living in a country as a third-grade citizen,” he complained.Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring group, has condemned the treatment of Afghan refugees.“Pakistani authorities are increasingly committing abuses against Afghan refugees that are triggering a mass refugee return,” said Patricia Gossman, a researcher with the group. “The government should rein in its abusive security forces and ensure the refugees secure status and protection.”Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) is caught between criticizing overt harassment of refugees and seeking to avoid offending authorities in Pakistan while negotiations over extending the deadline for returns are ongoing.The UNHCR admitted earlier this year that a “concerted push from the Pakistan government” to repatriate Afghan refugees was underway. In August, UNHCR spokesperson Duniya Aslam Khan told local media that they were receiving reports of harassment, mainly from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, which includes Peshawar.The agency is also providing legal aid to registered Afghan refugees being detained illegally by the police under their Advice and Legal Aid (AlAC) Program, partnering with Pakistan’s Society for Human Rights and Prisoners’ Aid (SHARP).At the same time, the UNHCR’s representative in Pakistan, Indrika Ratwatte, paid tribute to the country, calling it “an exemplary host” in a recent interview.The UNHCR has facilitated the repatriation of more than 4 million Afghans since 2002. According to the agency’s own data, some 217,000 Afghan refugees have been voluntarily sent back to Afghanistan in 2016. An average of 4,500 Afghans left Pakistan every day during September, compared to 2,400 who left during the whole of September last year.The first port of call for Afghans who have decided to go home is one of the UNHCR’s repatriation centers, which have seen a huge increase in demand. U.N. officials insist the rush is the result of stricter border policies by Pakistan, plus a doubling of the cash grant from $200 to $400 for refugees who agree to voluntary repatriation.However, many of the hundreds of Afghans waiting outside Chamkani, the repatriation center nearest Peshawar, took a different view.“The cash grant by UNHCR has been increased from $200 to $400 but is that enough for a man to start a new life in a totally foreign country?” asked Asadullah, a young Afghan man who is going to Afghanistan for the first time.Shahzeb, a father of two who was born in Pakistan, finds talk of voluntary repatriation to be ridiculous: “We have been given an ultimatum to leave the country; the police are harassing us – do we have any other option?”Fear is a greater driver than cash, even according to the refugee agency’s own survey of sentiment among returnees. U.N. researchers found that 31 percent of respondents said “fear of arrest or deportation” was the main “push factor” compared to just 15 percent who cited economic reasons. In the same survey, fewer than one in 10 refugees cited the UNHCR grant as a “pull factor” drawing them to Afghanistan.Even among those who have chosen to leave there is anger at the way their departure is being handled. To get the cash, refugees must first cross the border and then attempt to claim the UNHCR grant, leading many Afghans to complain of having to borrow money to arrange proper transport.The response from many U.N. officials echoes their prioritization of returns over all else.“If we give them the money, here in Pakistan, they might not return to Afghanistan at all,” said Samad Khan, a spokesman for UNHCR Peshawar. “The grant is an incentive for them to go back to Afghanistan; transporters know that Afghans are being given the money once they return, so they are more than happy to carry them from Pakistan and get paid in Afghanistan.”Nabi Jan Orakzai also contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

In August, UNHCR spokesperson Duniya Aslam Khan told local media that they were receiving reports of harassment, mainly from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, which includes Peshawar.The agency is also providing legal aid to registered Afghan refugees being detained illegally by the police under their Advice and Legal Aid (AlAC) Program, partnering with Pakistan’s Society for Human Rights and Prisoners’ Aid (SHARP).At the same time, the UNHCR’s representative in Pakistan, Indrika Ratwatte, paid tribute to the country, calling it “an exemplary host” in a recent interview.The UNHCR has facilitated the repatriation of more than 4 million Afghans since 2002. According to the agency’s own data, some 217,000 Afghan refugees have been voluntarily sent back to Afghanistan in 2016. An average of 4,500 Afghans left Pakistan every day during September, compared to 2,400 who left during the whole of September last year.The first port of call for Afghans who have decided to go home is one of the UNHCR’s repatriation centers, which have seen a huge increase in demand. U.N. officials insist the rush is the result of stricter border policies by Pakistan, plus a doubling of the cash grant from $200 to $400 for refugees who agree to voluntary repatriation.However, many of the hundreds of Afghans waiting outside Chamkani, the repatriation center nearest Peshawar, took a different view.“The cash grant by UNHCR has been increased from $200 to $400 but is that enough for a man to start a new life in a totally foreign country?” asked Asadullah, a young Afghan man who is going to Afghanistan for the first time.Shahzeb, a father of two who was born in Pakistan, finds talk of voluntary repatriation to be ridiculous: “We have been given an ultimatum to leave the country; the police are harassing us – do we have any other option?”Fear is a greater driver than cash, even according to the refugee agency’s own survey of sentiment among returnees. U.N. researchers found that 31 percent of respondents said “fear of arrest or deportation” was the main “push factor” compared to just 15 percent who cited economic reasons. In the same survey, fewer than one in 10 refugees cited the UNHCR grant as a “pull factor” drawing them to Afghanistan.Even among those who have chosen to leave there is anger at the way their departure is being handled. To get the cash, refugees must first cross the border and then attempt to claim the UNHCR grant, leading many Afghans to complain of having to borrow money to arrange proper transport.The response from many U.N. officials echoes their prioritization of returns over all else.“If we give them the money, here in Pakistan, they might not return to Afghanistan at all,” said Samad Khan, a spokesman for UNHCR Peshawar. “The grant is an incentive for them to go back to Afghanistan; transporters know that Afghans are being given the money once they return, so they are more than happy to carry them from Pakistan and get paid in Afghanistan.”Nabi Jan Orakzai also contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

U.S. IS “GREAT POWER”“It’s much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people’s choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.”In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Putin’s remarks as predictable and said the United States stood by its hacking allegations.“There’s nothing that President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the president’s confidence in the analysis that’s been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community,” said Earnest.Russian state TV and some of his past comments have suggested the Russian leader favours Trump, but Putin said he did not back any candidate in the U.S. election and was ready to work with any new U.S. president and to discuss any issue.Asked about Trump, whom he once described as “very talented,” Putin said the Republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the U.S. political elite.“He has chosen a method to get through to voters’ hearts,” said Putin. “He behaves extravagantly of course, we see this, but I think there’s a reason for this.”Putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the West that Russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the Middle East apart from Syria.Such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that Russia posed, he said, in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance.He said Russia was not planning to attack anyone.But he made clear Russia was in Syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of Aleppo of what he called “a nest of terrorists”, while trying to minimise civilian casualties.(Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin and Maria Tsvetkova in Moscow and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Andrew Roche)"

50,POLITICS,Trump-Linked Voter Intimidation Group Releases New Script For 'Citizen Journalists',Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vote-protectors-citizen-journalists_us_58111180e4b064e1b4b04a85,"Vote Protectors wants volunteers to approach voters on Election Day to ask about ""election fraud.""",2016-10-27,"This is the script that Vote Protectors released Wednesday for its volunteers to approach voters with on Election Day. Its emphasis on ""election fraud"" could be intimidating to some voters.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5811128e17000070005b9f1c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Vote Protectors, an anti-voter-fraud group loyal to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, released a new script Wednesday for its so-called “citizen journalists” to use when they approach voters at the polls. The new script was released less than 24 hours after a Huffington Post investigation revealed that Vote Protectors plans to issue fake ID badges to its volunteers, who intend to travel to cities with large minority populations and conduct phony “exit polls” on Election Day. The interview guide, below, appears to be scripted like a TV news segment, in which a Vote Protectors volunteer would approach citizens and open with, “This is [volunteer’s name] reporting for Vote Protectors.”The questioner would then ask about “election fraud,” a conspiracy theory promoted by Trump and his campaign surrogates in order to cast doubt on the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. As Trump has fallen further behind Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in recent weeks, his doomsday predictions of widespread “election fraud” have grown more urgent.The “Interview Prompt Sheet” instructs Vote Protectors volunteers to contrast Trump’s theories about a “rigged election” with President Barack Obama’s refusal to entertain the fantasy of voter fraud as a serious idea. Scores of political scientists, academics and voting rights advocates have all dismissed this kind of “election fraud” as a myth.The interview questions also appear to be aimed more at promoting a false narrative of election fraud than at gathering newsworthy information. This is similar to Vote Protectors’ other tactics, like creating fake ID badges and filming voters as they approach the polls.Notably absent from the Vote Protectors site Wednesday afternoon was any sign of Trump’s confidante Roger Stone, whose nonprofit, Stop The Steal, hosts Vote Protectors as a collaborator. On Tuesday, Stone had a prominent “Defend The Donald” blog segment on the Vote Protectors website. On Wednesday, it was gone.This is what the site’s menu looked like on Tuesday:On Wednesday, after HuffPost revealed Stone’s role in the Vote Protectors group, his column, called “Defend the Donald Blogger,” was removed without explanation. This is how the new menu bar appeared:Stone told HuffPost he didn’t write the new script, adding, “In fact, I have never seen it before.” He also said his website, Stopthesteal.org, was hit with a DDOS attack Wednesday, but that the site “is back up and is now secure.” Stone initially denied the existence Tuesday of Vote Protectors’ plans to have volunteers wear phony ID badges, or to film voters at the polls. But when confronted with evidence of both, Stone said he had been unaware of them and would never have endorsed such obvious voter intimidation tactics.But as of Wednesday evening, Vote Protectors was still creating fake ID badges and still registering new volunteers using Stone’s “Stop The Steal” banner. HuffPost on Wednesday used their software to create two new ID badges, one for each of the presidential nominees. As Election Day nears, voting rights experts agree that education is key to pushing back against voter intimidation efforts like those planned by Vote Protectors.“It’s important for voters to understand that they should not automatically trust that everyone who walks up to them at a polling station is an official election worker,” said Danielle Lang, deputy director of voting rights at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. “On the contrary, I would counsel voters to maintain a healthy skepticism at all times.” That said, Lang emphasized that “not even poll workers have a right to determine your eligibility to vote. All they can do is run your name against a list of registered voters. If you are told you’re not on the list, you should ask to cast a provisional ballot.”“The bottom line,” Lang told HuffPost, “is that no one should have to leave their polling place without casting some kind of ballot.”  This story has been updated to include Stone’s comments on the script.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
51,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Supporters More Likely To Pray Than Riot If He Loses,Sam Stein and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-supporters-loss_us_5812764be4b0990edc302a1e,There is no talk of blood in the streets in small-town Ohio.,2016-10-27,"Trump supporters in Springfield, Ohio, watch him speak.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio ― At times, the closing argument of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign seems to be built around instilling paranoia in his supporters. The election may be rigged, stolen by a media complex obsessed with undermining his candidacy and by corrupt bureaucrats trying to fix the vote, Trump has warned.This claim has intensified an already skeptical group’s dislike of the press and sparked fear among Democrats and Republicans alike that there may not be a peaceful transition of power come Nov. 8.But at a pro-Trump rally here on Thursday, there was little indication that the Republican nominee’s passionate base of supporters were ready to take up pitchforks if the election didn’t go their way. If anything, the vast majority of them seemed emotionally prepared for the possibility that their beloved Trump would lose, scoffing at the idea that it would prompt fantasies of political revenge.“We’ve got better character than that,” said Greg Grierson, 59. I may “go into mourning for a while,” he added, but he mostly just plans on working hard and getting on with his life. For the more than a dozen people interviewed inside and outside the Champions Center Expo on an overcast, windy fall day, the stakes of the election are high. They are worried about the spiking costs of health insurance; wary about government interference in schools; and petrified that an influx of immigrants would worsen their already precarious employment prospects. But they also say they are committed to the principle that election results should be respected, regardless of the outcome. “It worries me a little bit. But I still believe in the process,” said Tim Combs, 50, who believes Trump is “God-ordained” to win this year.  Juli Cherry, 56, is a cancer survivor and runs a hair salon that employs nine people. She gets her insurance off the Obamacare exchanges ― and it doesn’t come cheap. Her monthly premium is $1,000 and her deductible is $1,500, she says. She makes just over the amount needed to qualify for a subsidy, so the recent news of premium spikes on the exchanges has her spooked. If costs increase notably, she may have to drop coverage and pay the mandate penalty instead. “I feel that politicians no longer serve the public,” Cherry said. “They don’t serve our interests. They serve their own.”For this reason, as well as for her distaste for Hillary Clinton’s support of abortion rights, Cherry is a Trump fan. But if the election goes Clinton’s way, she won’t revolt, take to the streets or indulge in the conspiracies of vote rigging. “If she wins, we have four years to figure out the next time,” Cherry said. “We won’t be happy. But we will survive and figure it out.” Marcia Zink is similarly troubled with Clinton’s stance on abortion. A devout Catholic, she came to the Trump rally 31 weeks pregnant with her ninth child. If Trump loses, she said, she would have “a day of prayer.” And then, she would move on. “We have to trust the system,” Zink said of the possibility that the election might be rigged.In conversation after conversation, attendees at the rally echoed this message. There were exceptions, of course. Ashley Greer, 26, said that if Clinton wins, she might head to Washington D.C. to participate in rallies demanding her ouster. “She needs to be impeached,” Greer said. “That’s what needs to happen … they need to lock her up.” But, by and large, the crowd seemed content to let the vote count stand on its own. If Clinton wins, people said they’d regroup and try to elect Republicans in the next congressional cycle ― and a president like Trump in 2020. “I will work even harder than now to get my fellow people involved and get them engaged,” said Zoanne Bouche, who said she was “50-something.” As for blood on the streets, she replied: “That’s silly.”Bouche’s mentality, and that of other Trump fans present, may be a product of culture and geography ― the crowd’s Midwestern sensibilities overwhelming a more rebellious instinct. At other Trump venues, attendees have talked more openly about post-election protests if Trump loses. At a recent event in Colorado Springs, The New York Times found Trump fans speaking of “another Revolutionary War” come Nov. 9. Still, this bloc of Trump backers’ reluctance to indulge in such talk suggests it’s just that: talk. And that after Election Day, much of the animus and fear will likely dissipate and life will go on. This attitude doesn’t only extend to the election results. Several Trump supporters at the Springfield rally also said they didn’t support the idea ― pushed recently Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ― that a Republican Senate could simply refuse to confirm any Supreme Court justices nominated by Clinton if she becomes president. “That’s a little extreme,” said Marquis VanDeMark, 60, who stood outside the rally, a red “Make America Great Again” hat perched on his head, handing out voter guide fliers made by the group CitizenActionUSA. “We aren’t a banana republic. Come on now. Seriously.” Instead, attendees seemed more focused on reshaping their own party and political ecosystem if Trump loses. Many expressed frustration with the way Fox News ― the usually reliably conservative TV stalwart ― had covered the election, saving particular umbrage for host Megyn Kelly, who has clashed with Trump surrogates about the nominee’s boasts of sexual assault. “Megyn Kelly posted for several pictures in GQ that were sexually explicit,” said rally attendee Doug Tipton. “And now she is appalled with Trump? I’m getting tired of all that.” Others seemed more piqued at how Republican congressional leaders have handled Trump’s nomination. None of the rally attendees interviewed for this piece had nice words for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) or their own Republican governor, John Kasich, who challenged Trump in the GOP presidential primary. Although Ryan has stuck by his endorsement of Trump, he has put as much distance as possible between himself and the GOP nominee. Kasich, by contrast, is an open Trump critic. “I used to like Kasich, but he acted like a fool during this whole thing,” Grierson said. “Paul Ryan is not a stronger fighter for conservatives than [former Republican House Speaker John] Boehner, and Boehner was weak.” “[I am] very disappointed,” Sharon Bennett added. “I would hate to see their next election cycle because no one here is going to vote for them. They’re cowards, they’re babies.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Travel Weekly recently surveyed about 1,100 travel agents, and more than half reported having clients who specify they aren’t interested in staying at Trump hotels. About 46 percent of these agents said more of their clients asked to avoid Trump hotels after the recording of Trump’s lewd comments about women surfaced.Sixty-one percent said they recommend Trump’s hotels less often since he launched his campaign. “When talking to my clients [today], it’s like enough is enough,” Stacy Weigant, a Florida-based travel specialist, told Travel Weekly. “It’s just one thing after another after another.

Booking site Hipmunk found that reservations for Trump hotels dropped about 58 percent during the first half of 2016 compared to the same time last year.

Contrary to reports, Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger says the enterprise is rolling right along.“... [T]he political campaign runs separately from our business,” he told The Huffington Post in a statement. “As a company, we are in growth mode.”Trump, meanwhile, is preparing to launch a new hotel brand that targets younger clients and “those looking for a sense of connection during their travels.” But they won’t be connecting with his name.He’s decided to leave “Trump” off the new hotel’s branding, calling the line “Scion” instead.

58,SPORTS,Grant Hill Says He Would Have Loved Playing In Today's NBA,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grant-hill-nba-interview_us_580e5239e4b02444efa48fdb,The five-time All-NBA player discusses how point guards and big men have reversed roles.,2016-10-27,"Grant Hill says of being a broadcaster, ""You don’t have to worry about the result. You don’t live and die by the results like you did as a player.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f91a41700009c2aace134.jpeg?cache=XD6g0L1EYP&ops=crop_17_163_1983_1251%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Grant Hill was such a special basketball player that fans once called him “the next Jordan.” A two-time national champion at Duke University and the third overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, Hill earned co-Rookie of the Year honors and seven All-Star selections during his 19-year career.Unfortunately, Hill’s brilliant career was hampered by a series of devastating injuries, mainly to his foot. As the 2016 NBA season gets underway, the 44-year-old ― who now works for TNT and NBA TV as a broadcaster ― caught up exclusively with The Huffington Post to discuss the league’s dramatic stylistic changes, describe why he wishes he could have played today, and explain how young big men are stunted by the changing role of the point guard.From both a preparation and physical standpoint, have you found that playing and broadcasting share any similarities? Obviously, there’s no physical toll that comes with broadcasting like playing, but there is a preparing for your opponent aspect ― shoot-around, walk through, understanding matchups, the game plan.So much of being a player is understanding players’ tendencies: What is a team trying to accomplish and how can we go about trying to limit them or restrict them from having success? As a broadcaster, whether in the studio or broadcasting games, you have to prep ― you watch tape, you read, you talk to people.One of the things when I’m calling a game, because I’ve been around the league so much, I like to talk to beat writers of the local teams. They’re really dialed in with what’s happening. Part of broadcasting is reading, reacting and explaining what’s happening to the viewer at home, but like any kind of test or presentation where preparation is required, it’s best to be overly prepared.Quite frankly, I enjoy that. That’s one of the aspects I enjoy, getting into the weeds, preparing for a game, and when you’re at the game, it’s the closest thing to playing. That’s why I like to say it’s the best things from playing, but you don’t have to worry about the result. You don’t live and die by the results like you did as a player.Can you explain the difference between watching film as a player and now as a broadcaster?I would imagine that a former coach that transitions to television brings that coach’s perspective when you start watching tape. I would tend to watch more from a player’s standpoint, sprinkled in with coaching. A lot of it, for me, is understanding players and their tendencies. When I was a player, I would watch a team that we were going to play in the coming days: I [wanted] to get a sense from everybody on the court ― what does the point guard like to do? The big guy, what are his tendencies? And you can pick that up by watching tape.So when you’re in the game, even though it might not be your player, you might make a read or you might have seen something ― a tendency from watching film that can help you adapt or help make you a steal or anticipate something. Now, [as a broadcaster], you’re doing that in preparing for two teams, as opposed to just preparing for one.Can you remember another time when the league had such an influx of top-flight point guard play?No, this is the era of the point guard position. In the mid-’90s, the point guards didn’t shoot as much. They ran the offense, and the emphasis was on the big guy and wing players. Now it’s a point-guard-driven league, and as a result, point guards have adapted.Look, to be competitive nowadays, you have to have good lead guard play. You have to have guys that are little that can play with the ball in pick-and-roll, and can also get you a basket and carry the team, and that was not part of the game 20 years ago. That’s just part of the evolution, it goes hand in hand with the change in the big guy’s role.Young big men today are entering the NBA as “stretch” players, far more comfortable facing the basket away from paint than with their backs to the basket on the block. I think it’s the chicken or the egg theory. The style of play has changed, and it has trickled down to the grass-roots level. When I was young, [if] you were tall, you were encouraged to play with your back to the basket. You worked on post moves, and the school of thought was, “If your feet aren’t in the paint, you don’t shoot.” That was the traditional model, but now, as the game has evolved and we’ve opened the court up shooting more from the perimeter, there’s more spacing.They’re teaching big guys to handle the basketball ― to shoot, to play where they’re facing the basket. What came first? I think the style of play changed and forced everyone to sort of fit into a box and play that style of basketball. It has changed ― it’s a different league, not just at that position, but at the point guard position, perimeter play. And I’m not saying one is better and one’s worse, but like anything, things change and evolve, and the style of play in the NBA has evolved to what it is today.Is it fair then to say the bigs are limited because of the increased scoring role of the point guards?Yeah, I think to a degree, one could say the style of play 20 years ago hurt the point guard. You still need to have good big men, people on the interior who can defend, who can be in that roll position to be effective. But you don’t have to be the dominant centerpiece in this style of play in order to be successful.Quite frankly, we don’t have as many ― the Shaqs, the Ewings and the David Robinsons. You used to have a number of big guys who were really good and effective and you could throw the ball into the block for them 25 times a game, and they could carry you. Part of that is because we’re beginning to condition them at an early age to play more out on the perimeter.How would you have enjoyed playing in this era as opposed to when you entered the NBA in the mid-’90s?When I was young in Detroit, my strengths and what separated me was my ability to handle the basketball, and as a big guy, handling the ball like a point guard. To be able to play in this kind of era, I would have loved it. I would have loved to have the ball in my hands, to be a decision-maker, to make plays for myself and my teammates. It’s more open, there’s not as much physicality.When I was in Detroit, I was a point-forward. We had shooters out there on the floor, Terry Mills, Joe Dumars, Lindsey Hunter, and there was a lot of screen-and-roll with me. But the possessions per game were down ― we only averaged 89 points. We weren’t running up and down the court. We were playing very methodical, defensively grinding it out. Every possession was critical, and it was a wrestling match at times. It was, opportunistically, get out and run, but if you don’t have numbers, let’s slow it down and let’s be very deliberate in our attack.What insight and knowledge did you gain toward the end of your playing career, particularly when you were no longer a focal point of the offense?That last year [with the Clippers] was a valuable experience because now I have an understanding of what it’s like to be an older player, not playing and dealing with the emotions with retirement on the horizon. But also, we had young guys who weren’t playing, so now I’m able to interact and work out with them and just understand the challenges that they went through.I feel like with the Hawks [Hill is vice chairman of the Atlanta Hawks], I can talk to a guy and in a lot of ways relate to what they’re going through, because I’ve lived many lives as a player. So even that last year where I didn’t play was a hugely valuable experience.Would you possibly be open to a Grant Hill documentary ― perhaps an ESPN “30 for 30” ― detailing what actually went down as far as your career and the way you were deceived regarding your injuries?I got a story! I think some of what I’ve gone through and what really happened ― particularly with the injuries and that ordeal four years, five years, and then coming back. There’s a lot that went into that and a lot of people don’t know what happened. Not to call people out, it’s not about that, but to relive what happened.People ask me, “What are you most proud of?” My career had different phases. In the early part, it was really good, and then the difficult middle part in Orlando and really all that came with that, and the end, where I was able to reinvent myself and find tremendous value and fulfillment from playing more in a complementary role. When I look back and reflect, there are three different roles, but I’m most proud of going through what I went through and being able to overcome that. That four years, there’s a lot that happened. I know when I’ve spent a good hour or two going through and explaining things, people are like, “Wow, I had no idea.” This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

Madison Police Department/Handout via Reuter,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587d3cbb1200002d00ad7e43.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A University of Wisconsin-Madison student faces charges in a series of sexual assaults that began last year, authorities said.Alec Cook, a 20-year-old junior majoring in business, was expected to be formally charged on Thursday with 34 counts, including sexual assault, strangulation, battery and false imprisonment, according to WISC-TV. He was jailed awaiting his court appearance.Police said they found notebooks in Cook’s apartment in which he wrote about grooming and stalking his victims and his sexual desires.Police arrested Cook last week, after a 20-year-old fellow student said he tried to strangle her and raped her during hours of captivity in his home. He was re-arrested on suspicion of other crimes after three more women, who heard about his arrest, accused him of separate assaults. One student alleged that he inappropriately touched her in class on 15 occasions during the Spring 2016 term, according to University of Wisconsin-Madison police. Another student said she was assaulted in a downtown Madison apartment in February.“I saw the news story and was empowered by another girl being able to tell what happened to her, that I thought I could now finally tell,” police said the woman told investigators.More charges may follow. A Madison police affidavit obtained by TV station WKOW says “dozens of females” have come forward.At least one of the 20 notebooks that police seized includes names of women, details Cook liked about them, and how he first encountered them, according to authorities. Notes also include descriptions of sexual fantasies and a column with a heading of “kill.” Cook is cooperating with investigators, his attorney told the Star Tribune.“Much of what has been on Facebook has been character assassination of my client,” attorney Christopher Van Wagner complained.Cook has been suspended from the university, one of the country’s top public institutions. “Sexual violence is unacceptable in our campus and community,” Lori Berquam, dean of students, said in a statement that also discussed campus resources available to victims of sexual attacks. “This is a serious case and the university is responding.”Need help?

61,POLITICS,Arguing Republican Pundits Remind Us Just How Divisive The Election Has Been,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-pundits-fight-cnn_us_5811f43ce4b0990edc2f4b02,A discussion about Donald Trump's sexual assault allegations derailed quickly.,2016-10-27,Republican CNN contributors Ana Navarro and Scottie Nell Hughes got into a shouting match Thursday morning over where their loyalty stands.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58120522150000b700530208.png?cache=VZsccXegxi&ops=crop_332_327_626_347%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A fight between Republican pundits shows exactly how much this election season has tested many people’s party loyalty. Ana Navarro and Scottie Nell Hughes got into a shouting match on CNN Thursday morning as they discussed rising allegations of sexual assault against GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and whom they plan to vote for in the general election. Hughes, who waved off Trump’s threat to sue his accusers as “great drama for ratings,” insisted that voters are ultimately going to look past the allegations to “what he’s promising for the future of America.”Navarro, who slammed Trump as “the most rude, vulgar candidate that we’ve ever had in U.S. history,” expressed concern that we’re “getting numb” to these kind of allegations.“I really can’t keep track anymore of how many women have accused Donald Trump,” she said.Hughes responded by demanding to know where Navarro’s loyalty stood.“For the last year I’ve heard you bash Donald Trump,” she said. “Who are you supporting?” “I am … writing in my mom,” Navarro snapped back. Hughes criticized this tactic, saying it was “not a feasible solution.”“I’ve got every right to vote my conscience. If my conscience doesn’t allow me to support either the Republican or Democrat, then I’m going to write in whomever I want,” Navarro said.Hughes called Navarro’s actions selfish. “I actually look at the bigger picture,” she said.The explosive segment ended without the women coming to an agreement, amicable or otherwise.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

A protester was taken into custody, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.In a separate incident, a woman was arrested after firing three shots that almost hit a deputy, Fong said. As darkness fell, more than 100 protesters had been arrested. “We do believe there are people down there that are peaceful and prayerful but we’ve also known from the beginning that there are some bad actors,” Fong said, referring to the hundreds of Native Americans and activists who’ve camped in protest of the oil pipeline for months. “The last thing we want is for anybody to get hurt.”The violence erupted Thursday morning, when law enforcement began removing Native Americans and environmental activists from a protest camp they built on private land. The site, known as Cannonball Ranch, will be used by Energy Transfer Partners for its 1,172-mile pipeline. Many of the protesters, who prefer to be called water protectors, had refused earlier orders to leave. Some prayed in circles while others yelled at advancing members of law enforcement, according to The Associated Press. “Militarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today. We continue to pray for peace,” said Dave Archambault, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, a tribe that fears the pipeline will taint their drinking water and destroy sacred sites. “We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone’s safety.”By Thursday evening, the sheriff’s office had arrested 117 people in what it called “illegal protest activities.” Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier told reporters earlier that charges could include being a public nuisance and engaging in a riot.“Nobody wanted this,” Kirchmeier said, claiming that protesters’ illegal actions made the conflict inevitable. The group of about 200 people, including many members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, had been occupying land slated for the controversial pipeline since Sunday. The conflict escalated as the Morton County Sheriff’s Department claimed that protesters set fire to a bridge and to tires left on the highway.Officers were dressed in riot gear and some carried arms, The Associated Press reported. Authorities moved in with trucks, police cars, Humvees and buses, the AP said, while helicopters and a fixed-wing airplane monitored from above.One witness, who had been livestreaming throughout the protest on Facebook, said that police had used tear gas and fired bean bags at protesters.Fong, a spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services, confirmed the bean bags and said police had used pepper spray. She added that protesters had thrown rocks and debris and had torched some construction equipment.There have been “a handful of minor injuries,” according to Fong, speaking before the shooting. Kirchmeier said in an earlier statement that he was compelled to act because the protesters hadn’t left the site on Wednesday. “I can’t stress it enough: This is a public safety issue,” Kirchmeier said. “We cannot have protesters blocking county roads, blocking state highways or trespassing on private property.”The sheriff’s department announced it was also dismantling a roadblock on a highway set up by the group of Native Americans and environmental activists. A variety of local and state law enforcement agencies have sent officers to support the department, Kirchmeier said. Members of the tribe say the land they’re occupying is rightfully theirs, and that authorities are infringing on tribal sovereignty and failing to respect two treaties ratified by the federal government.This week, the Standing Rock Sioux accused local and state authorities of civil rights violations and asked the Department of Justice to open an investigation. Energy Transfer Partners has argued that transporting oil via a pipeline is safer than carrying it on trucks and trains. A company spokeswoman did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiries. Hundreds of Standing Rock Sioux tribal members and their allies have camped on nearby federal land for months. They argue that the pipeline project won approval without a proper environmental study, and worry that their drinking water could become contaminated if the pipeline leaks into the Missouri River. They also say construction has disturbed the tribe’s burial sites and other land of historical importance. This article has been updated to include the rising number of arrests by the sheriff’s office."

65,RELIGION,Can A New Qur’an Translation Promote Religious Harmony?,"Safi Kaskas and Dr. David Hungerford, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-a-new-quran-translation-promote-religious-harmony_us_58127cf4e4b08301d33e0760,"The first translation of the Qur’an into English from the original Arabic was published by George Sale, in London in 1734",2016-10-27,<p>Cover image for “The Qur’an - with References to the Bible: A Contemporary Understanding”</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58127d901500001300530424.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The first translation of the Qur’an into English from the original Arabic was published by George Sale, in London in 1734. Since then, Wikipedia lists 69 English translations of the book that is holy to 1.7 billion people across the globe. So, why do we need yet another new translation, and why now?As co-authors of “The Qur’an - with References to the Bible: A Contemporary Understanding,” we believe that civilization stands at a crossroads of confrontation and enmity that is spiraling out of control. War and conflict have been a part of the human condition since Cain killed Abel, but now we have the capacity to wipe out life on the planet, and it is imperative that we seek understanding of ‘the other.’While some prior translations of the Qur’an are excellent, many are written in archaic English, while others present ‘interpretations’ that are not representative of the original text. This translation is, for the first time in history, the work of a devout practicing Christian and a devout practicing Muslim and the only one with parallel references to the Bible. Readers may be surprised to find that the Qur’an, in its original context, actually challenges some of the more mainstream interpretations believed by both Muslims and Christians, especially the more controversial verses. We have worked together to produce a translation of the Qur’an into contemporary commonly understood English.[1] Dr. Kaskas began the ten-year process by first translating the Qur’an from the original Arabic into English. We then sat side-by-side and optimized each verse, line-by-line, into accessible, easy to understand English, which was no simple task. A great deal of effort was made to ensure that the meaning of the Arabic was translated into that same denotation in contemporary English.The second phase of the project has been to choose verses from the Bible that correspond to the meaning of selected verses of the Qur’an. Many of the biblical stories – from attributes of God, the Creation of the Universe, the beginning of mankind and historical events recorded in the Bible, to the lives of the prophets and the life of Jesus –are repeated in the Qur’an. The Qur’an also says of itself that it has been given to confirm the prior revelations (the Torah and the Gospels). In our experience, most Christians and many Muslims are completely unaware of the rich trove of common themes in these scriptures, which are considered holy to more than half the people on the planet. Although some have a vague awareness of their ‘common ground,’ few are aware of the extent of the similarities. The selection of the verses, chosen for contextual relevance, has also been a combined effort of the two authors.Where Christians and Muslims are divided and cannot resolve their differences, the Qur’an prescribes an appropriate arena for competition: we are to contend with each other in good deeds:To every community there is a direction to turn to, so compete to do good deeds wherever you may be. God will bring you all. God has power over all things. Q2:148We have assigned to each of you a law and a way of life. If God had wanted, He could have made all of you a single community, but instead He is testing you by means of what He has revealed to you. So compete in doing what is good. You will all return to God, and He will clarify these matter about which You have differed. Q5:48Without syncretizing, or transgressing either book, affirmation of the tremendous overlap in content is not only appropriate, but also leads to more openness to ‘the other.’ And, we have personally found that openness leads to dialogue, understanding and cooperation.Hearing about an attempt to compare the Qur’an and the Bible in order to emphasize commonalities will make some Muslims very suspicious. We have experienced that same suspicion from some religiously fervent American and European groups, who consider it an insult to compare the Bible to the Qur’an. To many Western Christians, the Qur’an is “the book of the devil.” They see nothing good that can come out of it, and either want to burn it or ban its reading all together. Some even warn of a “Chrislam” movement when they hear of Muslims speaking positively about Jesus.This translation is not intended to be a tool for converting Christians to Islam or Muslims to Christianity. It is intended to be a clarion call to follow the foundational tenets of both the Bible and the Qur’an to love God with all our hearts, mind and soul and our neighbor as ourselves. What is needed is a movement toward peace and personal reconciliation, and it is our hope that this translation will stimulate the first step.[1] Kaskas, S., and Hungerford, D.

He said the suspension would last until he was satisfied the process for providing relief to those affected by the repayment demands was “working effectively.”Carter said he had ordered Pentagon officials to establish that process by January, ensuring “the fair and equitable treatment of our service members and the rapid resolution of these cases,” with the Pentagon making decisions on all the bonuses by July at the latest.“Ultimately, we will provide for a process that puts as little burden as possible on any soldier who received an improper payment through no fault of his or her own,” he said. “At the same time, it will respect our important obligation to the taxpayer.”A bombshell report in the LA Times over the weekend detailed how the Defense Department was ordering some California National Guard members to repay large enlistment bonuses that they were not eligible for ― hitting veterans with interest charges, wage garnishments, even tax liens.As the U.S. fought two wars over the past 15 years, the Pentagon paid out improper bonuses in every state. But those overpayments were particularly frequent in California. And efforts to get the money back from nearly 10,000 soldiers in California was causing incredible hardship.After the Defense Department realized the error, they began trying to get the money back, years after it was paid out, by any means necessary. Following the LA Times story, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle began calling for the Pentagon to forgive the debts, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began an investigation into the overpayments."

Rather than seeking to keep the peace, law enforcement personnel are clearly working in tandem with private security of Dakota Access,” he wrote.The DOJ didn’t directly respond to the tribe’s request for an investigation, but says it’s working with authorities and activists. “The Justice Department is taking the situation in North Dakota seriously, and has been in communications with state and local law enforcement officials, as well as tribal representatives and protesters, to facilitate communication, defuse tensions, support peaceful protests, and maintain public safety,” DOJ spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle wrote in an email. “The department has also offered technical assistance and community policing resources to local law enforcement in support of these goals.”An online petition that calls on the DOJ and North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) to support protesters’ rights attracted more than 120,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon. This summer, the battle intensified over the 1,172-mile pipeline that Energy Transfer Partners is building through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Hundreds of Standing Rock Sioux and their allies are camping out to protest the pipeline over fears it will pollute the Missouri River and destroy culturally significant land. Recently, protesters have expanded to an auxiliary camp near Lake Oahe, located on private land owned by Energy Transfer Partners. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department official who spoke on Facebook expressed frustration that protesters refused to vacate the new settlement. “At some point, rule of law has to be enforced,” he said. “We could go down there at any time. We are trying not to. We are trying to avoid the confrontation.”The area near Lake Oahe is pivotal. Energy Transfer Partners needs a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit to build across the federal waterway. But the DOJ, Army and Department of the Interior have jointly announced they won’t issue a permit before conducting a review of the permitting process. The Standing Rock Sioux are arguing for more extensive environmental vetting before construction can proceed. The mounting tension alarms Jan Hasselman, an attorney who represents the tribe and works for the environmental law organization Earthjustice. “Things are definitely escalating. The company is provoking a confrontation by getting closer and closer [with construction],” Hasselman said. “State law enforcement is acting as a full partner of the pipeline.” In North Dakota and Iowa, where the pipeline has generated the most opposition, dozens of protesters have been arrested on charges such as trespassing and disorderly conduct, including actress Shailene Woodley.Journalists have also been arrested, including “Democracy Now” host Amy Goodman, who was reporting when pipeline security guards used pepper spray and dogs against protesters. She was accused of participating in a riot, but a judge dismissed the case.In his letter to the DOJ, Archambault condemned police tactics such as allowing surveillance planes and helicopters to fly above the protesters’ prayer camp. He said that law enforcement officials shirked their responsibility when they didn’t stop the pipeline’s security team from using dogs against the protesters.“This country has a long and sad history of using military force against indigenous people — including the Sioux Nation,” Archambault wrote. “I would like to think that those days are past — and that today Tribal rights cannot be ignored and military force cannot be used to suppress Indian people. But when I see the militarization taking place in North Dakota against Indian people, I am genuinely concerned.” The dog handlers may face charges for working without a license, Morton County investigators announced this week.Energy Transfer Partners, meanwhile, alleges that protesters have threatened workers and that vandals have caused millions of dollars in damage by setting fire to construction equipment.The company expressed appreciation for officers’ presence during the conflict. “We are very supportive of the efforts of local and state law enforcement,” Energy Transfer Partners spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in an email.

Trump, who goes by “Skip” and has garnered some media attention in recent months for the many things he doesn’t have in common with the presidential hopeful.Dr. Trump, who’s crossed paths with the business mogul over the years due to their shared name and some resulting mixups, revealed in an interview with CNN’s KFile on Monday that he won’t be casting a vote for his name twin. “I would vote for Clinton,” said the CEO and executive director of the Inova Dwight and Martha Schar Cancer Institute in Northern Virginia, adding that he also voted for President Barack Obama. “[I] like the empathy, the inclusiveness, and the progressive policies that they espouse,” Dr. Trump said.He’s been very turned off by the Republican nominee’s antics.“I have found [Trump’s] theatrical persona and lack of content to his positions distasteful and particularly some of the rabble-rousing rhetoric and hostile rhetoric I think is distinctly out of place in public discourse,” the oncologist continued. “[The institute] is really lucky to have the other Donald Trump, but the other Donald Trump is me because you’re the famous one,” the nominee said in the video.“Believe it or not what you do in life is more important than what I do in life,” he continued. “So I’d say Donald L. Trump, which is you, is probably more important than Donald J. Trump, which is me.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

72,POLITICS,This Could Be The Beginning Of The End Of The Supreme Court As We Know It,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-hillary-clinton-nominees_us_580fed9ae4b08582f88cb00c,Conservatives lay the groundwork for blocking all of Hillary Clinton's nominees.,2016-10-26,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could let the Supreme Court wither away while he waits for a Republican president.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580fee7a180000be00dc4273.jpeg?cache=4NnIzxaO8H&ops=crop_0_472_5760_3346%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Maybe Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had the right idea after all. Maybe Republicans are willing to trigger a constitutional crisis over the Supreme Court.Some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to McCain’s controversial suggestion last week that Senate Republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all Supreme Court nominees put forth by a future President Hillary Clinton.Who needs a fully functioning Supreme Court after all?“As a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,” wrote the Cato Institute’s Ilya Shapiro in a column Wednesday on The Federalist.Shapiro is well-versed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. Nothing in the Constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nation’s highest court ― if not an entire branch of the federal government ― to stop Clinton from selecting judges who share her views.But McCain’s comments suggesting a total blockade initially faced opposition, even from some members of his own party. “We can’t just simply stonewall” those hypothetical Clinton nominees, said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).Of course, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley is doing exactly that to Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.To Shapiro, there’s nothing wrong with even more Senate obstructionism because “the Constitution is completely silent” on how the upper chamber provides its “advice and consent” on the president’s nominees.Legal scholars across the ideological spectrum have agreed that’s true. But they’ve also concluded that the Republicans’ no-hearings-no-votes posture on Garland is unprecedented in American history. And many deplore the partisanship that has overwhelmed the judicial confirmation process over the last few decades.Not Shapiro. “I simply can’t blame politicians who follow their convictions,” he wrote. “If you truly believe that a particular nominee would wreak havoc on America, why not do everything you can to stop him?”Shapiro noted that senators may pay a political price for refusing to work with a president from the other party. More importantly, the justice system pays a price.Even those now on the Supreme Court have lamented that a shorthanded court can’t operate as it should.“It’s much more difficult for us to do our job if we are not what we’re intended to be ― a court of nine,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor during a recent appearance in Minnesota. She added that 4-to-4 rulings can leave the law unsettled and justice across the country “administered in an unequal way.” In other words, when lower courts disagree on how to interpret a particular law or how to apply the Constitution to new problems ― and they do regularly ― the justices are supposed to step in and resolve that disagreement. When an equally divided Supreme Court can’t do that, the meaning of congressional statutes and the Constitution may vary from state to state ― which isn’t just or fair.This didn’t seem to be a concern to Shapiro.“So when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate’s constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names,” he concluded.If Clinton wins and the Republicans retain control of the Senate, this argument could serve as the groundwork for their next play in Congress — even though they’ve spent most of 2016 insisting that the people’s choice for the next president should get to pick Scalia’s replacement.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) signaled on Wednesday that he may be a convert to this vision of a new normal — a Supreme Court not at full steam for a very long time:Of course, none of this likely matters if Democrats regain the Senate, which HuffPost Pollster projections say is not beyond the realm of the possible. The Constitution may give the president the power to nominate justices and the Senate the power to vote them up or down. But in the end it’s the voters who choose."

76,ARTS & CULTURE,The ‘Bachelor’ Franchise Needs To Stop Giving Chad A Platform For His BS,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chad-on-ben-lauren_us_581000b8e4b001e247df309a,He's been verbally abusive to contestants. He tried to dox this reporter on Twitter. Will he ever be excommunicated?,2016-10-26,"After his ""Bachelorette"" stint, which featured a shoving match and threats of violence, Chad was invited on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" to charm the masses.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5810290d1800002d00dc42f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like a particularly pernicious hangover, “Bachelor” bad dude Chad Johnson just won’t fade away. After his time on JoJo Fletcher’s season of “The Bachelorette,” a sad appearance on “After the Final Rose,” and an even more shocking stay on “Bachelor in Paradise,” he still keeps cropping up ― on an aftershow for “Bachelorette Canada” and now on Freeform’s “Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After?”On Tuesday night’s episode of “Ben & Lauren,” the tepidly happy couple decide to go camping with some franchise friends ― Chris Soules, Emily and Haley Ferguson, Lace Morris and Grant Kemp, and (oops!) Chad Johnson. Yep, thinking Lace and Grant can’t make the weekend, Lauren and Ben invited their friends’ sworn enemy. After meeting him at “After the Final Rose,” Lauren felt convinced Chad was a good guy deep down, and wanted to reach out to the poor friendless dude. The final campfire of the weekend ended up being a group therapy session. Lace sobbed, Lauren insisted that she didn’t really think Chad was a bully, and Chad severely undercut her case by smirking and whipping out lines like, “I meant to upset you! I meant to piss y’all off, and it worked! ... It entertained me.” When Grant asked what his late mother would think of his actions on the show, Chad stiffened and ground out, “I think, stop bringing my mom up ... I don’t bring up my mom. There’s no unhurtful way to keep bringing up my mom.” (While this is an understandable defensiveness, he has brought her death up, repeatedly, to garner sympathy and burnish his actions on the show.)Finally, he mouthed an apology and left before anything worse could happen ― what amounts to a triumphant act of generosity from Chad given the low bar he’s been given to clear in the “Bachelor” world of late.Presumably, this camping trip was filmed some time ago, but based on the context of the show, it’s clear that it took place after his appearances on both “Bachelorette” and “Paradise,” as well as an appearance on “After Paradise” with Lace. By this point, his ongoing pattern of inappropriate behavior toward cast members was eminently apparent ― yet he was shoehorned into an episode of a “Bachelor” star’s reality show nonetheless. Freeform declined to comment on Chad’s appearance on the show, and as of press time, contacts at Warner Horizon and ABC had not responded to requests for comment. As someone who watches and writes about “The Bachelor” franchise, I’d been troubled by Chad’s comportment on the show since early on, especially as it became more aggressive and openly hateful toward women on the show such as Lace and Sarah Herron. I’d commented on it when I found his behavior toward other contestants inappropriate. I’d also revealed on Twitter and on my podcast that my own mother had died when I was very young, and that the grieving process had been very prolonged and difficult. Based on my experience, I empathized, but I didn’t believe his mother’s death should be used as an excuse for harmful actions.But, full disclosure, I’m not just an observer here. That’s because Chad didn’t like me “bringing up his mom” by commenting that a grief I so deeply sympathized with shouldn’t be used to justify abusive behaviors. He didn’t like me doing this so much that on Aug. 10, he began to harass me on Twitter, first tweeting at my employer:He continued by tweeting what he either believed or claimed to believe was my address. (I had never resided at the apartment in question.)I reported the attempted doxing to Twitter. After many hours, his account was suspended until the tweets were removed. In the meantime, the tweet hung in the ether, receiving plenty of unsettling responses. (I just hoped that was all it would lead to.) My editors and I also brought the tweets to the attention of ABC and Warner Horizon, the studio. Given that this occurred the day after Chad’s appearance with Lace on “After Paradise,” it seems likely that the camping trip filmed for “Ben & Lauren” took place just a few days later.Chad presents himself as someone who thinks his own purposefully harmful actions can be erased with a glib apology, while others are lucky if a comment that rubs him the wrong way isn’t met with physical violence. Lauren asked him during the campfire chat if it made him sad to hurt other people; he almost scoffed as he replied, “No!” If others hit on a sore spot for him ― his mother, though it’s one that he’s made part of his reality TV narrative — he finds their hurtfulness appalling and unforgivable. There’s no one standard of kindness; everyone must behave with gentle deference to Chad, while he can gaily stomp on them in return and expect forgiveness on demand.That is what it is. Whether a calculated ploy or a manifestation of deeper issues, by now, we know what we’re getting with Chad. He has, in the past, excoriated fellow contestants for playing nice to get endorsement deals and fame, but on “Ben & Lauren” he basically admitted what was always clear: that he’s been acting horrendously both on and off the show to stay in the spotlight, to “make people laugh.” Why ― why ― are ABC and Freeform giving him a platform to play this hurtful game at the expense of the rest of their talent, himself, and even others who may be caught in the crossfire? The episode, “Chad to the Bone,” ends with Ben toasting to “more hope, more love, and more acceptance of the people in our life that have hurt us.” “That was a great toast,” says Lace, raising her glass to staying vulnerable to someone who just admitted to intentionally harming her for his own amusement. What an inspiring message. "

Mike Coffman's re-election is testing whether Trump will doom down-ticket Republicans, even if they don't back him.",2016-10-26,Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) says he won't support Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton for president.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f600a1a00004e2d5bb9d7.jpeg?cache=eLhAC1lbKm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRIGHTON, Colo. ― Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) has tried harder than most congressional Republicans to distance himself from Donald Trump.In August, he put out an ad saying he didn’t like the GOP presidential nominee. This month, he called for Trump to step aside. And last week, he said he may not vote for president at all, because he won’t support Trump or Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It’s good politics in Coffman’s Denver-area district, where he’s worked over the past several years to craft a Latino-friendly, reasonably moderate image at odds with Trump’s virulently anti-unauthorized immigrant boasts. The question is, will it will work?Coffman will have to pull off a tough feat to survive his Democratic challenger, state Sen. Morgan Carroll. He’ll have to outperform Clinton, who may well win his district by double digits at the top of the ticket. Coffman, who’s been in the House since 2009, is neck and neck with Carroll, according to private polling conducted by Carroll’s campaign. Polls show Clinton trouncing Trump in the district by double digits, according to a Democratic source, meaning Coffman needs a significant number of Clinton voters to split their tickets and vote for him as well. He would need to do that in a place where Trump’s sagging standing seemed most likely to doom down-ballot Republicans: a suburban swing district with a large Latino population.The craziest thing is, Coffman might pull it off.“The district itself has moved in a lot of ways, but Coffman’s brand is almost completely distinct from all of the changes that are happening demographically and politically within the district,” a national GOP operative told The Huffington Post, declining to comment by name. Coffman has beaten the top of the ticket before. He won in 2012, even though President Barack Obama defeated GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney by 5 points, 52 percent to 47 percent. Coffman won that year by 2 points. But 2016 is different. This year, there’s Trump. For all of his disavowals of the GOP nominee, Coffman has given Democrats plenty of ammunition to tie him to Trump. Last week, in a debate with Carroll hosted by 9News, Coffman fielded a question about his 2012 comments on Obama’s birthplace ― relevant because of Trump’s long history of birtherism. Coffman said at a private fundraiser that year that he didn’t “know whether Barack Obama was born in the United States of America ... in his heart, he’s not an American.” Coffman apologized for the comments, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has packaged the tape into a commercial suggesting Coffman is no different than Trump.Coffman acknowledged at the debate that he made the statement “at one time.”“Assumed it wasn’t public,” Coffman said. “I was wrong for making the statement, I said so. But to somehow infer in any way that it had an influence on Donald Trump is absolutely ridiculous.” Coffman was asked at the debate whether Trump’s statements about groping women made him a sexual predator. “I don’t know,” Coffman answered, even though it was that 2005 hot-mic recording that led Coffman to call for Trump to step aside. Democrats also have hit Coffman for his comments about deportation, a hot-button issue in the 20-percent Latino district. Coffman said he thinks the U.S. ought to toughen immigration enforcement ― a Trump mainstay ― but he also supports allowing certain undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status. Immigration has been a particularly important piece of Coffman’s political evolution. His predecessor was former Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), an immigration hawk and fringe precursor candidate to Trump who ran for president in 2008 by promising to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The district changed after the 2010 census, and Coffman, who once championed similar positions, switched gears as thousands more Latinos became his constituents. It was then that Coffman announced his support for legal status for undocumented immigrants and a path to citizenship for those who came to the U.S. as children, often called Dreamers. He’s voted against his party on certain measures related to immigration ― such as a bill to strip deportation relief from Dreamers ― but he also joined fellow Republicans in a lawsuit against Obama’s broader deportation relief. Coffman’s most recent pro-unauthorized immigrant move, a bill introduced in June that would allow certain Dreamers to move toward citizenship, was dismissed as merely a “symbolic gesture” by the pro-reform group United We Dream.It’s unclear whether Latino voters buy Coffman’s shift on immigration ― and whether they’ll hold him accountable for his earlier positions.Carroll spokesman Drew Godinich told HuffPost that Coffman’s supposed shift doesn’t amount to much. “He’s come out and said that he’s evolved away from this position and certainly the rhetoric and stuff his campaign puts out would suggest that, but when you actually look at the record in Congress, the evolution is not necessarily there,” Godinich said.Coffman has alienated at least one Republican as well ― Tancredo, whom he replaced in Congress. Tancredo wrote in Breitbart News that he hoped Coffman’s “duplicitous attack” on Trump would not win him another term.“Coffman has gone through so many ‘soul searching’ political transformations it is becoming apparent to all that the only angst he feels is from the fear of no longer being CONGRESSMAN Coffman,” Tancredo wrote.Meanwhile, Coffman and fellow conservatives have have gone after Carroll as too liberal for the district. Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers, didn’t endorse Coffman, but the group is working against Carroll through door-knocking and phone-banking.

Mike Coffman's re-election is testing whether Trump will doom down-ticket Republicans, even if they don't back him.",2016-10-26,"Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) shakes hands with his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Morgan Carroll. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRIGHTON, Colo. ― Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) has tried harder than most congressional Republicans to distance himself from Donald Trump.In August, he put out an ad saying he didn’t like the GOP presidential nominee. This month, he called for Trump to step aside. And last week, he said he may not vote for president at all, because he won’t support Trump or Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It’s good politics in Coffman’s Denver-area district, where he’s worked over the past several years to craft a Latino-friendly, reasonably moderate image at odds with Trump’s virulently anti-unauthorized immigrant boasts. The question is, will it will work?Coffman will have to pull off a tough feat to survive his Democratic challenger, state Sen. Morgan Carroll. He’ll have to outperform Clinton, who may well win his district by double digits at the top of the ticket. Coffman, who’s been in the House since 2009, is neck and neck with Carroll, according to private polling conducted by Carroll’s campaign. Polls show Clinton trouncing Trump in the district by double digits, according to a Democratic source, meaning Coffman needs a significant number of Clinton voters to split their tickets and vote for him as well. He would need to do that in a place where Trump’s sagging standing seemed most likely to doom down-ballot Republicans: a suburban swing district with a large Latino population.The craziest thing is, Coffman might pull it off.“The district itself has moved in a lot of ways, but Coffman’s brand is almost completely distinct from all of the changes that are happening demographically and politically within the district,” a national GOP operative told The Huffington Post, declining to comment by name. Coffman has beaten the top of the ticket before. He won in 2012, even though President Barack Obama defeated GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney by 5 points, 52 percent to 47 percent. Coffman won that year by 2 points. But 2016 is different. This year, there’s Trump. For all of his disavowals of the GOP nominee, Coffman has given Democrats plenty of ammunition to tie him to Trump. Last week, in a debate with Carroll hosted by 9News, Coffman fielded a question about his 2012 comments on Obama’s birthplace ― relevant because of Trump’s long history of birtherism. Coffman said at a private fundraiser that year that he didn’t “know whether Barack Obama was born in the United States of America ... in his heart, he’s not an American.” Coffman apologized for the comments, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has packaged the tape into a commercial suggesting Coffman is no different than Trump.Coffman acknowledged at the debate that he made the statement “at one time.”“Assumed it wasn’t public,” Coffman said. “I was wrong for making the statement, I said so. But to somehow infer in any way that it had an influence on Donald Trump is absolutely ridiculous.” Coffman was asked at the debate whether Trump’s statements about groping women made him a sexual predator. “I don’t know,” Coffman answered, even though it was that 2005 hot-mic recording that led Coffman to call for Trump to step aside. Democrats also have hit Coffman for his comments about deportation, a hot-button issue in the 20-percent Latino district. Coffman said he thinks the U.S. ought to toughen immigration enforcement ― a Trump mainstay ― but he also supports allowing certain undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status. Immigration has been a particularly important piece of Coffman’s political evolution. His predecessor was former Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), an immigration hawk and fringe precursor candidate to Trump who ran for president in 2008 by promising to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The district changed after the 2010 census, and Coffman, who once championed similar positions, switched gears as thousands more Latinos became his constituents. It was then that Coffman announced his support for legal status for undocumented immigrants and a path to citizenship for those who came to the U.S. as children, often called Dreamers. He’s voted against his party on certain measures related to immigration ― such as a bill to strip deportation relief from Dreamers ― but he also joined fellow Republicans in a lawsuit against Obama’s broader deportation relief. Coffman’s most recent pro-unauthorized immigrant move, a bill introduced in June that would allow certain Dreamers to move toward citizenship, was dismissed as merely a “symbolic gesture” by the pro-reform group United We Dream.It’s unclear whether Latino voters buy Coffman’s shift on immigration ― and whether they’ll hold him accountable for his earlier positions.Carroll spokesman Drew Godinich told HuffPost that Coffman’s supposed shift doesn’t amount to much. “He’s come out and said that he’s evolved away from this position and certainly the rhetoric and stuff his campaign puts out would suggest that, but when you actually look at the record in Congress, the evolution is not necessarily there,” Godinich said.Coffman has alienated at least one Republican as well ― Tancredo, whom he replaced in Congress. Tancredo wrote in Breitbart News that he hoped Coffman’s “duplicitous attack” on Trump would not win him another term.“Coffman has gone through so many ‘soul searching’ political transformations it is becoming apparent to all that the only angst he feels is from the fear of no longer being CONGRESSMAN Coffman,” Tancredo wrote.Meanwhile, Coffman and fellow conservatives have have gone after Carroll as too liberal for the district. Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers, didn’t endorse Coffman, but the group is working against Carroll through door-knocking and phone-banking. It’s the only House race in the general election in which the organization is expressly advocating, chosen because Carroll has “a long track record of far-left policies” and because it’s a close race where the group may make a difference, said Michael Fields, Americans for Prosperity’s Colorado director.Coffman spokeswoman Cinamon Watson said Carroll “has proven herself to be blindly partisan,” while Coffman’s comments on Trump show he’s willing to stand up to both parties.“Morgan Carroll said she trusts Hillary and is running to get Hillary’s back,” Watson said in an email. “Mike Coffman’s got Colorado’s back.”In August, Coffman released an ad promising to “stand up” to Trump.

But in another photo taken four years later, it looks golden.Saturn’s changing seasons and increased exposure to sunlight might have caused the color change, scientists theorize.“During the polar winter night between November 1995 and August 2009, Saturn’s north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions ― reactions involving sunlight and the atmosphere,” NASA explained on its website.“Since the planet experienced equinox in August 2009, the polar atmosphere has been basking in continuous sunshine, and aerosols are being produced inside of the hexagon, around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy today,” the website stated.Atmospheric circulation could also explain the color change.Both images were obtained by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, which launched in 1997 and orbits Saturn, studying the planet and its moons."

But documents obtained by The Huffington Post show that the candidate has also repeatedly fought to lower the amount he pays in state and local taxes, in some cases telling authorities that his properties are worth tens of millions of dollars less than he’s claimed in his federal election filings.It’s a strategy that Trump has used across the country, and it can cost local communities hundreds of thousands in lost revenue they’d otherwise spend on schools, fire departments and other services. Trump’s tax reduction tactics are all the more jarring as his surrogates cite the enormous amount of state and local taxes he pays amid revelations that he used a massive write-off to avoid paying federal income taxes.The wildly fluctuating reported value of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas is a prime example of Trump’s approach. In July 2015, Trump convinced a Nevada tax board to reduce the taxable value of the hotel, which had initially been assessed at $176 million, to just $25 million. That much lower valuation would have cut Trump’s tax bill by millions of dollars in the 2015-16 tax year, and could continue to do so, if he’s paying the standard Clark County property tax rate.Yet just six days after the tax board’s decision, which was obtained by HuffPost, Trump said the same property was worth over $50 million in a personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. He repeated that value in an updated disclosure on May 16, 2016. (Candidates are only required to report the value of their assets in broad ranges, with the highest category being simply “over $50 million.”) Valuing his Las Vegas hotel at a higher amount made Trump’s net worth appear higher. Both valuations can’t be true, said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who was the chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. “Either he’s not telling the truth to the board of equalization, or he’s not telling the truth about his assets on the [financial disclosure] and making himself look richer than he is,” he said.Painter, who has endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, said that if Trump is lowballing the value of his building to pay lower taxes, he is effectively “cheating the other taxpayers of Nevada. They’re either going to have to pay higher taxes or put up with crummy services because he’s not paying his fair share.”It’s a fairly common tactic for real estate developers to argue that a building is worth less than the local government claims in order to reduce their property taxes. However, Trump’s aggressive tax tactics are not always consistent with his personal financial disclosures, nor with his campaign’s insistence that the state and local taxes his company pays offset the massive federal income tax deduction he has apparently claimed.Dan Lesser, a hotel valuation expert and the president of LW Hospitality Advisors, told HuffPost that valuation is never a straightforward process. Each appraiser uses his or her own assumptions about what something is worth, so it’s entirely possible to come up with different valuations within a “range of reasonableness.” The accuracy of a particular valuation is “in the eye of the beholder,” he explained. Without speaking directly to a specific property or valuation, Lesser said that if he valued a building and it went on to sell at an amount within 10 percent of his estimate, he’d consider his job well done.For Trump’s Las Vegas hotel, a county tax assessor found that the taxable value of the land, building and personal property (including furniture) was just over $176 million for tax years 2014-2016. That finding was appealed in a January 2015 petition signed by Eric Trump, who is a vice president of Trump Ruffin I LLC, the company that owns the towers. In the appeal, he asked that the full value of the building be listed at $20 million ― which was even lower than the $25 million valuation by an appraiser the company had hired. The Clark County tax board didn’t agree with that $20 million valuation, but did dramatically reduce its initial assessment, putting the hotel’s taxable value at a little over $48 million. Despite what seemed to be a favorable ruling, Trump Ruffin I LLC appealed again the next month, asking the state tax board to overrule the county and drop the property’s value all the way down to $20 million.There was a hearing before the state tax board in May, and in July, the board agreed to lower the property’s valuation to $25 million, the figure the company’s own assessor had suggested. If Trump’s company paid the standard property tax rate for the area, reducing the hotel’s taxable value from $176 million to $25 million saved it $4.4 million in property taxes in 2015-16 and could continue to do so.Spokespeople for the Trump campaign and Trump Hotels did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.Trump also fought to lower the assessment for his Briarcliff Manor, New York golf course from $13.5 million to just $1.4 million, the Westchester Journal News reported in September 2015. Yet in his 2015 and 2016 personal financial disclosures, Trump maintained that the golf course, which sits on 140 acres and has a 75,000-square-foot clubhouse, was worth more than $50 million.Trump followed an almost identical routine for his golf course outside Charlotte, North Carolina. The Washington Post reported that after Trump bought the course for $6 million in 2013, invested $10 million in renovations and saw real estate values rise in the area, the course’s value dropped from $22.7 million to $9.6 million on the tax rolls of rural Iredell County. Since the purchase price and renovations alone cost $16 million and the Charlotte area is experiencing a real estate boom, that new valuation seems low. (In this case, Trump’s personal financial disclosure filings in 2015 and 2016 list the property’s value between $5 million and $25 million, a range that accommodates both the higher and lower assessed values of the property.)Those valuation acrobatics in North Carolina saved Trump somewhere between $200,000 and $300,000 in total taxes and $167,000 in county taxes, the Charlotte Observer reported ― money that cuts directly into what the county has to spend on basic services like schools and roads. Trump also fought the town of East Fishkill, New York, to retroactively lower the value of his Trump National Hudson Valley golf course from $6 million to $4.6 million for the 2015 tax year. The town settled the case in April 2016, agreeing to reduce the value to Trump’s proposed $4.6 million. Meanwhile, Trump’s 2015 disclosure to the FEC said the property was worth somewhere between $5 million and $25 million. As part of the settlement, the town, county and local school district had to pay for an audit to determine if Trump’s company had paid any excess taxes in the previous year based on the new, lower, value. In the end, Trump managed to wring out refunds from the local governments: $31,367.06 from the Wappingers Central School District, $5,045.38 from Dutchess County, $4,141.25 from the town of East Fishkill, $1,066.06 from the East Fishkill Fire Department, and $306.99 from the public library.A self-proclaimed billionaire lawyering up to get a penny shy of $307 back from a local library may seem inane and cruel.

He hadn’t even made a summer league team, let along gotten drafted. Now, here he was at Concordia University, where he paid a $150 registration just for the right to show the San Antonio Spurs’ development league team that he had what it took to make it in.The process in the years before that were hard. He had gone to two community colleges. He had four daughters he needed to feed. He was just about to give up and pursue another one of his talents: cutting hair. But he stepped into that gym, and he impressed.Flash forward three years later to Tuesday night, and Simmons wasn’t only in the NBA. He was destroying Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and the heralded Golden State Warriors in their first game of the season.Simmons, 27, who joined the Spurs as a rookie last season, let the world know he belongs. He registered 20 points, three three-pointers, a +33 plus-minus, three rebounds and one absolutely monstrous monster block on two-time reigning MVP Stephen Curry. He also registered a buzzer-beating three to end the half for good measure.In what was supposed to be the first of many dominating nights for the Warriors following their signing of Kevin Durant, fans in the Bay Area instead could only watch on in horror as the Spurs dismantled the NBA’s newest super-team, 129–100. Kawhi Leonard was a big part of the reason for the dominating victory, as was LaMarcus Aldridge. But so was Simmons, much to the chagrin of his opponents.“We let Simmons come in and destroy us in the first half, and he continued it in the second half.

This surprising move comes as Trump staggers to the election finish line. Even worse for Trump is that he has built essentially no campaign infrastructure to help get out the vote during the early voting period and on Election Day.The large contributions he was raising through Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee sharing money with the Republican National Committee, was supposed to finance the party infrastructure to help turn out Republican voters to the polls. Trump also raised party money through a small donor committee called Trump Make America Great Again.Presidential campaigns are supposed to provide a flush of cash for the party. But Trump’s effort has raised significantly less than previous Republican candidates even though he has been able to collect much larger checks. That has left the RNC in the worst financial shape it has been in at this point in a presidential election since the turn of the millennium.Overall, Trump’s fundraising committees had transferred $58.8 million to the RNC by the end of September. That is less than half of the $125 million Mitt Romney’s fundraising committee raised for the RNC at the same point in 2012. It is comparable to the $57.8 million raised by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for the RNC through September during his 2008 presidential campaign.Republican National Committee Fundraising (2004-2016)The RNC has raised just $271 million through September, including the money brought in by Trump. This is the lowest amount the party has had at this point since the passage of the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law instituted higher contribution limits and banned party soft money. It is lower than the $332 million raised in 2012, the $310 million raised in 2008 and the $306 million raised in 2004 ― and that’s before adjusting for inflation.In fact, the totals raised by the RNC and by Trump for the RNC are actually inflated by special accounts that cannot be used on the actual campaign. In 2014, Republicans in Congress slipped a provision into the lame duck omnibus budget bill that created new accounts for political parties and expanded contribution limits. This provision created two separate party accounts, one for convention expenses and the second for headquarters expenses. These accounts could receive contributions totaling $100,200 from a single donor ― far above the $33,400 total that donors are limited to giving to the party’s general election fund. This change also extended the higher $100,200 contribution limit to the pre-existing separate legal account.This change meant that a single donor could make a $334,000 contribution to the RNC each year. You would think that the ability to raise such bloated checks would actually increase the amount the RNC would raise in 2016, but it clearly has not. The RNC has raised $53.6 million for these separate accounts. This leaves just $217 million available to be freely spent on election activities.The RNC now has little help coming. Trump campaign finance director Steven Mnuchin told The Washington Post on Tuesday, “We’ve kind of wound down.”Mnuchin added that Trump’s fundraising schedule had ended for the election and he would now focus solely on political activities. On Wednesday, with less than two weeks before the election, Trump flew into Washington, D.C., to officially christen his company’s new hotel. The campaign said it was a non-campaign stop.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It's another to see your grandmother witness it.,2016-10-26,"Grandma Belle and her eldest daughter, the author's mother, circa 1966.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58100f021a000071285bbc95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I call my grandmother every evening, as I leave the office and head to the subway. At 102, Belle Littenberg is the revered matriarch of our small family: She’s generous, indomitable, beloved.Grandma Belle was born in Brooklyn, New York City, in 1914, a few months shy of the outbreak of World War I. Six years before the 19th Amendment extended the right to vote to women. In 1936, she joined the thousands of white women who could truly exercise that right, when she cast her first vote in 1936, to reelect Franklin Roosevelt as president.She met her husband as a camp counselor in upstate New York, and spent much of the Second World War living on an Army base with him in Jim Crow Mississippi, where he worked as a dentist. They returned to Brooklyn, where my mother and aunt were born in quick succession during the baby boom of the early 1950s.And then, just a few years later, her husband died. Belle found herself a widow and a single mother of two, her livelihood – keeping the books at my grandfather’s practice – suddenly gone. She became a public school teacher, for the schedule, the pension and because of limited options that a married woman faced (even one with a Bachelor’s degree). She also wanted to be of service and spent years teaching and working as a guidance counselor. Belle fell in love with a math teacher and married him, adding two stepchildren to her brood.As her daughters grew up and prepared to leave their home in Long Island, New York City, a new feminist movement was brewing, hinting at the monumental shifts that would soon arrive. A cascade of legal and cultural changes that would begin reshaping the nation, opening up opportunities for a new generation that were barely imaginable when Belle was a girl. Soon women would take to the streets, raging against their restraints, demanding their fair share. Belle watched as her daughters reaped the benefits of this brave new world, sat in the audience as my mother became one of the first few hundred women to graduate from Yale. She watched, she worked, she was widowed yet again.Belle retired from teaching and began volunteering, playing more bridge and taking more trips, but still determined to serve. One of the things she likes least about old age is that she can no longer volunteer. “I feel as though I still have something I can contribute,” she told me, shortly after turning in 102 May.In the 1980s, grandchildren arrived, all five of them girls, all five of them born into a world of post-Second Wave feminism. We grew up taking for granted rights and opportunities our mothers had marched for, imagining giant lives for ourselves in a way that Belle wasn’t permitted. My sister and I were raised on the other side of the world, and my family made annual trips to Belle’s house off Rockaway Turnpike, where my sister and I put on dance performances on the pea-green shag carpet and got to know our mom’s mother.When I moved from Australia to America’s East Coast over a decade ago, I relished my new proximity to Belle – what a luxury to be able to visit her whenever I want, and without spending 20 hours on a plane. There are no dance performances now. Instead, I cook her dinner, and we play Scrabble. She is fiercely competitive, and keeps a list of obscure two- and three-letter words tucked inside her official Scrabble dictionary. My grandmother is unafraid of playing filthy words, and once beat my father at the 11th hour by scooping up a triple word score for one with an F (four points), a C (three points), and a K (5 points).In April last year, I sat with Grandma Belle and watched her witnessing Hillary Clinton announce on television that she was launching a campaign to become the first woman to be president of the United States.I hadn’t planned the visit to coincide with the campaign launch but, sitting on my grandmother’s bed as the crowd on Roosevelt Island cheered and waved, I was grateful for the fortuitous timing.As the primaries wore on, I asked her who she’d be voting for. And she said she was backing the woman who was once her senator. “Because she’s very well-qualified,” Belle said. “She’s been in government and knows what goes on in politics. And she’s a woman.”It has been unexpectedly moving for me to watch Clinton run, but in hindsight, it makes sense that her candidacy struck the emotional chord it did. She’s a woman of my mother’s vintage, who, like my mom, has spent her life navigating a sexist culture, changing herself in the ways she must in order to make the change she wishes to see.When Clinton keeps her cool answering a condescending question, I’m reminded that my mother has spent decades honing the same skill. When Clinton smiles through an insult from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, I recognize her expression, that pleasant and well-practiced mask concealing what I can only assume is righteous, rightful fury. I see my mother. Belle sees her daughter. “She’s like your mother,” she told me a few days after the final presidential debate. “She’s tough. She’s not taking anything from him.”Clinton’s performances in the debates have particularly impressed Belle and Trump’s attempts to belittle, while dominate his way through the three head-to-heads has unnerved her. The evening after the second debate, we talked about how Trump had prowled the stage, crowded into Clinton’s space and into every camera shot he could. Belle was in awe that the former New York senator could continue articulating policy positions despite such sinister distractions.As Nov. 8 draws near, and Clinton’s chances of winning rise to near-certain levels, my daily calls with Belle have become increasingly tinged with excitement and exhilaration. And with pride. “I’m so proud that after all this time, we’re going to do this,” she told me last week. “I have waited for this for so long.” A few weeks ago, she proudly voted for Clinton and mailed in her ballot. “She’s not perfect,” she told me. “But I know she’ll do a good job.”On election night, I’ll make the journey out to her place yet again ― this time, the timing is deliberate ― and we’ll raise a glass to the end of a bitter campaign, and, hopefully, the beginning of a new American era.Belle didn’t think she’d live to see a woman elected to the White House, and she’s had to live an exceptionally long life in order to witness it. She has watched as the world has changed around her – as wars remade maps and movements swept the nation, as we celebrated one milestone of progress after another. She remembers the progressive activist Frances Perkins, who became FDR’s Secretary of Labor. She remembers Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice. She remembers the pioneering gay rights activist Harvey Milk. She witnessed Sandra Day O’Connor be appointed to the Supreme Court, Madeleine Albright become secretary of state and President Barack Obama elected as the nation’s first African-American commander-in-chief.On the night of Nov. 8, she hopes she’ll be watching another first, as Clinton wins the White House. And I’ll get to witness that."

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is staying as far away from Donald Trump as possible this election. The Pennsylvania Republican’s race is one of the most competitive in the nation, and he’s trying to convince a state that’s leaning blue to re-elect him, even though he once ran the conservative Club for Growth and has one of the most conservative voting records in Congress. Unwilling to alienate either side, he’s just not taking one. Toomey’s balancing act as he tries to attract split-ticket voters may be best illustrated by two ads his campaign recently released. The first goes after his competitor, Democrat Katie McGinty, as a “blank check” for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The narrator says Toomey will “fight Clinton’s liberal agenda.” The second ad, in contrast, touts kind words that Democratic politicians like Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) ― Clinton’s vice presidential running mate ― have said about Toomey. If a viewer didn’t know the Toomey was a conservative Republican, it’d be hard to tell from this spot. “It’s an important difference between the candidates: Pat Toomey has shown independence and leadership, while Katie McGinty would be a rubber stamp for Hillary Clinton and the party bosses who hand-picked her for the Senate,” Toomey spokesman Ted Kwong said.A Democratic media tracker said they hadn’t seen the “Blank Check” ad in Philadelphia and hadn’t seen the Democratic voices ad outside of the city. Kwong did not answer a question about whether these ads are airing in different parts of the state and are meant for different audiences that are either more liberal or more conservative.But Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the two spots showed that Toomey is still trying to have it both ways ― without taking a real position.“Pat Toomey is just another typical, gutless politician who won’t give a straight answer to an easy question,” Weiner said. “In this instance he refuses to stand up to Donald Trump, but prefers to tell different people different things, which isn’t leadership, it’s pandering.”At a rally in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, Kaine also took issue with Toomey using him in an ad:I heard...that Senator Toomey has an ad out where he quotes me. I said something positive about him in a newspaper story a couple years ago. I think I said he was a decent person, a civil person. I say what I believe, but the issue is more than just that. It’s whether somebody stands up for your values.Toomey isn’t the only Republican to have a tough time assessing where to come down on Trump. Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.), who is running for the Senate, said he’s not going to tell voters his choice for president. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who has now changed his mind about his endorsement four times, said Wednesday that he won’t confirm whether he’ll pick Clinton, Trump or someone else. Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), who is also running for Senate, may not vote at all. This coy approach has its risks. In 2014, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, who was trying to unseat then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), wouldn’t say whether she voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. In an interview with the Louisville Courier-Journal, she repeatedly refused to answer the question, leading to a widely circulated, painful video.HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate of publicly available polling in the race shows Toomey and McGinty neck and neck.This piece has been updated with Kaine’s comments.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

89,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Latest Scare Tactic: Claiming Clinton Will Cut Social Security And Medicare,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-social-security-cuts_us_580fe243e4b02b1d9e639577,Hillary Clinton has pledged not to cut benefits.,2016-10-26,"Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Sanford, Florida, on Tuesday. He made false claims about Hillary Clinton at a rally in Tallahassee later that evening.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580fe4ff170000232face26e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Hillary Clinton will cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, despite her clear promises not to do so.“We are going to save Social Security,” the Republican presidential nominee told supporters at a campaign rally in Tallahassee, Florida. “She is going to cut your Social Security and your Medicare.”Trump has made the accusation before, including at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.As early as February, Clinton pledged not to cut Social Security benefits. She also promised to enhance benefits for certain vulnerable groups. The Democratic presidential nominee said at the third presidential debate that to close the program’s funding gap and finance benefit increases, she would ask wealthy Americans, including herself, to pay more into the program.Clinton also has never indicated she would cut Medicare benefits. She says she plans to reduce Medicare’s costs by empowering it to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies, according to her campaign website. Stephen Miller, a Trump campaign policy adviser, pointed to Clinton’s comments in a private speech to bankers in 2013, in which she called the Simpson-Bowles reform proposal of 2010 “the right framework.” “That is her private, real position as opposed to her public position,” Miller said. The comments from her speech were disclosed in the hacked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta published by Wikileaks earlier this month.The Simpson-Bowles plan indeed proposed significant Social Security and Medicare cuts. In the speech, however, Clinton declined to state her view on specific benefit cuts, instead embracing the overall structure of the Simpson-Bowles recommendations.Clinton went on to explain what she meant by the “right framework.” “We have to restrain spending, we have to have adequate revenues, and we have to incentivize growth. It’s a three-part formula,” she said. “The specifics can be negotiated depending upon whether we’re acting in good faith or not.”The Clinton campaign declined to comment on the meaning of Clinton’s remarks, saying the campaign refuses to verify the authenticity of the hacked emails. The campaign instead referred HuffPost to fact-checks by CNN and FactCheck.org claiming the allegation was false, as well as to progressive leaders’ comments praising Clinton as a champion of Social Security and Medicare.Trump has promised that he would protect Social Security and Medicare but has not provided any substantive proposals for avoiding cuts. In the third debate, he balked at a question about whether he’d consider a so-called grand bargain to reform Social Security and Medicare that combined benefit cuts favored by conservatives with tax increases preferred by liberals. Instead, Trump vaguely suggested that he would improve the programs’ finances by growing the economy through tax cuts and repealing Obamacare.Growing the economy can improve Social Security’s solvency, but there are no credible projections in which economic growth alone is enough to close the program’s funding gap. And as Clinton noted during the third debate, Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare, which extended Medicare’s lifespan through reforms that saved some $800 billion, would hurt Medicare’s finances.In the past, Trump has claimed he could close Social Security’s funding gap by cracking down on waste, fraud and abuse. In reality, the rate of overpayment in the program is far too low to generate the savings needed to address its financial shortfall. Of course, it’s possible Trump is uninterested in coming up with plausible plans to fix Social Security and Medicare’s finances because he actually plans to cut benefits himself. In a 2011 interview, he endorsed the idea of reducing benefits but said politicians should avoid admitting their plans to do so due to the unpopularity of cuts.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The outlet spoke with a rep for E! who said, “Full production has resumed on ‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians.’” A separate source told People that the 36-year-old “just wants to be with her kids and out of public,” but made the choice to began filming on her own.That news contradicts an earlier report from Entertainment Tonight, which said that Kardashian was present during filming for “KUWTK,” but was not yet participating in the filming herself. E!

91,POLITICS,Why Police Reform Needs To Be An Inside Job,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/future-of-police-reform_us_580679bde4b0b994d4c22098,We'll only see change if they overhaul the culture of law enforcement.,2016-10-26,"In this Nov. 24, 2015, file photo, Chicago police officers line up outside the District 1 central headquarters in Chicago, during a protest for the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. (AP Photo/Paul Beaty File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d692ef2250000340089de5a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHICAGO ― Even staunch advocates of policing admit that major changes are needed to salvage the institution’s reputation and efficacy after two years of harsh scrutiny over racism, secrecy and lack of accountability.They disagree, however, on how to best do that.The discussion around police reform hit a major flashpoint last November with the release of a video showing a Chicago cop shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times as the teen walked away. “Because it was so stark, there was no denying how horrible it was,” Craig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, told The Huffington Post ahead of last week’s Chicago Ideas Week conference. He and several other policing experts met there to discuss the police force of the future ― with discussions ranging from better officer recruitment to full-scale abolition.“But perhaps more important, what caught even the most causal observer, was what happened afterwards,” Futterman added. Footage of the fatal shooting was only made public after an anonymous tipster told Futterman it existed, and he started a yearlong legal battle to have it released. In addition to discrediting the police’s official narrative, the video galvanized already growing scrutiny around problems that reform advocates say are pervasive in police departments across the U.S. Some law enforcement officials, including FBI Director James Comey, have responded by invoking the “viral video effect” ― a popular but discredited theory that filming police has actually resulted in higher overall crime rates and fewer arrests. But Futterman says videos only reveal problems that have been there all along.Rationale for police misconduct has changed from “justified shootings” to “acts of self-defense” to “one bad apple,” he said, noting that videos force departments to reckon with patterns that have led to that evolution.“We shouldn’t forget the whole saying: One bad apple spoils the whole bunch,” Futterman said. “We’ve had systemic issues with regard to racism and brutality for years. That goes beyond the bad acts of a single person.” Eugene O’Donnell, a former New York City police officer and prosecutor who now teaches at John Jay College, took issue with the belief that Americans are generally unhappy with the police. He argued instead that “elites” ― like journalists and politicians ― have led much of the anger directed at law enforcement.Still, he acknowledged that departments can’t go on with business as usual. “I think the profession has been irreparably damaged and we have to figure out what’s next,” O’Donnell said. Many of his peers support community policing ― a strategy that involves officers fostering trust by patrolling a specific area to build relationships and familiarize themselves with the issues there ― but O’Donnell said that tactic ignores the reality of police work.“Built into the police role is that they make enemies with people,” he said. “That’s the way policing works.” O’Donnell said he believes the current climate of scrutiny could lead to a longer-term crisis of no one wanting to be a cop.A dearth of recruits has prompted departments to lower their hiring standards related to such issues as exam performance, drug tests and academic qualifications, he said. About 1 percent of police forces nationwide currently require a four-year degree; nearly a decade ago, 75 percent of forces required one. “I don’t know what [police] are allowed to do once they get hired,” O’Donnell said, noting that widespread criticisms of law enforcement have resulted in some officers feeling like they can’t use traditional policing methods.President Barack Obama established a task force on 21st-century policing in 2014. The group recommended in a report released the following year that police departments should improve how they collect data, particularly regarding use of force. Cedric Alexander, a task force member and public safety director in DeKalb County, Georgia, said better data collection could be a step toward building better community-police relations and rooting out excessive force.“I think you’re going to see a much better police department if you can see the data and see what they’re doing the street,” Alexander said during a panel discussion at Chicago Ideas Week. Marc Lamont Hill, an African-American studies professor at Morehouse College and former HuffPost Live host, was the panelist most wary of the proposed reforms. He comes from a self-described radical background, and said the institution of policing is too broken to mend because it was built on a foundations of racism, brutality and secrecy. In the immediate term, Hill suggests decreasing the overcriminalization of small infractions, which are overwhelmingly enforced against black and Latino Americans. Something like selling CDs in front of a store should be regulated by a community entity rather than an armed police force, he said. The cost of perpetuating bad practices, Hill said, is loss of human life.“Take Eric Garner ― that’s ticky-tacky policing,” he said. “That’s ‘I gotta stop a guy selling loose cigarettes because those type of minor offenses lead to major ones.’ Bad policing causes people to die.” Futterman, the University of Chicago professor, said the tight-knit, fraternal culture of police departments has contributed to the challenge of overhauling the institution. There is a dangerous “us versus them” mentality that has abetted misconduct ― and punished whistleblowers trying to do the right thing.“If you buck the official narrative, you get crushed. Not just by the rank-and-file, but by the entire department,” Futterman said. “That could mean the end of your career, the end of your life, the end of your family.” The person who alerted him about the McDonald footage, for example, still works in Chicago law enforcement and has chosen to remain anonymous. Moving forward, Futterman said departments must fire officers who lie on reports and criminally prosecute anyone who retaliates against their peers for blowing the whistle on misconduct. “If you’re going to lie, if you submit false reports, put people in jail who shouldn’t be in jail, if you’re going to abuse your power to wantonly hurt someone who is weaker than you, you absolutely have no business wearing a badge,” he said.

He and several other policing experts met there to discuss the police force of the future ― with discussions ranging from better officer recruitment to full-scale abolition.“But perhaps more important, what caught even the most causal observer, was what happened afterwards,” Futterman added. Footage of the fatal shooting was only made public after an anonymous tipster told Futterman it existed, and he started a yearlong legal battle to have it released. In addition to discrediting the police’s official narrative, the video galvanized already growing scrutiny around problems that reform advocates say are pervasive in police departments across the U.S. Some law enforcement officials, including FBI Director James Comey, have responded by invoking the “viral video effect” ― a popular but discredited theory that filming police has actually resulted in higher overall crime rates and fewer arrests. But Futterman says videos only reveal problems that have been there all along.Rationale for police misconduct has changed from “justified shootings” to “acts of self-defense” to “one bad apple,” he said, noting that videos force departments to reckon with patterns that have led to that evolution.“We shouldn’t forget the whole saying: One bad apple spoils the whole bunch,” Futterman said. “We’ve had systemic issues with regard to racism and brutality for years. That goes beyond the bad acts of a single person.” Eugene O’Donnell, a former New York City police officer and prosecutor who now teaches at John Jay College, took issue with the belief that Americans are generally unhappy with the police. He argued instead that “elites” ― like journalists and politicians ― have led much of the anger directed at law enforcement.Still, he acknowledged that departments can’t go on with business as usual. “I think the profession has been irreparably damaged and we have to figure out what’s next,” O’Donnell said. Many of his peers support community policing ― a strategy that involves officers fostering trust by patrolling a specific area to build relationships and familiarize themselves with the issues there ― but O’Donnell said that tactic ignores the reality of police work.“Built into the police role is that they make enemies with people,” he said. “That’s the way policing works.” O’Donnell said he believes the current climate of scrutiny could lead to a longer-term crisis of no one wanting to be a cop.A dearth of recruits has prompted departments to lower their hiring standards related to such issues as exam performance, drug tests and academic qualifications, he said. About 1 percent of police forces nationwide currently require a four-year degree; nearly a decade ago, 75 percent of forces required one. “I don’t know what [police] are allowed to do once they get hired,” O’Donnell said, noting that widespread criticisms of law enforcement have resulted in some officers feeling like they can’t use traditional policing methods.President Barack Obama established a task force on 21st-century policing in 2014. The group recommended in a report released the following year that police departments should improve how they collect data, particularly regarding use of force. Cedric Alexander, a task force member and public safety director in DeKalb County, Georgia, said better data collection could be a step toward building better community-police relations and rooting out excessive force.“I think you’re going to see a much better police department if you can see the data and see what they’re doing the street,” Alexander said during a panel discussion at Chicago Ideas Week. Marc Lamont Hill, an African-American studies professor at Morehouse College and former HuffPost Live host, was the panelist most wary of the proposed reforms. He comes from a self-described radical background, and said the institution of policing is too broken to mend because it was built on a foundations of racism, brutality and secrecy. In the immediate term, Hill suggests decreasing the overcriminalization of small infractions, which are overwhelmingly enforced against black and Latino Americans. Something like selling CDs in front of a store should be regulated by a community entity rather than an armed police force, he said. The cost of perpetuating bad practices, Hill said, is loss of human life.“Take Eric Garner ― that’s ticky-tacky policing,” he said. “That’s ‘I gotta stop a guy selling loose cigarettes because those type of minor offenses lead to major ones.’ Bad policing causes people to die.” Futterman, the University of Chicago professor, said the tight-knit, fraternal culture of police departments has contributed to the challenge of overhauling the institution. There is a dangerous “us versus them” mentality that has abetted misconduct ― and punished whistleblowers trying to do the right thing.“If you buck the official narrative, you get crushed. Not just by the rank-and-file, but by the entire department,” Futterman said. “That could mean the end of your career, the end of your life, the end of your family.” The person who alerted him about the McDonald footage, for example, still works in Chicago law enforcement and has chosen to remain anonymous. Moving forward, Futterman said departments must fire officers who lie on reports and criminally prosecute anyone who retaliates against their peers for blowing the whistle on misconduct. “If you’re going to lie, if you submit false reports, put people in jail who shouldn’t be in jail, if you’re going to abuse your power to wantonly hurt someone who is weaker than you, you absolutely have no business wearing a badge,” he said. Reconciling the longstanding practices with the new expectations is part of the issue, Futterman said. And he agreed it would be difficult for the officers. “If you’ve taught me for all these years that policing means laying hands on more and more people, and you’re telling me not to do that, what do I do now?” Futterman said. “The ground has moved beneath them.” "
