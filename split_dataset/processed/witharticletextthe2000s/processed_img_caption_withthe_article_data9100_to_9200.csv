Doctors looked inside her ear and confirmed a spider had made itself at home there.“I was terrified as I could feel the movement of a creature in my ear,” the woman said, according to The Sun. “I couldn’t think of anything and was petrified when the doctor confirmed the presence of a spider in my ear.”Dr. Santosh Shivaswamy at Columbia Asia Hospital stressed that it’s one thing to remove a foreign object from an ear canal and another to remove a living creature ― especially when the patient knows exactly what it is.“When a living [creature] makes its way inside a human ear, the patient’s anxiety makes it difficult to continue the procedure,” she said, according to The Mirror.Fortunately, the eight-legged squatter calmly left her ear on its own, as the video shows.In other instances, the victim wasn’t as lucky.In 2015, a spider was found weaving a web inside of a woman’s ear cavity in China. When doctors tried to remove it, the arachnid responded aggressively, causing her even more pain.Then in 2014, writer Annie Stoltie wrote of how a beetle climbed into her ear while camping in the Adirondack Mountains with family.The pain the creature caused her was described as “a full-body shock from my toes to my temples,” she wrote. “With every stab I saw a flash of light.”H/T MashableCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article described the spider as an insect."

5,QUEER VOICES,Gay Rapper Releases First Music Video Since 2014 Gay-Bashing Broke 7 Facial Bones,"Pollo Del Mar , ContributorDrag queen on the SF social, political, editorial and fundrais...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gay-rapper-releases-first-music-video-since-2014-gay_us_593c2dfde4b094fa859f18df,The incident left him too traumatized to record for nearly two years.,2017-06-10,<p>Rapper Jipsta is back with his first music video since a 2014 gay-bashing broke seven broken bones in his face.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593c39d31d00004900cc23cd.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In March 2014, JP Masterson was on top of the world. With a new single blazing up the charts, the out rapper known professionally as Jipsta headed to Greenwich Village to celebrate a relationship milestone with his partner. By morning, however, the Billboard recording artist was a bloodied mess, undergoing surgery in an area hospital.“It all stemmed from me holding my partner’s hand, on our ten year anniversary, at 12 o’clock,” recalled Masterson of the violent attack in a New York subway that left him with seven broken bones in his face, effectively ended promotion of his sophomore album Turnt Up and left him too traumatized to record for nearly two years.“It was really rough afterward,” Jipsta told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl in a recent interview. “I had writers block for a really, really long time.”Now fully recovered physically, the emotional healing is still ongoing from the still-unsolved hate crime. The artist acknowledges being almost apologetic about discussing “the incident,” since he does not want it to appear he is “milking it.” However, finally returning to the recording studio helped channel the experience in a creative way. With the aid of long-time collaborators DJ Ranny -- with whom he released the 2014 ""Body Pop,"" which reach No. 11 on Billboard Dance Charts -- and Grammy-winning producer Chris Cox, he released third album Ban2oozle earlier this year.""There's some shit that happened in my life that just poured out,"" he relayed to Podomatic's No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. Some tracks from the album, specifically ""Breathe,” were directly inspired by the incident. ""After that happened to me, I wanted to talk about it,"" said Masterson, a school psychologist by day and performer by night, ""But not have people be like, 'Oh God!'"" In May, Jipsta released a music video for the album's title track and lead single. It is his first official release since the attack, which left physical reminders in the form of scars next to his left eye, and took a significant toll mentally. ""When I went to do this album, and be back in the public eye -- knowing I feel some type of way about my face -- I got to come so correct,"" said Jipsta of the Cox-produced song and accompanying video, which was primarily filmed last February in the Grammy Award-recipient's Las Vegas home. Like much of the album, largely produced by Masterson and Cox, formerly of remix super-duo Thunderpuss, ""Ban2oozle"" leans more decidedly hip-hop than Jipsta's early work. Breakout hits like ""Nasty Boy/Nasty Girl"" featuring Inaya Day, ""Party of the Year"" with Sandy B and the George Michael cover ""I Want Your Sex"" were all much more circuit-oriented.""I love those songs, but musically I would have done them differently,"" said Jipsta, who admits he sometimes ""cringes"" at the production value of earlier releases. ""You progress musically and in the studio, and I almost wish this was my first album, because it is me 100-percent.""WATCH: Jipsta’s ‘comeback’ video “Ban2oozle”""Ban2oozle is more of what I really, really wanted to do,"" Jipsta went on to say, ""But I probably couldn't do with a first album.""Feeling ""rejuvenated,"" the ""hunger"" he knew in the early part of public life has returned. Masterson says working with long-time friend Cox was the right move at this point in his career. ""Everybody thinks he just does Whitney Houston, circuit, big room anthems,"" he stated, calling the producer ""gangster,"" ""But he can kill any type of genre.""The truth is, Chris Cox's origin is in hip hop,"" Jipsta stated. ""He's like a hip hop encyclopedia, and he and I geek out on that.""The harder-edged sound will invariably continue parallels to other New York-based gay rappers, Jipsta recognizes. Throughout his career, he's drawn comparisons to Cazwell, for example, but Masterson says they are ""two totally different artists.""""Do I wish I had seven million views on a video?"" he asked. ""Of course I do, but I also work in an elementary school... I'd love to have dicks just all around me, but I have to make choices.""For Masterson, the decision to teach students ""you can't run around acting crazy"" easily trumps (so to speak) salacious videos to elicit views or listens. That said, however, he feels ""Ban2oozle"" speaks for itself -- especially in context.""In the wake of 'the incident,' the American culture, we do love to tear people down, but we also love a comeback story,"" he said. ""I wanted to record an album where people could say, 'Damn! That bitch really came back!'"" Jipsta concluded. ""I do feel that has been the response.""LISTEN: Gay Rapper Jipsta discusses his 2014 gay-bashing, today’s political climate, new album Ban2oozle & more on Party Foul Radio. Other recent celebrity guests include Dustin Lance Black, former WWE superstar Melina, Erasure’s Andy Bell and more."
6,HEALTHY LIVING,12 Habits Of Genuine People,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/12-habits-of-genuine-people_us_5925d658e4b0aa7207986a37,There’s an enormous amount of research suggesting that emotional intelligence (EQ) is critical to your performance at work,2017-06-10,<p>Genuine people have a profound impact upon everyone they encounter. Dr. Travis Bradberry unveils the unique habits that cause them to radiate with energy and confidence.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5925d6822000001b0016eb32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s an enormous amount of research suggesting that emotional intelligence (EQ) is critical to your performance at work. TalentSmart has tested the EQ of more than a million people and found that it explains 58% of success in all types of jobs.People with high EQs make $29,000 more annually than people with low EQs. Ninety percent of top performers have high EQs, and a single-point increase in your EQ adds $1,300 to your salary. I could go on and on.Suffice it to say, emotional intelligence is a powerful way to focus your energy in one direction with tremendous results.But there’s a catch. Emotional intelligence won’t do a thing for you if you aren’t genuine.A recent study from the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington found that people don’t accept demonstrations of emotional intelligence at face value. They’re too skeptical for that. They don’t just want to see signs of emotional intelligence. They want to know that it’s genuine—that your emotions are authentic.According to lead researcher Christina Fong, when it comes to your coworkers,“They are not just mindless automatons. They think about the emotions they see and care whether they are sincere or manipulative.” The same study found that sincere leaders are far more effective at motivating people because they inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that authenticity is important to them, but genuine leaders walk their talk every day.It’s not enough to just go through the motions, trying to demonstrate qualities that are associated with emotional intelligence. You have to be genuine.You can do a gut check to find out how genuine you are by comparing your own behavior to that of people who are highly genuine. Consider the hallmarks of genuine people and see how you stack up.“Authenticity requires a certain measure of vulnerability, transparency, and integrity,” -Janet Louise Stephenson 1. Genuine people don’t try to make people like them. Genuine people are who they are. They know that some people will like them, and some won’t. And they’re okay with that. It’s not that they don’t care whether or not other people will like them but simply that they’re not going to let that get in the way of doing the right thing. They’re willing to make unpopular decisions and to take unpopular positions if that’s what needs to be done.Since genuine people aren’t desperate for attention, they don’t try to show off. They know that when they speak in a friendly, confident, and concise manner, people are much more attentive to and interested in what they have to say than if they try to show that they’re important. People catch on to your attitude quickly and are more attracted to the right attitude than what or how many people you know.2. They don’t pass judgment. Genuine people are open-minded, which makes them approachable and interesting to others. No one wants to have a conversation with someone who has already formed an opinion and is not willing to listen.Having an open mind is crucial in the workplace, as approachability means access to new ideas and help. To eliminate preconceived notions and judgment, you need to see the world through other people’s eyes. This doesn’t require you to believe what they believe or condone their behavior; it simply means you quit passing judgment long enough to truly understand what makes them tick. Only then can you let them be who they are.3. They forge their own paths. Genuine people don’t derive their sense of pleasure and satisfaction from the opinions of others. This frees them up to follow their own internal compasses. They know who they are and don’t pretend to be anything else. Their direction comes from within, from their own principles and values. They do what they believe to be the right thing, and they’re not swayed by the fact that somebody might not like it.4. They are generous. We’ve all worked with people who constantly hold something back, whether it’s knowledge or resources. They act as if they’re afraid you’ll outshine them if they give you access to everything you need to do your job. Genuine people are unfailingly generous with whom they know, what they know, and the resources they have access to. They want you to do well more than anything else because they’re team players and they’re confident enough to never worry that your success might make them look bad. In fact, they believe that your success is their success.5. They treat EVERYONE with respect. Whether interacting with their biggest clients or servers taking their drink orders, genuine people are unfailingly polite and respectful. They understand that no matter how nice they are to the people they have lunch with, it’s all for naught if those people witnesses them behaving badly toward others. Genuine people treat everyone with respect because they believe they’re no better than anyone else.6. They aren’t motivated by material things. Genuine people don’t need shiny, fancy stuff in order to feel good. It’s not that they think it’s wrong to go out and buy the latest and greatest items to show off their status; they just don’t need to do this to be happy. Their happiness comes from within, as well as from the simpler pleasures—such as friends, family, and a sense of purpose—that make life rich.7. They are trustworthy. People gravitate toward those who are genuine because they know they can trust them. It is difficult to like someone when you don’t know who they really are and how they really feel. Genuine people mean what they say, and if they make a commitment, they keep it. You’ll never hear a truly genuine person say, “Oh, I just said that to make the meeting end faster.” You know that if they say something, it’s because they believe it to be true.8. They are thick-skinned. Genuine people have a strong enough sense of self that they don’t go around seeing offense that isn’t there. If somebody criticizes one of their ideas, they don’t treat this as a personal attack. There’s no need for them to jump to conclusions, feel insulted, and start plotting their revenge. They’re able to objectively evaluate negative and constructive feedback, accept what works, put it into practice, and leave the rest of it behind without developing hard feelings.9. They put away their phones. Nothing turns someone off to you like a mid-conversation text message or even a quick glance at your phone. When genuine people commit to a conversation, they focus all of their energy on the conversation. You will find that conversations are more enjoyable and effective when you immerse yourself in them. When you robotically approach people with small talk and are tethered to your phone, this puts their brains on autopilot and prevents them from having any real affinity for you. Genuine people create connection and find depth even in short, everyday conversations. Their genuine interest in other people makes it easy for them to ask good questions and relate what they’re told to other important facets of the speaker’s life. These are some of the skills we teach in our emotional intelligence certification program.10. They aren’t driven by ego. Genuine people don’t make decisions based on their egos because they don’t need the admiration of others in order to feel good about themselves. Likewise, they don’t seek the limelight or try to take credit for other people’s accomplishments. They simply do what needs to be done without saying, “Hey, look at me!”11. They aren’t hypocrites. Genuine people practice what they preach. They don’t tell you to do one thing and then do the opposite themselves. That’s largely due to their self-awareness. Many hypocrites don’t even recognize their mistakes. They’re blind to their own weaknesses. Genuine people, on the other hand, fix their own problems first.12. They don’t brag. We’ve all worked with people who can’t stop talking about themselves and their accomplishments. Have you ever wondered why? They boast and brag because they’re insecure and worried that if they don’t point out their accomplishments, no one will notice. Genuine people don’t need to brag. They’re confident in their accomplishments, but they also realize that when you truly do something that matters, it stands on its own merits, regardless of how many people notice or appreciate it.Bringing It All TogetherGenuine people know who they are. They are confident enough to be comfortable in their own skin. They are firmly grounded in reality, and they’re truly present in each moment because they’re not trying to figure out someone else’s agenda or worrying about their own.What other qualities do you see in genuine people?

Driving it off the lot is pure bliss,2017-06-10,"<p>Dr. Travis Bradberry explains the four things that, when people do them, predict the demise of a relationship with 93% accuracy. He offers proven strategies for eliminating these “Four Horseman of the Apocalypse” from your relationships at work and home.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5939af8319000020003e5437.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new relationship—whether personal or professional—is a lot like buying a new car. Driving it off the lot is pure bliss. And like a car, when a relationship breaks down, it’s overwhelming. A trained eye knows when a car is in trouble. The same is true of relationships, and you can be your own mechanic.Dr. John Gottman and his colleagues at the University of Washington discovered four clear indicators of relationship failure, dubbed “The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.” The Four Horsemen are so profound that their presence predicts the demise of a relationship with 93 percent accuracy.The researchers in Washington made their predictions with married couples, but these behaviors also wreak havoc in the workplace. TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and compared the quality of their working relationships to their job performance. We’ve found that 90 percent of top performers are skilled at managing relationships, and they avoid The Four Horsemen like the plague. We’ve also found that The Four Horsemen are all too common in the workplace, and when they rear their ugly heads, relationships, teamwork, and performance suffer.The Four Horsemen of the ApocalypseThe Four Horsemen represent the counterproductive acts we can easily fall victim to when our emotions get the better of us. As you read each of the Horsemen and consider its relevance in your relationships, remember that conflict itself is not a problem. Conflict is actually a normal and (ideally) productive part of two people with different needs and interests working together. The amount of conflict between two people has no bearing on the success of the relationship. It’s how conflict is handled that determines a relationship’s success, and the Four Horsemen’s presence means conflict is not being dealt with constructively or productively. Follow the strategies provided for overcoming each of the Four Horseman, and your relationships are bound to be successful.The 1st Horseman: CRITICISMCriticism is not to be confused with delivering feedback or otherwise seeking improvement or change in another person. Criticism becomes, well, criticism when it isn’t constructive (“This report is terrible.”). Criticism, in its most troubling form, focuses on the individual’s personality, character, or interests rather than the specific action or behavior you’d like to see changed (“You are terrible at writing. You’re so disorganized and tangential.”). It’s one thing to criticize without being constructive; it’s another to go after someone for something they are unable to change.Overcoming CRITICISMIf you often find yourself criticizing when you planned on being constructive, it’s best if you don’t deliver your feedback and commentary until you’ve planned ahead. You’ll need to think through what you’re going to say and stick to your script in order to remain constructive and avoid criticism. It’s also best if you focus your feedback on a single specific behavior, as your reactions to multiple behaviors at once can easily be perceived as criticism. If you find that you cannot deliver feedback without generalizing to the other person’s personality, you’re better off saying nothing at all.The 2nd Horseman: CONTEMPTContempt is any open sign of disrespect toward another. Contempt often involves comments that aim to take the other person down a notch, as well as direct insults. Contempt is also seen in indirect and veiled forms, such as rolling of the eyes and couching insults within “humor.”Overcoming CONTEMPTContempt stems from a lack of interest in the other person. When you find that you don’t enjoy or admire someone—perhaps there are things about him or her that used to be interesting or charming and now they’ve lost their luster—contempt can surface unexpectedly. If your disinterest is unavoidable and the relationship is one that isn’t going anywhere, such as a family member or coworker, then you need to focus on taking small steps forward. People who manage relationships well are able to see the benefit of connecting with many different people, even those they are not fond of. Common ground, no matter how small, is a commodity to be sought and cherished. In the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln, “I do not like that man. I must get to know him better.”The 3rd Horseman: DEFENSIVENESSDenying responsibility, making excuses, meeting one complaint with another, and other forms of defensiveness are problematic, because they prevent a conflict from reaching any sort of resolution. Defensiveness only serves to accelerate the anxiety and tension experienced by both parties, and this makes it difficult to focus on the larger issues at hand that need to be resolved.Overcoming DEFENSIVENESSTo overcome defensiveness, you have to be willing to listen carefully to the other party’s complaint, even if you don’t see things the same way. This doesn’t mean you have to agree with them. Instead, you focus on fully understanding the other person’s perspective so that you can work together towards resolving the conflict. It’s critical that you work to remain calm. Once you understand why the other person is upset, it’s much easier to find common ground than if you dismiss their opinions defensively.The 4th Horseman: STONEWALLINGStonewalling is what happens when one person shuts the discussion down by refusing to respond. Examples of stonewalling include the silent treatment, being emotionally distant or devoid of emotion, and ignoring the other person completely. Stonewalling is problematic, because it aggravates the person being stonewalled and it prevents the two from working on resolving the conflict together.Overcoming STONEWALLINGThe key to overcoming stonewalling is to participate in the discussion. If you’re stonewalling because the circumstances are leaving you feeling overwhelmed, let the other person know how you’re feeling and ask for some time to think before continuing the discussion. Maintain eye contact and a forward posture and nod your head to let the other person know that you are engaged in the discussion and listening even when you don’t have something to say. If you stonewall as a matter of practice, you need to realize that participating in discussions and working together to resolve conflict are the only ways to keep your relationships from crumbling. Emotional intelligence training is a great way to overcome all of the horsemen, including stonewalling.Want to learn more from me? Check out my book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."

His biggest issue was that America could not trust a president that uses Dijon mustard on his food.“Take a look at [Obama] ordering his burger with a very special condiment,” Hannity said on his program at the time, before showing a clip of POTUS at a Virginia restaurant.“I’m gonna have your very basic cheddar cheeseburger, medium-well,” Obama told the cashier. “I just want mustard, no ketchup. You got a spicy mustard or something like that? Dijon mustard or something?”“I hope you enjoyed that fancy burger,” Hannity shot back.Eight years later, the U.S. now has a president who has bragged about sexually assaulting women, is accused of colluding with Russia to help him win an election, golfs more than he leads, ignores climate change evidence, and petulantly shoves world leaders when he doesn’t get to be the center of attention.Oh, he also eats his steaks well-done with ketchup. It’s unclear why Hannity’s investigation never led to the removal of President Obama, but at least the American people can finally rest assured that these types of scandals are finally over."

He will be succeeded by Naruhito, 57.In a vote televised live on NHK public television, the upper house of parliament passed the bill with a handful of lawmakers sitting out the vote. It cleared the more powerful lower house last week.“Abdication will take place for the first time in 200 years, reminding me once again of how important an issue this is for the foundation of our nation, its long history, and its future,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters after the vote.Now the government has to hammer out the details of the abdication, including the timing, but media reports have said it is likely to take place at the end of 2018, which would mark three decades on the Chrysanthemum throne for Akihito.The abdication, the first since 1817, appears to have support among the general population, who view it as a sign of changing times.“In essence, the emperor is resigning, which I feel was an issue of personal thought,” said Masayoshi Matsumoto, a 47-year-old animator.“People live much longer these days. I think while on the one hand it pains him not to be able to carry out his duties properly, he may also wonder why he should have to do the job this long.”The government also has to ensure the continuity of a monarchy beset by a shortage of male heirs and shrinking pool of imperial family members. Women are not allowed to inherit the throne and leave the family upon marriage, an issue highlighted last month with the announcement that the Emperor’s oldest granddaughter will marry a commoner.The law, which applies only to Akihito and not to future emperors, included a resolution to debate letting female royals stay in the imperial family after marriage but did not touch on the controversial topic of allowing women to inherit.“I believe we will look into all these issues rather broadly,” said Koichi Hagiuda, deputy chief cabinet secretary, at a news conference.Many conservatives oppose the idea of an empress, but some Japanese think the monarchy should also move with the times on this.“I have no problem with an empress, there are plenty of women royals ruling overseas,” said Yukinori Kumakiri, 61-year-old man working for an electrical company.“After all, the emperor is a symbol, it’s not as if they really have power. They’re a representative of the Japanese people and man or woman shouldn’t matter.”"

The female elephant had been killed by poachers, her skin peeled clean off her body. Warning: Disturbing images below.Elephant poaching has long been an issue in Myanmar, but there was something unusual and troubling about the grisly discovery: The endangered Asian elephant was female, and she’d been killed for her skin. Unlike their African counterparts, female Asian elephants don’t boast the long tusks that poachers seek for ivory. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, this has allowed Myanmar’s female elephants to largely escape the deadly interest of poachers, resulting in imbalanced wild populations in which females significantly outnumber males.But a recent — and indiscriminate — spate of elephant killings in Myanmar suggests a new threat is facing all of the nation’s elephants, and possibly those in other countries, too. It’s no longer just the tusks that poachers are after, but elephant skin and other body parts.WWF said this week that at least 20 killed and skinned Asian elephants, including females and juveniles, have been found in the Bago Yoma and Ayeyarwady regions of Myanmar since January. “This is a very serious poaching crisis we’re facing,” Rohit Singh, a WWF wildlife law enforcement specialist, told HuffPost over Skype on Thursday. “We’ve lost more elephants in the past five months than in the whole of 2016. This is just shocking.”Poachers use poison-laced arrows to kill the elephants, shooting the animals before stalking them as they die a slow and painful death. They then slice up the carcasses, pull the skin off in strips and chop off saleable body parts like feet (said to be “tasty”) and penises (for use in traditional medicine). “With the skin trade, all elephants are targeted,” said Singh, speaking from his office in Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh. “We’ve found mothers and calves brutally killed and skinned.”Elephant numbers have been plunging in Myanmar since at least 2012. The government said in January that elephant poaching in the country had increased tenfold since then, fuelled by a growing demand for not just ivory but for elephant hide and other body parts.Myanmar has the world’s second-largest population of Asian elephant (India has the most). Though precise numbers are unknown, WWF said the Southeast Asian country may have as few as 1,500 elephants now left in the wild.The spiking demand for elephant skin in Myanmar appears to stem from a new “fad” in traditional medicine. The origins of this trend remains a mystery, said Singh. But elephant hides have been appearing with increased frequency in local markets across the country, where it’s touted as a miracle cure for skin problems like eczema and even pimples.Singh was quick to point out that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that this is true. “It’s just skin,” he said. “There’s no medicinal value.”He added that it’s unclear whether elephant skin is truly even a “traditional” product. “We have heard some cases in Africa where elephant hide has been used for medicinal purposes, but in Asia, this is the first time we’re hearing about it,” he said. “It may not actually have traditional value.”In January, AFP reporters described vendors selling slices of elephant skin, priced at a few dollars per square inch, at the foot of the famous Golden Rock Pagoda in Myanmar’s Mon State. “Elephant’s skin can cure skin diseases like eczema,” said one shop owner, who was also hawking porcupine quills and snake skins. “You burn pieces of skin by putting them in a clay pot. Then you get the ash and mix it with coconut oil to apply on the eczema.” The Guardian reported this week that elephant products from Myanmar have also been making their way across the border to China, where demand for body parts like trunks, feet and penises is on the rise. Elephant skin is “particularly in demand” for traditional medicine purposes, the outlet wrote.Singh said that there’s an acute concern that the “medicinal” reputation of elephant skin may spread across the region and elsewhere, thus boosting demand and posing a potential threat to elephants worldwide.“We know, for example, what’s happening to rhinos,” he said, referring to how the demand for rhino horn in Asian traditional medicine has fueled a poaching crisis not just in Asia, but in Africa, too. “We know this sudden demand puts huge pressure on a species. If we want to protect the future of Myanmar’s elephants, we need to act now. We need to address the problem before it gets out of control.” WWF launched a campaign this week called “Save Their Skins” in an effort to raise awareness and funds to combat Myanmar’s poaching crisis. The organization said it’s now working closely with the Myanmar government to train and equip rangers with anti-poaching technology to tackle the problem on the ground. WWF said it also plans to engage local communities on the issue and to figure out ways to dampen demand for elephant parts. The Wildlife Conservation Society has also worked with local officials to develop a conservation action plan to protect Myanmar’s elephants. The 10-year plan was unveiled in January.Asian elephants are considered an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Over the past 50 years, more than 60 percent of the species has been lost in the wild. “Everyone talks about the African elephant and the threats facing them,” said Singh this week, “but the Asian elephant, too, has not been untouched.”"

Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party gained 32 seats, a significant change that reflects growing discontent with May’s leadership after the country’s decision to leave the European Union. The election results left Britain with a so-called hung Parliament, prompting the minority government to make a deal with the smaller Democratic Union Party (DUP) in order to maintain leadership. The DUP is a conservative Northern Irish party that opposes same-sex marriage and has been accused of denying climate change. May announced the deal midday local time on Friday after receiving permission from the Queen, a formality in British politics.“What the country needs more than ever is certainty,” she said. “Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.”You can read more about Democratic Unionists and what’s next for Britain on HuffPost UK.The Conservatives’ unexpected election night disaster raised doubts about the prime minister, who was criticized for running a lackluster campaign that failed to inspire voters. Despite a host of calls for her resignation, 10 Downing indicated that May will not step down.“The mandate she’s got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence,” Corbyn said. One Tory voter told HuffPost UK on Thursday night, “It’s taxi for Theresa May. Goodbye. Gone. Out.”The British press was scathing in its verdict. The Sun, which had backed May, led with the headline: “Mayhem.”The election will have wide-ranging consequences, both in the U.K. itself, where the political landscape may rapidly change, as well as for upcoming Brexit negotiations. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the E.U. and the Democratic Unionists will likely push for a so-called soft Brexit, a rebuttal of May’s earlier vows.Meanwhile, the leader of the Brexit-championing U.K. Independence Party, Paul Nuttall, resigned on Friday after his party failed to win a single seat.Observers suggested that a high turnout among young voters may have helped Labour gain seats in a country where the biggest political divide is to be found between the young and the old. Labour does “8 percentage points better than the Conservatives among the very poorest, 15 points better among the jobless and 25 better among those who voted against Brexit. But its lead among voters under 25 is a jaw-dropping 44 points, nearly triple the size of the gap in the previous general election, in 2015,” according to The Economist.May, a former home secretary, rose to power after Britain’s Brexit vote, after her predecessor, David Cameron, lost the referendum on the U.K.’s membership in the European Union. Taking a gamble on strong public approval polls in the spring, she called a snap election that she hoped would allow her to solidify her party’s mandate as the country prepares for Brexit negotiations.The election had been hers to lose. Corbyn, a leader from the left wing of the party and ridiculed in the press as a radical, had been considered unpopular ― even among some members of his own party. May ran a disastrous campaign, refusing to debate Corbyn ahead of the vote, dodging the media and pulling a U-turn on key social issues.“As political miscalculations go, this is a monumental one for May and her strategists,” Dr. Michael Geary, a Global Fellow at the foreign affairs think tank the Wilson Center, said. “It now looks increasingly likely that this is May’s first and last election as Conservative leader and PM.”May also faced criticism for not standing up more forcefully to U.S. President Donald Trump ― especially after he took a swipe at London Mayor Sadiq Khan the day after London suffered a terrorist attack. After she declined to denounce Trump’s travel ban, she earned the moniker “Theresa the Appeaser.”Last week, one Conservative candidate told HuffPost UK, “We deserve to lose.”"

To federal prosecutors, she’s a criminal leaker, while others, like WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, have lionized her as a whistleblower in need of support.What’s the difference? The answer isn’t cut and dry, yet it carries huge legal consequence. Federal laws protect whistleblowers who provide evidence of government wrongdoing. But they must share the sensitive information through specific official channels to avoid arrest or reprisals at work. Leakers, on the other hand, can become targets for prosecution for mishandling classified information. Not all leaks are crimes, however. Sharing unclassified materials — such as former FBI Director James Comey did with some of his memos about his private conversations with President Donald Trump — is not illegal, experts say. Reality Winner is a leaker, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Southern Georgia. They’ve charged her with violating the World War I-era Espionage Act for “removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet.” The document in question was an National Security Agency memo about attempted Russian hacking into voter registration systems last year that The Intercept covered in an article Monday. She faces 10 years in prison if convicted. Appearing in federal court for the first time Thursday in Augusta, Georgia, Winner pleaded not guilty, though she allegedly admitted to the FBI that she printed and mailed the classified memo at an NSA facility. Authorities had granted Winner, a former Air Force linguist, a top-secret security clearance in February for her job with Pluribus International Corp.At this point, Winner’s motive is unknown. Regardless, she appears to have acted hastily, according to experts. “She committed the most fundamental mistake for blowing the whistle, which is not learning your legal rights first,” said National Whistleblower Center Executive Director Stephen Kohn, referring to Winner. “There are ways that you can bring information public that are legal and protect you, and there are ways that will bring you down.”Would-be government whistleblowers have have several options for raising their concerns. They can bring evidence to their department’s inspector general, members of Congress and federal prosecutors. Another route involves asking officials permission to publish the scandalous information and filing a lawsuit if the request gets denied. The term whistleblower implies that the source of the information has good intentions for uncovering fraud, waste or corruption. There has to be some public value to sharing the informant’s evidence to trigger whistleblowing protections. They’re not meant for airing personal grievances about a coworker, for instance. An example of a true whistleblower in the legal sense of the word is Army Spc. Joseph Darby, who helped pull the curtain back on prisoner abuse in Abu Ghraib, an Army detention site in Iraq. In 2004, Darby provided supervisors with a CD showing naked, hooded prisoners being humiliated and tortured. The Army launched an investigation immediately. Three months later, “60 Minutes” broadcast images of the abuse. Darby wasn’t arrested, but he’s been ostracized by members of the military and his family who have labeled him a traitor. There’s ample reason for potential whistleblowers to be skeptical of the official channels for reporting misconduct, according to Melvin Goodman, a former CIA and State Department analyst and author of Whistleblower at the CIA.Intelligence agency workers have grounds to worry about their anonymity being protected after opening a complaint with an inspector general, he said. And going to Congress doesn’t guarantee members will dig into the issue either. Daniel Ellsberg first gave copies of the Pentagon Papers, classified reports showing the futility of Vietnam War, to members of Congress in 1969 more than a year and half before he released portions of them to the New York Times. It’s unclear what Winner sought to achieve by releasing the Russian hacking memo, since allegations of Kremlin interference in the election last year are well-known and already under investigation, said Goodman. Still, going to the press may often be the best option for government employees who want a problem to receive attention. “This is what whistleblowing is all about — going to the public arena to talk about wrongdoing,” said Goodman. “There aren’t a lot of avenues other than the media. The so-called guardrails of democracy are broken.”Leakers, too, often say they too were motivated to expose a wrong, such as Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst who was released from prison last month. Manning had grown alarmed by the direction of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq when she gave a trove of military documents to WikiLeaks; she was arrested and charged with violating the same law as Winner in 2010. Winner already has some high-profile fans. Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, said Winner “must be supported.” Talk show host and frequent Trump critic Rosie O’Donnell donated money to her legal defense. It’s easier than ever for prosecutors to go after leakers. Computer records show which files employees access and whom they emailed or called. The Obama administration used the Espionage Act to target leakers more than all previous presidents combined. In Winner’s case, officials claim to know that she had printed the NSA memo and also sent an email to The Intercept. If Winner acknowledges being the source, her intentions will do her no good in court, no matter how noble she may consider them, according to attorney Edward McMahon, who represented a CIA officer convicted in 2015 of leaking to the New York Times details about the agency’s attempts to interfere with Iran’s nuclear program. “As a lawyer, the ‘golden motives’ don’t matter,” he said.To win a conviction, prosecutors must prove that the information Winner divulged was closely held, pertains to the national defense and was given to someone unauthorized to receive it.A defense attorney would probably craft an argument that the NSA memo at the heart of Winner’s case is not vital to national security. “Not every government secret is national defense information,” said McMahon.

To federal prosecutors, she’s a criminal leaker, while others, like WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, have lionized her as a whistleblower in need of support.What’s the difference? The answer isn’t cut and dry, yet it carries huge legal consequence. Federal laws protect whistleblowers who provide evidence of government wrongdoing. But they must share the sensitive information through specific official channels to avoid arrest or reprisals at work. Leakers, on the other hand, can become targets for prosecution for mishandling classified information. Not all leaks are crimes, however. Sharing unclassified materials — such as former FBI Director James Comey did with some of his memos about his private conversations with President Donald Trump — is not illegal, experts say. Reality Winner is a leaker, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Southern Georgia. They’ve charged her with violating the World War I-era Espionage Act for “removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet.” The document in question was an National Security Agency memo about attempted Russian hacking into voter registration systems last year that The Intercept covered in an article Monday. She faces 10 years in prison if convicted. Appearing in federal court for the first time Thursday in Augusta, Georgia, Winner pleaded not guilty, though she allegedly admitted to the FBI that she printed and mailed the classified memo at an NSA facility. Authorities had granted Winner, a former Air Force linguist, a top-secret security clearance in February for her job with Pluribus International Corp.At this point, Winner’s motive is unknown. Regardless, she appears to have acted hastily, according to experts. “She committed the most fundamental mistake for blowing the whistle, which is not learning your legal rights first,” said National Whistleblower Center Executive Director Stephen Kohn, referring to Winner. “There are ways that you can bring information public that are legal and protect you, and there are ways that will bring you down.”Would-be government whistleblowers have have several options for raising their concerns.

And if the world does not mitigate climate-related impacts, they are likely to “intersect, amplify and ripple across countries,” disrupting international security, a team of climate and security experts warns in a new report. The lengthy report from The Center for Climate and Security identifies 12 key climatic risks, or “epicenters,” and makes the case for why addressing them should be of the highest priority for world governments. Those risk categories vary from eroding state sovereignty and disrupted trade routes, to increased pandemics and a damaged coffee trade.“The risks that climate change is posing to each of these elements of the world are potentially globally significant by themselves,” Center co-president Francesco Femia, an editor of the report, told HuffPost. “All of these things are essentially happening together, and climate is making it worse. And when you put all of these things together you have a potential for a very significant impact on global security, and potentially — loftily — on world order.” If climate risks are not significantly reduced, Femia added, they are likely to put pressure on nation-states’ ability to provide basic resources, creating tensions not only within those nation-states but between them. One example highlighted in the report is the often-violent disputes between China and Vietnam over fishing rights in the South China Sea, where fish stocks have all but collapsed. Another “epicenter” the report analyzes is the potential for entire nations ― in low-lying islands like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives — to be submerged by climate-induced sea level rise. Some 2,300 years after the Greek philosopher Plato wrote of the lost city of Atlantis, “the world may be facing a new Atlantis, as sea level rise — caused by climate change — is threatening to inundate civilizations again,” the report reads.“We have no means of international, legal norms for dealing with that sort of thing,” Femia said. “We have no experience with a disappearance of a nation under the ocean, and what to do with the citizens of that nation.” The 139-page report, titled Epicenters of Climate and Security: The New Geostrategic Landscape of the Anthropocene, was released Friday at the fourth Annual Oxford Interdisciplinary Desert Conference, at the University of Oxford in England. It comes roughly seven months after the Center delivered its comprehensive climate change “briefing book” to Donald Trump when he was President-elect. That document ― released in September and prepared by the center’s Climate and Security Advisory Group, a non-partisan group of 43 U.S. military, national security and other experts ― had a rather similar, albeit more local message: The new administration must prioritize climate change or risk jeopardizing national security.But the president, who has dismissed the phenomenon as “bullshit” and a Chinese hoax, didn’t seem to get the memo. Since taking office, he has moved quickly to derail America’s actions to combat climate change, including rolling back Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Catering to fossil fuel interests, Trump has promised to revive America’s dying coal industry, increase oil and gas production, and open up now-protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to drilling. And he has proposed sweeping cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and other scientific agencies. Last week, Trump followed through on one of his campaign promises, announcing he would withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris Agreement — a landmark international accord aimed at warding off the worst effects of climate change. Asked about Trump’s first six months in office, Femia said he finds the president’s unwillingness to address climate change “deeply unfortunate.” However, a lot of it is “short-term politics that won’t stand up to the impacts,” The Center for Climate and Security co-president said. And Femia noted that even under a White House that has “poured cold water on everything climate,” U.S. defense and security officials have made clear the threat is a real and must be taken seriously.“The reason for that is that the impacts are already happening,” he said. “And all these departments and agencies that deal with risk and threats to the United States understand that and have been dealing with it for at least the past 10 years.”Femia added that while the administration may slow progress, he expects the reality of the threat will eventually change politics, despite what the White House has to say about it. In one key chapter of the report, Femia and Caitlin E. Werrell, co-founder of The Center for Climate and Security, discuss the threat of climate change on state sovereignty.“National governments, as well as regional and international security institutions will need to integrate the effects of climate change into their strategies, plans, and operations, and shift resources accordingly,” they write. “Improving, augmenting, and possibly even creating new governance structures for addressing climate change may also be necessary for maintaining a stable world order.”View the Center’s new report here.

Charles Grassley warned President Trump that he is being ""ill-served and ill-advised.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593ac3311d00002900cc2156.jpeg?cache=WJZ8INf06b&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a scathing letter this week to President Donald Trump, arguing that the Office of Legal Counsel is “flooding the swamp.”“You are being ill-served and ill-advised,” the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman wrote, adding that the Department of Justice office had “utterly failed to live up to its own standards.”Grassley’s letter was prompted by a May 1 memo from the OLC to other federal agencies, instructing them to effectively ignore any requests from Congress that do not come from chairs of committees or subcommittees. Requests from other individual members of Congress “do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable,” the memo stated. (Since both houses of Congress are currently controlled by the GOP, that means don’t answer any questions from Democrats as well as most Republicans.)The memo, signed by acting Assistant Attorney General Curtis Gannon, claimed that it was a “longstanding policy” for government agencies to accommodate “congressional requests for information only when those requests come from a committee, subcommittee, or chairman authorized to conduct oversight.”“This is nonsense,” Grassley wrote. “For OLC to so fundamentally misunderstand and misstate such a simple fact exposes its shocking lack of professionalism and objectivity,” he told the president.Grassley urged the White House to “rescind this OLC opinion and any policy of ignoring oversight request from non-Chairmen.”The June 7 letter is among the latest examples of a growing sense of frustration among top Republicans in Congress with how the Trump White House operates and how little regard the administration appears to have for certain democratic processes.This frustration was on display in another forum Wednesday after four top administration officials refused to answer a series of questions during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe all repeatedly said they did not feel comfortable answering senators’ direct queries about interactions they had with Trump, even though they were under oath and the president had not invoked executive privilege to prevent them from talking. Before he adjourned the hearing, Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) chastised the officials and the Trump White House.“I would ask each of you to take a message back to the administration,” he said. “You’re in positions whereby you’re required to keep this committee fully and currently informed of intelligence activities. At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer.”Sometimes referred to as the president’s law firm, the OLC dispenses legal advice to the White House and executive branch agencies. It can take on a quasi-judicial role in settling legal questions that arise within an administration.For example, the OLC is the office that signed off on President Barack Obama’s use of drones against U.S. citizens and approved “enhanced interrogation techniques” under President George W. Bush. (The Trump administration has nominated Steven G. Bradbury, who helped write those “torture memos,” to a spot in the Transportation Department.) Other OLC reports are much less attention-grabbing, with titles like “Authority to Permit Part-Time Employees to Work Regularly Scheduled Workweeks of 33 to 39 Hours.”Trump recently nominated Stephen Engel, who previously served as deputy assistant attorney general in the OLC during the Bush administration, to head the office on a permanent basis."

The Michigan state House is considering bills that would prevent cities from enacting policies that limit cooperation between local authorities and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. These so-called “sanctuary policy prohibition acts” have similar counterparts in more than 30 other state legislatures.At a hearing on the bills Wednesday, representatives heard about an hour of testimony from opponents of the bill, none more excoriating than from Rene Lichtman, 79, who works with several groups of Holocaust survivors. “I’m a child survivor of the Holocaust,” Lichtman said. “I was about 2 years old when the war began and I went into hiding. My family members were picked up in the streets of Paris in the very same way that ICE people are deputizing local police and picking [undocumented immigrants] up in the streets.”He said that the French police, “deputized by the Nazis,” kept lists of Jews in Paris, “including Jewish children, including children on my street, who were picked up and went to the gas chambers while I was fortunate to be in hiding.”“I see a lot of parallels to what is going on in cities like Ann Arbor and Pontiac, where ICE is coming in and with the help of the local police are picking up immigrants,” Lichtman said. No cities in Michigan call themselves sanctuary cities, but a few, including Ann Arbor, limit cooperation with ICE and would be in violation of Michigan law if the new bills are passed. Advocates in Ann Arbor and Pontiac have reported an uptick in immigration arrests.Under Trump, ICE has ramped up enforcement of illegal immigration, arresting 41,000 people in the first 100 days of the new administration, a 38 percent increase compared with the same period last year.Some local governments have immigrant-friendly policies, such as prohibiting police from honoring ICE requests to continue detaining suspected unauthorized immigrants. The White House has vowed to punish sanctuary cities, and Trump’s executive order to withhold their federal funding has been challenged in court.Critics of Michigan’s bill and others, like the extreme law passed in Texas last month, say the push against sanctuary policies erodes safety, because immigrants are less likely to report crimes or cooperate with police. During Lichtman’s remarks, one representative noted that Jewish immigrants were actually one of the earlier groups of people to come to the United States illegally after quota laws were put in place in the 1920s.Lichtman responded that he had his own experience as an undocumented immigrant ― when he was about 20 and serving in the Army, his captain called him in for a meeting, telling Lichtman his name was on a list of “aliens.”“He says, ‘What are you doing working in an intelligence unit in the army?’” Lichtman recalled. “I said, ‘Sir, I don’t know, you know I came here, I assumed I became a citizen automatically when my mother married an American citizen.’ He said, ‘Well, that isn’t the case, so get your butt into town and go see Judge so-and-so.’”Lichtman, who came to the U.S. at age 13, said the process to get his citizenship papers was fairly simple.“Today I would probably be ― ICE could have been called on me and I would have been shipped off,” he concluded in his testimony.Lichtman and others’ opposition didn’t sway the representatives, who passed the bills on party lines and sent them for a full House vote. Rep. Jim Runestad (R), a cosponsor of the anti-sanctuary bills who was at the hearing, told HuffPost he’s “a rule of law person” and that the legislation would ensure cities follow federal immigration policy. “I don’t believe that there is any relationship to what the horror of the Holocaust was, compared to what we’re talking about, almost exclusively economic immigrants, illegal immigrants, looking to advance their financial situation,” Runestad said. “One of the most horrific situations in all of human history, where a people were targeted for mass murder, and comparing it to someone who wants a good job is, to me, a very, very unfortunate comparison, and certainly no parallels, practically at all, exist between the two.”ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said the agency “does not conduct sweeps or raids that target aliens indiscriminately,” but added that “ICE will not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.” Lichtman has been telling his story at pro-immigrant rallies around the state since Trump came into office, he told HuffPost. He conceded that the “deportations” of Jews during the Holocaust ― or murders ― were more “dramatic” than deportation of undocumented immigrants, though he’s not the first to make the comparison.“I can empathize with these people because I’ve been there,” he added. “It’s tearing families apart.”"

The sludge pits in “The Descent” are speckled with a foreboding scarlet. “It Comes at Night,” opening in theaters this weekend, brandishes a red door at the end of a slender hallway. The only portal leading in and out of an isolated home in the woods, it provides security and alarm. Open it at the wrong moment, and whatever apocalyptic sickness that’s seized the world could seep in. Keep it closed, and resources will run out. Equal parts family drama and end-times horror feast, Trey Edward Shults’ first film with professional actors ― following last year’s superb micro-budget psychodrama “Krisha,” which starred the 28-year-old director’s relatives ― is a boiling, 91-minute labyrinth that grows more ominous by the minute. Fuse the simmering paranoia of “The Witch,” the post-apocalyptic dread of “Night of the Living Dead” and the domestic tension of “The Others,” and you’ll get “It Comes at Night.”“I actually didn’t read it as a horror at all,” Christopher Abbott told HuffPost at the movie’s junket earlier this week. “When I read it, I though it was a heavy family drama with some creepy moments.”Abbott and Riley Keough play a desperate couple seeking shelter after their truck breaks down. Fleeing an epidemic that’s never detailed, they land at a home sporting boarded windows and a skeptical family that doesn’t leave once the sun sets. The latter clan ― played by Joel Edgerton, Carmen Ejogo and standout newcomer Kelvin Harrison Jr. ― are the narrative’s spine. They don’t know exactly what’s happened to the world, but they’ve entered full-blown panic mode. Their house, their rules. No one exits alone, the red door remains locked, gas masks are mandatory whenever potential threats loom. There’s always something lurking beyond that door, at least in their minds.“Who told him to put a gas mask on? No one,” Harrison said, referring to Edgerton’s patriarch, Paul, who is hell-bent on protecting his wife and 17-year-old son. “They decided that on their own, and that’s what’s kind of messed up about it. Is anyone actually sick?”Characters break these rules as often as they keep them. What resonates is not the apocalyptic trivia ― it’s how everyone deals with it. Delusions. Hallucinations. Knee-jerk reactions. Like the best ambiguous horror tales, “It Comes at Night” conceals enough information to send its audiences down similar paranoia spirals. Paul agrees to house this rogue family, but are they trustworthy? Will teenage Travis’ voyeuristic interest in the couple align with his burgeoning, inhibited sexuality? Will whatever vague peril haunting the forest that surrounds the house infiltrate the families’ newfound shared domesticity? The script, written at the start of 2014, “spewed out of” Shults after his semi-estranged father died. Through this story of two clans processing their hysteria, Shults processed his grief. A cinephile completing a two-picture deal with trendy indie studio A24, Shults channeled some of his favorite movies ― “There Will Be Blood,” “A Woman Under the Influence,” “The Shining,” David Lynch’s catalog ― in developing the stylistic menace suffused throughout “It Comes at Night,” shot in upstate New York. He knows some viewers will be frustrated by the lack of finite information about the disease that may have seized civilization, but he hopes the film will play like the aforementioned gems: richer, deeper and more meaningful upon second and third encounters. In the meantime, horror stalwarts will be treated to a production that expands the genre’s finest tropes into a coming-of-age trance built on nightmares, yearning and that sinister red door.“I love movies that have an openness, movies that don’t sum up everything for me,” Shults said. “[With time], I see different things about them or I interpret them in a different way. That’s my jam. I think this movie is intentionally designed that way. There’s some tough subject matter in it.”“It Comes at Night” is now in theaters."
24,POLITICS,Trump Sets Obstruction Of Justice Terms: It’s His Credibility Against Comey’s,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-comey-liar_us_593b0c09e4b0b13f2c6a82d3,Trump long history of falsehoods against Comey’s boy scout reputation.,2017-06-09,"President Donald Trump reacts to a reporter's question during a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S. June 9, 2017",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593b0d4516000021001155c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – With a possible obstruction-of-justice probe on the line that could determine the future of his presidency, Donald Trump Friday set the terms: It will be his word against that of the FBI director he fired.It’s a match-up Trump may come to regret.James Comey is a 30-year career law enforcement officer and prosecutor with a reputation as straight shooter. Trump has been known for decades for unhesitatingly dispensing falsehoods – a habit that has not diminished with his taking of the Oval Office.“It’s difficult to look at Comey and besmirch his reputation,” said Rick Tyler, a Republican consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the 2016 GOP primaries. “I don’t think Trump would recognize the truth if he stumbled across it.”Comey on Thursday testified under oath that Trump had asked him for his personal loyalty and pressured him into dropping an investigation into Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over his undisclosed discussions with Russian officials.Comey had already been conducting an investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which the U.S. intelligence community concluded worked to help Trump win the presidency.Over the course of two-and-a-half hours before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey matter-of-factly called the president a liar. Asked why he took such detailed notes about his meetings with Trump, when he hadn’t done so after meetings with former presidents George W. Bush or Barack Obama, Comey answered that it was “the nature of the person.”“I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document,” Comey testified.On Friday, during a warm afternoon in the White House Rose Garden, Trump followed up on a earlier statement on Twitter and claimed it was Comey who was lying.“I didn’t say that,” Trump said about asking Comey to drop the Flynn probe at a private White House meeting – as visiting Romanian President Klaus Iohannis stood a few feet away at their joint news conference.“I hardly know the man. I’m not going to say, ‘I want you to pledge allegiance,’” Trump said about asking Comey for his loyalty. “Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean ― think of it, I hardly know the man. It doesn’t make sense. No, I didn’t say that and I didn’t say the other.”Trump went on to say that he would provide those answers under oath: “One hundred percent.”Whether he ever gives a full statement to special counsel Robert Mueller is unclear. Trump frequently promises things but then reneges – he promised, for example, to release his tax returns if he ran for president, which he has subsequently refused to do. In any event, the veracity of any such statements is also unclear. Trump has been known for decades for his willingness to say false things to advance his interests, including in legal depositions taken under oath. In the 1990s, he was even known for calling reporters and pretending to be non-existent Trump Organization subordinates to plant favorable stories about himself.He called People Magazine once posing as “John Barron” to claim that his employer ― that is, Trump himself ― was dating Italian model Carla Bruni. (Bruni denied she’d had anything to do with Trump and called him a “lunatic.”)His readiness to deliver falsehoods to his audiences and journalists frustrated his primary campaign rivals, who saw GOP voters seem to accept Trump at his word, regardless of evidence to the contrary.One of Trump’s last opponents to drop out was Ted Cruz, who on the morning of the pivotal Indiana primary let loose a three-minute tirade about Trump’s lack of honesty.“This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies,” Cruz told reporters. “He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And he had a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook. His response is to accuse everybody else of lying…. I say pathological because I actually think Donald—if you hooked him up to a lie-detector pass, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon, and one thing in the evening, all contradictory, and he’d pass the lie-detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral.”Trump won the Indiana primary, the GOP nomination and then, against improbable odds, the presidency with the assistance of Russian intelligence agencies working to sabotage his Democratic rival, according to U.S. intelligence officials.The false statements, though, have continued, right from his first full day on the job when he told CIA employees that some 1.5 million people had attended his inauguration, when the actual number had been a fraction of that.The fact-checking site PolitiFact showed Trump with the highest rate of false statements of any candidate in the 2016 campaign. As of Friday, of the 410 Trump statements PolitiFact has analyzed since he entered the race in 2015 through this week, a full 69 percent are rated “mostly false,” “false,” or “pants on fire.”Trump’s long and troubled history with the truth may overwhelm whatever advantage the imprimatur of the White House might otherwise afford. Polling shows that a majority of Americans find Trump dishonest – an impression that his staff is unlikely to be able to counter.Thursday, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asked about Comey’s testimony calling Trump a liar, responded: “I can definitively say the president is not a liar. I think it is frankly insulting that question would be asked.”That kind of answer, said Tyler, was not helpful, given Trump’s long and storied record of untruths through the years. All she had to do was answer that she wasn’t going to dignify that sort of question and to move on, rather than defend Trump so combatively and damage her own credibility.“It’s the most fundamental mistake you can make in communications,” Tyler said. “And she went and did it.”"

Russian hackers that is, this time hiding a sophisticated malware operation in Britney Spears’ Instagram account.A gang of Russian hackers notorious for spying on foreign governments, diplomats and military facilities has come up with a clever back-door Trojan marriage between their operation and social media — most notably Spears’ Instagram, according to Slovakian cyber-security firm ESET, which discovered the ruse.The account — hopefully — wasn’t being used to target victims. Rather, it was used as a kind of camouflaged command center for the Turla hacker system. Comments posted to the site linked to a central server that sent instructions and trafficked hacked stolen data to and from computers infected by malware. Hacking operations can often be shut down once the command-and-control server is located. But Spears’ Instagram account served to veil the operation because it functioned as a third-party relay system.For example, a nonsensical comment posted to the Spears’ Instagram (and since deleted) — “#2hot make loved to her, uupss #Hot #X” — was essentially a code that included a string of characters creating a link to a command-and-control hacker server, according to a blog post by ESET. If that server had been tracked down, other links could have been posted to a replacement server. Such coded “comments” providing a server link can easily hide in an Instagram account with 17 million followers. The Spears photo with the coded message had more than 2,000 other messages.ESET discovered the operation in February, and managers believe what was found may have been part of a series of tests for a new operation launch.Turla last made news in 2014 when cyber-security experts identified the Wipbot Windows malware that infiltrated the internet systems of the embassies and governments of a number of Eastern European nations, Ars Technica reported.For the nuts-and-bolts of the complicated hacker scam, check out ESET’s blog post here."
26,POLITICS,Trump DOJ And Chicago May Reach A Police Reform Deal With ‘No Teeth’,Kim Bellware and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-doj-police-reform_us_593af1cde4b0b13f2c6a36bc,"City Hall is confident it struck the best deal, but police reformers say it won't go far enough.",2017-06-09,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivers a speech on the city's surge in violence as Police Supt. Eddie Johnson listens in Chicago on Sept. 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593b0e752200003d00c6d45c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHICAGO ― After several bruising years for the Chicago police and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, heightened by the fatal shooting of teenager Laquan McDonald by an officer, allegations of a City Hall cover-up and a damning Justice Department probe, the city is poised to begin its police reform efforts. But now there are serious doubts about whether a toothless plan can address the deep problems.News trickled out of city hall last week that Emanuel planned to seek a “memorandum of understanding,” rather than an enforceable consent decree, as part of an effort to remedy the widespread unconstitutional practices the Justice Department identified in a report released just before Trump’s inauguration. The sweeping federal report, issued after the biggest investigation of a city police department in Justice Department history, concluded that reform efforts in Chicago were “not likely to be successful” without a consent decree and independent monitoring.The city has not yet established a timeline for an independent monitor. “At this point, there’s still ongoing discussions between ourselves and the DOJ,” Walter Katz, Emanuel’s chief liaison with the CPD, told HuffPost. Katz noted that the city has already undertaken some reform efforts, including revamped police rules on use of force, an expanded bodycam program and a planned Civilian Office of Police Accountability, set to open in September. Success will be defined by “substantial compliance with the agreement,” Katz said, adding that prior consent decrees and memorandums of understanding have been effective for measuring compliance.High tensions over crime and policing in the city were aggravated with the November 2015 release of a police dashcam video that showed a more than year-old incident of an officer shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times as the teen walked away. The video contradicted the narrative by police that McDonald had been imminently threatening officers, and the legal fight to keep the tape under wraps prompted critics to accuse Emanuel of intentionally covering up the video until after his reelection, a charge he has denied. The officer who shot McDonald is awaiting trial on multiple charges, including first-degree murder.When the Civil Rights Division’s report came out on Jan. 13, the Justice Department and Emanuel’s administration announced they had reached an agreement in principle, a two-page document in which both parties committed to “negotiate in good faith to reach a comprehensive settlement in the form of a consent decree.”Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not believe in police consent decrees. Shortly after his Feb. 8 confirmation, Sessions conceded he hadn’t read the Chicago report but called it “anecdotal.” Sessions separately suggested that such binding legal agreements amounted to “harmful federal intrusion” that could “cost more lives by handcuffing the police instead of the criminals.”The Trump administration also attempted to back out of a firm agreement with the city of Baltimore. After a federal judge approved the Baltimore deal over DOJ’s objections, Sessions issued a statement saying he had “grave concerns” that the “rushed” agreement “will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city. Theoretically, the Trump DOJ is bound by the previous agreement to work in “good faith” toward a consent decree with Chicago. But Adam Collins, a spokesman for Emanuel, noted the stark ideological differences between the Obama-era DOJ and the department under President Donald Trump. “Obviously there’s a different administration in D.C. right now that has a different attitude on consent decrees,” Collins said. “The public comments from the DOJ are very clear about their attitudes about how it relates to consent decrees and that they don’t believe they’re a good model.”Nevertheless, Collins said Police Supt. Eddie Johnson “has been clear that the city of Chicago is on the road to reform.” Vanita Gupta, the former head of the Civil Rights Division, says that commitment isn’t enough. Gupta, who now heads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told HuffPost that Chicago has seen “over and over again” that deals without court enforcement mechanisms don’t work. The memorandum of agreement will “become yet another set of recommendations for the Chicago Police Department that will have no teeth.”“History has demonstrated that memoranda of agreement, which are not court-enforceable, are not robust enough to remedy longstanding problems,” Gupta said.Gupta noted that, even with the new administration, the agreement signed in January had “not been publicly disavowed by either party” and that both sides had recognized “the gravity and scope of the constitutional violations required a court-enforced agreement.”Gupta said it is “absolutely critical” that the career Civil Rights Division officials who investigated the Chicago Police Department “find that whatever agreement is reached will actually remedy the serious findings” the report brought to light. Groups like the ACLU of Illinois concur with Gupta’s concerns, slamming the memorandum of agreement as a “half-measure” that will not amount to meaningful change.“This proposal is a non-starter for anyone committed to real reform of Chicago’s broken system of policing,” Karen Sheley, director of the ACLU of Illinois Police Practices Project, said in a statement. “The City is proposing to sign a set of promises with a DOJ that is hostile to real police reform.” A spokesman for ACLU of Illinois said that it had not yet determined if they would go to court over the city’s decision but that it would “continue to talk with other advocates and consider all options.” Chicago was the last police department to undergo an investigation into its “patterns or practices” in the Obama-era Justice Department. The number of DOJ-enforced consent decrees grew under Obama’s tenure compared with his most recent Republican and Democratic predecessors. From the start of Obama’s first term in 2009 to the conclusion of his second term this year, 14 police departments — including Seattle; Cleveland; Ferguson, Missouri; and Puerto Rico ― agreed to consent decrees. By contrast, only three consent decrees each were reached in Bill Clinton’s and George W. Bush’s two-term administrations. While consent decrees have been welcomed by police reform advocates, they’re often oppose by police unions as burdensome and restrictive. Since consent decrees are effectively lawsuits brought by the Justice Department against the city to ensure reform measures are implanted, the agreements can also come as huge expenses to taxpayers. Sessions himself hit on the cost in his statement following the approval of the Baltimore consent decree, saying the deal would force the city to fund a “highly-paid monitor to govern every detail of how the Baltimore Police Department functions for the foreseeable future.”But in Chicago, a lack of police reform has already taken a massive financial toll: Since 2004, the city has paid out roughly $662 million for police misconduct in the form of multimillion-dollar settlements, legal fees and other penalties.City Hall is standing by the decision as its option for achieving the badly needed overhaul. Collins cited Washington as an example the city views as a case study on successful police reform achieved without a consent decree. “It’s a model that’s worked in other cities,” Collins added, noting that D.C.’s former police chief Charles Ramsey — a former CPD official who now serves as an adviser on reform for the police department ― “spoke highly” of the process.Emanuel aide Katz said he was confident the city’s efforts will be successful because the city, its police and its residents want the same basic outcome. “What we’re focused on is the fact that people want to live in a community that is safe,” Katz said. The ACLU’s Sheley expressed doubt that anything short of a consent decree would make a difference. She noted in a statement that the kind of agreement Chicago is pursuing “could not be enforced by the monitor, by the community or by anyone else ― since it is not planned to be overseen by a federal court.” “The only real path to police reform in Chicago is through a consent decree overseen by a federal judge,” Sheley added. “That is what the City committed to when the DOJ completed its scathing report in January.” Gupta also believes that Chicago’s proposal will fall short of implementing the necessary reform.“There is no political solution that will fix the problems that the career Justice Department team found. Congress gave career lawyers at the Justice Department the mandate to remedy patterns and practices of unconstitutional policing when found,” Gupta said. “It is their judgment that matters and that has not changed.”A Justice Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Kim Bellware reported from Chicago and Ryan Reilly reported from Washington, D.C."

Dozens more were injured.Bars and clubs have long been a place for LGBTQ community members to gather and simply be ourselves, as few other safe spaces exist. As an openly gay Latino myself, I know that this tragedy has been deeply felt by both the LGBTQ and Latinx (a gender-neutral alternative to Latino/a) communities throughout the nation and the world.Perhaps the most affected by this tragedy are the families (both biological and of-choice) and loved ones who were left behind. I recently sat down with Vilma Torres, a Safe Horizon expert who works with families and friends of murder victims to better understand what loved ones may experience after a tragedy of this magnitude and how as a society we can best offer support.Brian: It’s one year later. What may be some of the common experiences and feelings of the loved ones who lost someone in the Orlando attack?Vilma: The first year is such a challenging time. Often, families are having a very difficult time coping with the grief and the heartache.People deal with their grief, heartache, and pain very differently. What happened in Orlando was very violent, so you may have family who are still dealing with how violently their loved one actually died. They may not be ready to come to terms with that horrifying fact.For some, they may just now be dealing with the separation. They know that this person is no longer physically in their life, and they need to adjust to the new reality.Brian: How do anniversaries of a death affect surviving family members?Vilma: In the event of a violent death, I often hear from survivors that on an anniversary they are replaying the events of that day, replaying the conversations. Surviving family members and friends are thinking that a year ago on this day, [their loved one] was still alive. They replay their last conversation with that person.Some want to do this in private; they don’t want people to bring up that today is the anniversary of the death. Some people say that they really want to focus on how he or she lived[and not how they died]. For some it’s a very quiet day, for others it’s very public where they might want to do something to commemorate that person.Some families talk about people reaching out to them during the first anniversary. It’s the years after that some are upset that nobody calls anymore, no one acknowledges that today is the day.Brian: How may the heightened media attention on the anniversary affect surviving family members? How is it for a family member to have their loved one’s murder covered in the news?Vilma: I think that’s always very difficult. I mean, we have definitely seen that in the coverage of the London attacks, Sandy Hook, and 9/11, where you have no control over that. It is 24/7. Horrific scenes are being replayed over and over, and that can be very challenging to families. Sometimes you turn on the TV and all of a sudden they can flash something and it will bring you back to the sights, the sounds, the smell of where you were when you first heard about your loved one.We know that the media is there to inform us, but it can be very difficult to see those visuals, the trauma, the blood, and the bodies playing out on television. You’re hearing details you may not want to hear, and they are referring to your loved one as a victim, as a statistic, but they had a name and an identity.This is why it was so important that Anderson Cooper read the names of every individual who died in Orlando [as we have seen done for victims of 9/11]. He made it really very personal, recognizing that these are people, who have family, friends. These are people with identities, names, and faces.Brian: How can we as a community be sensitive to these grieving family members and loved ones?Vilma: What I often hear from survivors is “ask, don’t tell.” People don’t realize that, on days like this, the grieving want to be able to do what they feel comfortable doing. You should be sensitive to what kind of help and support you can offer. They may not want to face the world on this day, but they have responsibilities to get their children to school, responsibilities at work. Sometimes asking what they need on that day: groceries, laundry, pick the kids up ― that can be a gift for someone who doesn’t want to worry about one more thing.I still remember going to a mother and she told me “be careful, there is going to be media outside the door. Don’t say my name, make sure you don’t ring my buzzer. Ring another buzzer, they already know,” and it’s sad she couldn’t even leave her house. However, others were able to help her, and that stems from asking what they need versus me telling you what you need.Brian: What can the grieving or healing process look like for a surviving family member?Vilma: Everyone handles this differently. There is no right or wrong way of dealing with grief. How a loved one dies can also impact how someone grieves. Families can experience… grief as a result of a natural death or an unnatural death, and grieving from an unnatural death may include dealing with the trauma of the violence of how your loved one was killed. That in itself creates images and intrusive thoughts for families and how do you manage that? Sight, sound, smell; you can hear a siren and that siren can bring you back to the moment of when you were walking into the emergency room.One of things we talk about in our group is that with grief you can’t go over it, you can’t go under it, you have to go through it. Grief is hard work and adapting to the person that you are after this tragedy can be difficult.Brian: How can these families best take care of themselves during this one-year anniversary?Vilma: It’s whatever the family thinks is going to help them. As a service provider, it’s really about what we can do for you. With the families of loved ones who were killed in Orlando, it would really be about hearing from them and finding out what they need from us and what support we can provide.When it comes to one-year anniversaries, if they want a very quiet and respectful day, or they don’t want to turn on the TV, or they don’t want to be reminded that today’s the day of their loved one’s murder, it doesn’t mean that they forget the other 364 days of the year. I think sometimes there’s a lot of focus on anniversaries, but it doesn’t mean their family members are not thinking of their loved one the other days.Vilma Torres is an expert on the effects of trauma and grief, She works with families and friends of murder victims through Safe Horizon’s Bronx Community and Court Program.

You should be sensitive to what kind of help and support you can offer. They may not want to face the world on this day, but they have responsibilities to get their children to school, responsibilities at work. Sometimes asking what they need on that day: groceries, laundry, pick the kids up ― that can be a gift for someone who doesn’t want to worry about one more thing.I still remember going to a mother and she told me “be careful, there is going to be media outside the door. Don’t say my name, make sure you don’t ring my buzzer. Ring another buzzer, they already know,” and it’s sad she couldn’t even leave her house. However, others were able to help her, and that stems from asking what they need versus me telling you what you need.Brian: What can the grieving or healing process look like for a surviving family member?Vilma: Everyone handles this differently. There is no right or wrong way of dealing with grief. How a loved one dies can also impact how someone grieves. Families can experience… grief as a result of a natural death or an unnatural death, and grieving from an unnatural death may include dealing with the trauma of the violence of how your loved one was killed. That in itself creates images and intrusive thoughts for families and how do you manage that? Sight, sound, smell; you can hear a siren and that siren can bring you back to the moment of when you were walking into the emergency room.One of things we talk about in our group is that with grief you can’t go over it, you can’t go under it, you have to go through it. Grief is hard work and adapting to the person that you are after this tragedy can be difficult.Brian: How can these families best take care of themselves during this one-year anniversary?Vilma: It’s whatever the family thinks is going to help them. As a service provider, it’s really about what we can do for you. With the families of loved ones who were killed in Orlando, it would really be about hearing from them and finding out what they need from us and what support we can provide.When it comes to one-year anniversaries, if they want a very quiet and respectful day, or they don’t want to turn on the TV, or they don’t want to be reminded that today’s the day of their loved one’s murder, it doesn’t mean that they forget the other 364 days of the year. I think sometimes there’s a lot of focus on anniversaries, but it doesn’t mean their family members are not thinking of their loved one the other days.Vilma Torres is an expert on the effects of trauma and grief, She works with families and friends of murder victims through Safe Horizon’s Bronx Community and Court Program.

29,HEALTHY LIVING,"'Ask, Don’t Tell' -- Pulse Victims And Supporting The Loved Ones Left Behind","Brian Pacheco, ContributorPublic Relations, Marketing and Communications Professional",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ask-dont-tell-pulse-victims-and-supporting-the_us_593ae571e4b094fa859f1803,Everyone handles grief differently.,2017-06-09,<p>49 white roses and rainbow flags for the lives lost in the Orlando Pulse attack. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593ae8f51d00004900cc21d2.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last year, 49 people lost their lives in the Orlando massacre at the LGBTQ nightclub Pulse in the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Dozens more were injured.Bars and clubs have long been a place for LGBTQ community members to gather and simply be ourselves, as few other safe spaces exist. As an openly gay Latino myself, I know that this tragedy has been deeply felt by both the LGBTQ and Latinx (a gender-neutral alternative to Latino/a) communities throughout the nation and the world.Perhaps the most affected by this tragedy are the families (both biological and of-choice) and loved ones who were left behind. I recently sat down with Vilma Torres, a Safe Horizon expert who works with families and friends of murder victims to better understand what loved ones may experience after a tragedy of this magnitude and how as a society we can best offer support.Brian: It’s one year later. What may be some of the common experiences and feelings of the loved ones who lost someone in the Orlando attack?Vilma: The first year is such a challenging time. Often, families are having a very difficult time coping with the grief and the heartache.People deal with their grief, heartache, and pain very differently. What happened in Orlando was very violent, so you may have family who are still dealing with how violently their loved one actually died. They may not be ready to come to terms with that horrifying fact.For some, they may just now be dealing with the separation. They know that this person is no longer physically in their life, and they need to adjust to the new reality.Brian: How do anniversaries of a death affect surviving family members?Vilma: In the event of a violent death, I often hear from survivors that on an anniversary they are replaying the events of that day, replaying the conversations. Surviving family members and friends are thinking that a year ago on this day, [their loved one] was still alive. They replay their last conversation with that person.Some want to do this in private; they don’t want people to bring up that today is the anniversary of the death. Some people say that they really want to focus on how he or she lived[and not how they died]. For some it’s a very quiet day, for others it’s very public where they might want to do something to commemorate that person.Some families talk about people reaching out to them during the first anniversary. It’s the years after that some are upset that nobody calls anymore, no one acknowledges that today is the day.Brian: How may the heightened media attention on the anniversary affect surviving family members? How is it for a family member to have their loved one’s murder covered in the news?Vilma: I think that’s always very difficult. I mean, we have definitely seen that in the coverage of the London attacks, Sandy Hook, and 9/11, where you have no control over that. It is 24/7. Horrific scenes are being replayed over and over, and that can be very challenging to families. Sometimes you turn on the TV and all of a sudden they can flash something and it will bring you back to the sights, the sounds, the smell of where you were when you first heard about your loved one.We know that the media is there to inform us, but it can be very difficult to see those visuals, the trauma, the blood, and the bodies playing out on television. You’re hearing details you may not want to hear, and they are referring to your loved one as a victim, as a statistic, but they had a name and an identity.This is why it was so important that Anderson Cooper read the names of every individual who died in Orlando [as we have seen done for victims of 9/11]. He made it really very personal, recognizing that these are people, who have family, friends. These are people with identities, names, and faces.Brian: How can we as a community be sensitive to these grieving family members and loved ones?Vilma: What I often hear from survivors is “ask, don’t tell.” People don’t realize that, on days like this, the grieving want to be able to do what they feel comfortable doing.

It is a wish list that reflects the President’s priorities. Trump’s budget makes clear that his priorities are making his rich pals wealthier at the expense of the most vulnerable in our society.On the campaign trail, Trump promised to crack down on undocumented immigrant communities living in the United States. This budget offers unusually cruel ideas to match his rhetoric.One of Trump’s most notorious campaign promises during the campaign trail was getting Mexico to pay for a “big, beautiful” border wall on the southern border. Since his election, the Mexican government has made it explicitly clear that it would not pay any of the cost involved in building the wall and as a result the Trump administration is looking to make Americans pay for a wall that most don’t even want. Trump has requested $1.6 billion just to cover a few dozen miles of the wall, the estimated cost for completing it could cost tax payers a mind boggling $67 billion.Along with the money for the border wall, his budget proposal includes billions of dollars to severely crackdown on immigrant communities with a bulked up deportation force on steroids. He proposes spending $1.5 billion to detain and deport undocumented immigrants and $300 million to bring on up to 1,500 new immigration agents, a move which already has seen rushed efforts to hire anyone available, lowering the standards and quality of these new officers.To complement these new immigration agents, the Trump administration is requesting $1.2 billion to expand the nation’s detention centers to their biggest capacity in their history. Considering the fact that border crossings are in record low numbers, these detention centers will likely be filled with people arrested inside the United States. To deal with that eventuality, the Trump administration has asked the Department of Justice to spend $75 million to hire immigration judges and support staff.But this administration won’t stop there in its effort to hurt immigrant families as much as possible. They want to hurt anyone who humanizes immigrants and considers them assets to building a better America. The Trump administration attempted to sneak in language into the budget that would force local governments to comply with federal detention requests. Trump had signed an executive order in January attempting to do something similar but legal challenges eventually made the order null. The City of San Francisco, which fought the executive order, accused the administration of trickery in its attempts to sneak the language into its budget.In total, the Trump administration is requesting about $4.6 billion to tear children from their parents, wives from husbands and grandparents from their relatives. He is proposing some of the harshest anti-immigrant policy proposals this country has seen in a long time. This comes at a time when the country is seeing record low numbers of border crossings.As immigrants and Americans, we need to stop this madness. We need to say no to wasting our money on half-baked executive orders that are not legally sound and do nothing more than attack people for who they are. We need to say no to spending our taxes for border enforcement when crossings are at record low numbers. We need to say no to funding a wall no one wants or detention beds meant to enrich the private prison industry and corporations backing hate.Instead, we need to protect immigrants, including those people that the administration is taking law enforcement actions against who were protected under President Obama’s enforcement priorities, such as Dreamers.The Trump budget is needlessly cruel and takes broad aim at immigrant communities living peacefully and contributing to our society. We must make Congress do the right thing and reject this budget.Thomas Kennedy is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change."

As Chucha and I we were thinking of titles for the show, I offered we use the name I’d titled a series that was inspired right after the June tragedy: Que Siga La Fiesta.In these sets of graphic illustrations, my goal was to honor our brown and black migrant, queer and trans community by capturing their resilience and beauty while dancing, drinking and just having a great time in their local gay bars or clubs. The reason why I was inspired to capture these moments was because right after the Pulse attack, the national media flocked the Orlando area to cover the tragedy and I was reminded of the constant danger that we as queer and trans people of color must deal with on the daily. That was, of course, their job. But after confronting the sadness that came with this tragic loss, it dawned on me that it took the death of 49 black and brown for our stories to count. It took tragedy to see the stories of people who looked like me and my friends to be in the conscience of straight (and gay) white America.I turned to my art to deal with this anger. As I traveled the country doing lectures, workshops and curating art shows in various college campuses, there was always a group of brown and black queers who wanted to take me to their spot. A spot where they could dance, have a drink and call their own. From crowded clubs in the Castro and smoky bars in El Paso with Mexico as a backyard to POC-themed nights in New York, I got to experience and document these spaces by taking photos of old and new friends that captured a time where they were not dealing with the racist, homophobic and transphobic bullshit that this society throws at us as queer and trans people of color. I’d then sit in airports, bus and train stations and create the illustrations that eventually became “Que Siga La Fiesta: Queer and Trans People of Color Club Takeover.” The week leading to the opening of the show was hectic. With the help of close friends, we painted a temporary mural that paid homage to those who came before us and who used nightclubs as a refuge to be themselves. Painted in the mural was Jose Sarria, who was the first openly gay man to run for office and a fixture at San Francisco’s The Black Cat Bar; Marsha P. Johnson, who was an icon of the Stonewall riots; Brenda Lee Marquez, who lost her life the night of the shooting at Pulse Nightclub; and Dorian Corey, who guided us through the ball scene vernacular in the documentary Paris Is Burning. My friend Chucha created portraits of artists and performers that included RuPaul, San Cha, Juan Gabriel and Persia. Another aspect of the show was a small installation we had in the corner of the gallery that faced the street. In this installation, Chucha and I wanted to recreate a young queer’s room. We filled one side of the wall with some of our favorite divas: Beyonce, Lil’ Kim, Jenni Rivera and Rihanna. There was a small zarape-covered dresser with some of the essentials: cologne, empty bag of hot Cheetos, booze and an old Mexican consular identification. There was also a portrait of one of Chucha’s friend, who left this world around the time of the Pulse tragedy. You see, if you’re a lucky young queer, you’ll get a room of your own where you can be free to be yourself. If you grew up poor like me and your room was a small laundry room in a one-bedroom home, you made the best out of it and decorated its walls with Spice Girls’ lollypop wrappers (it was the ‘90s). But the biggest goal of this installation was a sort of moment of silence for those 49 lives we lost. For most of them, the last thing they saw was their room. The place where they got dolled up, maybe pre-gamed and joked with their friends. A ritual that queers and trans folks across this country do right before going out and having a fun night. It was our way to honor them by celebrating this ritual.When we opened the show on May 20, the Oakland gallery slowly began to fill with a bunch of familiar queer and trans faces whom I’d illustrated. Seeing them so excited and taking selfies next to their portraits assured me that art is indeed the tool we can turn to in times of crisis and loss.Que Siga La Fiesta will be up until June 25th at Studio Grand in Oakland, CA."

33,SCIENCE,The Humble Honeybee,"Dr Reese Halter, ContributorBroadcaster, Biologist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-humble-honeybee_us_593b1cdee4b014ae8c69e05d,Honeybees are incomparable little creatures. Allow me to tell you why: Honeybees and humans share many things in common: we,2017-06-09,"<p>Honeybee loading pollen into her corbicula (or pollen basket) from lemon blossom in Hollywood, Calif.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593b1cfb1d00001600cc22a2.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Honeybees are incomparable little creatures. Allow me to tell you why:Honeybees and humans share many things in common: we socialize, dance, eat honey, touch, feel, mimic one another, sleep, enjoy nicotine, caffeine, vote and we both get sick.After a queen honeybee lays a couple million eggs, she begins to produce fewer pheromones (or chemical scents), which cause the worker bees to feed half a dozen larvae royal jelly or pure protein as they begin rearing a new queen. It’s up to the scout bees to locate a new site to move the existing queen and thousands of workers to create with their beeswax a new hive. The bees reach a consensus on a new location by voting. Research has shown that 15 is the crucial number of scout bees for a quorum. Then they wait for the signal to evacuate.Are you like me and millions of other people who find our morning caffeine buzz irresistible? Well – we’re not alone – our friends the honeybees also seek a morning buzz from flowers containing nectar laced with caffeine. That caffeine boosts the bees’ memories causing the buzzed forager bees, returning to the hive, to dance vigorously and communicate to other bees the precise location of the caffeinated flowers. It seems that some plants have evolved an ingenious mechanism of using caffeine as a drug to get the upper hand on the bees to pollinate their flowers first.Not only do bees pollinate 75 percent of all the world’s food crops, but also all the cotton we wear. Honeybees produce an astounding 2.6 billion pounds of honey each year for humans. One teaspoon of honey weighing 21 grams contains 16 grams of sugar or 60 calories. It takes 12 honeybees a combined flying distance of about 6,000 miles, or their entire foraging lives, to produce those 21 grams of honey. Normally, a forager honeybees dies because after flying 500 miles in three weeks and visiting almost a million flowers, she wears her wings out or to put it another way – she works herself to death.These admirable little creatures can count to four and they can be trained to arrive at three, four and five separate periods during 24 hours.For the previous 15 years, my colleagues have been training honeybees to identify over 60 different odors ranging from enriched uranium to tuberculosis, methamphetamine (or crystal meth) and TNT the main explosive in landmines. Honeybees are now being deployed instead of sniffer dogs to locate more than 250,000 landmines at sites left behind in the 1990s war in former Yugoslavia. By the way, sniffer dogs cost $9,000 each, are accurate approximately 71 percent of the time, require three months of intensive training and they get maimed. Honeybees, on the other hand, are accurate 98 percent of the time, require less than 10 minutes of training and they preclude sniffer dogs from being harmed or killed. By finding those unexploded landmines our friends the humble honeybees will help prevent the maiming of hundreds of children playing in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Just like people and dogs, bees get sad when they are handled or manipulated too much or if they don’t get enough sleep when predators repeatedly attack them. Bees learn while asleep and they may dream too. Bees show similar signs of pessimism seen in depressed or anxious people. Honeybees and people even share genetic similarities. Some thrill seeking honeybees, just like people, are drawn to adventure. And there are over 1,000 genetic differences that affect a bee’s likelihood of being a thrill seeker.There are approximately one million neurons in a bee’s brain and some of those neurons are responsible for giving honeybees distinct personalities. The more we learn about the bees, the more remarkable these creatures become.Bee deaths in America are at an all time annual high of 44 percent. In addition, 749 native bee species in North America and Hawaii are heading towards extinction from pesticides, habitat loss and the climate crisis. It’s long over due that we protect the bees, at all costs, from deadly neonicotinoid pesticides. We need healthy bees in order to feed a human population adding almost 90 million people a year, as the United Nations predicts we will top 8.5 billion humans by 2030.Earth Doctor Reese Halter is the author of “The Incomparable Honeybee.”"

That day remains the definitive start of many firsts in my coming out story. It was the first time I held a rainbow flag on a stick in public. It was the first time I was in the same place as a real celebrity — Cyndi Lauper, albeit she was on top of a moving vehicle singing her heart out as I dilly dallied along the far side of the sidewalk, separated from the spirited crowd on the curb. The first season of Queer as Folk (the U.S. adaptation) was ending that evening. Their parade contingent was made up of men in pink passing out pink handheld QAF paper fans. It felt significant with meaning at the time. Then GAPIMNY (The Gay Asian & Pacific Islander Men of NY) marched by, and it was the first time I saw other gay Asians banded together. They looked both brave and fearful. I could relate to the yin and yang of the situation; it was the year I first fell in love and first experienced heartbreak.I was just a kid and brand-spanky new to New York. I didn’t yet have a bed of my own, nor a clear career path to the dismay of my immigrant family. I had no social network, other than the AOL chatrooms. This was before social media, before my go to vodka cranberries, and definitely before any intentions of coming out. I was just a shell. But by that year’s end, I would be forever changed — as would all of New York, and even the world. Innocence was lost, but I was stronger because of it.Gay pride season kicks off every year in June, and much like our youth is chronicled by what grade we’re in, my journey of self-acceptance is time stamped by the context of each pride season. In 2003, I celebrated pride in Los Angeles, having come out to my VERY Korean parents. In 2008, the devastating defeat of taking down Prop 8 colored the march with righteous angry hues. In 2015, now living in DC, the marriage equality victory made for an amorous and ecstatic weekend. The following pride would be a stark contrast as it was the day after the Pulse nightclub massacre. This year, almost half a century since the first gay pride parade in 1969, it goes without saying that pride celebrations have profoundly evolved in meaning and execution.Cue the rounds of constructive criticism and off-hand dissections on what pride was — or is — and what it shouldn’t be. The DC-based group No Justice No Pride have been particularly vocal this year, resulting in frustrated and even angry sentiments. In the context of our societal and legal progress as well as grave setbacks for our community, why is it so easy to roll our eyes at the commercial sponsorships, ageist go-go boys and all the Jennifers, while we fight our way to the bar for another round? Admittedly, the sights, sounds and anthemic rhythms of Pride can feel mundane.But for me, participating in gay pride still evokes the feeling I had in 2001 in New York City. I’m reminded of the moment I took in the crowd and saw someone that reminded me of myself, but instead with a generous smile and a stronger gaze. I remember in that moment, I shed the dull coating of shame and was introduced to myself for the first time. Unguarded and no longer invisible, I saw a glimpse and I liked it. I saw a glimpse and my soul stirred with strength and nascent inklings of pride.This weekend in DC, I will be participating in Capital Pride events and the Equality March with my buddies. I will participate by being visible and adding a note to the chorus. I will do so knowing that this weekend is only the start of pride season and that this chorus will be carried out across different cities and different dates before the summer’s end. And we will be heard in exuberant harmony, bolstered by the rally cries of strangers that traveled this journey long before. But I will especially think of those around me, quietly watching from the sidelines or perhaps lurking on social media from a small town. I will think of my brothers and sisters in other countries, suffering without a voice. I will make myself visible for all of them, sensing that maybe they need to see a glimpse of themselves, unmasked. This weekend, I will be there for the kid that I once was. Thinking about that — yeah, it still tickles me pink with pride. 🌈"

I hadn’t seen any trailers, read interviews, or otherwise been exposed to its plot or themes. I expected it to be just another Hollywood money grab with a starlet in provocative clothes who is strong up to a point, until she eventually gets saved by a man and sees the light. Damn, was I wrong. We were a little tardy getting into the theater due to the snack line and when we entered the dark theater with previews in play, we were awed to see that nearly every seat was already taken. Inwardly grumbling about the sore neck I’d have later, we settled into our second-row seats just in time for the opening scene, which quickly segued to Wonder Woman’s origin story on the breathtaking island of Themyscira. Surrounded by undulating blue water and shocking in its unspoiled beauty, Themyscira is the birthplace of Princess Diana (aka Wonder Woman), who was sculpted of clay and brought to life by Zeus. But even more breathtaking than idyllic Themyscira were its inhabitants – a community of Amazonian women engaged in fierce hand-to-hand battle practice. As they fearlessly lunged and spun into high kicks in an evocative dance of strength without breaking a sweat, I turned to my friend Patti and said, “You didn’t tell me this was a lesbian movie!” It was that, and it was so much more. Is it an overstatement to say that it’s every lesbian’s dream to live on an island such as this one? Where women are powerful, fully capable of defending themselves, and tasked with the knowledge that the beauty and safety of the world is in their capable hands? Is it every woman’s dream to live on a pristine island where the concept of sexual assault is unheard of and body shaming hasn’t been invented or experienced? Ever. What would it be like to live without the hobbling effects of shame and fear and misogyny? Themyscira gives us a peek, and it is glorious. When it’s Diana’s turn to learn to fight, her aunt, Antiope, trains her fiercely, and when Diana stumbles, she commands her, “Never doubt yourself!” leading Diana to find unknown strength and power in her next moves. In the age of Trump, when it feels like the seams of our world as we know it are breaking apart, Themyscira seems like a utopia for this Amazon wannabe. And when Greek mythology is evoked to explain that one day the God of war, Ares, will come to corrupt mankind with hatred and loathing, and it’s the Amazons’ purpose to defeat him, you can’t help but well up with grief over the parallels to our time. Throughout the film, when Diana is confronted with human suffering, violence, evil, and war, she is single-minded in the knowledge that it’s her purpose to end it, even under seemingly insurmountable circumstances. When her traveling companions, seasoned male veterans of war, balk at the idea of advancing against the German front, she leaps forward alone, fiercely striding toward the enemy lines with only her metal wrist cuffs, her round Amazonian shield, and determination to protect her from the onslaught of machine gun bullets aimed at her. This film operates on an archetypal level. From the moment war ships broke the magical veil and advanced toward unspoiled Themyscira, I was hit with the realization that I was witnessing the attack of Christianity on Goddess culture and the birth of misogyny. Diana’s quest to find Ares and defeat him is quite simply the desire for goodness to conquer evil. But the most important message of the movie was not one of simplicity, nor was it black and white. The message was about complexity. That each one of us holds good and evil within us – and that it’s what we believe that shapes our actions and the world we live in. When Diana is engaged in an epic battle with Ares, and her faith in humanity is in question after she sees what we are capable of – the good as well as the evil – Ares tries to convince her that the world would be better off without humans. I have to confess that I’ve had my moments thinking the same. Wouldn’t Earth be a paradise without our interference, without the disruptions to the equilibrium of nature that we bring? But Diana struggles to find the good, and even as she heaves a tank overhead in a moment of rage and grief, she is still able to see the humanity in the eyes of her enemy and spare them. In that moment, as she looked into the eyes of her cowering and destructive enemy, we see their vulnerability and we are forced to wonder – what makes someone evil? What makes Trump the way he is? What makes the conservative GOP set policies specifically intended to hurt the vulnerable and the marginalized? What takes away a person’s capacity for empathy? Evil begets evil. I can’t help thinking about how restrictive and stifling it is to grow up in a conservative and punitive culture. How it can break a person. When you live under those kinds of rules, you either bend to them to survive –often continuing the cycle of abuse – or you rebel and accept that you will be an outcast to your community of origin. It’s much like the epic struggle to come out within conservative families. Some people go so deep in the closet that they can’t even look at themselves in the mirror, and we end up with spiteful, sexually repressed lawmakers who legislate to govern our bodies while trying not to get caught in the local motel with a rent boy. Others break the closet door and lay down a path that everyone else in between can follow to freedom. No one saves Princess Diana of Themyscira, daughter of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. She saves herself, and she saves our idea of what humanity can be. We can recognize the good and evil within ourselves, and choose to believe, against all the evidence, that if we work toward the good and never doubt ourselves, we too can be the saviors of our world.

Forty-one men remain imprisoned without charge, suspended in space and time, detached from families and homeland, a 15-year hiatus from reality.I’ve been coming to this place for a few years now as a lawyer for the prisoners, but it still feels surreal to me. Some days (including today), the power will go out entirely on one side of the island and stay out all day without explanation or warning. The only modes of transportation here are a yellow school bus and slow-chugging ferry—a throwback to some suburban childhood that wasn’t mine.Days at Guantanamo are quiet and dull—the people who work on the base have polite southern accents (all “yes sir” and “no ma’am”), and all the faces are familiar. It’s like a scene from Pleasantville —but for the prison. I think people here forget that they’re living next to the most famous prison in the world. When I answer a mail clerk’s question about why I’m on the base, he looks as though I have reminded him of a childhood classmate he had worked to forget. “Ohh yeah… right,” he says.On this trip, I am meeting with eight men. One of them—Tolfiq al Bihani—was cleared to go home in 2010​. This means that the entire American security apparatus has agreed unanimously that Tolfiq posed no threat to the U.S. Guantanamo may be the only prison on earth that keeps prisoners it concedes need not be imprisoned.This is the era of Donald Trump, which for most down here simply means the third commander-in-chief who hasn’t quite known what to do about this illegal prison. The detainees all have different perspectives on what his clumsy reign will bring. For now, we sit and wait. My clients have become good at that.These days, things are as quiet inside the prison as out. The inmates are now long-term residents, and have been there much longer than the average Guantanamo resident, who’ll rotate here for some nine months to two years. These prisoners have familiar routines, old favorites, likes and dislikes; they know the behaviors of local wildlife as well as any local biologist might. They can explain the Caribbean weather patterns, and list which foods are available on base and which are not. They are like 41 grandfathers with a view of the town from their front porch, but their ankles are chained to their rocking chairs.We communicate in English, all of my clients and I. Sometimes they correct my word choice, and I imagine a little “w/c” scribbled on a high school essay. This trip, two of my clients read aloud to me from books in English. What kind of shattered beauty is it to teach yourself a new language from scratch in this place—the language of your captors.All my clients here have spent over 10 years in prison without ever being charged with a crime. Ten years ago, I didn’t have my law license. Ten years ago, we heard Obama promise the closure of Guantanamo from the campaign trail. The men here know better than anyone that political promises in Washington are just that.As the years tick by, while American politicians hem and haw, and American people look away, these stranded prisoners age—beards turn gray and life slips away. My unmarried clients dream of a future family, children to raise, while encountering the usual signs of growing older—high blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis. What happens when my client, Saifullah Paracha, a 70-year-old father of four, has a heart attack while imprisoned here? There is no facility to save him.On the airplane home to New York, I wonder if Donald Trump, businessman, has done the math on Guantanamo. It costs the U.S. government $445 million a year to keep this prison open. That’s over $29,000 per prisoner, per night—spent to secure me, as an American, from the clients I visit several times a year. Meanwhile, men across the world dress their prisoners in familiar orange jump suits to terrify us all.I know I don’t feel any safer, do you?"
37,POLITICS,Will There Be A Rural Backlash To Affordable Care Act Repeal Efforts?,"Dr. Marcus Bright, ContributorScholar and Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/will-there-be-a-rural-backlash-to-affordable-care-act_us_5937412fe4b04ff0c46682a6,"There are real consequences for people amidst the political showmanship in Washington, D.C.",2017-06-09,"<p>Supporters of Wendi Wright at the Weakley County (TN) Courthouse on June 2, 2017</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5937415619000052003e4e06.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is a misconception nationally about there being a virtual consensus of support for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in rural areas that traditionally vote for Republican candidates. The fact is that many people in rural areas of the country will be among the 24 million who will likely lose their healthcare coverage if the new American Health Care Act of 2017 (ACHA) gets passed by the Senate and signed by the President.There are real consequences for people amidst the political showmanship that often occurs in Washington, D.C. around this issue. It will be interesting to see if GOP Congressional members who voted for the AHCA will face a backlash as the nation looks toward the 2018 midterm elections.An example of the resistance to ACA repeal efforts in rural areas occurred on May 8th in Martin, Tennessee. Wendi Wright, a 35-year-old University of Tennessee at Martin student, got into a confrontation with GOP Congressman David Kustoff about his vote for the AHCA.Wright was charged with reckless endangerment after she allegedly followed Kustoff after an event on the UT Martin campus. According to WPSD Local 6, she allegedly got out of the car and screamed at the Congressman for not addressing her questions related to his recent health care reform vote. Wright is the is the mother of a 5-year-old with pre-existing conditions. According to Wright’s father, her daughter has an eye issue and a tumor.Wright’s father, Albert Wright, said in an interview that “she wanted to ask him what is a pre-existing condition, what’s going on to be covered, what’s not going to be covered, what in the state of Tennessee is going to change. I just think basically the frustration of not getting an answer is what drove her to try to find him.”Wright’s charges were dropped on the condition that she have no contact with Kustoff or his staff over the next year during a hearing on June 2nd. A crowd of people organized to show support for Wright outside of the courtroom on the day of the hearing. One of the supporters stated that “she’s not alone here, and she’s not alone in her frustrations that he’s not been available to answer any questions of hers.”Wright’s actions were extreme, but they did speak to the desperation that people feel who may lose health care coverage for themselves and their children. Will these emotions be widespread and potent enough to jumpstart a progressive movement in traditionally red states? Will the facts of their potential tangible losses register enough with them politically for people to change their voting behavior?It is difficult to continue to make sense of why people would continually support politicians who vote against their material self-interests. The elephant in the room that people seem to not want to address is that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that they knew little about because the ACA is attached to President Barack Obama.Texas native and former President Lyndon B. Johnson once stated that “if you can convince the lowest white man that he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll even empty his pockets for you.” The question today is whether or not that same group of people will be persuaded to give up their health care coverage. There is undoubtedly a racial aspect to some of the vigorous ACA opposition.The fact that the ACA was nicknamed “Obamacare” is likely to be the determining factor as to whether or not people support the ACA. The New York Times reported on a poll from Morning Consult that one-third of Americans don’t know that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same. They may feel that erasing “Obamacare” will erase his Presidency of Barack Obama as we know it. Ironically, many opponents of the ACA actually agree with many of the core principles of the bill.There is a need for a targeted information push by people who can go door to door at the grassroots level. This kind of personalized approach is necessary to overcome the noise from Fox News and other media outlets. The story of Wendi Wright suggests that there may be an untapped progressive movement in rural areas that can potentially shift electoral politics in traditional Republican strongholds.Marcus Bright, Ph.D. is a Scholar and Activist"

Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, photographer and journalist Allen Kakony, received a call from the Iraqi army in a call Mosul, Iraq’s second largest town. “A six-year-old Christian girl had been liberated” from the hands of ISIS. Her father and a family friend were to go to a specific location in Mosul where she would be given back to them. The terrorist group ISIS invaded Mosul and surrounding villages of the Nineveh Plain during the summer of 2014. Christian Assyrians/Chaldeans/Syriacs were given four options: convert to Islam, flee, die or pay extortion money (so called jizye, a religious tax). The letter N in Arabic, Noon, meaning Nazerene or Christian in Arabic was painted on all Christian homes and shops, they fled en masse for fear of being slaughtered. ISIS also persecuted Yazidis and other non-Muslims minorities as well as Muslims who did not heed ISIS’s interpretation of the Koran. Thousands of people were slaughtered and thousands more were kidnapped. Millions were exiled.Christina was three years old at the time.. Her family’s faith became known all over the world. She was snatched from her mother’s arms by one of the ISIS commanders. New York Times Magazine and many others outlets covered her story. Her face was used on placards all over the world during rallies to stop the persecution of non-Muslims in Iraq and Syria. As her family waited in utter devastation, in a camp in Kurdish Regional Government’s capital Erbil, their story was discussed in the European Parliament, the US congress and many other places. A Demand for Action, the organisation I am a part of, reported numerous times about the family’s plight because of their faith. Christina became a symbol of genocide. Churches all over the world prayed for her safety and release. Today she is reunited with her family but the effects of her kidnap are clear. “She appears fine physically however she is unable to talk to her parents. She only communicates with them in sign language. She has lost her Assyrian/Syriac and only speaks few words of Arabic,” Allen Kakony tells me over the phone while sitting with her and her five siblings in the camp where her parents are residing. Kakony sent a live FB video on his personal page this morning of the celebration of her release. As I watch her community celebrate her return with dancing and singing, I think not of the terrorists who tore her from her mother but of the Muslim family who found, saved her and returned her to parents. Yesterday Christina was a symbol of genocide. Today she is a symbol of hope. The road back to her old self may be a long one but it is now a journey she can make with her family."

We are still deeply saddened by the loss of 49 lives and injuries to more than 50 others in the ISIS-claimed attack; an attack which was an act of hate and violence against LGBTIQ persons and our fundamental dignity.However, we are also proud to see the immense efforts to heal undertaken by the Orlando community and the solidarity from around the world in the year since the massacre. Worldwide condemnation of the attack was loud and for the most part recognized that violence and persecution of the LGBTIQ community is pervasive and must be put to an end. Many LGBTIQ communities around the world felt the attack on a personal level, knowing it could have happened to them. Many felt the familiarity of being at a club, dancing with other LGBTIQ people. Through our global partners, we at OutRight saw acts of solidarity in cities from all around the world.The aftermath of the Orlando shooting also saw the first-ever statement by the United Nation’s Security Council referencing sexual orientation, denouncing the attack and acknowledging that it was anti-gay biased. This important statement sets precedence in the international peace and security arena that queer lives matter, and they are being targeted; a matter of international concern.However, we all know that there remains much to be done in the wake of the shooting in the United States and globally. The underlying issues that contributed to the shooting remain unresolved, and has indeed increased, in the past year. Both state-sponsored and individual acts of homophobia and transphobia are far too common in the US and worldwide. In the US, the administration is rolling back protections for trans students and undermining international systems and structures that have contributed to providing safety and services for LGBTIQ people. Internationally we have seen many examples of arrests, torture and even killings of LGBTIQ people, as can be seen by the recently reported detention of men presumed to be gay in Chechnya and Indonesia.All around the world LGBTIQ people’s, arguably all people’s, rights to exist, to assemble, to express themselves are being targeted. With greater visibility and demands of equality of and by the LGBTIQ community, we are also seeing drastic pushback aimed at erasing our lives and silencing our rights through force and threats. Issues impacting the LGBTIQ community are heightened by anti-Muslim, xenophobic, anti-women sentiments in the US and beyond, as exemplified by President Trumps “Muslim travel ban,” the consequences of which are devastating and far reaching. The idea that anti-Muslim policies would make society safer is a forced illusion; we feel, and are, no safer with policies that put white-supremacy on a pedestal and oppress minority communities in any way.To prevent more attacks against the LGBTIQ and Muslim communities, we must work to resolve issues that affect all disenfranchised communities around the world. We must continue not to conflate the actions of one man, or ISIS affiliates and sympathizers, with all Muslims, we must fight against Islamophobia the marginalization and villainization it propagates. And we must not pit minorities against each other, but rather stand together in solidarity against bigotry, violence, and discrimination everywhere. Indeed, OutRight Action International has joined 58 other LGBTIQ, Muslim, and Latinx communities in a unity statement in commemoration of the first day of remembrance of the massacre.We need a peaceful, community-driven, and global strategy to continue healing from events like the massacre at Pulse and prevent further violent crimes against LGBTIQ people, Muslims, and LGBTIQ Muslims globally.To the people of Orlando, especially the families and loved ones of the victims of last year’s massacre, we are still with you. To members of the LGBTIQ, Muslim and LGBTIQ Muslim communities and allies around the world, we are with you in the fight for human rights everywhere. And as we did last year, we urge friends and allies to celebrate Pride with joy, love, and fearlessness."

Sterling fell more than two cents against the U.S. dollar. .It was an extraordinary failure for May, who was enjoying opinion poll leads of 20 points and more when she called the snap election just seven weeks ago.But her lead had gradually shrunk over the course of the campaign, during which she backtracked on a major social care proposal, opted not to take part in a high-profile TV debate with her opponents, and faced questions over her record on security after Britain was hit by two Islamist militant attacks that killed 30 people.“If the poll is anything like accurate, this is completely catastrophic for the Conservatives and for Theresa May,” George Osborne, who was the Conservative finance minister from 2010 to 2016 when he was sacked by May, said on ITV.Analysts were treating the exit poll with caution. In the last election, in 2015, the corresponding poll predicted May’s predecessor David Cameron would fall short of a majority. But as the night wore on and the actual results came in from constituencies, it became clear he had in fact won a majority, albeit a small one of just 12 seats.That outcome was a triumph for Cameron though, because he had been predicted to fall well short. For May, who went into the campaign expecting to win a landslide, even a narrow win later in the night would leave her badly damaged.Until the final results become clear, it is hard to predict who will form the next government.“It’s difficult to see, if these numbers were right, how they (the Conservatives) would put together the coalition to remain in office,” said Osborne.“But equally it’s quite difficult looking at those numbers to see how Labour could put together a coalition, so it’s on a real knife edge.”Political deadlock in London could derail negotiations with the other 27 EU countries ahead of Britain’s exit from the bloc, due in March 2019, before they even begin in earnest.A delay in forming a government could push back the start of Brexit talks, currently scheduled for June 19, and reduce the time available for what are expected to be the most complex negotiations in post-World War Two European history.The poll forecast the Scottish National Party (SNP) would win 34 seats, the center-left Liberal Democrats 14, the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru three and the Greens one.If the exit poll is correct, Labour, led by veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, could attempt to form a government with those smaller parties, which strongly oppose most of May’s policies on domestic issues such as public spending cuts.May called the snap election to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with the other 27 EU countries and to cement her grip on the Conservative Party after she took over as prime minister in the wake of last year’s Brexit referendum.If she fails to win a majority, that could call into question her position as Conservative leader and might mean a second election in Britain this year.If Corbyn’s Labour does take power with the backing of the Scottish nationalists and the Liberal Democrats, both parties adamantly opposed to Brexit, Britain’s future will be very different to the course the Conservatives were planning and could even raise the possibility of a second referendum.May had promised to clinch a Brexit deal that prioritized control over immigration policy, with Britain leaving the European single market and customs union, and said no deal would be better than a bad deal.Labour said it would push ahead with Brexit but would scrap May’s negotiating plans and make its priority maintaining the benefits of both the EU single market and its customs union, arguing no deal with the EU would be the worst possible outcome.It also proposed raising taxes for the richest 5 percent of Britons, scrapping university tuition fees and investing 250 billion pounds ($315 billion) in infrastructure plans.(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle, William Schomberg, Andy Bruce, William James, Alistair Smout, Paddy Graham, writing by Guy Faulconbridge and Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)"

Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) first came to Congress four years ago, he wanted “to get rid of foreign aid.” Since then, he said during a Wednesday hearing in Washington, he’s had a change of heart.“I know a lot of people might want to take a hatchet to foreign aid and say we’re not doing a good job,” Yoho continued. “But what I’ve learned is what [Secretary of Defense] General [James] Mattis said: If you cut foreign aid, buy more ammunition ‘cause you’re gonna need it.”Yoho’s remarks came during a House agriculture committee hearing centered on U.S. foreign food aid programs, a particularly timely topic given that President Donald Trump’s spending plan proposes eliminating all funding for two key food aid programs — Food for Peace and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program.The committee is in the beginning stages of reviewing farm bill programs, like the food aid initiatives, ahead of writing a new bill set to be finalized next year.While committee members, including Yoho, spoke about the need for reform to improve the efficiency of the programs, committee members from both parties on Wednesday widely panned the president’s proposal to zero out funding for both programs — spending that totals about $1.9 billion annually.In his opening comments, committee chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) criticized the programs’ proposed elimination as running counter to one of the president’s favorite campaign catchphrases.“International food aid programs not only contribute jobs in the U.S. agricultural sector, but also create American jobs in the manufacturing and maritime sectors,” Conaway said Wednesday. “Eliminating such programs seems contrary to the role they play in a robust ‘America-first’ policy.”Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) put matters a bit more bluntly.“Of all the things we could cut, we would cut food,” Fudge said. “We have become complicit, or will become complicit, in the starvation of hungry women and children. How many guns do we need, how much ammunition do we need? … It cuts jobs in this country. It is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.”The current need for food aid in regions such as East Africa is high.According to the U.N., more than 20 million people in four nations ― Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen — are on the verge of starvation in a situation the organization called the worst humanitarian crisis since 1945.Trump recently announced some $329 million in new food aid for the four above nations last month. But his overall proposal for international food aid spending — folding it into a broader international disaster assistance program — would represent a more than 40 percent cut in spending in the next fiscal year, an Associated Press analysis last month noted.The U.S. is far and away the world’s leading food aid provider, and the programs slated for cuts have been a key part of that effort, supporters say.The Food for Peace program, created in 1954 by President Dwight Eisenhower and administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development, reached about 48 million people in 61 different countries during the most recent fiscal year for which data has been published.The McGovern-Dole program, named after former Sens. George McGovern and Robert Dole, has provided meals to more than 40 million children across 40 nations since it was created in 2003.Dole, himself an adamant Trump supporter, told the Washington Post in March that eliminating the program “would have a disastrous effect on the planet’s most vulnerable children.”The president’s skinny budget described the McGovern-Dole program as “lack[ing] evidence that it is being effectively implemented.” It remains unclear whether Congress will pass the president’s proposed food aid cuts, as even supporters of the programs acknowledged that the nation’s budget constraints could force difficult decisions. Arlene Mitchell, executive director of the Global Child Nutrition Foundation, admitted in a phone conversation after Wednesday’s hearing that she was skeptical whether the committee’s remarks largely supportive of the programs would sway the administration.“Even with bipartisan congressional support, programs can be slowed or diminished and are difficult to implement if the administration doesn’t support them,” Mitchell added, “but hopefully the administration would take instruction from Congress and implement the programs that Congress supports.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Yemen as part of the East African region."

While the nation’s attention was turned to former FBI director James Comey’s testimony at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Clinton stayed silent on the revelations about his conversations with President Donald Trump, instead urging the graduating class to remember that “the work of justice is never finished.”“The first months of this year saw a surge in hate crimes across our country,” Clinton said. “White supremacists are emboldened, and their numbers on the rise.”She reminded the audience of the May 26 stabbing on a Portland commuter train, when Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, allegedly stabbed three men who defended two teenage girls from Christian’s “racist, xenophobic tirade,” as Clinton put it. One of the girls was wearing a hijab, and Christian reportedly made comments such as telling the girls to go back to Saudi Arabia. Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, died in the attack. Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, was seriously injured but survived.“They stepped in front of those girls to block the abuse,” Clinton said. “Other passengers rushed forward to comfort and pray with the victims, and one victim’s last words as he was carried away by paramedics echoes what [Medgar Evers College President Rudolph Crew] said at the very beginning of this ceremony: ‘Tell everyone on this train that I love them.’”That quote was remembered by one of the passengers on the train, Rachel Macy, who told local Oregon Live that she had comforted Namkai-Meche after he was stabbed in the neck.Namkai-Meche’s last words and the heroic actions in the face of hate “showed us the best and worst of humanity among us,” Clinton said Thursday.“At the last minute of his life he was thinking of love ― love for those he knew and love for total strangers,” she said.Clinton said that in light of the surge of acts of hate, both the nation’s leaders and the public must “recommit ourselves to the urgent work of protecting the safety and civil rights of all of our people, not moving in the opposite direction, undoing the progress that we have made.” “Instead, we see official actions that turn us against one another and turn us back,” she said.She highlighted Trump’s “Muslim ban,” as well as the Department of Justice’s limited interest in protecting voting rights and the Department of Education’s signal that it won’t defend the civil rights of LGBTQ students.“The Muslim ban is a particularly egregious example ― and yes, it is a ban, as the president himself made very clear this week,” Clinton said. “But you know, attacks on civil rights don’t have to be dramatic to be dangerous.” CORRECTION: Due to an editorial error, this article initially misstated that the men killed in Portland were from Oklahoma."
45,HEALTHY LIVING,Experts Don't Recommend Writing Comey-Style Memos About Your Boss,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/comey-memos-psychology_us_59397de8e4b0061054808f42,Unless you really don't trust him or her.,2017-06-08,"Former FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, June 8, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5939a3b2190000aa4f3e5416.jpeg?cache=WImsJEDhKy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Thursday, Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) complimented former FBI Director James Comey on the detailed memos in which Comey documented, among other things, President Donald Trump’s request that he stop a federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.“I find it concise, and having been a prosecutor for a number of years and handling hundreds, maybe thousands of cases and read police reports, investigative reports, this is as good as it gets,” Risch said during Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. “Not only the conciseness and the clearness of it, but also the fact that you have things that were written down contemporaneously when they happened.”If you want to remember something accurately, writing out a description of it immediately after it happens is the most reliable way to do so.In Comey’s case, his status as onetime leader of the FBI makes those notes even more valuable. The New York Times noted in May that “an F.B.I. agent’s contemporaneous notes are widely held up in court as credible evidence of conversations.” Still, human memory is imperfect.Writing down memories is a form of what psychologists call rehearsal ― a way to retain information and solidify it in memory by repeating and revisiting it. But the technique has its drawbacks. While you can strengthen your recollection of certain details by writing them out, the details you don’t focus on can end up fading from your memory faster ― a psychological phenomenon known as retrieval-induced forgetting. “If you see some event and you rehearse parts of it, those parts you rehearse are strengthened in memory, but at the same time, the non-rehearsed parts are weakened in memory,” Elizabeth Loftus, a cognitive psychologist and expert on memory formation at the University of California, Irvine, told HuffPost.And while it’s standard for FBI employees to keep detailed logs, typically to preserve evidence, according to psychology experts, it’s not necessarily a habit that non-federal agents should incorporate into their lives. “The world in which we all have to keep memos is a sad world,” Eli Finkel, a social psychology professor at Northwestern University, told HuffPost. “But if you believe that you can’t trust the people around you, the people that you work with, then you need to set all sorts of safeguards in place to protect yourself.”Notably, Comey did not document his interactions with former Presidents Barack Obama or George W. Bush. “When trust is badly damaged or compromised, it’s sensible ― in fact, it’s a very good idea ― to put mechanisms in place to protect yourself,” Finkel said.Sensible, yes ― but it could also be a sign of an unhealthy situation.In fact, if you find yourself documenting negative interactions with your boss or your partner, or even just thinking that you need to do so, it could be a sign that you should find a new job or think critically about your relationship.“I think it’s a sufficient cue that trust is badly damaged,” Finkel said. “If you are doing that with your partner, I would say that you should get help in your marriage.”To be sure, there’s a time and a place for keeping written records. Journaling, for instance, has been shown to help manage anxiety and reduce worry. And group note-taking, such as recording official minutes for a work meeting, can ensure productivity and help an organization run more smoothly. But those instances are very different from “surreptitiously ensuring that you have your ducks in a row,” as Finkel put it.Loftus, meanwhile, is worried that all the attention given to Comey’s memos might have a backfiring effect.“What is it going to teach people?” she asked. “Is it going to teach people to make up notes soon afterwards, in anticipation of somebody telling a different story later on?”Loftus stressed that she doesn’t think that’s what Comey did. “But,” she said, “I think this whole experience invites us to think about that potential.”This reporting is brought to you by HuffPost’s health and science platform, The Scope.

Today is Seersucker Thursday at the Senate, thanks to a tradition resurrected by the former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.). According to the Senate’s official website, senators in the South used to wear seersucker in the early 1900s to keep cool in the summer (the fabric is very breathable). They continued to wear the fabric until air conditioning became widely available in the 1950s. But Sen. Lott liked wearing seersucker, and in the 1990s he introduced Seersucker Thursday, reserving it for a “nice and warm” day in the second or third week of June. Sen. Dianne Feinstein later introduced the tradition for women in 2004. “I would watch the men preening in the Senate,” she said, according to the Senate’s website, “and I figured we should give them a little bit of a horse race.” The tradition is alive and well again.A few other senators also showed up in seersucker today: “[Seersucker Thursday] is just plain fun and celebrates an American product invented in my home state of Louisiana,” Sen. Cassidy told Roll Call on Wednesday. “It’s a lighthearted tradition and shows that the Senate isn’t a bunch of boring suits.”People clearly loved that Sen.

Trump cannot be expected to understand appropriate behavior for a president because he is a businessman, not a politician, and is still only learning.Trump’s Republican critics, though, have little patience with this argument – particularly because of the dangers it poses in foreign affairs. They point to an MSNBC report Thursday suggesting that Trump may have been unaware that Qatar hosts a crucial U.S. air base when he issued a statement via Twitter accusing that nation of supporting terrorists.“Our base in Qatar is a major hub for operations in the region. If he is getting halfway decent briefings on ongoing operations, he would know that ― and if he is not being decently briefed, it is on him, no one else,” said Eliot Cohen, a top State Department official and participant of the National Security Council under President George W. Bush who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University. “Ditto, leaning on the FBI director to drop a politically inconvenient investigation.”White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the MSNBC report on Qatar was not accurate. “100 percent false,” he said.As it happens, Trump’s ignorance actually seemed a feature on the campaign trail, as many of his core supporters justified their allegiance in spite of his clear ― and sometimes admitted ― lack of knowledge on a range of issues, from health care to foreign policy. After Trump won the GOP nomination, more established Republican operatives adopted a similar defense of their standard-bearer.But both grassroots followers and Republican Party regulars nevertheless expressed confidence that Trump, in their view a wildly successful businessman, would quickly learn on the job all he needed to know.Some supporters, though, concede that five months in, Trump has not been learning as quickly as might have been hoped.“The voters wanted an outsider, and these are things you get with someone from outside,” said one top Republican National Committee member privately.Matt Mackowiak, a Texas GOP consultant and frequent Trump defender, acknowledged that Trump’s attempts to end the investigation into his first national security adviser’s contacts with Russian officials was improper.“Lawyers know that ignorance of the law is no defense,” Mackowiak said. “But what may have clearly been inappropriate, may indeed not rise to the level of being illegal.”For Trump critics, the attempts to defend the president’s ignorance and unwillingness to adhere to basic standards of conduct have already gone too far ― particularly as they now involve the Republican National Committee’s systematic attacks on Comey’s integrity.“Trump is like a parasite that invaded the body politic, and the part that is most rotten right now is the RNC,” said John Weaver, who ran Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s presidential campaign last year. “They should be ashamed of themselves.”Weaver added that in addition to being wrong, reflexively defending Trump was bad politics. “Handcuffing yourself to a president who’s at 34 percent and sinking is not a good strategy,” he said.CORRECTION: This story incorrectly referred to Eliot Cohen as having been a lawyer at the State Department."

During a Senate hearing Thursday, former FBI Director James Comey challenged the accuracy of the story, responding “yes” when Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) asked whether it would be “fair to characterize” the Times’ Feb. 14 story “as almost entirely wrong.”Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) similarly asked Comey whether it would be “a fair statement” to say the Times report “was not true.” “In the main, it was not true,” he responded. Comey didn’t specify which details he believed to be inaccurate, a point The Times made in a Thursday article on the former FBI director’s remarks. That piece was written by Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti and Matt Apuzzo, the three reporters behind the February story. “Multiple news outlets have since published accounts that support the main elements of The Times’s article, including information about phone calls and in-person meetings between Mr. Trump’s advisers and Russians, some believed to be connected to Russian intelligence,” the paper reported. Though its “original sources could not immediately be reached” following Comey’s remarks, the Times noted that “in the months since the article was published, they have indicated that they believed the account was solid.”A Times spokesperson said in a statement that the new report had “found no evidence that any prior reporting was inaccurate.” “Neither the F.B.I., nor Mr. Comey would comment or elaborate on what Mr. Comey believes to be incorrect,” the spokesperson added. “Should they provide more information, we would review that as well.”Schmidt said Friday that his team has spent an “enormous” amount of time rereporting the story since its initial publication and speculated about which parts of the story the FBI might have taken issue with.“We think maybe the FBI may be putting a fine definition on ‘intelligence officials,’” he said. “They may be saying that the amount of intercepted calls we think there were was wrong. But our reporting still supports it.”While Thursday’s hearing was damaging for the president, with Comey recalling Trump’s requests to stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn and blasting the administration for lies and attempts to defame him, the criticism of the Times’ story gives ammunition to the president’s supporters who view the news media as overhyping the ongoing Russia investigation. The Republican National Committee blasted out an email Thursday afternoon with the subject “The New York Times Has Some Explaining To Do.”Comey’s remarks Thursday may give weight to previous denials from the Trump White House, which routinely dismisses critical and unflattering news stories as inaccurate or “fake.” White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Feb. 19 on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that officials at the “top levels of the intelligence community” had assured him the Times story “was grossly overstated, and inaccurate and totally wrong.”Five days later, CNN reported that Priebus had asked the FBI to rebut both the Times’ and its own reporting on communications between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence. White House officials responded by claiming Priebus asked Comey and then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to knock down the reports after they privately told him the information wasn’t accurate.New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said amid the earlier White House criticism that “the Times had numerous sources confirming this story” and “attacking it does not make it less true.”Hayley Miller contributed reporting.This article has been updated with comment from Schmidt."

And that translated into a landmark session for women’s rights and health this year, even under a male Republican governor.Nevada lawmakers just wrapped up a state legislative session that delivered a startling number of progressive victories for women: tax-free tampons, a new $500,000 family planning program, workplace accommodations for pregnant women, and mandatory insurance coverage of contraception and mammograms.“We started with some pushback from Republicans, but by the end of the session we had broad bipartisan support on a lot of these measures,” said state Sen. Julia Ratti (D), a freshman from Sparks. Ratti introduced a bill that codifies the women’s health protections in the Affordable Care Act into state law, so that if the Trump administration rolls any of them back, employers in Nevada will still be required to cover contraception, well-woman visits, breast exams and other preventive health services in their insurance plans at no out-of-pocket cost to their female employees. The bill also allows women to pick up a 12-month supply of birth control at once. Six Republicans joined Democrats in passing the measure, and Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) signed it. Nevada lawmakers also established the Nevada Pregnant Workers’ Fairness Act, introduced by state Sen. Nicole Cannizzaro (D), which requires employers to provide “reasonable accommodations” like breast pump rooms and a fair break schedule for pregnant employees. Legislators approved two bills introduced by state Sen. Pat Spearman (D) aimed at preventing stalkers and domestic abusers from possessing guns, and a bill eliminating sales tax on feminine hygiene products and diapers. And they established a state-funded family planning program to address a dearth of contraception access for low-income women in rural areas.“I think the results speak for themselves,” said Vanessa Cardenas, a spokesperson for EMILY’s List, which helps elect Democratic women in Nevada and nationwide. “We have been able to identify women that really represent the communities that are sending them to office.”EMILY’s List has been working to build and train a pipeline of female candidates in Nevada since 2014. The group recruited, trained, endorsed or financially supported the campaigns of 15 of the 18 Democratic women currently serving in the state legislature. “We have been able to identify women that really represent the communities that are sending them to office,” Cardenas said. “We go in there early, work to identify women who have a passion for helping their communities, and then give them the tools to win.”Women, despite making up more than half the population, are grossly underrepresented in politics. They make up less than 20 percent of Congress ― which often translates to rooms full of men making decisions that greatly affect women and women’s health.Of course, female lawmakers have a range of policy interests and expertise beyond those that mainly pertain to women. Ratti, who plans to run for state Senate again, hopes to spend her second term focusing on economic inequality and the state’s “broken” property tax system, which is contributing to an affordable housing crisis. She said she focused on health care in her first term because Trump’s victory “shone a bright light” on the immediate need to protect access to women’s preventive health services. Ratti said her first few months in the state legislature have shown her why it’s critical to have more women at the table. “We bring a different perspective,” she said. “You get a broader range of ideas when you have diversity in the workplace.”"

But he defended Trump and acted as if the president’s apparent attempts to influence Comey and have him drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn should be excused because the commander in chief is “new at this.”“He’s new to government,” Ryan said. “And so he probably wasn’t steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI, and White Houses. He’s just new to this.”Ryan continued that one takeaway from Comey’s testimony ― the Speaker wasn’t watching the Senate Intelligence hearing, but he said he had read Comey’s prepared remarks ― was that people should be able to see why Trump was so frustrated.“When the FBI director tells him on three different occasions, he’s not under investigation, yet the speculation swirls around the political system that he is, that’s frustrating,” Ryan said.Pressed that Trump’s lack of experience perhaps shouldn’t be an excuse for breaking the law, especially when he has advisers around him who know the law, Ryan offered that, “I’m not saying it’s an excuse, it’s just my observation.”When pressed on Trump, according to Comey, explicitly trying to get him to drop the investigation into Flynn, Ryan said he wasn’t going to comment “on these things,” citing the ongoing investigations in the House and Senate into Russian meddling.“There’s a ‘he said-he said’ thing to this, and I don’t have any comment on it,” Ryan said."

And at the eleventh hour, a little more time is what he got.Magaña Ortiz, a respected owner of a coffee farm and a businessman in Kona, Hawaii, was scheduled to report to immigration authorities in the state’s capital at 9 a.m. local time Thursday so he could be deported from the United States.At the last minute, the Department of Homeland Security granted Magaña Ortiz a 30-day delay from deportation, according to a statement from Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who had spoken to DHS Secretary John Kelly about the farmer’s case.“Today’s announcement is a positive step, but our work to keep Mr. Magaña Ortiz with his family isn’t done yet,” Hirono said Thursday.The federal government earlier appeared as if it wouldn’t give the father of three more time. As of late Wednesday, his lawyer James Stanton said, he was still waiting for word from someone in the Trump administration to put a halt to his imminent removal from the U.S. back to Mexico, where he hasn’t stepped foot in 28 years.For all they knew, that word could’ve come the moment Magaña Ortiz showed up at the federal office building in downtown Honolulu.“We’re still optimistic and waiting that something good will happen and that they’ll give me more time to get my situation in order,” Magaña Ortiz, owner of El Molinito Farm in Holualoa, said in an interview conducted in his native Spanish earlier this week. He was brought into the U.S. at 15 to work as a fruit picker in California.Magaña Ortiz appears to have everything he needs to make a compelling case that he belongs here: The ringing endorsement of a federal judge. The support of Hawaii’s entire congressional delegation. The backing of family members, fellow coffee farmers, and an industry that would falter if he’s made to leave.If Magaña Ortiz, 43, is forced to depart, he’d leave behind his wife and three children, all of whom are American and dependent on him. He’d leave behind his life’s work ― the 20-acre coffee farm he owns and nearly 150 acres of land he manages for other farm owners who are either too elderly, inexperienced or just unable to handle the work on their own.“He’s indispensable for my little corner of the world,” said Elisabeth Siekhaus, 75. She’s retired, has a disability and relies on Magaña Ortiz to tend to her 10 acres of land in Hawaii’s Kona district, renowned for its namesake coffee ― one of the world’s most expensive and distinctive, according to the Kona Coffee Farmers Association.“If he has to go,” Siekhaus said, “I’m kind of at the end of my rope.”Kona coffee isn’t easy to grow, in large part due to the coffee berry borer — a pest that hit the local coffee industry hard in 2010, leading to massive losses for growers and manufacturers. Over the years, University of Hawaii researchers, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and locals have looked to Magaña Ortiz to help keep the killer beetle under control.Magaña Ortiz’s efforts have helped keep the “bug problem” at their farms in Kona down to 2 percent, Brian Lindau, his business partner, told Hawaii News Now, a local news outlet. “When you get a guy like Andrés who’s a model citizen, been in business for years, pays taxes and is one of the heavy hitters in the coffee industry here,” Lindau said, “you’re shooting yourself in the foot and you’re shooting down the Kona coffee business” by deporting him.Even Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who in April got in hot water over calling Hawaii “an island in the Pacific,” got a feel for Magaña Ortiz’s contributions to the state when the president of the Kona Coffee Farmers Association, Suzanne Shriner, sent him a letter urging him to intervene and grant a stay of his deportation.“I work closely with farmers in the control of an invasive pest that has decimated our yields,” Shriner said in her June 1 letter. “Mr. Ortiz has been a large part of this response. He has served as a bilingual bridge in the community, teaching our labor force how to properly manage the pest. He has also advanced our control methods by assisting USDA-funded scientists in their research.”The outpouring of support for Magaña Ortiz began in earnest last week, when an appeals judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which reviews cases from Hawaii — including an ongoing challenge to Trump’s travel ban — issued a forceful opinion calling attention to the “inhumane” circumstances in the case. The judge was unafraid to call out Trump by name.“President Trump has claimed that his immigration policies would target the ‘bad hombres,’” wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt, also the court’s longest-serving, full-time judge. “The government’s decision to remove Magana Ortiz shows that even the good hombres are not safe.“Magana Ortiz is by all accounts a pillar of his community and a devoted father and husband,” he continued. “It is difficult to see how the government’s decision to expel him is consistent with the president’s promise of an immigration system with a lot of heart. I find no such compassion in the government’s choice to deport Magana Ortiz.”In his written opinion, Reinhardt conceded he had no legal authority to prevent Magaña Ortiz’s deportation. But the Trump administration does, and Hawaii lawmakers — quoting from the judge’s “pillar” language — addressed a letter to John Kelly, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, requesting that the government issue an “administrative stay” that would permit him to remain in the U.S. beyond Thursday.“The Department has the power to keep this family together, or to break them apart,” read the letter sent earlier this week by Hirono and Sen. Brian Schatz and Reps. Colleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard, all of them Democrats.The delegation is pulling out all the stops for Magaña Ortiz. On Tuesday, Gabbard introduced a rare private bill in Congress that would grant him, and only him, a path to citizenship. Only 94 such bills, all immigration-related, were passed by Congress between 1986 and 2013, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report.“If Andrés is forced to leave, the law would keep him from his family for 10 years,” Gabbard said in a House floor speech Wednesday, referring to the decade-long bar on re-entry Magaña Ortiz would face if he is deported and has to wait for relief outside of the country.As recounted by legislators in their letter and Reinhardt in his court opinion, all Magaña Ortiz needs is a little reprieve from the federal government, which is currently processing his wife’s petition so that he may be deemed her relative and be granted a green card. His daughter, Victoria, could likewise petition for him in a few months when she turns 21.Back in 2014, Magaña Ortiz caught a break when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted him his first stay of deportation. But his latest request for an extension went unheeded. In March, the government finally told him he wouldn’t receive it and ordered him to report for removal.There was nothing the courts could do under the law, leading Reinhardt to express alarm about Magaña Ortiz’s predicament.“The government forces us to participate in ripping apart a family,” the judge wrote last week, and noted that his deportation would leave his three children — the other two are ages 14 and 12 — without a father to support them.Their welfare and that of the farmowners who rely on his work weigh heavily on Magaña Ortiz. Harvest season is coming ― he’s expecting for his team to pick up to 700,000 pounds of coffee berries ― and he can’t imagine how everyone will manage without him around.“A lot of things are happening at the moment,” he said when asked if he had much time to focus on picking season as his deportation day approached. “But it’s all about doing the best you can because the work won’t wait.”UPDATE: This story has been updated with a statement from Sen.

Bars across the country opened early to hold viewing parties, and networks interrupted their popular soap operas to broadcast the hearing. The event had even been dubbed “Washington’s Super Bowl.”So it’s safe to say we’d all gone a little Comey Crazy.What the former FBI chief said is important. It’s the most concrete evidence we have that President Donald Trump attempted to quash an investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia. However, Comey would not definitively say that Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice nor would he say that Trump personally colluded with Kremlin officials. As HuffPost’s Sam Stein notes, Comey’s testimony alone will probably not spell the end of Trump.Meanwhile, Republicans are well on their way to repealing the Affordable Care Act, putting millions of people at risk of losing their health insurance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday took steps to fast-track their efforts, sidestepping the typical committee hearings in favor of closed-door meetings. And many Republicans are avoiding their own town hall meetings, where the subject is likely to come up. As progressive New York Times writer David Leonhardt notes, the Comey hearing has relieved some of the pressure Republicans faced in previous months against their health care plans. But it shouldn’t, he says.“Even amid the Comey testimony, and all of the attention it deserves, don’t let health care be forgotten,” Leonhardt wrote this week. “It’s too important.”And as several Trumpcare opponents have noted, it’s not too late to fight back:"

On Feb. 26, 1913, a letter written by Brewster, a British Suffragist, appeared in the U.K. newspaper The Daily Telegraph. The letter is a powerful representation of just how far these women were ready to go to obtain the right to vote. Brewster politely addressed the short letter to an unknown “Sir,” writing: “Everyone seems to agree upon the necessity of putting a stop to Suffragist outrages; but no one seems certain how to do so.”The suffragist continued that there are “two, and only two” ways to stop the violent protests of the movement: “1. Kill every woman in the United Kingdom,” or “2. Give women the vote.”Read the full note below that was posted to Twitter on Thursday morning by “Letters Of Note,” a book of historical letters. The British Suffragist Movement began in the late 1800s and fractured into two distinct sections by the early 1900s. One group lobbied and protested for the women’s vote peacefully, while the second group ― led by Emmeline Pankhurst ― became more militant. Brewster was a part of this second group, which used violent tactics such as throwing rocks through windows and blowing up buildings to push for the vote. Listen below to actress Carey Mulligan recite the note at an event for The Telegraph on March 9, 2017.

They praised Stoops for winning the National Championship in 2000, and talked about how strong the team is looking for next year. They overlooked Stoops’ finest moment: leading his team to take a big stand against racism in 2015.Back in 2015, a video surfaced that showed members of Oklahoma University’s chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) led a horribly racist chant on their bus, according to Alejandro Danois with Bleacher Report. It through the OU into the crisis, threatening to have the campus turn into so many others schools with racial strife, like the University of Missouri, Yale University, Emory University, etc.Stoops responded with his players in a protest against the racism, according to Greg Couch with Bleacher Report. He and more than 100 of his teammates gathered at the statue of former OU Coach Barry Switzer. Ty Darlington, one of his players, led the group in a prayer, according to Graham Watson with Yahoo Sports. They were also joined by OU Basketball Coach Lon Kruger.Others on campus joined in the protest. OU President David Boren also suspended the fraternity, had them move out, and began an investigation. It was the school’s finest hour under Bob Stoops.This isn’t to say that Stoops wasn’t so great at winning the National Championship, which they captured against Florida State University in 2000, prevailing against the Seminoles 13-2. At the time, I was graduating from FSU (Class of 2000) with my doctorate, and badly wanted my team to repeat as #1. But the Sooners won an impressive defensive battle against the defending National Champions. They earned their victory.This isn’t to say that Stoops didn’t have a career full of amazing highlights, according to Sam Cooper with Yahoo Sports. He took over a program that had several straight losing seasons, and was the two-time Walter Camp Coach of the Year (2000, 2003). More than 13 times in his years, his team won 10 or more games in his 18 years, amassing a record of 190-48 that is unsurpassed in school history. He also won 10 Big 12 Championships, while no one else in the Big 12 won more than 12.This isn’t to say that Stoops didn’t have some problems. Certainly there was the terrible incident involving Oklahoma Running Back Joe Mixon and the violence he was involved in. QB Blake Mayfield showed some lack of discipline in his charges for alcohol-related incidents, and other problems his players had, leading to speculation that this might have played a role in his retirement.Of course, there could be some incident like terrible one involving child abuse that plagued Penn State under Joe Paterno, or a scandal like the one that brought down Ohio State University’s Jim Tressel, or personal practices that upended Bobby Petrino at the University of Arkansas. If so, it was something we were unaware of at the time of Stoops’ record.But assuming there’s no dark secret, then Stoops really should be honored, not just for his impressive accomplishments as a coach. He needs to be lauded for leading his team in a stand against racism, which will hopefully inspire other coaches to do the same.John A.

Earth Day protest in Fairbanks, Alaska.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5939232d1d00001a00cc1cd0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Sutter is a science teacher at Wellston High School, student population less than 500. Wellston, Ohio is a town of a little more than 5,000 people in southeastern Ohio near the West Virginia border. The town is 98 percent white and mostly Protestant. Only 12.7 percent of adults in the town age 25 or older have at least a college degree compared to almost one of three adults in the United States as a whole. Most students are from families that live below the poverty line. Wellston, located in Jackson County, used to be coal country and it is now Trump country. Donald Trump got 73 percent of the presidential votes cast in Jackson County in 2016.According to a recent article in the New York Times, Mr. Sutter has been having difficulty with some of the students in his classes, and their parents, because, like the President of the United States, they reject the reality of climate science. The article cited a specific conflict between Sutter and one of his students. When he “ascribed the recent warming of the Earth to heat-trapping gases released by burning fossil fuels like the coal her father had once mined, she asserted that it could be a result of other, natural causes.”In addition, “When he described the flooding, droughts and fierce storms that scientists predict within the century if such carbon emissions are not sharply reduced, she challenged him to prove it.” This student was only the “most vocal of a raft of student climate skeptics.”During one interchange, the student insisted that teachers “are supposed to be open to opinions.” Sutter responded, “It’s not about opinions. It’s about the evidence.” She answered, “It’s like you can’t disagree with a scientist or you’re ‘denying science.”’ On another occasion, the student, who was academically very strong, grew so agitated that she stormed out of the room.The Times article attributed the battles in Mr. Sutter’s classroom to the “culture wars” being played out in the United States. In a 2016 Pew public opinion poll only 22 percent Trump supporters believed that human activity is warming the planet. The Heartland Institute, which receives major funding from the fossil fuel industry, has distributed tens of thousands of copies of their propaganda material challenging climate science to teachers in an effort to undermine support for reigning in pollution, cutting back on the use of fossil fuels, and reversing climate change before there is a global disaster.The kind of issues raised in Mr. Sutter’s classroom are not just limited to disputes about climate change or to science classes. Creationist forces have long fought against the teaching of human evolution as part of the biology curriculum. In social studies classes during the last election cycle, some students echoed one of the Presidential candidates, repeating unsubstantiated claims they heard or read in alt-media.As a teacher educator I offer the following advice to pre-service and beginning teachers who face determined student, parent, and even administrative challenges that interfere with their ability to teach the mandated curriculum. I think this advice would be useful for Mr. Sutter.1. You need to know your stuff, to do the research, to collect and evaluate the data, and to organize how it will be presented to students. It is okay to express uncertainty, but be clear about why you are uncertain and what more you feel you need to know.2. Science is never about 100% certainty, but there are things scientists are really, really sure about. Science is always about making decisions based on experimentation, evidence, and consistent explanations.3. Explain to students the purpose of what they are studying. Every class has an established curriculum. In this case, Mr. Sutter’s curriculum is understanding climate science, particularly evidence of the impact of human action on the environment. Information, analysis, and discussion must be consistent with established scientific principles and procedures and explanations must be based on evidence. The purpose of the curriculum in this case is to understand what scientists know about climate change and how they arrived at these conclusions.According to the State of Ohio Science Learning Standards: “Contemporary studies regarding global climate must be based on facts and evidence.” In high school, students are expected to be able to: Identify questions and concepts that guide scientific investigations; Design and conduct scientific investigations; Use technology and mathematics to improve investigations and communications; Formulate and revise explanations and models using logic and evidence (critical thinking); Recognize and analyze explanations and models; and Communicate and support a scientific argument.” The guidelines for Environmental Science include a section titled “Common Misconceptions.” It recognizes that “Students may have difficulty separating science from non-science factors as they relate to the different parts of the environment. It is important to distinguish “what is science” and therefore, what will be included in an environmental science class, especially as it relates to climate change and evolution. Identifying and understanding personal bias and ethical issues are an important step in recognizing science.” Additionally, “it is important to provide evidence of climate change throughout Earth’s history and current data to document temperature changes (surface and oceanic).”4. It is crucial to establish guidelines for discussion. An important goal is to develop a classroom community where students are able to listen to each other and the teacher and to explore the curriculum together. No student, or group of students, has the right to monopolize discussion, to silence others, or to prevent a class from proceeding. Mr. Sutter and every teacher should welcome student questions, but questioning should not become a technique for disruption.5. It is important for students who dissent from the curriculum or teacher presentations to feel they are respected and have a place in classroom discussion. In this case, I would offer the dissenting student or students the opportunity to conduct research and prepare a report explaining their critique of climate science. I would help the dissenters evaluate data and alternative explanations for climate change and if their reports were well-organized and consistent with the curriculum and established scientific practice, I would set aside time for the student or students to present in class and for the class to discuss their alternative perspective. This approach could have prevented must of the difficulties described in the Times article.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

Wellston, Ohio is a town of a little more than 5,000 people in southeastern Ohio near the West Virginia border. The town is 98 percent white and mostly Protestant. Only 12.7 percent of adults in the town age 25 or older have at least a college degree compared to almost one of three adults in the United States as a whole. Most students are from families that live below the poverty line. Wellston, located in Jackson County, used to be coal country and it is now Trump country. Donald Trump got 73 percent of the presidential votes cast in Jackson County in 2016.According to a recent article in the New York Times, Mr. Sutter has been having difficulty with some of the students in his classes, and their parents, because, like the President of the United States, they reject the reality of climate science. The article cited a specific conflict between Sutter and one of his students. When he “ascribed the recent warming of the Earth to heat-trapping gases released by burning fossil fuels like the coal her father had once mined, she asserted that it could be a result of other, natural causes.”In addition, “When he described the flooding, droughts and fierce storms that scientists predict within the century if such carbon emissions are not sharply reduced, she challenged him to prove it.” This student was only the “most vocal of a raft of student climate skeptics.”During one interchange, the student insisted that teachers “are supposed to be open to opinions.” Sutter responded, “It’s not about opinions. It’s about the evidence.” She answered, “It’s like you can’t disagree with a scientist or you’re ‘denying science.”’ On another occasion, the student, who was academically very strong, grew so agitated that she stormed out of the room.The Times article attributed the battles in Mr. Sutter’s classroom to the “culture wars” being played out in the United States. In a 2016 Pew public opinion poll only 22 percent Trump supporters believed that human activity is warming the planet. The Heartland Institute, which receives major funding from the fossil fuel industry, has distributed tens of thousands of copies of their propaganda material challenging climate science to teachers in an effort to undermine support for reigning in pollution, cutting back on the use of fossil fuels, and reversing climate change before there is a global disaster.The kind of issues raised in Mr. Sutter’s classroom are not just limited to disputes about climate change or to science classes. Creationist forces have long fought against the teaching of human evolution as part of the biology curriculum. In social studies classes during the last election cycle, some students echoed one of the Presidential candidates, repeating unsubstantiated claims they heard or read in alt-media.As a teacher educator I offer the following advice to pre-service and beginning teachers who face determined student, parent, and even administrative challenges that interfere with their ability to teach the mandated curriculum.

In fact, for most of the time, the war on terror has been a sideshow.The attempt to bring Qatar to heel by closing its borders and effectively laying siege to it has shed light on the real forces competing for dominance of the region in the post-Western world in which we live today.Three regional blocks are vying for control.The first is led by Iran - its state actors including Iraq and Syria, and non-state ones the Shia militias in Iraq, Hezbollah and the Houthis.The second is the ancien regimes of absolute Gulf monarchs: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, while also including Jordan and Egypt.The third block is led by Turkey, Qatar, the Muslim Brotherhood and the forces instrumental in the Arab Spring.In this three-way fight, America’s allies are just as destabilising to regional order as America’s foes, and the campaign launched against Qatar is a prime example of this.Saudi Arabia has made a strategic miscalculation by attempting to impose its will on little Qatar. Because in so doing, it has upset a regional order on which it relied to confront Iran’s dominance in countries all around the kingdom.Put another way, if the Iranian-backed civil war in Syria brought Saudi and Turkey together, the Qatari conflict has done the opposite. In fact, it could lead to the construction of a common cause among Iran, Turkey and forces of Sunni political Islam - as bizarre as this may seem.The two powers would not fall into each other’s arms naturally, but they could come together amid the reckless and shortsighted policies of Saudi Arabia. The Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif was in Ankara on Wednesday.Pentagon contradicts Trump’s tweetsThe two game changers for Saudi Arabia’s campaign against Qatar are the Turkish parliament’s decision to fast track legislation allowing Turkish troops to be deployed at a base in Qatar, and the statement by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps accusing Saudi Arabia of responsibility for the attack on the Iranian parliament and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini in which 12 died.This leaves Saudi Arabia isolated. It can bully smaller nations, but it cannot defend its own borders without substantial amounts of foreign military support.Whatever their commander-in-chief may tweet, the US military in the Gulf is trying very hard to avoid having to provide it. Which is possibly one reason why the White House and the Pentagon have been saying different things about Qatar this week.Shortly after Qatar’s land border with Saudi was closed at dawn on 5 June, the Pentagon lauded Qatar’s “enduring commitment to regional security”.It said pointedly about al Udeid airbase, which is the forward base of US Air Forces Central Command, that “all flights continue as planned”. About 10,000 US troops are based there.Then came Trump’s tweets, which essentially claimed ownership of the extraordinary moves against Qatar by saying they were the fruits of the address he made in Riyadh before 50 Arab and Muslim leaders. And then came a second Pentagon statement, renewing praise of Qatar for hosting US forces.The Pentagon was joined by Europe, or least the foreign minister of its most important state, Germany. Sigmar Gabriel said: “Apparently, Qatar is to be isolated more or less completely and hit existentially. Such a Trumpization of treatment is particularly dangerous in a region already plagued by crisis.”Soon after the Turkish decision, Trump was on the phone to the Emir of Qatar offering mediation; 24 hours after his tweet, it seemed the message from his military had gotten through to him.MiscalculationsSaudi Arabia and the Emirates have now bitten off more than they can chew.Their first miscalculation was to buy the Trump narrative. When you purchase a Trump product, you buy a lot more with it. There are side effects, not least the sheer amount of resentment, hostility and resistance Trump himself has created at home.This is not inconsiderable when you review who resents Trump - the CIA, Pentagon, State Department, senators of all colours, and the judges. This is not just America’s deep state, but if it were only them, they are enough to be going on with.The much-in-the-news Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, made the classic mistake of thinking that because he had former defence secretary Robert Gates eating out of his hand, the rest of the defence department would do the same. It plainly did not.Russia’s US ambassador Sergey Kislyak, now dubbed Washington’s most dangerous diplomat, fell to earth over a similar act of hubris. All of these ambassadors confuse their success as lobbyists with foreign policy-making. The two are different.Their second miscalculation was to assume that because Qatar was small, no bigger nation would come to its defence. Both Saudi and the UAE have significant investments in Turkey, one of which Abu Dhabi made after it had tried to unseat Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a coup. Both thought Turkey would be bought off.The opposite happened. Erdogan realised that if Qatar were crushed, he would be the only man of that camp standing.Their third miscalculation was to reveal their real beef with Qatar. It has nothing to do with funding terrorism or cosying up to Iran. In fact the Emiratis do a roaring trade with Iran, and they are part of the coalition accusing Qatar of siding with Tehran.Their real demands, which were conveyed to the Emir of Kuwait - who is acting as an intermediary - are the closure of Al Jazeera, de-funding of Al Arabi al Jadid, Al Quds al Arabi, and the Arabic edition of Huffington Post, along with the expulsion of Palestinian public intellectual Azmi Bishara.This is the media that reveals - in Arabic - the stories that these Arab dictators most want their citizens not to read.

That is about the last thing Egypt, Jordan, the UAE or Saudi Arabia want. The kingdoms are so keen to normalise relations with Israel that a Saudi commentator was recently interviewed for the first time on Israel’s Channel 2.The Egyptian-Palestinian poet Tamim al Barghouti provided a fitting commentary to this. He wrote on the Facebook page:“On the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem, an Egyptian-Saudi-UAE-Bahraini-Israeli alliance forms and lays ground and aerial siege around an Arab country for no reason other than supporting the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance and the Arab revolutions over the past two decades, in particular the Egyptian revolution that brought down Israel’s ally and threatened the military authority of Camp David in Cairo.

They are punishing it for the fall of Mubarak in 2011.“A bankrupt and terrified military officer who suffers from Macbeth syndrome and who is washing his hands of old blood with a new one and an adolescent who is in a rush to become king and who is ambitious to surpass his cousin to the throne at whatever cost chose the fifth of June specifically in order to announce that their countries had just joined the Israeli strategic depth.”The final miscalculation? Qatar is not Gaza. It’s got friends with big armies - a country with a population smaller than Houston has got a sovereign wealth fund worth $335bn.

The West must view Iran as a partner in the fight, not an enemy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59384afb1d00004600cc1b43.jpeg?cache=TCsfpIsXUJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Iran’s parliament and the shrine of its revolutionary father were the targets Wednesday of what appears to be the Islamic State militant group’s first major attack on Iranian soil. In an operation that seemed to require a level of coordination not often typical of ISIS attacks in the West, gunmen and suicide bombers penetrated deep inside Iranian territory and attacked two symbols of Iranian political identity, killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens.The twin assault, the worst terrorist attack Tehran has seen in more than a decade, also came at a time of heightened regional tension, with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir calling for Iran to be punished for what it deemed interference in regional affairs and various politicians weighing in on an escalating Qatar crisis. The shocking strike, coupled with the chaos, could mean an exacerbation of several bad situations if tensions aren’t quelled.While the overwhelming majority of the international community condemned the deadly incident, U.S. President Donald Trump not only failed to issue a direct condemnation, but also suggested, in a statement released hours later, that Iran deserved it. “We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,” the two sentence press release began. It concluded: “We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil that they promote.” Trump’s insensitive remarks evoke both dangerous ignorance and glaring hypocrisy on his part. During his presidential campaign, Trump directed his ire towards Saudi Arabia. He declared that he was “not a big fan” of the Saudis. And as a citizen, he proclaimed they were the “world’s biggest funder of terrorism.” After the election, however, he sharply changed his tune, praising the U.S.-Saudi “strategic partnership” and making Iran the focus of his anti-terrorism rhetoric.  This move was underscored at a recent summit in Riyadh, where Trump shifted U.S. regional policy towards total alignment with Saudi Arabia, decisively breaking away from the previous U.S. administration’s policy of diplomatic engagement with Iran and attempts to ameliorate Saudi-Iranian tensions. Trump’s change of heart on Saudi Arabia occurred amid a massive Saudi-linked lobbying campaign in Washington ― which in part reportedly relied on hiring former Trump advisers and spending around $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel ― as well as a $110 billion arms deal.Interestingly, while the target of Trump’s furor in Riyadh was Iran, as the Qatar crisis developed, Trump once again brazenly contradicted what he had said just weeks earlier. Even though Trump made no mention of Qatar in his Riyadh speech and even met with the Qatari emir while in Saudi, he tweeted the following about terrorism after Saudi Arabia and its allies cut ties with Qatar this week:The world simply cannot afford for Trump to continuously play with the word “terrorism” and regularly shift America’s policies based on his personal whims and interests. The United States needs to take serious action in fighting terrorism. Further, Trump’s relentless quest to implement his Muslim ban, which includes Iran and other Muslim-majority countries, and his attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan following violent acts in the United Kingdom, only serve to alienate Muslims and in turn fuel the fear terrorists thrive on.The reality is that the Tehran attacks highlight the common threat faced by nations across the world from groups such as ISIS. Whether in San Bernardino, London, Paris, Baghdad, Kabul or the heart of Iran, innocent people everywhere are in the same boat in the face of this barbarity. Iran, seemingly unbeknownst to Trump, has since its 1979 revolution been a chief victim of both terrorism and state violence. In the decade after the revolution, it was wracked by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Iran and attacks by groups such as the notorious Mujahideen-e Khalq, or MEK, which has been responsible for the killing of thousands of Iranian civilians, as well as senior officials and public figures, and was once labeled a terror group by America.This week, Tehran has become the unlikely victim of ISIS terror. But for the last few years, it has been leading from the ground the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. The same cannot be said of Saudi Arabia.After his recent re-election, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani noted how Saudi Arabia provided Saddam Hussein with some $97 billion during the Iran-Iraq War. Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former head of Saudi intelligence, has admitted to meeting a few times with Sept. 11 attack mastermind Osama bin Laden in the 1980s and delivered the keynote address at an MEK gathering during which he praised the group and emphatically supported its objective of toppling the Iranian government. Prominent U.S. analysts have also commented on the Saudi government connection to Wahhabi terrorist groups such as ISIS, as have numerous U.S. officials and media figures. “Almost every terrorist attack in the West has had some connection to Saudi Arabia. Virtually none has been linked to Iran,” Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” wrote in a recent Washington Post column. Even though the attacks in Tehran came after a contentious Iranian presidential campaign, they will serve to unify the Iranian people and make them more resilient in the face of terror. In fact, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have already stated they “will never allow the blood of innocents to be spilt without revenge” and asserted the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were “involved” in the attack.But Iran and Saudi Arabia must be careful not to fall into the trap of all-out confrontation. Iran has long been ready for dialogue with Saudi Arabia, with both President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif making numerous overtures since 2013. It would be best if that route were taken before sectarian conflict rises to a new level, proxy wars in Yemen and Syria get worse and ISIS decides to strike again to make up for its blows in Syria and Iraq. But Iran needs support.Terrorism knows no borders. Collective cooperation is necessary to eradicate it, and this must begin with the West viewing Iran as a partner in the fight, not an enemy. The West must seriously confront the material and ideological sources that enable terrorist groups like ISIS to emerge. This will require the Trump administration to refrain from encouraging Saudi Arabia’s zero-sum mentality towards Iran and giving Saudi leaders carte blanche to further stoke instability in the region. Instead, the president must have tough conversations with Saudi officials and other allies about Riyadh’s role in the facilitation of terrorism.Donald Trump now has the option to help de-escalate tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran before they spiral out of control.

In an operation that seemed to require a level of coordination not often typical of ISIS attacks in the West, gunmen and suicide bombers penetrated deep inside Iranian territory and attacked two symbols of Iranian political identity, killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens.The twin assault, the worst terrorist attack Tehran has seen in more than a decade, also came at a time of heightened regional tension, with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir calling for Iran to be punished for what it deemed interference in regional affairs and various politicians weighing in on an escalating Qatar crisis. The shocking strike, coupled with the chaos, could mean an exacerbation of several bad situations if tensions aren’t quelled.While the overwhelming majority of the international community condemned the deadly incident, U.S. President Donald Trump not only failed to issue a direct condemnation, but also suggested, in a statement released hours later, that Iran deserved it. “We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,” the two sentence press release began. It concluded: “We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil that they promote.” Trump’s insensitive remarks evoke both dangerous ignorance and glaring hypocrisy on his part. During his presidential campaign, Trump directed his ire towards Saudi Arabia. He declared that he was “not a big fan” of the Saudis. And as a citizen, he proclaimed they were the “world’s biggest funder of terrorism.” After the election, however, he sharply changed his tune, praising the U.S.-Saudi “strategic partnership” and making Iran the focus of his anti-terrorism rhetoric.  This move was underscored at a recent summit in Riyadh, where Trump shifted U.S. regional policy towards total alignment with Saudi Arabia, decisively breaking away from the previous U.S. administration’s policy of diplomatic engagement with Iran and attempts to ameliorate Saudi-Iranian tensions. Trump’s change of heart on Saudi Arabia occurred amid a massive Saudi-linked lobbying campaign in Washington ― which in part reportedly relied on hiring former Trump advisers and spending around $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel ― as well as a $110 billion arms deal.Interestingly, while the target of Trump’s furor in Riyadh was Iran, as the Qatar crisis developed, Trump once again brazenly contradicted what he had said just weeks earlier. Even though Trump made no mention of Qatar in his Riyadh speech and even met with the Qatari emir while in Saudi, he tweeted the following about terrorism after Saudi Arabia and its allies cut ties with Qatar this week:The world simply cannot afford for Trump to continuously play with the word “terrorism” and regularly shift America’s policies based on his personal whims and interests. The United States needs to take serious action in fighting terrorism. Further, Trump’s relentless quest to implement his Muslim ban, which includes Iran and other Muslim-majority countries, and his attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan following violent acts in the United Kingdom, only serve to alienate Muslims and in turn fuel the fear terrorists thrive on.The reality is that the Tehran attacks highlight the common threat faced by nations across the world from groups such as ISIS. Whether in San Bernardino, London, Paris, Baghdad, Kabul or the heart of Iran, innocent people everywhere are in the same boat in the face of this barbarity. Iran, seemingly unbeknownst to Trump, has since its 1979 revolution been a chief victim of both terrorism and state violence. In the decade after the revolution, it was wracked by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Iran and attacks by groups such as the notorious Mujahideen-e Khalq, or MEK, which has been responsible for the killing of thousands of Iranian civilians, as well as senior officials and public figures, and was once labeled a terror group by America.This week, Tehran has become the unlikely victim of ISIS terror. But for the last few years, it has been leading from the ground the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. The same cannot be said of Saudi Arabia.After his recent re-election, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani noted how Saudi Arabia provided Saddam Hussein with some $97 billion during the Iran-Iraq War. Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former head of Saudi intelligence, has admitted to meeting a few times with Sept. 11 attack mastermind Osama bin Laden in the 1980s and delivered the keynote address at an MEK gathering during which he praised the group and emphatically supported its objective of toppling the Iranian government. Prominent U.S. analysts have also commented on the Saudi government connection to Wahhabi terrorist groups such as ISIS, as have numerous U.S. officials and media figures. “Almost every terrorist attack in the West has had some connection to Saudi Arabia. Virtually none has been linked to Iran,” Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” wrote in a recent Washington Post column. Even though the attacks in Tehran came after a contentious Iranian presidential campaign, they will serve to unify the Iranian people and make them more resilient in the face of terror. In fact, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have already stated they “will never allow the blood of innocents to be spilt without revenge” and asserted the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were “involved” in the attack.But Iran and Saudi Arabia must be careful not to fall into the trap of all-out confrontation. Iran has long been ready for dialogue with Saudi Arabia, with both President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif making numerous overtures since 2013. It would be best if that route were taken before sectarian conflict rises to a new level, proxy wars in Yemen and Syria get worse and ISIS decides to strike again to make up for its blows in Syria and Iraq. But Iran needs support.Terrorism knows no borders. Collective cooperation is necessary to eradicate it, and this must begin with the West viewing Iran as a partner in the fight, not an enemy. The West must seriously confront the material and ideological sources that enable terrorist groups like ISIS to emerge. This will require the Trump administration to refrain from encouraging Saudi Arabia’s zero-sum mentality towards Iran and giving Saudi leaders carte blanche to further stoke instability in the region. Instead, the president must have tough conversations with Saudi officials and other allies about Riyadh’s role in the facilitation of terrorism.Donald Trump now has the option to help de-escalate tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran before they spiral out of control. But to accomplish this, he will need to balance America’s relations with regional powers, namely by establishing channels of dialogue with Iran, and incentivize them to move towards cooperation. And he’ll need to pressure Saudi Arabia to diplomatically engage Iran.The ball is in his court."

Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comDonald, listen, whatever you’ve done so far, whatever you’ve messed up, there’s one thing you could do that would make up for a lot. It would be huge! Terrific! It could change our world for the better in a big-league way! It could save us all from economic disaster! And it isn’t even hard to grasp or complicated to do. It’s simple, in fact: reinstitute the Glass-Steagall Act. Let me explain.In the world of romance, if you break up with someone, it’s pretty simple (emotional complications aside). You’re just not together anymore. In the world of financial regulation, it used to be as simple as that, too. It was like installing a traffic light at a dangerous intersection to avoid deaths. In 1933, when the Glass-Steagall Act was passed, it helped break up the biggest banks of the day and for good reason: they had had a major hand in triggering the most disastrous economic depression our country ever experienced.Certain divisions of those banks were no longer allowed to coexist with others. The law split the parts of banks that placed bets by creating and trading certain risky securities and those that took deposits and provided loans. In other words, it ensured that the investment bank and the commercial bank would no longer cohabit. Put another way, it separated bankers with a heinous gambling habit from those who only wanted a secure nest egg. It was simplicity itself.After 1933, the gamblers and savers went their separate ways, which proved a boon for the economy and the financial system for nearly seven decades. Then legislators, lobbyists, bankers, and regulators started to chisel away at the wall separating those two kinds of banks. By November 1999, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed the Glass-Steagall Act totally. The abusive marriages of gamblers and savers could once again be consummated.And who doesn’t remember the result: the financial crisis of 2007-2008 that led to taxpayer-funded bailouts, subsidies, loans, and sweetheart fraud-settlement deals. Just as the Crash of 1929 had been catalyzed by the manufacturing of shady “trusts” stuffed with shady securities, this crisis was enabled by the big banks that engineered complex assets stuffed with subprime mortgages and other loans that were sold around the world. Under President Obama, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Act sought to limit the ability of big banks to trade the riskiest types of securities. Through inclusion of something called the “Volcker Rule,” Dodd-Frank prohibited the trading of securities (even if with many loopholes). What it didn’t do was actually break up the big banks again. That meant another 1933 still awaited its moment. Then along came the bizarre 2016 presidential election campaign during which, strangely enough, Democrats and Republicans found one issue on which they had some common ground: the banking system. Key figures in both parties agreed that it was time to stop the investment bank and the commercial bank from commingling. Bernie Sanders ran on a campaign to break up the banks ― and so did Donald Trump. At at an October campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump even stated, “It’s time for a twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall.”The Democratic National Committee platform offered a similar message. “Banks,” it said, “should not be able to gamble with taxpayers’ deposits or pose an undue risk to Main Street. Democrats support a variety of ways to stop this from happening, including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall as well as breaking up too-big-to-fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy.”The Republican National Committee wasted even fewer words making the point in their platform: “We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment.” And it didn’t even suggest that the act should be “modernized” or mention a “twenty-first-century” version that didn’t do what the twentieth-century one had done.For the first time since its repeal, in other words, a return to the Glass-Steagall Act had bipartisan support. It couldn’t have been simpler, right? Two parties, one idea: split banks into two pieces. But then, as if you hadn’t already guessed, it got complicated. Breaking-up, Republican-StyleIn the new administration, two key figures are now offering quite different and conflicting views of what a resurrection of the Glass-Steagall Act might mean. At his Senate confirmation hearings, Steven Mnuchin, former Goldman Sachs partner and Trump’s nominee to be secretary of the Treasury, faced Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) as she bluntly asked “Do you support returning to Glass-Steagall?”He replied, “I don’t support going back to Glass-Steagall as is. What we’ve talked about with the president-elect is perhaps we need a twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall. But, no, I don’t support... taking a very old law and say we should adhere to it as is.”Cantwell then pressed him further: “And so, is that the position of what the Republican platform was? Because I thought it was Glass-Steagall?”To this, Mnuchin responded, “Again, the Republican platform did pass at the convention Glass-Steagall and... [when] we talked about policy with the president-elect, our view is we need a twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall.”The skepticism in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. Here, after all, was a man who had made windfall profits on the fallout from the 2007-2008 “too big to fail” financial crisis by organizing a cadre of hedge-fund billionaires to buy the collapsed IndyMac Bank at a discount. He then proceeded to foreclose on some of its mortgages and resell it for a $2.5 billion profit. Why should such a man want to restrict banking activity, Glass-Steagall-style, when his loan practices had allowed him to make a fortune off the taxpayer bailouts that were the result of not doing so? What would the point be when a crisis, as history had just shown, forced the federal government to subsidize risk and failure?The only problem he faced: the Republican platform said he should. Last month, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee and under questioning from Senator Elizabeth Warren, he backtracked even further: “The president said we do support a ‘twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall,’ that means there are aspects of it that we think may make sense. But we never said before we support a full separation of banks and investment banking.”Warren responded incredulously, “Tell me what twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall means if it doesn’t mean breaking up those two parts. It’s an easy question.”Mnuchin replied, “It’s actually a complicated question... We never said we were in favor of Glass-Steagall. We said we were in favor of a twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall. It couldn’t be clearer.” Which, of course, couldn’t have been murkier.And then there’s that other former Goldman Sachs man, Gary Cohn, Trump’s director of the National Economic Council. He had quite a different Glass-Steagall tale to tell Senator Warren. According to Bloomberg News, he insisted that he “generally favors banking going back to how it was when firms like Goldman focused on trading and underwriting securities, and companies such as Citigroup Inc. primarily issued loans.” That sounds a lot like breaking up the banks.This division and the as-yet unresolved nature of the Trump administration response to the Glass-Steagall question could, in the face of another financial crisis, come back to haunt us all, if it translates into more bailouts and systemic failures.The Democrats’ DilemmaAs with the proverbial difficulty of chewing gum and walking at the same time, certain Democrats seem to find the very idea of supporting both Dodd-Frank and a new Glass-Steagall Act perplexing. Many of them have promoted the idea that no big bank actually failed in the Great Recession moment (which was true only because those banks got huge infusions of federal aid to remain solvent). As a result, they avoided all responsibility for the way the repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed too-big-to-fail banks to come into existence in the first place. In the process, they also conveniently ignored the way the big banks lent money to, or funded, the investment banks that did fail like both of my former employers, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Without those loans or that funding, those outfits couldn’t have purchased the overload of toxic assets that, in the end, imploded the whole system.President Obama summed up this position when he told Rolling Stone in 2012, “I’ve looked at some of Rolling Stone’s articles that say, ‘This didn’t go far enough, we didn’t institute Glass-Steagall’ and so forth, and I pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. But there is not evidence that having Glass-Steagall in place would somehow change the dynamic. Lehman Brothers wasn’t a commercial bank; it was an investment bank. AIG wasn’t an FDIC-insured bank; it was an insurance institution. So the problem in today’s financial sector can’t be solved simply by reimposing models that were created in the 1930s.” He needed a more astute team.Hillary Clinton took a similar tack in her campaign and it may have contributed to her devastating election loss. The continued promotion of such fallacies does not bode well for the future of the party if it continues to adopt that view. A return to a safer system, on the other hand, would be more populist ― and far more popular.Glass-Steagall’s Bipartisan PastFortunately, current legislation is circulating in Congress that would promote the long-term stability of the financial system by restoring Glass-Steagall for real. H.R. 790 (“Return to the Prudent Banking Act of 2017”) is one of two reinstatement bills in the House of Representatives. It has 50 co-sponsors from both parties and its passage is being spearheaded by Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Walter Jones (R-N.C.). The second bill, H.R. 2585, sponsored by Mike Capuano (D-Mass.), bears a close relationship to Senate bill S.881 (the “Twenty-First-Century Glass-Steagall Act of 2017”), sponsored by Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and nine cosponsors including John McCain (R-Ariz.), Maria Cantwell, and Angus King (I-Maine). Either of the bills, if enacted, would do the same thing: break up the banks.In order to understand just why passage is so crucial, a little history is in order. Glass-Steagall, or the Banking Act of 1933, was signed into law by President Franklin Roosevelt. It represented a bipartisan effort and was even ― perhaps not surprisingly given the devastating nature of the collapse of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed ― actively promoted by some of Wall Street’s most powerful bankers. In its 66 years as law, it effectively prevented systemic banking and economic collapse.Even before Roosevelt began his first term, congressional Republicans had initiated an investigation into bankers’ practices. In early 1933, as Roosevelt was preparing to take office with an incoming Democratic Senate, outgoing Senate Banking and Currency Committee chairman Peter Norbeck, a Republican from South Dakota, hired former New York Deputy District Attorney Ferdinand Pecora to lead the Senate Banking Committee in a new investigation.Later known as the Pecora hearings, they would shed light on the kinds of financial manipulations by unscrupulous bankers that had led to the crash of 1929. They would also provide the new president with the necessary populist political capital to enact America’s most sweeping financial reforms. No less crucial was the way banking leaders aligned themselves with Roosevelt’s new program. Duty to country over balance sheets seemed then to be the order of the day, even on Wall Street. (It’s not an attitude that lasted into the twenty-first century.)Two days after his inauguration, for instance, Roosevelt invited incoming National City Bank Chairman James Perkins to the White House for a secret meeting. The next day, under Perkins’ direction, his bank board passed a resolution splitting apart its trading and deposit-taking divisions. Chase National Bank chairman Winthrop Aldrich, a major financial power player, lent a hand as well. Both Perkins and he would back the new Glass-Steagall bill. (Lest you think that all was sweetness and light, they were also convinced that it would diminish the strength of their main competitor, the Morgan Bank.)Three days after Roosevelt called Perkins to the White House, Aldrich’s views on breaking up the banks hit the front page of the New York Times when he announced that Chase National Bank and Chase Securities Corporation would become separate entities, effectively enforcing the bill before it even became law. It wasn’t simple ― the Chase Securities Corporation was the biggest of its kind in the world ― but it happened.Aldrich then took part in a series of private meetings with the president at the White House about the pending legislation. Without the support of Aldrich and Perkins, it’s possible that the bill wouldn’t have passed. After all, a far weaker version proposed during the previous administration of Herbert Hoover hadn’t.The Glass-Steagall Act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure citizens’ bank deposits. This left commercial banks with a choice to make. If they took deposits and made loans, they could not speculate with depositors’ money. If they wanted to create and speculate, they were on their own. There’s much to be said for protecting hard-working Americans in this fashion.How the Walls Came Tumbling DownIn the 1980s, the walls between investment and commercial banking first began to crumble. The deregulation of the financial sector that followed would prove to be as bipartisan as the passage of Glass-Steagall had been. In 1982, as the Republican presidency of Ronald Reagan began, Congress passed the Garn-St. Germain Act, deregulating the kinds of investments that savings and loan banks could make to include riskier real estate loans. This had the effect of exacerbating the savings and loan debacle, which hit its pinnacle in the late 1980s. By 1989, more than 1,000 S&L banks in the U.S. would crash and burn. In total, the crisis wound up costing about $160 billion, $132 billion of which was footed by taxpayers. And the suppliers of risky S&L securities tended to be the big banks.In 1987, still in the age of Reagan, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a past board member of JPMorgan, said that non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies could sell or hold “bank-ineligible securities” ― that is, securities prohibited by Glass-Steagall, including mortgage securities, asset-backed securities, junk bonds, and other derivative products. The move exacerbated the S&L crisis, but it also offered an avenue for commercial banks to stock up on some of the securities at the heart of that crisis.And so commercial banks began investing in hedge funds, whose very purpose in life is to gamble on securities, stocks, and commodities. In 1998, in an early warning of what the future might hold, one of them, Long Term Capital Management, crashed and nearly brought down the whole financial system with it. Fifty-five commercial banks had invested in it using depositors’ money to back their bets. Only an emergency meeting of the presidents of the major banks at the Federal Reserve averted a larger economic meltdown, but because Glass-Steagall was still in place, they had to figure out how to save themselves. No government bailouts were forthcoming.Having narrowly avoided disaster, Wall Street only plunged deeper into financial deregulation. In 1999, Glass-Steagall itself was repealed. On December 21, 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act deregulating derivatives trading. The big commercial banks then merged with investment banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms. By 2007, the assets of those big banks had tripled. The four largest ― Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo ― by then controlled (and still control) more than half the assets of the banking system.In the fall of 2007, that system finally started buckling because of the problems of Citigroup, not because of the investment banks, which would not have been covered by Glass-Steagall. The catastrophe that hit Citigroup makes it clear just how crucial the repeal of that act was to the financial meltdown to come. Citigroup would “require” a taxpayer-financed bailout of $45 billion, $340 billion in asset guarantees, and $2 trillion in near-0% Federal Reserve loans between the fall of 2007 and 2010. That in itself was staggering and Citigroup wasn’t alone. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would later testify that, by 2008, 11 out of the 12 biggest commercial banks were “insolvent” and had to be bailed out. The entire banking system was rotten to the core and the massive buildup of bad paper, high leverage, and speculative bets (derivatives) that made disaster inevitable can be traced directly back to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. Today, a fresh bubble is inflating. This time, it’s not U.S. subprime mortgages at the heart of a budding banking crisis, but $51 trillion in corporate debt in the form of bonds, loans, and related derivatives. The credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings has predicted that such debt could rise to $75 trillion by 2020 and the defaults on it are starting to increase in pace. Banks have profited by the short-term creation and trading of this corporate debt, propagating even greater risk. Should that bubble burst, it could make the subprime mortgage bubble of 2007 look like a relatively small-scale event.  What Will the President Do?On the positive side, there’s a growing bipartisan alliance in Congress and outside it on restoring Glass-Steagall. This increasingly wide-ranging consensus reaches from the AFL-CIO to the libertarian Mises Institute, in the Senate from John McCain to Elizabeth Warren and Maria Cantwell, and in the House of Representatives from Republicans Walter Jones and Mike Coffman to Democrats Marcy Kaptur, Bernie Sanders, and Tulsi Gabbard. In fact, just this week, Kaptur and Jones announced an amendment to the pending Financial Choice Act in the House of Representives, that would represent the first genuine attempt to bring to a vote the possibility of resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act since its repeal.So, Donald, here’s the question: Where do you ― the man who, in the course of a few weeks, embraced Middle Eastern autocrats, turned relations with key NATO allies upside down, and to the astonishment of much of the world, withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement ― stand? In just a few months in office, you’ve turned the White House into an outpost for your family business, but when it comes to the financial well-being of the rest of us, what will you do? Will you, in fact, protect us from another future meltdown of the financial system? It wouldn’t be that hard and you were clear enough on this issue in your election campaign, but does that even matter to you today? I noticed that recently, in an Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News, when asked about breaking up the banks, you said, “I’m looking at that right now. There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.”Your party and your own appointees are split on the subject. Where will you fall? You could still commit yourself to securing the financial well-being of our nation for generations to come. You could commit yourself to Glass-Steagall. The question is: Will you?

64,WORLD NEWS,What To Know When ISIS Claims Responsibility For An Attack,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isis-responsibility-claims-amaq_us_5936b731e4b013c4816b118c,There's a familiar pattern in how the militant group takes credit for its terror.,2017-06-07,"People inside Iran's Parliament on June 7, 2017, during a terror attack that was later claimed by ISIS. Coupled with another attack on the Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini, at least 12 people died.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593840382200002d00c6ccd4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After deadly terror incidents this week in London and Melbourne, a familiar pattern of events began to unfold online. First, there was a flurry of activity from pro-Islamic State militant groups’ accounts on encrypted messaging apps like Telegram. Then, hours later, the Islamic State claimed credit for the violence in a message via its news agency.Something similar happened after last month’s suicide bombing in Manchester, England, the killings at Westminster Bridge before that ― and in many of the other attacks ISIS has professed to be behind.Amid twin attacks in Iran’s capital of Tehran on Wednesday, ISIS made a more immediate claim, though the pattern was the same. The group released a statement through its Amaq media arm, and shortly afterward, it was widely broadcast that the group had taken responsibility. But the way the Islamic State group frames and words its messages in the wake of terror obscures a more nuanced reality. Although ISIS does not indiscriminately claim it’s behind different attacks, there can be a vast difference in how involved the group’s leaders are in orchestrating them. “ISIL has a much broader sense of taking responsibility for something, and they would certainly include inspiration to perpetrators not formally affiliated with the group,” said Erin Miller, program manager of the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland, using an alternative abbreviation for ISIS.Monitors and analysts will often parse the language of the statements Amaq disseminates, focusing on the way it describes an incident. One way Amaq frequently refers to attackers is as “soldiers of the caliphate,” which may indicate that the perpetrator was inspired by ISIS’s ideology but not in direct coordination with the group.There are numerous types of claims, each with its own intricacies, Rita Katz, the director of terrorism monitor SITE Intelligence Group, explained to HuffPost. Katz’s organization relentlessly tracks ISIS’s messaging and is often the first source news outlets cite when confirming that the terror group indeed claimed to be responsible.Along with Amaq, the news agency ISIS uses as a kind of intermediary propaganda arm, the group sometimes also issues direct claims from the Nashir Media Foundation, which it regards as its official channel.The claims are often further publicized via channels on Telegram ― a Russian-made, WhatsApp-like messenger that has become one of ISIS’s preferred means of communication in recent years. As Facebook, Twitter and Google have all made efforts to prevent extremist content from spreading on their platforms, terror groups have increasingly used encrypted communication services and the dark web to disseminate their information. When ISIS appears to have directly planned and coordinated an attack, there is less of a lag between the event and an Amaq or Nashir statement on Telegram. There may also be more information provided about the attack or images and video of the attackers. During Wednesday’s attacks in Tehran, ISIS took credit for the killings while the violence was still ongoing. The group posted a video on Telegram from inside Parliament, where the assault was taking place.But ISIS’s propaganda is often intentionally vague about which attacks the group directs and which are carried out by people inspired by its ideology.

65,WORLD NEWS,What To Know When ISIS Claims Responsibility For An Attack,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isis-responsibility-claims-amaq_us_5936b731e4b013c4816b118c,There's a familiar pattern in how the militant group takes credit for its terror.,2017-06-07,"A boy is evacuated during a terror attack on the Iran's Parliament in central Tehran on June 7, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59383fcd19000047003e5040.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After deadly terror incidents this week in London and Melbourne, a familiar pattern of events began to unfold online. First, there was a flurry of activity from pro-Islamic State militant groups’ accounts on encrypted messaging apps like Telegram. Then, hours later, the Islamic State claimed credit for the violence in a message via its news agency.Something similar happened after last month’s suicide bombing in Manchester, England, the killings at Westminster Bridge before that ― and in many of the other attacks ISIS has professed to be behind.Amid twin attacks in Iran’s capital of Tehran on Wednesday, ISIS made a more immediate claim, though the pattern was the same. The group released a statement through its Amaq media arm, and shortly afterward, it was widely broadcast that the group had taken responsibility. But the way the Islamic State group frames and words its messages in the wake of terror obscures a more nuanced reality. Although ISIS does not indiscriminately claim it’s behind different attacks, there can be a vast difference in how involved the group’s leaders are in orchestrating them. “ISIL has a much broader sense of taking responsibility for something, and they would certainly include inspiration to perpetrators not formally affiliated with the group,” said Erin Miller, program manager of the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland, using an alternative abbreviation for ISIS.Monitors and analysts will often parse the language of the statements Amaq disseminates, focusing on the way it describes an incident. One way Amaq frequently refers to attackers is as “soldiers of the caliphate,” which may indicate that the perpetrator was inspired by ISIS’s ideology but not in direct coordination with the group.There are numerous types of claims, each with its own intricacies, Rita Katz, the director of terrorism monitor SITE Intelligence Group, explained to HuffPost. Katz’s organization relentlessly tracks ISIS’s messaging and is often the first source news outlets cite when confirming that the terror group indeed claimed to be responsible.Along with Amaq, the news agency ISIS uses as a kind of intermediary propaganda arm, the group sometimes also issues direct claims from the Nashir Media Foundation, which it regards as its official channel.The claims are often further publicized via channels on Telegram ― a Russian-made, WhatsApp-like messenger that has become one of ISIS’s preferred means of communication in recent years. As Facebook, Twitter and Google have all made efforts to prevent extremist content from spreading on their platforms, terror groups have increasingly used encrypted communication services and the dark web to disseminate their information. When ISIS appears to have directly planned and coordinated an attack, there is less of a lag between the event and an Amaq or Nashir statement on Telegram. There may also be more information provided about the attack or images and video of the attackers. During Wednesday’s attacks in Tehran, ISIS took credit for the killings while the violence was still ongoing. The group posted a video on Telegram from inside Parliament, where the assault was taking place.But ISIS’s propaganda is often intentionally vague about which attacks the group directs and which are carried out by people inspired by its ideology. Miller, of the Global Terrorism Database, believes this contributes to a social media and news frenzy that can give an incomplete picture of the role ISIS actually played in an incident. Once ISIS claims responsibility for an attack, that can become shorthand for why an incident occurred. But that can eclipse any deeper, more layered understanding of how an individual attack happened and how to prevent the next one.“A lot of people have expressed some concern with the idea that type of media cycle surrounding an attack ― that kind of rampant speculation, then their claim and the discussion ― sort of feeds into their goals.

Proxies attack what their masters despise most: the seat of democracy.”He did not explicitly blame any country but the tweet appeared to refer to comments made by Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud, in May, saying that that Riyadh would bring “the battle” for regional influence to Iran.Sunni Saudi Arabia denied any involvement in the Tehran attacks, but the assault further fuels tensions between Riyadh and Tehran as they vie for control of the Gulf and influence in the wider Islamic world. It comes days after Riyadh and other Sunni Muslim powers cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing Tehran and militant groups.They were the first attacks claimed by Islamic State inside the tightly controlled Shi’ite Muslim country, one of the powers leading the fight against IS forces in nearby Iraq and Syria.The deputy head of Iran’s National Security Council, Reza Seifollhai, told state TV late on Wednesday that the attackers were people from Iran who had joined Islamic State. Iranian police said they had arrested five suspectsSupreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: “These fireworks have no effect on Iran. They will soon be eliminated.”“They are too small to affect the will of the Iranian nation and its officials,” state TV quoted him saying.The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps accused Riyadh of being behind the attacks and vowed to seek revenge.“This terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the U.S. president (Donald Trump) and the (Saudi) backward leaders who support terrorists. The fact that Islamic State has claimed responsibility proves that they were involved in the brutal attack,” a Guards statement said.Trump said in a statement that he prayed for the victims of the attacks but added that “states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.” The U.S. State Department and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres both condemned the attacks.Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said he did not know who was responsible for the attacks and said there was no evidence Saudi extremists were involved.DRESSED AS WOMENAttackers dressed as women burst through parliament’s main entrance, deputy interior minister Mohammad Hossein Zolfaghari said, according to the Tasnim news agency. One of them detonated a suicide vest, he said.On a video released by the IS news agency Amaq a man purportedly inside the parliament says in Arabic: “Oh God, thank you. [Gunshots]. Do you think we will leave? No! We will remain, God willing.”Police helicopters circled over parliament, with snipers on its rooftop. Within five hours, four attackers were dead and the incident was over, Iranian media said.“I was inside the parliament when shooting happened. Everyone was shocked and scared. I saw two men shooting randomly,” said one journalist at the scene.Soon after the assault on parliament began, a bomber detonated a suicide vest near the shrine of the Islamic Republic’s revered founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, a few kilometers south of the city, Zolfaghari said.A second attacker was shot dead, he said. The shrine is a main destination for tourists and religious pilgrims.“The terrorists had explosives strapped to them and suddenly started to shoot around,” said the shrine’s overseer, Mohammadali Ansari.By late evening, deputy interior minister Zolfaghari put the death toll at 13, with 43 wounded.The Intelligence Ministry said security forces had arrested another “terrorist team” planning a third attack. The National Security Council’s Seifollhai said Iran had foiled 58 similar attacks, without specifying a time period.REGIONAL ANIMOSITYThe attacks follow several weeks of heightened rhetorical animosity between Riyadh and Tehran.In unusually blunt remarks on May 2, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is Saudi defense minister and a son of King Salman, said he would protect his country from what he called Iranian efforts to dominate the Muslim world.Any struggle for influence between the Sunni Muslim kingdom and the revolutionary Shi’ite theocracy ought to take place “inside Iran, not in Saudi Arabia,” he said without elaborating.The next day Iran accused Saudi Arabia of seeking tension in the region, saying the prince had made “destructive” comments and it was proof that Riyadh supported terrorism.The attacks could also exacerbate tensions in Iran between newly re-elected President Hassan Rouhani, who positions himself as a reformer, and his rivals among hardline clergy and the Revolutionary Guards.But Rouhani said Iran would be more united and more determined in the fight against regional terrorism and violence.“We will prove once again that we will crush the enemies’ plots with more unity and more strength,” he said.In an appeal for unity, Rouhani’s chief of staff, Hamid Aboutalebi, took to Twitter to praise the security services.“Applause to the power and firmness of our revolutionary guards, Basij (volunteer militia), police and security forces,” he wrote.However, two senior government officials, who asked not to be named, said the attacks might prompt a blame game.“They (hardliners) are very angry and will use every opportunity to grow in strength to isolate Rouhani,” said one. The other said the attacks would push Iran toward “a harsher regional policy”.Militant attacks are rare in Tehran and other major cities although two Sunni militant groups, Jaish al-Adl and Jundallah, have been waging a deadly insurgency, mostly in remote areas, for almost a decade.Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province, in the southeast on the borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to the Balouch minority and has long been a hotbed of Sunni insurgents fighting the Shi’ite-led republic.Last year Iranian authorities said they had foiled a plot by Sunni militants to bomb targets inTehran and other cities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.(Additional reporting by Parisa Hafezi in Ankara, Asma Alsharif in Cairo, Yeganeh Torbati in Washington, Lisa Barrington in Beirut, David Dolan in Istanbul; Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Robin Pomeroy)"

A frustrated Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who has asked for such an estimate for several years, said Coats “went back on a pledge.”Privacy advocates criticized the push to make Section 702 permanent, arguing that regular reviews of the law were necessary to conduct appropriate oversight and prevent potential abuses.“After months of criticizing the government for allegedly spying on his presidential campaign, President Trump is now hypocritically endorsing a bill that would make permanent the NSA authority that is used to spy on Americans without a warrant,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union.Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms shown to be involved in a program known as Prism.Last week, Facebook , Amazon , Alphabet Inc’s Google  sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to adopt several reforms to the law, including codifying the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected Americans’ communications with someone living overseas that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target.Making the law permanent without changes would preclude codifying that change.Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration supported renewal of Section 702 without any changes, citing an unnamed White House official, but it was not clear at the time whether it wanted the law made permanent.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 14 to add dropped words “embarrassing some U.S. technology firms involved in”)(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Alden Bentley and Paul Simao)"
69,WORLD NEWS,The 'Boy In The Ambulance' Emerges In Interviews With Pro-Assad Media,Carla Herreria and Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-boy-ambulance-assad-media_us_59371ed9e4b0aba888b99bb0,Experts warn that Omran's interviews are likely a public relations ploy by the Syrian government.,2017-06-07,"Images of Omran Daqneesh became a symbol of Syria's violence. Nearly a year after his rescue, his family appears for interviews with pro-Assad news outlets.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59376c181d00002900cc1908.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Omran Daqneesh held the world’s attention last year when a photo of the Syrian boy, sitting bloodied and confused in the back of an ambulance, went viral.Omran had just been pulled from the rubble after an airstrike on the Syrian city of Aleppo. His older brother would later die of wounds sustained in the attack. With his image circulating on the internet, Omran came to be known simply as “the boy in the ambulance,” a symbol of the terror that Syrian children are forced to endure in a civil war.Omran’s family hadn’t spoken to the press since his widely seen rescue ― until this week, when interviews with the boy and his father, apparently living comfortably in government-controlled Aleppo, emerged from news outlets that support Syrian President Bashar Assad.Kinana Allouche, a pro-Assad journalist, shared on Facebook photos of her interview with a healthy-looking Omran with his family, including his father, Mohammad Kheir Daqneesh, on a couch in an Aleppo home. Other photos on Allouche’s Facebook account show the journalist wearing a shirt with the image of Assad’s face.“The child Omran, those who tried to shed Syrian blood mislead the news that he was hit by the Syrian Arab Army,” she wrote in the caption, according to a translation by The Daily Telegraph in London. “Here he now lives in the Syrian state with its army, its leader and its people.”In a similar interview, filmed in the same living room and shared Monday by Russian news outlet Ruptly, Daqneesh said that the now-iconic photo of Omran in the ambulance and hospital was taken without his permission. Video of Omran’s rescue was first published by the activist group Aleppo Media Center.According to Ruptly’s report, “Daqneesh had concluded that the footage was used by opposition-supporters for the purpose of ‘propaganda.’” Another video taken by the Russian news station shows Omran waving the Syrian national flag.Daqneesh explained in a separate interview published Monday why he stayed in Syria after the attack, saying, “This is my country,” according to a translation by The New York Times. He also blamed the violence in Syria on the rebels who oppose Assad.“They are the ones who hurt us and our country and displaced the people,” Daqneesh said.Omran’s reemergence in the media was met with skepticism. Some speculate the recent television appearances on state-run news channels could be a regime-coordinated ploy to project an image of normality in government-controlled areas of Syria.As The New York Times report explains, the government is likely using Daqneesh and his family, now living in regime-controlled territory, “to endorse [Assad’s] view of the war and discredit the opposition.”The government has a history of using propaganda to “show its supporters –- even the reluctant ones ― that it’s in control,” Syria analyst Annia Ciezadlo explained in October. “More than that, it’s demonstrating that it’s the only force within Syria that can guarantee a normal life.”It isn’t clear if Daqneesh was forced to give these interviews, but experts say that the Syrian government has been known to punish anyone who speaks against Assad’s regime.Omran’s family is “under government control now and this is a government that we know arrests and tortures anyone that speaks out against it,” Valeria Szybala, executive director of the nonprofit research organization Syria Institute, told Reuters. “To me the situation seems to suggest this is probably coerced.”"

The American envoy in the room was California Gov. Jerry Brown (D).It’s unusual for a state official to meet with a national leader, but there Brown was, in one of Beijing’s most important buildings, discussing “the importance of expanding cooperation of green technology, innovation, and trade,” according to the governor’s office. “It’s highly significant that the governor of California can meet with the president of China, talking about very specific issues on the foremost challenge of our time — namely, climate change,” Brown, a Democrat, told reporters after the 45-minute meeting, according to The New York Times. “I believe [President Xi] definitely gave the green light for more collaboration between China and California, and I would say other states [too], through this subnational arrangement,” the 79-year-old added. The Beijing meeting — held just days after President Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on limiting carbon emissions — was a largely symbolic one, but it sent a powerful message. “[It] underlined the extent to which Trump … is being sidelined on the world stage,” Jessica Meyers from the Los Angeles Times wrote, describing the encounter.Gov. Brown, a vocal critic of the Trump administration and longtime climate change crusader, was described as “America’s de facto climate ambassador” in the days leading up to his China trip. Brown was among the 13 U.S. governors and hundreds of mayors who committed to upholding the Paris Agreement in the wake of Trump’s withdrawal from the accord last week. “We’re on the field ready for battle,” Brown told reporters last Thursday, an hour after Trump’s announcement. “While the president may be AWOL in the battle against the climate, we’re not.”China has similarly reiterated its commitment to the climate accord in recent days. Responding to Trump’s Paris decision, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that “China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change.” China, currently the world’s biggest carbon emitter (the U.S. is second), appears eager to take up the mantle of global climate leader as Trump’s administration relinquishes this role. China’s National Energy Administration announced in January that it would invest more than $360 billion in renewable energy projects through 2020. Later that month, the agency canceled plans to build more than 100 new coal plants in the country. According to a recent Climate Action Tracker report, China is set to significantly reduce its coal consumption in the coming decade and is on track to “overachieve [its] Paris Agreement climate pledges.” “I can just feel the order of the world shifting a bit east,” Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, told HuffPost last week. “It’s very clear that China is ready to forge new alliances, and deep alliances with others than the United States.”Or in the case of California, perhaps within the United States too.The environmental partnership between China and California is actually not a new one. Several climate-related partnerships have been forged between the state and Chinese politicians, scientists and regulators since 2005, reported The World Post. Most recently, China sought California’s guidance in building its first carbon cap-and-trade market.If Trump and his administration continue to turn their back on the global climate fight, Brown said the importance of this partnership will only grow. “The rest of the country and the rest of the world have to react [to Trump’s climate inaction], and the reaction has to be to intensify our efforts to decarbonize our economy,” Brown told The World Post earlier this month. “As Trump does his climate denial, that paradoxically is a catalytic force that mobilizes those who don’t agree with him and those who see climate change as the threat I think it is,” Brown added.
