0,POLITICS,Federal Judge Says North Carolina Must Restore Voter Registrations Of Those Removed From Rolls,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-voters_us_581d0356e4b0e80b02ca2471,"The North Carolina NAACP sued the state on Monday, claiming a purge targeted black voters.",2016-11-04,"Voters stand in line during early voting at the Beatties Ford Library in Charlotte, North Carolina.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5817643c190000a304c2ff7c.jpeg?cache=sar0wi8dl2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― County election boards in North Carolina must restore the registrations of voters removed from the polls, U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs ordered on Friday. The order follows an emergency hearing held on Wednesday to address allegations that election officials in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties had removed voters from the rolls due to campaign mailers that were returned as undeliverable. The North Carolina NAACP sued the state on Monday, claiming the purge targeted black voters. The Justice Department submitted a statement of interest in the lawsuit on Monday night supporting the assertion that removing voters from the rolls en masse is a violation of the National Voter Registration Act.Biggs, who during the hearing called the state’s process for removing voters’ names “insane,” said in her ruling that the NC NAACP had proved that names were unfairly removed.“The Court finds that a narrowly tailored injunction is warranted to ensure that eligible voters are not deprived of their right to participate in the upcoming election due to a flawed process engaged in by the State and County Boards, which this Court has determined likely violates the NVRA,” Biggs said in her decision.“Voter enfranchisement cannot be sacrificed when citizens through no fault of their own have been removed from the voter rolls,” she added.Rev. William Barber, the president of the NC NAACP, said the court ruled against “surgical, intention racism.”“Racism is about policy,” Barber said on a call with reporters. “It’s not just about feelings, it’s not just about language. It’s when you use your power ― or attempt to use your power ― to undermine the rights of people and you target it toward African-Americans.”The civil rights group argues that these cancellations are an attempt by the Republican Party to suppress the black vote, which is lower this year than it was in 2012.At least 5,600 registrations have been removed in Cumberland County for varying reasons since 2014, while 790 and 63 were removed in Moore and Beaufort counties, respectively.At least 3,500 voters were removed in the past 90 days, according to Penda Hair, an attorney representing the NAACP. The cancellations could have cost Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton the election, since most of the voters are black and tend to lean Democrat. It’s still unclear whether or not those people will be able to vote on Election Day. State law mandates that voters within any given county can challenge the eligibility of another voter in that county up to 25 days before the election.But the National Voter Registration Act says states can only cancel registrations if a voter provides written notice of a change in address or if a voter does not respond to a notice for two election cycles and fails to vote for two federal election cycles. States also cannot remove voters from the rolls 90 days or less before a federal election. “What they’re doing is race-driven. It’s immoral, illegal and it is unconstitutional. The courts have spoken,” Barber said. “We’ve not seen this kind of intentional suppression since the days of Jim Crow.”Read Biggs’ decision in full:  HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Chris Christie’s (R) former aides guilty of all charges in the Bridgegate scandal that has continued to plague the governor.Bill Baroni, who served as Christie’s top official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was the governor’s deputy chief of staff, each faced seven counts of conspiracy, fraud and related charges. The most serious charges carry a maximum of up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing is set for Feb. 21.Kelly cried as the verdict was read, according to a reporter who was in the courtroom.The trouble started on Sept. 9, 2013, when three of the access lanes were shut down on the George Washington Bridge connecting Manhattan to Fort Lee, New Jersey. It’s the busiest bridge in the country. The change created significant problems on the New Jersey side of the bridge and was ordered without notifying police, emergency officials or officials on the New York side of the Port Authority’s leadership.Christie officials originally tried to claim that the closures were part of a traffic study ― an excuse that was soon debunked. The real motive of messing with the city’s Democratic mayor, who refused to endorse Christie’s re-election bid, was revealed shortly afterward.The most damning piece of evidence for the political payback scheme was an Aug. 13 email sent by Kelly, when she wrote, “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” David Wildstein, a Port Authority executive and close Christie ally, replied, “Got it.”Baroni was fully aware of what closing the lanes would do to Fort Lee. Mark Sokolich, Fort Lee’s mayor, had written to Baroni in November 2010 to complain of ongoing traffic problems. Although Christie has not been charged with any wrongdoing, the scandal haunted him during his presidential run. And the trial revealed details that bring the incident closer to his doorstep and cast doubt on whether he was truly in the dark about the scheme.Wildstein told jurors that he and Baroni talked with Christie about shutting down the lanes during a Sept. 11 memorial service. Wildstein has been cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to two counts of conspiracy.There have long been indications that Christie may have known more than he was letting on. A top aide to Christie privately told a colleague that the governor lied at a December 2013 news conference when he said no one on his senior staff knew about the lane closures. “He just flat out lied about senior staff and [campaign manager Bill] Stepien not being involved,” Christie staffer Christina Renna texted. “And if emails are found with the subpoena or ccfg [Chris Christie for Governor] emails are uncovered in discovery if it comes to that it could be bad,” she added.Christie put out a statement after the verdict saying he was “saddened” by the actions of his staffers and continued to deny any involvement.“But let me be clear once again, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them,” he said. “No believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.”Even Donald Trump, who considered choosing Christie as his running mate, has said he’s pretty sure the governor knew about the lane closures.This piece has been updated to include Christie’s statement."

Fear of the GOP presidential nominee has been, perhaps, the primary motivating factor for many Clinton voters. But this spot seems more about targeting those who are nonchalant over the significance of their vote or, really, about the election entirely. And it’s not difficult to imagine that the ad’s creators had the Brexit referendum in mind when putting it together. There was general shock at the results in June, when most people voted for the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. That was followed by news reports of “leave” voters quickly regretting their decision. Several were quoted as saying they’d assumed the “remain” camp would prevail and wanted merely to send a message. The Trump campaign has often pointed to the Brexit result as proof that an un-anticipated surge in support ― not caught by pollsters ― could come for the Republican nominee. The Clinton campaign is telling voters to recognize the consequences of not taking that seriously.  Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
4,POLITICS,Report: FBI Examining Fake Documents Targeting Clinton Campaign,"Mark Hosenball, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-clinton-emails-investigation-fake-documents_us_581c85f6e4b0d9ce6fbb32fe,"In a letter identified as fake, Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat, is quoted as writing to Clinton, “We will not let you lose this election.”",2016-11-04,"FBI Director James Comey testifies at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in Washington on September 27, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581c86301600002e002c861d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies are examining faked documents aimed at discrediting the Hillary Clinton campaign as part of a broader investigation into what U.S. officials believe has been an attempt by Russia to disrupt the presidential election, people with knowledge of the matter said.U.S. Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, has referred one of the documents to the FBI for investigation on the grounds that his name and stationery were forged to appear authentic.In a document forged to appear as though Carper was writing a letter to Clinton, Carper is quoted as saying the Department of Homeland Security had advised him of a risk that a “massive” cyber attack “could change the election results in favor of a specific candidate.” The document dated October 3 was reviewed by Reuters.It concludes, “Any suspicious incident will be immediately reported to your assistants so that a recount of votes could be timely organized. You will not lose the election because of some compromised electronic voting systems.”The fake Carper letter is one of several documents presented to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice for review in recent weeks, the sources said.Carper spokeswoman Meghan Pennington confirmed on Friday that the senator had sent a copy of the letter to the FBI and the Senate’s chief law enforcement officer.“Our office became aware of a fake letter on Senator Carper’s official letterhead and immediately referred it to federal law enforcement to investigate its genesis,” Pennington said.As part of an investigation into suspected Russian hacking, FBI investigators have also asked Democratic Party officials to provide copies of other suspected faked documents that have been circulating along with emails and other legitimate documents taken in the hack, people involved in those conversations said.A spokesman for the FBI confirmed the agency was “in receipt of a complaint about an alleged fake letter” related to the election but declined further comment. Others with knowledge of the matter said the FBI was also examining other fake documents that recently surfaced.U.S. intelligence officials have warned privately that a campaign they believe is backed by the Russian government to undermine the credibility of the U.S. presidential election could move beyond the hacking of Democratic Party email systems. That could include posting fictional evidence of voter fraud or other disinformation in the run-up to voting on Nov. 8, U.S. officials have said.Russian officials deny any such effort.In addition to the Carper letter, the FBI has also reviewed a seven-page electronic document that carries the logos of Democratic pollster Joel Benenson’s firm, the Benenson Strategy Group, and the Clinton Foundation, a person with knowledge of the matter said.The document, identified as a fake by the Clinton campaign, claims poll ratings had plunged for Clinton and called for “severe strategy changes for November” that could include “staged civil unrest” and “radiological attack” with dirty bombs to disrupt the vote.Like the Carper letter, it was not immediately clear where the fraudulent document had originated or how it had begun to circulate.On Oct. 20, Roger Stone, a former Trump aide and Republican operative, linked to a copy of the document on Twitter with the tag, “If this is real: OMG!!”Benenson’s firm had no immediate comment. Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, said the document was “fake.” He said he did not know if the FBI had examined it.Stone did not respond to emails requesting comment.A spokesman for the Clinton campaign, Glen Caplin, said the document was a fake and part of a “desperate stunt” to capitalize on the leak of Democratic emails by Wikileaks.The developments highlight the unusually prominent role U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have played in a contentious election and an ongoing debate about how public they can or should be about their inquiries.FBI Director James Comey, a Republican appointed by President Obama, touched off an outcry from Democrats last week when he alerted Congress that agents had found other emails that could be linked to an inquiry into Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State, effectively re-opening an investigation he had closed in July.(Editing by Kevin Krolicki, John Walcott, Toni Reinhold)"
5,TASTE,"This Oven Only Makes Cookies, And It's Equal Parts Awesome And Awful",Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/smart-oven-cookies-k-cups_us_581c9a1be4b0e80b02c938b5,It’s basically the Keurig of the cookie world.,2016-11-04,A Green Mountain Coffee single-serving brewing cup is seen in a Keurig machine.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At first glance, it seems like SideChef, the company behind the recipe app of the same name, baked up a bit of brilliance.It has started a Kickstarter for a product called the Chip Smart Cookie Oven, which bakes fresh cookies in less than 10 minutes. It only bakes four sugary treats at a time, preventing those of us who consider the Cookie Monster to be our spirit animal to suppress our strongest and darkest binge-eating impulses. You can also completely suck at baking and still yield four perfect spheres of heaven that come in flavors such as sea salt chocolate chip and peanut butter Nutella swirl.But about those aforementioned flavors ...Here’s the aspect of the gadget that may make your inner cookie enthusiast crumble — the product relies on “dough pods,” which are much like Keurig cups (or those plastic cups you can put into single-serving coffee makers), to create their little nuggets of joy.See, this is how the whole thing works. In order to make the cookies, one scans a QR code on a dough pod and the app will send baking instructions to the Chip via Wi-Fi. You then put the dough from the cups in the oven and the Chip does the rest. You’ll actually get a notification on your phone once the cookies are done.Sounds cool, but the thing is, Keurig cups, also known as K-cups, are ridiculously bad for the environment. They create unnecessary waste and even if they are recyclable, each cup needs to be broken down and separated into paper, plastic and metal in order to be recycled, and most people do not want to take the time to do that.Even John Sylvan, the man who invented the Keurig machine and its cups, regrets creating it.“I don’t have [a Keurig]. They’re kind of expensive to use ... it’s not like drip coffee is tough to make,” he told The Atlantic, adding, “I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it.”SideChef’s Kickstarter does claim that customers could use their own recipes with the cookie oven, making the need for dough pods obsolete. The site also says it is experimenting with biodegradable parchment paper wrappers and using environmentally safe packing for their dough pods.The company told The Huffington Post via email that it plans to use recyclable and biodegradable polypropylene plastic number five — the same material used in yogurt cups — for the pods. Yet, it still seems like a lot of unnecessary waste to create a plastic container for a single-serving cookie.Good for the earth or not, the Chip also comes with a pretty bougie price tag. Through the month of November, the gizmo can be purchased with a $99 pledge on its Kickstarter page, but will retail for $144 once it hits the market.Yup.A conventional oven, a timer and package of Pillsbury cookie dough never looked so good."

Look at Hillary!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here’s a pretty high-quality “Gish gallop” from Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, running over MSNBC’s Brian Williams with a torrent of arguments Thursday night:WILLIAMS: Your candidate today on the stump. A quote from Donald Trump ― “It was reported that an avalanche of information is coming in. The FBI agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment.”That’s good stuff. Conway swiftly moves off the inconvenient fact that an earlier story of the day ― Fox News’ report that the FBI was about to hand down indictments in a Clinton Foundation investigation ― was false.She then represents last week’s story about scandal magnet Anthony Weiner’s emails figuring in a renewed FBI inquest as if it were an even more recent story, while oddly raising the spectacle that there are 650,000 new emails in the case. (There are 650,000 emails in total on Weiner’s laptop; it’s unknown how many involve Clinton.)Then she presents statements from Reps. Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas) about investigating and impeaching Clinton as if those two gentlemen were victims of cruel circumstance, passively being dragged to that point, when in reality they are champing at the bit to get that party started.It all ends with Conway asking Democrats to urge Clinton to quit the race and wondering why none have unendorsed her ― which maybe points to Conway’s own insecurities about her own candidate, from whom she’s taken some half-steps to distance herself.It would probably really help Conway out if Clinton were to quit the race, because the absence of a Clinton campaign and its ground game would finally bring the Trump campaign on level terms in that regard. But to answer her question: The reason that Democrats aren’t calling on Clinton to quit the race less than a week before Election Day is because Democrats want to win the election. (Had we had this conversation back in May of 2015, Kellyanne, you might have had a more salient point.)Of course, what I’d really like to point out here is how Conway answers Williams’ first question about whether the Trump campaign will correct or amend the false contention they’d made throughout the day. “Well, the damage is done,” she says, adding, “The voters are hearing it.” In other words, “We sowed false perceptions. Mission accomplished.” The Trump campaign is a very Beltway-ish, politics-as-usual affair. That’s an underappreciated fact.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

They found Kubek yelling and cursing at a group of adolescents ages 12 to 14, who were sitting on some grass in front of a house, police said.Kubek accused the youths of damaging his Trump sign, but admitted that he hadn’t seen any of them actually do it and didn’t have security cameras that could prove who destroyed the sign, according to officers.Police said there is no evidence that proves the kids were involved in vandalizing the sign, WDIV TV reported.Officers sent Kubek home while they questioned the kids, who had reportedly told him they didn’t touch his sign. He didn’t believe them, they said. Then they alleged that he’d pointed a gun at them while his mother called the police.When the officers questioned Kubek about this, he showed them an unloaded Sig Sauer 9 mm P938, according to the Detroit Free Press.“He said it was unloaded and still in the holster when pulled from his waist,” Allen Park Police Det. Lt. Dave Williams told the paper.Kubek told police he “felt threatened by the juveniles because he was outnumbered” and “stated that his intention was to scare the juveniles,” a news release issued by the department stated.He also said that his house had been egged and political signs in front of it had been destroyed a week earlier, according to RawStory.Kubek was arraigned on Tuesday. He was charged with six counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of felony firearm possession.His next court date is a probable cause hearing scheduled for Dec. 5."

That marks a 3-point drop since mid-October.Individual surveys that previously found Johnson with support from 10 to 13 percent of voters show him capturing just 2 to 4 percent support in the final days before the election.State polls also show a significant drop for Johnson in recent days. The former New Mexico governor began receiving double-digit support in polls in early June. As his numbers remained steady, analysts began to assess the effect he could ultimately have on the election, especially in tight state races.But Johnson’s impact no longer seems to be of much concern as he drops to the same level of support most third-party candidates see heading into Election Day.Johnson’s unprecedented rise was partly inspired by a highly polarized presidential race. A relatively unknown alternative candidate can often be appealing to voters looking for somewhere else to turn when they dislike both candidates.And that’s precisely what seems to have happened with Johnson. He entered the race relatively unknown, but, like most third-party candidates, his likability and vote share suffered as voters became more familiar with him. Signs of Johnson’s decline began to show up after he was barred from participating in the presidential debates because he failed to meet the 15 percent polling threshold required to secure a spot.His support was further dampened after a series of embarrassing gaffes in late September ― he asked what Aleppo is in one interview and failed to name one world leader he admires in another interview.His unusual behavior became more apparent as he did more interviews. The admission by his vice presidential running mate that Hillary Clinton is a more qualified candidate probably didn’t help either. It’s also possible that Johnson has been recently overshadowed by Evan McMullin, another third-party candidate who has grabbed national attention as his support has skyrocketed in Utah. As in past elections, it seems most third-party voters will ultimately bite the bullet and vote for one of the two major-party candidates or refuse to vote altogether. "
11,POLITICS,Latest Jobs Report Should Remind Us How Terrible Things Were 8 Years Ago,"Daniel Marans, Arthur Delaney, and Sam Stein",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/october-jobs-report-better_us_581c98bee4b0d9ce6fbb3d0e,America isn't the hellhole Donald Trump describes.,2016-11-04,"When President Barack Obama was elected in 2008, the economy was in a tailspin. Now, it is experiencing the longest consecutive period of job growth on record.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581c9a0f190000a304c30e63.jpeg?cache=yHP3YXClCO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― On the last Friday before the 2008 election, the full brunt of the recession was just beginning to take hold. America’s unemployment rate jumped from 6.1 percent in September to 6.5 percent in October. Within a year, it would peak at 10 percent.The signs of unfolding economic catastrophe were visible in other places. By Oct. 31, 2008, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index had plunged almost 17 percent that month, its worst-ever monthly point decline. That same day, it was reported that at least 7.5 million Americans were underwater on their mortgages. When the October jobs report came out in early November (after the country had voted), the headlines were chilling. Payrolls had shrunk by 240,000 in October. It was the 10th straight month of rising unemployment. And the yearly job losses up to that point were 1.2 million. These were dark times.By 2012, things had improved, but still weren’t great. In the second-to-last monthly jobs report before Election Day, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate had fallen slightly from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent, with a paltry 114,000 jobs created. Yet people thought this was such good news that CNBC contributor Jack Welch, the ex-CEO of General Electric, infamously accused the Obama administration of cooking the books.“Unbelievable jobs numbers,” Welch wrote on Twitter. “these Chicago guys will do anything ... can’t debate so change numbers.”Four years later, as Obama closes the books on his time in office and America prepares to elect its next president, the country’s economic landscape looks remarkably different ― and demonstrably better.The economy has continued its record consecutive streak of growth, creating 161,000 new jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.And there is even rosier news: Average pay rose 0.4 percent ― bringing total wage growth to 2.8 percent in the past 12 months.“Workers deserve a raise, and they’ve been long overdue for a raise, and we’re seeing in this report solid evidence of a sustained tightening job market, which means real wage growth,” U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez told The Huffington Post.The October jobs report speaks to the monumental economic progress that Obama has presided over ― and one increasingly at odds with the dystopian framing from GOP nominee Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Indeed, a look at the job market might turn the idea of a “third term” for Obama, hurled as an insult by Trump and his backers, into an unwitting compliment for Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton. The U.S. is in the middle of a 73-month streak of total job growth, which is a record. The Affordable Care Act, which was supposed to decimate the jobs market, has done no such thing.Of course, the Great Recession devastated the economy so much that most economists think the labor market has not yet fully recovered, despite the gains. To someone who is unemployed or whose wages haven’t gone up, the jobs report can seem like fiction. Recent research shows that unemployed Trump supporters, for instance, tend to think the unemployment rate is much higher than it is. Trump himself has repeatedly said the past year’s worth of low unemployment numbers are phony. Beyond the numbers are tales of real human suffering. The ordeal of Jeff Adams, a 61-year-old resident of San Diego, California, reflects the remaining gaps in the job market. The bad economy drastically changed his life, disrupting his career as a defense contractor and leaving him looking for a low-paying retail job that can carry him to retirement.It’s his second unemployment spell since the Great Recession, which officially started in 2007 and ended in 2009. Adams lost his job as a procurement specialist in 2010, and weeks later, found out he had pancreatic cancer. He said he kept looking for work even as he underwent chemotherapy.“I continued to [look for work] to increase my odds of finding something good, but if someone called, there were times I couldn’t have made it to the interview,” Adams said. Nobody called. Adams said he didn’t get any offers for two years, a duration of unemployment that afflicted nearly 2 million people at the time. (Even today, the number of Americans seeking work for 99 weeks or longer is historically high.) In 2012, he won a contract position to do procurement again, but it ended in 2014. Next, he worked as a home health care aide until he was laid off in June. Adams is looking forward to retirement and is not interested in another high-stress defense job. He’s optimistic about his retail prospects. “If you’ve got your health and enough money to feed yourself, those are two things that are so important, and I realized time is the most important thing we have,” Adams said. The next president will have to find a way to help people like Adams. The lack of jobs in the economy has persuaded many people to give up looking for work altogether.“We’re not at full employment,” said Elise Gould, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. She says full employment means “typically marginalized groups also have opportunities in the economy ― not just on average, but at the bottom. Young and old workers alike, and black and white workers.”The prime-age employment to population ratio, which accounts for Americans who have dropped out of the workforce entirely and excludes workers under 24 and over 55, just surpassed the low point of the two downturns before the recent Great Recession.“We are seeing consistent ‘singles,’ to use a baseball term,” Gould said. “We need to keep seeing it month after month, and we will see all those workers on the sidelines come back to the job market.” But it’s fair to say that on the aggregate, the country is remarkably better off than it was the last time Americans went to elect a new president.This story has been updated to include comment from U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

12,POLITICS,Judge Won't Put GOP On Tight Leash Over 'Ballot Security' Voter Intimidation [UPDATE],Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-ruling-poll-watching-gop_us_581cc29ee4b0aac62483f419,Donald Trump’s calls for poll monitors to watch “certain areas” could have landed the Republican Party in trouble for years.,2016-11-04,Donald Trump could land the Republican National Committee in legal trouble for years after the presidential election is over.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581cd2b41600002e002c8754.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Nov. 5 ― In a 36-page ruling issued Saturday, U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez denied Democrats’ request to hold the Republican National Committee in violation of its court-ordered obligations not to organize “ballot security” measures aimed at intimidating voters.Vazquez also declined to extend the 1982 consent decree that gave rise to these prohibitions. He left open the door, however, to allowing the Democratic National Committee to submit more evidence post-election that might result in further sanctions for the RNC.Angelo Genova, the lawyer who helped secure the original decree 34 years ago, said in a statement that he hopes the additional evidence will help establish that Republicans still need to be kept under court supervision over tactics he said amount to “voter suppression efforts.”PREVIOUSLY:NEWARK, N.J. – With only days to go before the election, the Democratic National Committee clashed with the Republican National Committee in federal court on Friday, seeking a ruling to curtail poll-watching efforts on the ground that may intimidate minority voters.Fueled by incendiary rhetoric from Donald Trump and his surrogates on the campaign trail suggesting the need for “ballot security,” lawyers for the DNC have asked U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez to hold the RNC in contempt of a consent decree that since 1982 has bound Republican officials from encouraging measures that can disenfranchise voters headed to the polls.“What the evidence shows, your honor, is that Republicans on the ground are responding to these calls,” said DNC lawyer Rajiv Parikh, who added that these “vigilante-type” activities are only meant “to target and harass people based on race.”Calling the decades-old court agreement a “burden” on Republicans, the lawyer for the RNC roundly rejected the idea that the proof offered by Democrats is enough to amount to a violation of its terms.“Even if the RNC were involved in poll-watching activities, that’s explicitly allowed under the consent decree,” said Bobby Burchfield, who has represented the RNC in earlier legal attempts to free Republicans from the onerous court order. “At best, what we have here, your honor, is a technical violation of the consent decree.”He added that if Democrats succeed in convincing Vazquez to extend the agreement for eight more years, which is what their lawyers requested in court papers filed last week, the DNC would be “completely emasculating the election process.”After hearing nearly two and a half hours of oral arguments from both sides and considering hundreds of pages of affidavits and other evidence, Vazquez said he’d rule on the matter later in the day or by Saturday, but indicated he is unlikely to extend the decree past its expiration date of December 2017.One of the hurdles for the court is to determine whether comments by Trump, running mate Mike Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway in recent months can be attributed to the RNC ― and result in sanctions that may keep the GOP under further court supervision.Since he clinched the Republican nomination for the presidency, Trump has repeatedly relied on innuendo and vague fear-mongering to warn supporters that Democratic-aligned voters in urban areas might “cheat” to steal the election from him.“Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times,” Trump said during a summer rally, despite almost non-existent evidence of voter fraud. He has made similar appeals at rallies in several states.In court documents filed ahead of Friday’s hearing, DNC lawyers made a forceful case to tie Trump and a key adviser, voter-intimidation expert Roger Stone, to the very origins of the consent decree the RNC is now under. The original court-ordered rules, which were renewed in 1987 and 2009 and remain in force, stemmed from a similar wave of tactics against voters of color in a New Jersey gubernatorial race.Vazquez, who is relatively new to the federal bench, now faces the difficult task of deciding what would be the proper scope and remedy for this new round of allegations. With the election only days away, the judge is likely to keep his ruling narrow but forceful enough to get the RNC to dissuade any potential poll watchers from crossing the line with voters.Still, the RNC lawyer appeared doubtful that the judge could tailor relief in the case in a way that could accomplish much.“What more can an injunction do to get the RNC to comply with the consent decree that is not already doing?” Burchfield said, adding that further enforcement could affect Republicans’ “ability to function as a major political party in the country.”Friday’s hearing took place against a backdrop of busy court activity for the DNC and its state affiliates. Lawyers for the party have filed a stream of emergency lawsuits in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona ― all of them aimed at keeping the Trump campaign or Republican state officials from engaging in conduct that may keep voters of color away from the polls.This article has been updated with additional background from the hearing and the case."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581ce23a190000a304c30fa8.jpeg?cache=ZwGiGjyd82&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Indiana governor and now-VP candidate Mike Pence approved an extreme anti-abortion bill in March of this year, Indiana resident Laura Shanley knew she needed to take some kind of action.But rather than protest or write an angry Facebook rant, she decided to get creative.On March 27, shortly after Pence approved HEA 1337, she started a Facebook page called “Periods for Pence,” encouraging women to call Pence’s office and give the nitty gritty details of their menstrual cycles to whoever answered the phone, as well as request that that information be passed on to Pence himself.Shanley has done this almost every single day since.The page ― which was changed to “Periods for Politicians” when Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate ― has since garnered more than 75 thousand likes. But Shanley, (who remained anonymous under the pseudonym “Sue Magina,” until a Thursday interview with IndyStar) refuses to call it a movement. She told IndyStar that instead she prefers the term “action.”“I feel like movement is a big thing and it’s hard for me as one little person to wrap my head around that. So I always hesitate to use the word movement but people have,” she said. Shanley wants the page to be less about her and more about the community that it has fostered.“I’m one person. I’m not this group,” she told IndyStar. “We’ve built an amazing community. There are women on here who talk back and forth all the time now and it’s a support system.”Shanley had a conservative upbringing, and remained anonymous for months after launching the Facebook page because she was working for a conservative, anti-choice church. She told IndyStar that her upbringing helps her to understand Pence’s stance on abortion. “I know the basis of where he’s coming from,” she said. “But there has got to be a point where empathy overrides theocracy. We are adults, autonomous beings.”Pence’s track record on women’s rights is not pretty, especially when it comes to women’s health issues, like abortion access.Pence signed a law that would make it illegal for women to have an abortion even if the fetus had fetal anomalies (this was later blocked by a federal judge). He once said that he wants to see Roe v. Wade “sent to the ash heap of history,” and has worked tirelessly to defund Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides crucial health services to men and women all over the country. Perhaps Pence might do well to engage with more of his female constituents. Keep fighting the good fight, “Sue Magina.”Head over to IndyStar to read the full (and fantastic) interview with Shanley.Donate below to support women, Latinos, Muslims, other groups Donald Trump has insulted.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Indiana was one of two states in the country where a woman cannot have an abortion even if the fetus has fetal anomalies.

You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture.Here we are: just days away from the election, and stress levels on both sides are at an all-time high. Emails are leaking, polls are going up and down, Donald Trump is still Donald Trump. It’s not a great spot to be in. In times of confusion and chaos, some are relying on what celebrities have to say to assuage their fears that the United States will become a flaming dumpster fire on Nov. 8. We want the same people who uplift and inspire us through acting and song to do the same on the political scene, lack of political experience and know-how be damned. And they have. To name a few, Miley Cyrus has popped up in Virginia to campaign for Hillary Clinton, while Anne Hathaway showed up in Pennsylvania to stump for the Democratic candidate. Katy Perry’s and Madonna’s antics have caught the public eye, for better or worse. Lena Dunham, she of the “grabbed pussy” Halloween costume, even commented on the absurdity of celebrity voting PSAs with a somewhat awkward, pantsuit-laden rap.It’s great that these women are using their public platform and influence to encourage voters — especially ones in that crucial youth demographic — to stop by the polls next Tuesday. Even better that they use the societal megaphone of social media to speak out against the sexual harassment and bigotry that has unfortunately become part of our 2016 election narrative.But, should a celebrity have to do so in today’s political climate, where a politically experienced woman is contending against a loudmouth real estate tycoon, especially if part of their brand includes feminism (in actions, if not explicitly by name)?While we’ve heard ringing endorsements from some celebrities, whether it’s those mentioned above or Scott Baio and Clint Eastwood supporting Trump, other prominent figures have kept mum. According to Esquire, top names like P. Diddy, Garth Brooks, The Rock, Ronda Rousey and Chris Pratt haven’t said one way or another who they’ll vote for, if they plan on voting at all. Then there’s the queen of #squadgoals herself.Taylor Swift is one notably silent celebrity when it comes to politics, and one who’s also championed the power of women helping each other (except in cases like her “Bad Blood” video, where she is ... not). She’s had a complicated year between her breakup with Calvin Harris, the Hiddleswift romance heard ‘round the world, and a certain damning Snapchat released by none other than Kim Kardashian. To embroil herself in another potentially controversial topic could bring her image down. In July, Daily Beast writer Amy Zimmerman pointed out that Swift’s white feminism (e.g., her ill-advised tweets with Nicki Minaj under the guise of said feminism while ignoring that women of color have been historically underrepresented at award shows) seems like an apt match for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. In the direct aftermath of the #KimExposedTaylorParty, Zimmerman wrote, “With all the time Swift and her squad have spent ... urging fans to focus on issues that really matter, the pop superstar could have actually directed some much-needed millennial attention toward HRC.”In the days leading up to the election, Twitter users have been asking the pop star to speak up.Swift has a track record of being one of the nicest pop stars around. She’s personally selected holiday gifts for lucky fans. She makes a show of stopping by children’s hospitals and quietly donated a huge sum to Kesha’s team when the singer was embroiled in a legal battle with Dr. Luke. Still, it seems that her generosity is doled out when it aligns with her carefully crafted image, that of a benevolent BFF who showers you in cat pictures and sparkly stage outfits and never wants to talk about the hard stuff.One could argue that that’s OK — Swift is a pop star. She’s in a different realm than the dogged Republican-Democrat sparring that shows up daily in the news. Sure, but the hateful rhetoric, including attacks on the Muslim community, women, Latinos and reproductive rights, among others, spewed during this election takes the typical election-year debates over policy into one of simple human decency. We’re in an election season where women have reported feeling traumatized from the news of Donald Trump’s multiple alleged assaults and his offensive “locker room talk” captured on a 2005 tape. It would be a powerful show of support for sexual assault survivors if the highest-earning female musician publicly denounced the kind of offensive speech the Republican nominee is known for. It wouldn’t be an explicit endorsement of Clinton, if drawing too hard a political line would be bad for business — as Allie Jones points out in New York Magazine’s The Cut, siding with Hillary would mean being on the same team as her avowed enemy, Perry. But if Swift’s pro-women beliefs are as strong as she purports, it would be a significant nod of support to those who have been deeply affected by this year’s headlines.It’s doubtful we’ll hear anything from Swift in the coming days — even a shot of an “I voted” sticker seems unlikely, considering her reticence on talking politics in the past. To admit to voting would spark a furious demand from fans to know who she voted for (heck, maybe Swift is secretly psyched for Jill Stein??), and an admission either way would risk alienating a chunk of her fanbase (or their parents).Could Swift’s silence on important matters like sexual assault threaten her fanbase’s loyalty more, though? We’re all heading into a new world with either outcome on Nov. 8 — perhaps Swift will have to change her public-facing strategy, too."

Some 600 police officers were deployed at the location.The estimated total of around 3,000 at the Paris camp is about twice as many as just a week ago when the bigger camp in Calais was evacuated and demolished.One Reuters journalist at the location, around a canal and an urban railway bridge at Paris’s Stalingrad metro station, said three buses had left by 0700 GMT amid cheering, applause and, in some cases, cries of solidarity with the migrants.About 80 buses were present.“We have the means to evacuate up to 4,000 if necessary,” Housing Minister Emmanuelle Cosse told France 2 television.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo urged the government earlier this week to clear the camp as a matter of urgency.Bruno Morel, director of the Emmaus Solidarite charity that has been helping migrants said: “Things are going smoothly so far. It’s above all a question right now of reassuring people that there are other options.”The illegal Paris and Calais camps, home to close to 10,000 migrants in all who are being put in smaller but less ramshackle lodgings, have come to symbolize Europe’s fraught endeavors to deal with a record influx of migrants from war zones in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.In the case of Calais, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said around 85 percent of migrants were expected to qualify for refugee status and asylum.France is currently negotiating with London to ensure that Britain takes in child migrants from the now-closed Calais camp, which for years was a magnet for migrants desperate to make it across the narrow Channel sea crossing to Britain."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe81f11a00006e145b902a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sofía Muñoz Boullosa came across the Rosalindo Grocery Store while walking through the streets of Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood. She took a photo. But when the Mexico City native turned to walk away she heard a man shout after her.The man was Pedro Cruz, the owner of the store, he wore a blue apron and asked the 26-year-old photojournalist to take a photo of him. When the two realized they were both from Mexico, they began to chat.“We talked for a couple of hours about Mexico, Puebla, his native state, Mexican food, racism, migration, Trump and the true meaning of missing Mexico,” Muñoz Boullosa told The Huffington Post via e-mail. “When I returned home an idea occurred to me: to look for more ‘Pedros’ to demonstrate the variety, complexity and the human stories linked to migration.” Muñoz Boullosa began by searching through social media for people named Pedro who lived in New York. She only found two using that method, so she began walking neighborhoods with large Mexican communities and simply stopping and asking at shops and stores if there was anyone named Pedro around. The idea about a photo series centered on Mexican immigrants had been brewing in Muñoz Boullosa head since she first arrived to the United States in 2015, the year Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president. “When I came to New York, the subject of Trump and migration was all over the media,” she recalled. “He had just expressed his beliefs that Mexicans bring drugs into the United States and are rapists. From the first day I was here I knew that I wanted to work on a project which challenged these declarations and these sentiments and provide an alternative image of Mexicans who come to the United States looking for a better life.”But despite wanting to “stand up for Mexican people in the United States during this moment where we have been targeted as something we’re not,” Muñoz Boullosa understood the importance of keeping her project positive.“Unlike [Trump], I wanted to challenge his statements from a rhetoric that does not come from hatred, but from understanding,” she said. “I view my project as a possibility of changing people’s minds towards immigration from that place of being sensitive and empathetic with the human condition, not the political turmoil around it.”While her photo series documents the stories of Mexican men named Pedro, Muñoz Boullosa says she feels these stories could belong to “Dimitris, Youssefs, Chengs, Mohameds, Paolos, or it could be the story of any of us.”And despite being an immigrant herself, the photographer says putting her “Pedro” series together taught her about how the immigrant experience is a normal part of the human experience. “I learned that immigration is made up by individuals, it is not a homogeneous theme,” she said. “Every single person that has migrated has a different story, and everyone should have the right to tell it. It should not be used as a political weapon because it is a human right that belongs to all of us. I learned that migration is a natural process: butterflies migrate, humans also do. The causes are different, but in the end finding a better place to live is natural.”Take a look at the Pedros she met below and what they told her about Mexico, being an immigrant in the United States and Donald Trump. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Donate below to support women, Latinos, Muslims, other groups Donald Trump has insulted."

It tore the facades off buildings and firefighters were searching for people trapped by debris.A spokesman for the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), parliament’s second-biggest opposition grouping, said the detention of its two leaders and at least nine other lawmakers risked triggering civil war.Yildirim told reporters that elected officials who incite and encourage terrorism must face legal proceedings and that they were detained because they had refused to give testimony.The arrests will heighten concern among Western allies about a deepening crackdown on dissent under President Tayyip Erdogan and about political stability in Turkey, a NATO member and a buffer between Europe and the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.The arrests, which drew swift condemnation from the European Union, come as Turkeyhas detained or suspended more than 110,000 officials in the wake of a failed July coup.Turkey is considering reintroducing the death penalty, and earlier this week journalists from a leading opposition newspaper were detained.“Very bad news from Turkey.

The HDP, which won more than 5 million votes in the last general election a year ago, denies direct links.The government introduced a nationwide state of emergency after a failed military coup on July 15 which gave it broad powers to round up suspects linked to the putsch.

There is nothing I cannot answer for,” Demirtas said in a statement to the prosecutor, which was shared by HDP lawmaker Besime Konca.“But I refuse to be an actor in this judicial theater just because it was ordered by Erdogan, whose own political past is suspicious,” he said.In a statement on Twitter, still accessible in Turkey through virtual private networks (VPN), the HDP called for the international community “to react against the Erdogan regime’s coup,” while party spokesman Ayhan Bilgen described the detentions as an attempt to provoke a civil war.Police also raided and searched the party’s head office in central Ankara.

I think that’s when it would go from an election to an activist movement,” Valderrama said. But the onus for change does not fall solely on the Latino electorate’s shoulders. Valderrama said politicians need to recognize and appreciate the contributions U.S.-born and foreign-born Latinos have made to the country, and make good on the promises they made to the community while on the campaign trail. “It’s about... embracing that community and giving them not only platform but giving them the right laws, the right reforms and really keeping those families together so you can not only organize the community for progress, but you keep the harmony and the spirit of what the American dream is,” he explained. Valderrama then said that, ultimately, Latinos need to be “shown with actions that they are really important because that is what moves the country forward.” We hear that. "

For a team with the Warriors’ star power, early challenges like what we’ve seen could very well give way to growth and success down the road.“We’ll find our stride eventually,” Kerr said.Read The Huffington Post’s exclusive interview with Grant Hill, and learn about the NBA’s best rookie you’ve probably never heard of.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

26,POLITICS,Why Trump Supporters Are Sticking With Him,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rally-maine-wajahat-ali_us_581b662de4b07cfea3219c77,"At a rally in Bangor, Maine, Wajahat Ali probes the depths of Trump supporters' hatred for Clinton.",2016-11-03,"A Trump supporter snaps a photo at a campaign rally in Bangor on Oct. 15, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s divisive, captivating and historic campaign is nearing its end. On Tuesday night, we’ll know whether he will be the 45th president of the United States of America. The Huffington Post recently sent its new video host, Wajahat Ali, to Bangor, Maine, for one of Trump’s many rallies in the state. Ali ― who in a 93-percent white town quipped that he was the “darkest thing in the neighborhood” ― asked Trump supporters why they were standing by him, even after his campaign has been rocked by scandal after scandal. “What about the ‘Access Hollywood’ video?” Ali asks one Trump supporter, referring to the recently surfaced 2005 tape of Trump bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy.”“I don’t watch ‘Access’ ― why would I watch ‘Access Hollywood’? C’mon think about that for just a minute,” a man responds. “You saw the [sexual assault] allegations, you heard the women, you’ve heard the tape, you’ve seen what he’s tweeted ― how can you... as a young, intelligent woman, still be for this guy Trump?” Ali asks another supporter. “From a personal point of view, I was raped when I was 19,” she responds. “Sexual assault is big to me. [Trump’s] words didn’t hurt anybody.” “Is there anything that motivates you towards [Hillary Clinton] just as a woman? That she might be the first female president,” Ali asks the same woman. “As a woman, no, because she’s not a good example of a woman because she’s against Christians, she’s against Jews, she’s against law enforcement...”“She’s for Muslims,” Ali, who happens to be Muslim, interrupts. “This is true. This is true,” the woman says. “They’re their best friends but that’s okay.” “Everybody can change,” says a man in a Make America Great Again hat with a Blue Lives Matter pin on his jacket. “I believe in forgiveness.” “Can you ever forgive Hillary Clinton?” Ali asks. “No.” This deep distrust of Clinton was a big part of Trump’s support in Bangor, one of the most populous cities in Maine’s second congressional district. In the long-shot scenario where Trump wins every swing state except Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado, a win in Maine’s second congressional district could put the GOP nominee over the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House. “Some folks are saying they’re going to lead an anti-Hillary militia if she wins precisely because they think she’s going to take the country down the wrong path. What’s your response to that?” Ali asks another Trump supporter. “I believe it to be right,” a woman responds.“If Clinton wins, it’s a close race, what do you think is going to happen to America?” Ali asks. “I think it’s going to follow the same pattern, and eventually end up leading to war,” she responds. “Internal war or external?”“I’d say both,” the woman says. This video was hosted by Wajahat Ali and produced by Gabe Piscione. It was edited by Zack Chapman and shot by Kenn Gonneville and Heeth Grantham.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
27,POLITICS,Does Peter Thiel Know Who Invented Email?,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-email-inventor_us_581a50cde4b0c43e6c1dc44a,Let's ask him.,2016-11-03,Peter Thiel delivers a speech at the National Press Club in Washington on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581a8696150000d804531609.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Peter Thiel is a pretty big deal in Silicon Valley and among the world’s tech elites. He was a co-founder of PayPal, became an important early investor in Facebook, and remains a venture capitalist of great renown. He’s also a figure of some controversy: a nominal libertarian who backs authoritarian presidential nominee Donald Trump, a promoter of seasteading, and the possessor of some odd but compelling ideas on human longevity. He’s also the guy who bankrolled Terry Bollea (aka/dba Hulk Hogan) in his successful lawsuit against Gawker Media.But that’s not important at the moment. What I’d like to know is whether Thiel knows who invented email.It shouldn’t be a difficult question to answer. It’s easily looked up: Here, see for yourself. But I’m not sure Thiel knows. And the reason for my uncertainty is simple: In addition to providing the financial backing for Bollea’s suit against Gawker Media, Thiel gave similar assistance to a scientist named Shiva Ayyadurai, who sued Gawker Media for defamation after it published a series of articles that, as former Gawker Media site Gizmodo reports, “cast doubt on his claims to have invented email in 1978.” Those stories were true. Ayyadurai did not, in fact, invent email. (As of Wednesday, a settlement has been reached in this case in which Ayyadurai will receive $750,000.)Why did Thiel find merit in Ayyadurai’s claims? Maybe it’s because Thiel does not know who invented email. (I can’t underscore this enough: It was not Ayyadurai.)Earlier this week, Thiel held a press conference at the National Press Club to account for his support of Trump. This is not really something I thought many people were interested in, but The Huffington Post was among the assembled media. There, Thiel described Gawker as a “singularly sociopathic bully” and claimed that the average “single-digit millionaire” did not have effective access to our legal system.That’s a dubious claim, to be sure, if only because if Ayyadurai had actually been the inventor of email, as opposed to being the inventor of a false claim to have invented email, he might not have needed Thiel’s assistance to finance his bogus lawsuit against Gawker.But apparently no one thought to ask Thiel, “Hey, do you know who invented email?” And that’s too bad, because I’d have liked to hear him answer. Presumably he would have said (incorrectly), “That’s easy. It was my man, Shiva Ayyadurai.”Of course, journalists then would have written stories with headlines like, “Peter Thiel Does Not Know Who Invented Email.” And then, I guess, he would have sued the people who wrote those stories? Actually, that’s a pretty interesting follow-up question: “Are you going to sue any of the other people who wrote about how Shiva Ayyadurai is not actually the inventor of email? Or is that something that’s okay for everyone not Gawker Media to say?”You see, either Thiel does not know who invented email, or he is one really intellectually and morally inconsistent fellow!One thing is for sure, Shiva Ayyadurai ended up getting a pretty big audience for his false claims. The Washington Post had to lengthily unwind a story in which his claims were reported as legitimate. The Huffington Post also allowed Ayyadurai’s claims to appear on these pages. We were wrong to have published them and wronger still to have defended their publication. Those posts, which attested to the veracity of these false contentions, have rightly been pulled.But Univision, which acquired most of the assets of Gawker Media as a result of the Thiel-funded bankruptcy cases, opted to take down Gizmodo’s original story about Ayyadurai, “The Inventor Of Email Did Not Invent Email.” They were wrong to have done so, as Gizmodo’s story was true. In fact, had Thiel actually read the story that was the basis of a lawsuit he bankrolled, he would have learned a lot about who actually invented email.I wonder if at some point in the future, Thiel might actually take the time to find out who invented email. Boy, is he going to be surprised!~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."

It then shows footage from Trump’s speeches and rallies ― including recordings of his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the moment a Sikh protestor was kicked out of a campaign event. The video also includes screen grabs of news headlines describing attacks against people of South Asian descent in America.“It doesn’t matter how you voted in the past. This is about our future,” the actors said. “Is this the world you want for your grandchildren?”The violent rhetoric that has emerged during this election cycle is something that is very troubling to the video’s executive producer Vijay Chattha. Chattha, founder of a public relations company in San Francisco, told The Huffington Post that he believes all South Asians should be worried about a Trump presidency because it could prompt what he calls “trickle-down racism.”“All Americans should be worried about things like the economy tanking as soon as Trump gets elected, his ability to have access to nuclear weapons, [his effect on] international relations,” Chattha said. “I think South Asians specifically should be worried about trickle-down racism and hate crimes. If he wins a lot of people are going to feel emboldened to do whatever they want to. That’s scary. Anyone who is South Asian should remember 9/11 and how the community was perceived afterwards. It was a scary time.”Chattha said that the idea for this “passion project” came to him after multiple conversations with members of his own family who were lifelong Republicans and planned to vote for Trump this year.Over the past few months, the Trump campaign has been making efforts to reach out to the small but vocal group of South Asians who are in his camp. The Republican Hindu Coalition hosted Trump at a charity event in mid-October. Last week, Trump released a Diwali ad in which he attempts to speak Hindi. The ad has reportedly been running on Indian-American television channels. But the majority of South Asians aren’t convinced that Trump is the best choice for president. According to the 2016 National Asian American Survey, only 7 percent of Asian Indian registered voters said they are voting for or leaning towards voting for Trump. Nine percent were leaning towards other candidates, while 13 percent said they didn’t know, or refused to answer the survey question. On the other hand, 70 percent of Asian Indian registered voters said they were either voting for or leaning towards voting for the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Although it’s a small group that this video is intended to reach, Chattha hopes the message will make an impact in South Asian communities in swing states like Florida and Ohio. “The more we can spread the word, the better,” he said.

30,POLITICS,This Tim Kaine Interview Is A Good Excuse To Geek Out On Supreme Court History,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-kaine-supreme-court_us_581b649de4b08f9841add69a,The senator made a big constitutional gaffe. But his save was impressive.,2016-11-03,"It's OK, Tim Kaine, you still get a 7 out of 10 on your Supreme Court quiz.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581b64f8190000a304c30b75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Hillary Clinton’s running mate, made news last week when he told The Huffington Post that a Senate controlled by Democrats might eliminate the de facto 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court justices.Democrats “will change the Senate rules to uphold the law,” Kaine said in the interview, where he also took Republican senators to task for their stated plans to stonewall anyone Clinton might nominate to the high court.But there was a slight problem. During that interview, Kaine made a mistake about something that’s actually not in the Constitution: how big or small the Supreme Court should be.“The Constitution doesn’t set the size of the court. It sets a maximum, I think, of 15,” he said. “But since the Judiciary Act of 1869, it’s been a nine-member court. That’s what the statute says.”Well ― sort of. Kaine is absolutely correct that the size of the Supreme Court is set by statute and that it’s stayed the same for nearly 150 years.Where Kaine missed the mark is the idea that Article III of the Constitution puts a cap on the number of justices there could be. In reality, the constitutional text is very vague about the structure of the court ― its language leaves it up to lawmakers to fill in the blanks and amend the court’s makeup as they please. Kaine acknowledged as much.“Congress could change it, if Congress wanted to and had the votes, but Congress won’t,” he said. “So until Congress does, that’s the size of the court.”Asked about the error, a Clinton campaign aide said that Kaine misspoke, and that he’d gotten confused with another bit of Supreme Court lore: President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s controversial court-packing plan of 1937.If that’s indeed what Kaine meant, it’s actually pretty impressive. Just this week, The New Yorker had a column comparing Roosevelt’s plan to fill the Supreme Court with friendly liberal judges ― a scheme that never materialized ― with Republicans’ novel efforts to shrink the court because a bench of eight instead of nine is suddenly a good thing.Well played, Tim Kaine. You get a 7 out of 10 on your Supreme Court quiz."

Experts believe the xenophobic rhetoric of this election is largely to blame.Muslims in Kansas are already seeing attempts at this kind of violence. In October, a group of three white men planned an elaborate terrorist attack that involved detonating four explosive-laden cars at the corners of a Garden City, Kansas, apartment complex that houses mostly Somali Muslims. The trio had stockpiled weapons, ammunition and explosives before the the FBI intervened and prevented them from carrying out their plot.There have been other recent incidents. Earlier this week, a Saudi Arabian student at the University of Wisconsin-Stout was beaten and killed, and police say it may have been a hate crime. In August, a white man shot and killed a Lebanese Christian neighbor in front of his Oklahoma home because he thought he was a “dirty Muslim.” “I think the real intention behind these is the fact that they don’t really have a leg to stand on when it comes to any policies or issues — they’ve driven our state into the ground,” Heather Scanlon, communications director for the Kansas Democratic Party, told HuffPost. “Rather than trying to run on issues like education or public safety, they’re using fear tactics and fear-mongering to rally up the voters who are unenthusiastic about their party.”Members of the Kansas GOP insisted in interviews with local Kansas newspapers that the fliers’ intent is to address terrorism, and not incite fear.The party did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment for this story.“I reject the explanation that the GOP and Kansas has tried to provide, saying they’re focusing on ISIS,” Elbayoumy said. “They’re throwing suspicion at every Muslim neighbor. It’s a shameful attempt to use the fear people have of ISIS and extremists, and imply the only people who can secure them is the GOP. This is definitely not true.

Chris Gibson (R-N.Y.) as a battle between three super PAC billionaires and working people.“You have at least three billionaires, including Sheldon Adelson, pouring millions of dollars into super PACs to try and buy this seat in Congress,” Sanders wrote. “The super PAC funded by Adelson has spent more money attacking Zephyr than they have for any other candidate in the country. ... These billionaires know that she will fight in Congress to take on corruption, stop bad trade deals, and fight for working people.”Teachout, a Democrat who built her academic career studying political corruption and corporate monopolies, is locked in a very tight race with former New York State Assemblyman John Faso, a Republican who made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2006 against Eliot Spitzer. In 2010, Faso and his law firm were tied up in an ethics scandal involving New York state pension funds. The firm paid $550,000 to resolve the inquiry, in a settlement that cited a meeting Faso arranged between an investment client and a state retirement fund.Teachout has created a fundraising juggernaut by relying on Sanders’ small-donation model, raising over $1.6 million without help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The average donation to her campaign has been $19 ― lower than Sanders’ famous $27 figure. Republican billionaires Paul Singer and Robert Mercer have each plowed more than half a million dollars into a pro-Faso super PAC.Sanders has been directing his supporters to Teachout’s campaign for months, and spoke at a rally for Teachout in September.“The task now in front of us is to help decide whether big corporations and special interests will win out over people power,” Sanders wrote Thursday. “This is about whether or not super PACs and big money can buy a seat in Congress to protect their profits, or if a grassroots movement will succeed.”Polling is thin in the Hudson Valley district, which stretches between New York City and Albany. A September poll put Faso ahead by 1 point, while a late October poll put Teachout up 3 points. The district leans slightly Democratic ― Barack Obama won it twice ― but has been represented by a Republican since 2013.Teachout has run a series of ads mocking Faso’s billionaire support, including one in which she challenged Singer ― rather than Faso himself ― to a debate. The National Republican Congressional Committee responded with an ad calling Teachout a “zany professor,” tying her to “socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.”Teachout doesn’t seem to mind the affiliation."

When she turned back, Kayla was gone. Initially, the woman thought her daughter went to play or use a restroom. When she couldn’t be found, the family called police.She’s described as a 4-foot-tall, 90-pound Hispanic female with black hair and brown eyes.

Where history can move. You can bend the arc of history in a better direction.”Obama’s personal popularity here is not in question. The arena can hold 6,000, but at least three times that many had hoped to get in, some waiting since dawn in a line that snaked more than a half mile down the road.Deborah Fields arrived at the UNF campus at 9 a.m. to win a spot near the head of the line, and by noon still had another three hours to go before Obama was scheduled to start.“It is worth it,” said Fields, who is 71 and retired after 48 years in the mortgage industry.

He said it was unrealistic to think that Clinton could ever win the sort of black support that the nation’s first black president could. What’s more, he said, it’s not critical for her do so.Schale said that for Clinton to win Florida, she had to make sure that by election day, the black share of the vote was about equal to the black share of the population, and that the overall electorate was more racially diverse than it was in 2012. He said that because of the growth of the Latino population over the past few years, the latter is definitely happening, and that the former is looking like it will happen, too – particularly with Sunday’s post-church services “souls to the polls” event still to come.Schale allowed, though, that black turnout so far in Duval County has only been about 25 percent of those registered, compared to about 30 percent statewide so far. “Hopefully this will help,” he said of Obama’s visit.In his 38 minutes on stage, Obama went through his accomplishments while in office, including: bringing the economy back from the brink of depression, scaling back wars, implementing marriage equality and increasing use of solar and wind power.He said all of those were at risk if the nation votes for GOP nominee Donald Trump, whom he again described as patently unqualified and unfit for the office.“If you have one person who you know is not qualified, and one person you know is eminently qualified, the only thing left to do is vote,” Obama said, promising that Clinton would build on his progress. “You’ve got to get your friends to vote. You’ve got to get your family to vote.”In that regard, John Bentley has his work cut out for him. The 70-year-old said he had already voted for Clinton, but is having trouble persuading one family member to do the same: his 24-year-old son, who he said does not trust Clinton because of the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and because of the repeated release of stolen email correspondence by Wikileaks. “Can you believe it?” Bentley asked."

Republican nominee Donald Trump has amped up talk on the trail that a Clinton presidency would lead to a “constitutional crisis” based on the presumption that the FBI’s acquisition of new emails will lead to an indictment.Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, downplayed some of that talk in a Tuesday interview with “The Wells Report” on 660 AM The Answer.“Well, I think that’s premature myself, to be talking about that because of course she hasn’t been elected or sworn into office,” Cornyn said. “And unless there is some additional evidence that the FBI director and the [Justice Department] would take to a grand jury, then she is not likely to be convicted of a crime.”Cornyn criticized Attorney General Loretta Lynch for not appointing a special counsel to lead the investigation and convene a grand jury “because clearly none of us really have the whole story.” CNN first reported on Cornyn’s comments.Endangered Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), known for his combative relationship with the White House throughout President Barack Obama’s term, also spoke about his Republican colleagues this week, advising them to “calm down.”“OK, I’m gonna say, be the adult in the room and say, ‘Calm down, back off, it’s not gonna happen,’” Issa said Wednesday on the “Brett Winterble Show” on KFMB San Diego. “The fact is we have impeached and removed from office nine federal judges in our history, no members of the executive branch, not a president, not a vice president, not a cabinet officer, so floating that word is usually a fairly reckless thing.”“The idea that there is a sort of quick fix and you throw somebody out of office ― it happens in third-world countries. It mostly doesn’t happen in the U.S.,” Issa continued. “I always push back and tell people that’s something you want to reserve for long after the American people are demanding it before you even begin to look at it.”House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pushed back against talk of impeaching Clinton on Thursday.“In addition to there being no grounds for impeachment to begin with, moving to impeach President Hillary Clinton for alleged activities from before the election would be a brazen attempt to nullify the vote of the American people, outside our constitutional framework and destructive to the Framers’ intent,” Pelosi said in a statement.

He chose to treat them himself and not seek medical attention, according to the Dallas Morning News.However, the incident was reported both to campus police and the Texas Rangers.A spokeswoman for the college said all other campaign signs would be inspected and those containing sharp objects removed.Steve Spainhouer, the Democratic chair in Collin County Precinct 122, had some cutting remarks about what he calls the worst campaign-related crime he’s seen in 16 years.“I think it’s deplorable,” he told CBS Dallas. “It just shows how far we’ve come in politics where people want to be so mean, so hateful to try and injure somebody who’s probably got no political party persuasion one way or another and is just working at a poll.”Although the matter is being investigated, there have been no arrests, according to Fox4News.com. A Collin College spokeswoman told the station there are no security cameras in the area where the incident happened.Experts told WFAA TV that if there is an arrest, the most likely charge would be tampering, but one legal expert said there could possibly be a criminal mischief charge."

The country music icon was one of the night’s biggest honorees, taking home the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award. When Parton went on stage to accept her award, she couldn’t help but make some high-larious jokes. “To be receiving the Willie Nelson Award, this is an absolute high for me,” she said, laughing as the crowd erupted into cheers. “For Willie to have a high-chievement award, I mean how proper is that? ‘Cause he’s had some highs that border on historic, I can tell you that.” In all seriousness, Parton added, “I really am very proud to receive this.”Before Parton gave her speech, some of country’s biggest stars paid tribute to the legend with a few great covers. First, actress Lily Tomlin introduced the award before singers including Reba McEntire, Kacey Musgraves, Martina McBride and Carrie Underwood took the stage to perform some of Parton’s greatest hits. Pentatonix, whose video of themselves singing with Parton went viral in September, gave one of the most memorable tribute performances, choosing to cover the classic hit “Jolene.” The group was joined by Jennifer Nettles, whose vocals were a perfect fit. McEntire was up next, singing Parton’s classic “9 to 5,” followed by Musgraves, who sang “Here You Come Again.” And of course, a Dolly Parton tribute wouldn’t be complete without “I Will Always Love You,” which was performed by all the women (minus Pentatonix).Parton clearly loved it: "

During their opening monologue at the 50th annual CMA Awards on Wednesday, the show’s hosts poked fun at certain moments from the last few weeks of debates, singing a little jingle calling out the election for “taking forever ... and ever.” They crooned:“The race is on, it’s on every single channel and it’s making my head spin. We’re so freakin’ sick of politics, we don’t even care who wins. Hey, won’t it be refreshing instead of the election to watch us all singing up here? Can you believe a bunch of hillbilly singers been doing this for 50 years?” The pair, who have been hosting the CMAs for nine consecutive years, brought on more laughs when they did a segment on the nominees for Entertainer of the Year.Paisley, imitating Trump during the debates, hovered over his sidekick and dubbed her “crooked Carrie” and “a nasty woman” after she gave her fellow nominees some shoutouts. The “Today” singer even revealed he’s #WithHer when he told the male nominees, “I love all you guys, but hashtag I’m With Carrie.” Underwood and Paisley didn’t just joke about the election, though. They also called out Billy Ray Cyrus, the Brangelina breakup and Peyton Manning.But the two eventually brought it back to the election with a “gift basket for the audience ― aka “a basket of deplorables” ― which featured “Florida Georgia Lime” soda, Dolly Parton’s rainbow bra and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill Barbies, of course. To be honest, we’re still laughing. "

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-krugman-climate-change_us_581b8687e4b0e80b02c889c1,Climate change could become an even greater catastrophe if Donald Trump wins.,2016-11-03,Paul Krugman warned that President Barack Obama's signature climate policy could be derailed if Republicans retain control of the Senate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581b87091600002f002c8424.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Krugman on Thursday warned of dire environmental consequences if Democrats fail to gain a majority of seats in the Senate. During an appearance on Bloomberg TV, the Nobel Prize-winning economist said that, even if Hillary Clinton wins on Nov. 8, President Barack Obama’s signature piece of climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, could be derailed if a Republican Senate majority blocks every Supreme Court justice she nominates. The plan has been stalled since February, when the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, granted a stay to 29 states and a slew of industry groups who appealed the rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held a marathon session in September to weigh the plan’s future and a decision is due in the coming months. If the Supreme Court continues without a ninth justice, any appeal of that ruling would likely split the country’s top court 4-4, which would affirm the lower court’s decision.“If the Democrats take the Senate, we probably save the planet,” said Krugman, who recently bemoaned the absence of climate-related questions during the president debates. “Climate change has turned out to be an easier issue economically, and an easier issue politically than we thought.”Improvements in technology have made clean energy cost competitive with fossil fuels. The historic 180-country agreement reached in Paris last December, which goes into effect on Friday, has given markets the clearest signal yet that the world economy is ready to begin weaning itself off carbon. Political gridlock in Washington has dimmed hope for legislation that would help the U.S. meet its goals for cutting carbon emission. “We have a Republican Party that’s been radicalized,” Krugman said. “The only way policy gets made is through executive action.” The Clean Power Plan, which was carried out through executive action, imbued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with new powers under a 46-year-old provision of the Clean Air Act to force utility companies to reduce their emissions. Under the plan, the power sector is projected to reduce its carbon emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.“You go for what is, in the end, something that is a top-down regulatory thing,” Krugman said. “It’s a not-too-bad second best.” But first, Clinton needs to secure a White House victory on Election Day. The Democrat has a 98.6 percent chance of winning, according to HuffPost’s election model. HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates publicly available polling, shows Clinton taking about 48 percent of the vote nationally to Donald Trump’s 42 percent in a head-to-head matchup. That’s good news for the climate. A victory for the Republican would reverse most of the progress made in cutting carbon pollution during Obama’s eight years in office. After two terms of Trump policies, emissions would be 16 percent higher than after two terms of Clinton’s policies, amounting to 3.4 billion tons of carbon over the next eight years, according to a study released Wednesday by the independent data firm Lux Research. “As independent analysts, we don’t endorse candidates, but the data and analysis clearly show that energy policy and the resulting emissions will go in very different directions under Clinton and Trump,” Yuan-Sheng Yu, an analyst at Lux, said in a statement. “Climate change hasn’t been front-and-center in media coverage of this election but voters should be aware of the implications of their choice on this important issue.”Cristian Farias contributed reporting."
46,POLITICS,"The Planet Is Screwed If Democrats Don't Win The Senate, Warns Paul Krugman",Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-krugman-climate-change_us_581b8687e4b0e80b02c889c1,Climate change could become an even greater catastrophe if Donald Trump wins.,2016-11-03,"If Donald Trump wins the presidency, the carbon emissions that cause global warming are expected to skyrocket. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581b87a81600002f002c842a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Krugman on Thursday warned of dire environmental consequences if Democrats fail to gain a majority of seats in the Senate. During an appearance on Bloomberg TV, the Nobel Prize-winning economist said that, even if Hillary Clinton wins on Nov. 8, President Barack Obama’s signature piece of climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, could be derailed if a Republican Senate majority blocks every Supreme Court justice she nominates. The plan has been stalled since February, when the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, granted a stay to 29 states and a slew of industry groups who appealed the rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held a marathon session in September to weigh the plan’s future and a decision is due in the coming months. If the Supreme Court continues without a ninth justice, any appeal of that ruling would likely split the country’s top court 4-4, which would affirm the lower court’s decision.“If the Democrats take the Senate, we probably save the planet,” said Krugman, who recently bemoaned the absence of climate-related questions during the president debates. “Climate change has turned out to be an easier issue economically, and an easier issue politically than we thought.”Improvements in technology have made clean energy cost competitive with fossil fuels. The historic 180-country agreement reached in Paris last December, which goes into effect on Friday, has given markets the clearest signal yet that the world economy is ready to begin weaning itself off carbon.

47,THE WORLDPOST,Russian Soldiers Are Secretly Dying In Syria,"Maria Tsvetkova and Anton Zverev, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-soldiers-secretly-dying-syria_us_581b232ee4b01a82df64e63d,They were in Syria as private contractors deployed by the Kremlin.,2016-11-03,"A grave of Russian contractor Maxim Kolganov, who was killed in combat in Syria, is pictured in his hometown of Togliatti, Russia, September 29, 2016. Picture taken September 29, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581b240f150000b7005316f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOGLIATTI, RUSSIA ― The start of this year proved deadly for one unit of about 100 Russian fighters supporting President Bashar al-Assad’s troops in northern Syria.On Feb. 3, 38-year-old Maxim Kolganov was killed in a firefight with rebels near Aleppo when a bullet pierced his body armor and heart. Then, on March 9, the same unit came under shell-fire near Palmyra, and Sergei Morozov, also 38, was hit and died on the way to hospital.Back in southern Russia, medals were delivered to their families: the order of bravery, with certificates signed by President Vladimir Putin. The medals, seen by Reuters, were intended to honor the sacrifice they had made for their country.Except Kolganov and Morozov were not employed by the Russian state. They were in Syria as private contractors, a small part of an army of such people who are being deployed secretly by the Kremlin in Syria.The deaths of Kolganov and Morozov, and others like them, have not been made public. Families say they were given little information and told not discuss the cases. In at least one case that Reuters uncovered, the family of a fighter killed in Syria received a payout of around $100,000 in compensation.Officially, Russia is participating only in an air war over Syria with a small number of special forces on the ground. Moscow denies that its troops are involved in regular ground combat operations.However, in interviews with more than a dozen people with direct knowledge of these deployments, Reuters has established that Russian fighters are playing a more substantial role in ground combat than that the role the Kremlin says is being played by the regular Russian military.The sources described the Russian fighters as contractors or mercenaries, hired by a private company, rather than regular troops. But despite their unofficial status, according to these accounts, they operate in coordination with the Russian military and are given privileges back home normally available only to serving soldiers.They fly to Syria on board Russian military aircraft which land at Russian bases. When they are injured, they are treated in hospitals reserved for the Russian military and get state medals, people interviewed by Reuters said.Reuters was not able to determine the precise number of such Russian mercenaries fighting in Syria, nor the total number of casualties they have sustained, but three people familiar with the deployments said there were many units of a similar size to the one that included Kolganov and Morozov.Neither the Kremlin nor the defense ministry responded to questions from Reuters. Reuters was unable to obtain comment from Syrian officials on the question of Russian mercenaries.Reuters was not able to identify the company or companies that hired the fighters, or the source of any payments to the fighters or their families.THE KREMLIN’S BIDDINGUnder Russian law, it is illegal to work as a private military contractor in another country. However, Russian citizens have participated in wars across the former Soviet Union throughout the 25 years since it broke up in 1991.In 2014, large numbers of Russians fought openly on behalf of pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine. Western countries say those rebel units were organized, paid and armed by Moscow; the Kremlin says any Russians there were independent volunteers.Last year, Russia joined the war in Syria, its first conflict outside the borders of the former Soviet Union since the Cold War. Word got out among veterans of the Ukraine conflict that mercenaries were needed.According to three people who knew Morozov and Kolganov, both had fought in Ukraine as part of the same unit that would eventually take them to Syria. It was led by a man who goes by the nomme de guerre “Vagner”, who has become a leader of Russian mercenary forces in Syria, one of the sources said.Little is known of his real identity. Two of Vagner’s comrades say he had already traveled to Syria as a mercenary in 2013, before commanding his group of Russian fighters in eastern Ukraine. He then headed back to Syria, where Russia began its intervention in Sept. 2015.A Russian-language website, Fontanka, has published what it says is the only known photo of him, a picture of a bald man in military fatigues striding near a helicopter. The website said his name was Dmitry Utkin. Reuters could not verify the image or the name.One Ukrainian rebel commander who was close to the Vagner group in eastern Ukraine said many of the fighters there were tempted to fight in Syria because they had found it difficult to return to civilian life.“I meet them now and see how much they have changed. I simply have nothing to discuss with them. They can’t imagine any other life but war. That’s why they go fight in Syria.”Morozov, the fighter who was killed near Palmyra, had returned from Ukraine to his home in southern Russia and dabbled in local politics.He served as an aide to a member of parliament originally from his native city of Samara, Mikhail Degtyaryov. Degtyaryov told Reuters Morozov was a friend and confirmed that he had died in combat during the battle for Palmyra.“Kapa”, a former Russian officer and volunteer in the Ukraine conflict who asked to be identified only by a nomme de guerre, was friends with Morozov and also knew Kolganov and several other Russians who fought in Ukraine and went on to fight in Syria with the Vagner group. He is still in contact with some of them.He said Morozov became frustrated when he attended a meeting of the far-right LDPR party, and no one listened to him. Morozov gave up lucrative business ventures to rejoin his Vagner comrades in Syria, Kapa said.According to Kapa, Russian veterans of the Ukraine fighting were recruited for ground combat in Syria when it became clear that Syrians would not be able to hold ground without help, despite Russian air support.“The Arabs are not warriors by nature, but are thrown together and told to storm high ground. They don’t know how to storm it let alone conquer their instincts and move towards the bullets. How can you make them do it? Only by setting yourself as an example,” Kapa said. “That’s why our guys reinforced their units.”Asked if fighters in the group coordinated with the Russian defense ministry, Kapa said: “Of course”.According to two people who knew different fighters, they arrive in Syria via ships that land in the port of Tartous, leased by the Russian navy, or in military aircraft that land at Russia’s Hmeymim air base in western Syria.A doctor at a Russian military hospital told Reuters the wounded are evacuated to Russia on board military cargo planes and then treated in military hospitals.The doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared losing his job, said he had personally treated contractors injured in Syria, whose role there was clear from their conversations.His hospital is officially meant to admit only serving military personnel, their family members or veterans who have served long careers in the military, a category his patients were too young to fit, the doctor said.When Morozov and Kolganov were killed, their bodies were flown to Russia aboard military aircraft and delivered to a morgue used by the military in the southern city of Rostov, according to relatives and Morozov’s friend Kapa.A Reuters reporter saw the Order of Courage which was given posthumously to Kolganov. It was delivered to his family home in Togliatti, a city on the Volga river, by someone in civilian clothes who did not identify himself, according to relatives. Reuters has also seen a photograph of Morozov’s Order of Courage, dated Sept. 7, 2016.SECRECYKolganov never told his relatives where he was deployed, but pictures he sent contained clues. One of them, in which he posed under an orange tree, is now on the wall of his parents’ house.The family got proof he was in Syria only after his death, when they saw his passport with a Syrian stamp in it.The people who informed the family by phone of his death, and the people who turned over the body in the Rostov morgue, did not explain where he was killed or who he had been working for, the relatives said. The people they interacted with did not identify themselves and told the family not to talk to reporters, the relatives said.In another case, a 55-year-old Russian woman said her husband was killed this year while working as a military contractor in Syria. She did not want her name, or her husband’s, to be published because she feared reprisals.“They only told me about it after his death. A young man ... phoned and told me. And he also threatened me, so I would never tell anyone about it,” she said. “They are scary people.”By contrast, Russian authorities do acknowledge some combat deaths among serving military personnel, though often with a delay and without keeping an official tally.Reuters was unable to determine how many Russians have died in Syria. According to Kapa, the small unit that included Kolganov and Morozov has lost four fighters since the start of the Russian campaign in Syria, including its commander, killed in the same firefight as Morozov. Dozens have been wounded.Reuters earlier reported that Russian major Sergei Chupov was killed in Syria on Feb. 8 He also belonged to the Vagner group, a person who knew him told Reuters.The doctor at the military hospital who spoke to Reuters said that the surgical department where he works had treated six or seven Russian fighters back from Syria with combat injuries who were not serving Russian servicemen.The overall number of wounded contractors treated at his hospital could be a few times higher, the doctor said. He also says he knows of at least two more hospitals in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg where contractors are treated."

Richman, an adviser to James Comey, were writing this story about the FBI director’s recent disclosure that the bureau was reviewing newly discovered emails in the Hillary Clinton probe, it would include a sentence like this right up top:“We don’t know what’s in them, and it’s entirely possible that there’s nothing in them. Don’t change your assumptions based on complete uncertainty.”Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told The Huffington Post he thinks media outlets have been “really poorly” covering the Clinton email news since last Friday. That’s the day Comey sent a short letter to members of Congress stating that the bureau had come across emails that may or may not be “significant” to the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a personal email server as secretary of state.Comey, in a note to FBI employees that day, acknowledged that his letter could “create a misleading impression” and that there was “significant risk of being misunderstood.” Six days later, it’s pretty clear that’s the case.While Comey’s letter has been criticized for being too vague, and not plainly spelling out the fact that many of the emails obtained may be duplicates of those the bureau had already reviewed, Richman says he thinks the director was pretty clear, and that media outlets had “failed, utterly” in placing the letter in the proper context.“I read the letter. It was in English. It said, ‘I don’t know what’s in here,’” Richman said, paraphrasing Comey. “Everybody has their own views on what the letter said,” he continued. “In my view, as just a simple reader of the English language, it was dialed down as far as possible to convey the very odd position of there being emails that appeared to be related to this, without conveying anything about the contents, which of course he didn’t know at the time.”“Could he have added an extra sentence saying, ‘I really mean it’? I guess,” Richman said. “It would be really nice if members of the media and members of the public realized that there’s a real possibility that there will be duplicates. Since they haven’t been checked, the bureau can’t say, but we can guess from the outside.”While Richman maintains that no one could “possibly game out how the press in all its wonder can react to sorts of things like this,” it seems pretty obvious that from the moment Comey’s letter was released, it would be quickly seized upon by Clinton’s political opponents and become a major news story. But Richmond said he believes the director did what he needed to do, and was bound to leave people frustrated no matter what he decided. “I think he found himself in a difficult position, faced with the choice of having people continue to believe that the FBI had completed its inquiry and there were no further emails to review, or correcting that with all the obvious risks that it would be at a time that is sensitive,” Richman said. “Either action has a political valence, either you do not correct or you do correct. Either way, there will be people happy or unhappy.”"
52,POLITICS,Ex-KKK Leader David Duke Takes Part In The Most Surreal Debate Of 2016,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-duke-debate_us_581a9d33e4b01a82df64c149,"""I'm not opposed to all Jews,"" Duke said during the debate.",2016-11-03,Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke is running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581a9f22190000a502c30964.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― U.S. Senate hopefuls in Louisiana attacked fellow candidate, former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, in a heated ― and at times, utterly surreal — debate Wednesday at a historically black university in New Orleans. The debate showed just how far the political climate surrounding Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has shifted to embolden white nationalist rhetoric: It included a moderator question about Duke’s references to the “CNN Jews,” a Duke rant about Jewish people controlling banking, and a lengthy shouting match.Democrat Caroline Fayard, one of six leading candidates at the event, kicked it off by pointing to the elephant in the room — that Duke, an anti-Semite who qualified for the debate after receiving 5 percent of the vote in a statewide poll, was there at all. She said that schoolchildren had asked her if she was running against “a bad guy.” She told them, “Yes, there’s one, his name is David Duke.” At the debate, Fayard called Duke a “snake” that has “slithered out of the swamp,” and pleaded for voters to join her and “cut the head off of his hatred.” Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, another Democrat, later said, “I have nothing in common with [Duke] other than, we’re probably breathing.” The debate took place at Dillard University without an open public audience, because the debate’s sponsor, Raycom Media, opted not to have one. That meant the university’s mostly black student body was not permitted to attend. Protesters reportedly clashed with police outside of the building.Duke, who is extremely unlikely to win the race, has a long history of seeking public office in Louisiana. He served as a state representative starting in 1989 and later came surprisingly close to winning the governor’s seat. But he and other white nationalists have been emboldened by Trump’s rise to more aggressively court disgruntled white voters.At times, Duke’s language — which included attacking the Black Lives Matter movement — seemed to echo Trump’s. “I’m the bad guy because I defend the people of this country that made this country great,” he said at one point. Trump, whose campaign has repeatedly shared content from white nationalists on social media, failed in February to immediately denounce Duke’s support. He has since done so, and his campaign called a recent endorsement by the KKK’s newspaper “repulsive” and said “their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign.”This was no ordinary U.S. senate debate. At one point, Republican state Treasurer John Kennedy, who has led polls, referred to Duke’s felony conviction and listed what he claimed was Duke’s federal prison number. This led to a shouting match, in which Duke sought to defend himself by claiming he was “targeted by the government.” He also went after the media, which he said was biased against him. In perhaps the most bizarre moment of the debate, the moderator asked Duke why his website made repeated references to “CNN Jews.” Duke went on an anti-Semitic rant about how “there is a problem in America with a very strong, powerful tribal group that dominates our media and dominates our international banking.” He added, “I’m not opposed to all Jews.” The other Republicans running for the open U.S. Senate seat still saw a clear difference between Duke and Trump ― because they support the latter. Kennedy told Duke, “It must be terrible to wake up in the morning with that much hate in your heart.” "

But we Muggles have always had to settle for ordinary exercise...until now.Yoga teacher Isabel Beltran and her sister Ximena Larkin transfigured an ordinary Halloween yoga class in Texas into a magical Harry Potter-themed workout. And now that Harry Potter yoga is here, we don’t know if we can ever go back to regular old downward dog again.“At the end of September, Isabel and I were talking about a way to make the class more fun and interactive and boost attendance,” Larkin told The Huffington Post. “I was reflecting on Harry Potter because Halloween night is the night his parents died and I thought it would be interesting to do something around Harry Potter, Halloween and death. We’re Mexican and celebrate the Day of The Dead. It’s not morbid, but rather a celebration of life.”The sold-out Potter-inspired class took place on October 30th at Circle Brewing Co. in Austin, Texas. Harry Potter-loving Muggles gathered to attempt poses like the Downward Fluffy, Whomping Willow (or Tree Pose) and Slytherin Cobra. Naturally, Beltran and Larkin provided all the students with wands to cast Patronus charms.At the end of the class, Beltran read passages from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows while students lay under “invisibility cloaks” (aka yoga blankets) for a five-minute savasana. Grab us a Portkey, because we’ve been transported to heaven. If your Floo Powder malfunctioned and you missed Harry Potter yoga, never fear: Beltran will be hosting more themed classes in the future, and we’re guessing this idea may pop up elsewhere. “If themed yoga classes get more people moving and open to trying yoga, then it’s worth pursuing to share the magic of its health benefits,” Beltran said.Beltran is already planning a Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them-themed class in Austin on November 20th. You can buy your tickets here. We can’t wait to see what workouts these exercise wizards conjure up next. "
54,POLITICS,"This Dark Money Group Is Spending Big On Judicial Races, And No One Knows Why",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-money-judicial-races-center-for-individual-freedom_us_581b5234e4b0c43e6c1e740d,But the group has a history of fronting for big corporations.,2016-11-03,The Center for Individual Freedom is running ads to elect judges in three states.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581b539b150000b7005317e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just two weeks ago, the newspaper in Jackson, Mississippi, reported that the state Supreme Court contest between incumbent Justice Jim Kitchens and Court of Appeals Judge Kenny Griffis “hasn’t generated the nastiness of some prior high court races.” At the beginning of October, The Clarion-Ledger called the race a “low key” affair with “both candidates saying they like each other.” “I don’t know anything bad about him and if I did, I wouldn’t tell,” Kitchens told the paper. “This race is about two good guys.”That was all before the conservative Center for Individual Freedom started running an attack ad that accuses Kitchens of “siding with child predators.” The ad, which the Virginia-based nonprofit has spent at least $270,000 to air, slams Kitchens for his decisions in the case of “three monsters” who “repeatedly raped a 4-year-old girl” and another case involving a “man who pleaded guilty to beating a 2-year-old girl to death.” It ends by asking the viewer to call Kitchens and tell him to “stop siding with child predators.”“What had once been a congenial, collegial kind of activity has taken a turn towards the negative,” said Pam Johnson, communications director for the Kitchens campaign.The top judicial race in Mississippi this year is not the only one targeted by the Center for Individual Freedom. In Ohio, the group has produced ads touting Judge Pat Fischer for his tough-on-crime rulings. In Louisiana, it has run negative spots against Judge Jimmy Genovese, who is backed by trial lawyers, and in support of his opponent Judge Mary Castle, who is supported by business groups.The Louisiana ads tar Genovese for tossing out “a conviction of a repeat child molester” and overturning “a conviction of a man found guilty of attempted forcible rape.” The Center for Individual Freedom is the state’s top outside spender on political advertising this year.But the Center for Individual Freedom is likely not concerned with criminal justice policies or the harsh application of the law against criminal defendants ― despite all those ads.The group was founded in the late 1990s as a front for the tobacco industry, which was trying to avoid liability for its decades of lying about the dangers of smoking. Since then it has become a dark-money hit group for a range of corporate interests looking to hide their attempts to influence issues and elections.Two of the judges supported by the Center for Individual Freedom denied any knowledge of the group or why it got involved in their races.“Judge Castle was not aware of the Center for Individual Freedom until she saw an ad they were running, praising her record,” Marie Centanni, a spokeswoman for Castle’s campaign, said in a statement.Griffis told The Huffington Post, “When you say the name of the group, I don’t know who that is.” (And neither do most voters.)There is little available evidence to indicate why the Center for Individual Freedom seeks to influence these three judicial elections. The dark-money group does not disclose its donors. It did not respond to a request for comment. And it has not indicated a position on any relevant court cases in those states. All that leaves is speculation based on the group’s past behavior and associations.The Center for Individual Freedom has routinely run campaigns in conjunction with the DCI Group, a Republican-leaning corporate public relations and lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C. The DCI Group was also founded by strategists and lobbyists for the tobacco industry, and it has built a reputation as one of the most adept manipulators of public opinion in Washington.DCI has worked with Microsoft to fight a Justice Department case accusing it of antitrust violations, McDonald’s to counter the book and movie “Super Size Me,” AT&T and other communications companies to defeat net neutrality rules and discourage municipal broadband, Exxon Mobil to discredit climate change science, and the trucking industry to beat back driver safety regulations, among many, many other corporations and their trade groups.The Center for Individual Freedom just so happened to submit a comment to the Justice Department in support of Microsoft. The group attacked “Super Size Me.” It also submitted a huge number of comments to the Federal Communications Commission opposing net neutrality rules.More recently, the center has helped the DCI Group to promote the interests of billionaire hedge fund managers trying to salvage their investments in distressed Puerto Rican debt. The center ran millions of dollars’ worth of ads in opposition to congressional legislation aimed at helping the island avoid bankruptcy. The legislation, which passed, also prioritized the payment of other debts over those held by the hedge funders.Moreover, this isn’t the first time the Center for Individual Freedom has jumped into electoral politics. The group ran ads in judicial races in Alabama in 2008 and Michigan in 2014. Crossroads GPS, another dark-money group, gave millions to the Center for Individual Freedom and it spent millions to support Republican congressional candidates in 2012.The fact that the public doesn’t know why the Center for Individual Freedom has decided to parachute into the 2016 races is a problem.“The role of secret money leaves voters in the dark,” said Alicia Bannon, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice’s Democracy Program. “In judicial races, it’s part of the problem because it obscures the conflict of interest that could appear before the courts.”The Brennan Center is one of the leading advocates for ending judicial elections. As the Supreme Court has confirmed in rulings like Caperton v. Massey and Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar, the election of judges can lead to conflicts of interest, actual or perceived. Lawyers and corporations contribute to judicial candidates who may rule on cases they bring.Four years ago, a dark-money group in Montana helped elect a state Supreme Court justice. The Montana Growth Network received a whopping $400,000 from two billionaire landowners who were suing to overturn a law that permitted public access to waterways, including on their land.Indeed, since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, supposedly independent groups like the Center for Individual Freedom have spent increasing amounts on judicial races. The Brennan Center released a report this October showing that outside groups had already set a record with $14 million dropped on TV advertising in 2016 judicial contests.The Center for Individual Freedom isn’t the only outside group or the only side spending money on the Louisiana, Ohio and Mississippi races. In Louisiana, a political action committee called Restore Our Coast is supporting Genovese. The PAC is funded by attorneys for those who are suing oil companies for environmental damage. The Republican State Leadership Committee, a group that works to elect Republicans in state legislative and judicial elections, is spending big to support Fischer in Ohio. And in Mississippi, Griffis is backed the Mississippi Manufacturers Association and Mississippi Realtors.The involvement of dark-money groups like the Center for Individual Freedom, with their unclear agendas, has an additional pernicious effect. The common use of tough-on-crime rhetoric in their ads appears to affect how judges sentence criminal defendants.“There is a growing body of evidence that judges are more likely to sentence harshly in election years,” Bannon said. “As states see more television ads in races, judges are more likely to vote in favor of tough sentences for criminal defendants.”For the moment, the main concern in Mississippi is the bitter edge that the Center for Individual Freedom’s ads have suddenly injected into the race.“I don’t like them,” Griffis said of the spots attacking his opponent. “Nobody asked me if I wanted them.”“I spent too much time working on a campaign to bring my positive message to the voters of Central Mississippi,” he added.But Griffis did suggest that the questions raised about his rival’s record ― “that he’s voted to reverse a large number of criminal cases” ― were legitimate.“Our candidate Justice Kitchens and his opponent had agreed early on that they would conduct positive campaigns,” said Johnson. “And when this began, Justice Kitchens reached out to his opponent more than once and asked him to decry these ads and he refused to do it.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

55,POLITICS,Lucy Flores Was The Perfect Candidate For EMILY’s List — Until She Wasn’t,Emily Tate,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lucy-flores-endorsement-emilys-list_us_581baa36e4b0d9ce6fbad3d9,"After three consecutive endorsements, the abortion rights group abandoned Flores. Did it have something to do with Bernie Sanders?",2016-11-03,"Lucy Flores, a politician from Nevada, had earned the favor of the abortion rights group EMILY's List, until she chose to support Sen. Bernie Sanders' bid for the presidency over Hillary Clinton's.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581bb77e150000d804531a08.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lucy Flores took a risk in 2013 when she stood before the Nevada State Assembly and told the story of her abortion at age 16. But after Flores, an Assemblywoman at the time, divulged this private detail, her political career took off. She racked up interviews, airtime and endorsements, earning a reputation as the up-and-coming Latina abortion rights champion. That is, until 2016, when Flores endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, losing a key endorsement from EMILY’s List and, ultimately, her bid for Nevada’s 4th congressional district seat — all of which Flores discusses in a new interview for “The Woman Card,” a Fusion special examining the role of women in the 2016 election that premiers Thursday. “I don’t regret it,” Flores said of the abortion during a 2013 legislative hearing where Nevada lawmakers were considering a sex education bill. “I don’t regret it because I am here making a difference, at least in my mind, for many other young ladies and letting them know that there are options and they can do things to not be in the situation I was in.”Immediately, Flores was embraced by the abortion rights movement and considered a rising star in progressive politics. She seemed the embodiment of the strategy of EMILY’s List, a group whose express mission is to “ignite change by getting pro-choice Democratic women elected to office.” The EMILY’s List argument has always been that policy change can happen by electing people whose lived experiences give them insight into reproductive justice in a unique way. Electing a female president is the group’s holy grail, and they’ve long been ardent backers of Clinton. EMILY’s List endorsed Flores during her state assembly campaigns in 2010 and 2012, and again in 2014, when she sought the spot as Nevada’s lieutenant governor. The group called her an “inspiring community leader” who “has not shied away from sharing her personal experiences growing up in order to highlight the real impact that legislation can have on the lives of Nevadans.”But when Flores sought the Democratic nomination for Nevada’s 4th congressional district this year, EMILY’s List opted instead to endorse one of Flores’ primary opponents, philanthropist and multi-millionaire Susie Lee, who was not vocal about reproductive rights in her campaign, but whose personal wealth and network of rich friends gave her a leg up on fundraising.In an email obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, an EMILY’s List staffer said that Lee’s campaign resources tipped the balance in her favor.“Susie is clearly the strongest candidate in this race — she currently has over half a million dollars more in her campaign account than Lucy, who hasn’t built an operation capable of communicating with voters this time around,” the staffer, Lucinda Guinn, wrote in the email to a supporter. This move felt like a betrayal, Flores told Fusion. “It was heartbreaking,” she said.When someone from EMILY’s List called to warn her they’d be endorsing Lee, “I didn’t ask why,” Flores added. “I, frankly, I was so shocked that I didn’t even know what to say.”If viability was truly the top factor, rather than Flores’ opposition to Clinton in the high-stakes battle for Nevada, then EMILY’s List botched its political calculation.In June, Flores ultimately lost the primary election to male challenger Ruben Kihuen, who won 40 percent of the vote to Flores’ 26 percent. Lee, the candidate EMILY’s List claimed was the most likely to beat Kihuen, finished third, with just 21 percent. Could Flores have won if EMILY’s List hadn’t split off and endorsed the third-place finisher? It’s impossible to know, but in the interview for Fusion, Flores doesn’t blame EMILY’s List for her failed bid. She does, though, admit frustration with the group’s justification for going in another direction. Many of Flores’ supporters — and Sanders himself, in a fundraising email on her behalf — considered her endorsement a factor in the group’s decision.A spokesperson from EMILY’s List told The Huffington Post that Flores’ endorsement of Sanders did not play into their endorsement of Lee.“There is simply no merit to the claim that any of our decisions are based on who our candidates endorse — in fact, several [of] our candidates supported Bernie Sanders during the primary,” Rachel Thomas, a spokeswoman for EMILY’s List, said in a statement.Those candidates, though, did not have other Democratic abortion rights female opponents in the primary, as Flores did, according to a Fusion review. Of the Sanders supporters that EMILY’s List endorsed, they only faced male or non-Democratic challengers.Eight days before endorsing Lee, who is white, EMILY’s List announced an initiative to increase the number of Latinas elected to public office. Flores and other prominent Latinas, including Alida Garcia, did not appreciate the group’s hypocrisy. “We can’t let any organization get away with having one stated mission, but then [in] application having it be completely different,” Flores said. “I never played by the rules, and let’s be honest, that hurt me.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

He had initially been diagnosed with ALS in 2010.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581b78461600002e002c83c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former NFL running back Kevin Turner suffered from the most advanced stage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative disease linked to repeated brain trauma, when he died at age 46, researchers at Boston University announced Thursday.Turner, who played eight seasons with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, died in March of what was initially considered complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. But in a press conference Thursday, Dr. Ann McKee, the director of Boston University’s CTE Center, said Turner did not in fact have ALS. Rather, his advanced CTE was causing similar symptoms.“The severity of Mr. Turner’s CTE was extraordinary and unprecedented for an athlete who died in his 40s,” McKee said in a news release. Turner began playing football at the age of 5. Researchers who studied his brain believed the length of his career contributed to the development of the CTE. Research has shown that the length of a player’s career could be a key factor in the development of the disease later on.“We believe the extreme severity of Kevin Turner’s disease is related to his 25-season career, and the fact he began playing tackle football at age 5, while his brain was still rapidly developing and more vulnerable,” said Dr. Robert Cantu, a Boston University neurosurgeon.Turner was a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit that more than 4,500 former players brought against the NFL, claiming that it mishandled concussion treatment and withheld information about the long-term effects of the injuries from players. The league reached a settlement of the lawsuit in 2015, but some players have since appealed.Turner pledged to donate his brain to CTE research in 2010, when he was initially diagnosed as having ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. He believed football had contributed to the development of the neurological disease.“While learning the results has been devastating to Kevin’s family and those of us close to him, unfortunately, we cannot say we are surprised,” said Tamara Alan, the executive director of the Kevin Turner Foundation, which Turner founded in 2010 to raise awareness about ALS and brain trauma. “We will continue to honor Kevin’s wishes that we bring attention to this devastating disease.”More than 95 percent of the donated brains of former NFL players showed signs of CTE in a 2015 study conducted by Boston University and the Department of Veterans Affairs."

He attended the concert to celebrate his 16th birthday. “Shoutout to [Kanye West] & [Kim Kardashian] for showing 16th bday love last night to my client #CameronSterling, eldest son of #AltonSterling,” the Sterling family’s attorney, Justin Bamberg, captioned a photo posted to Twitter. Kardashian has largely retreated from public life in the weeks since she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, taking some “much-needed time off,” according to a note posted on her website. While she’s attended a handful of West’s shows, this appears to be the first new photo she’s posed for since the incident. In response to Sterling’s death ― as well as the killing of another black man, Philando Castile, by police the following day ― Kardashian penned a brief letter titled “#BlackLivesMatter” on her personal website to memorialize the men and reflect on raising a black son of her own.“This week we watched Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two innocent black men, get senselessly murdered by police officers,” Kardashian wrote in July. “Like a lot of you guys, I watched the videos, and was appalled and completely heartbroken. I was left speechless, angry and numb.”“I want my children to grow up knowing that their lives matter,” she continued. “I do not ever want to have to teach my son to be scared of the police, or tell him that he has to watch his back because the people we are told to trust ― the people who ‘protect and serve’ ― may not be protecting and serving him because of the color of his skin.”"

Several cities across the country saw record-high Halloween temperatures on Monday. Among them: New Orleans, Louisiana, (89 degrees), Dodge City, Kansas, (90 degrees), Asheville, North Carolina, (81 degrees), Hunstville, Alabama, (88 degrees), Tallahassee, Florida, (90 degrees), Fort Smith, Arkansas, (89 degrees) and Colorado Springs, Colorado, (80 degrees).Atlanta, Georgia, also set a new heat record at 86 degrees, a temperature nearly 20 degrees above average, WTVM.com reports. It was the latest day in the year that the city has ever been that warm.“These temperatures are more like Labor Day than Halloween,” Atlanta meteorologist Brian Monahan said over the weekend, reporting on wildfires consuming parts of Georgia because of the scorching heat.Atlanta’s 86-degree Monday marked the 12th time this year the city has either broken or tied a high temperature record, reported WTVM.com.Forecasters have warned that the first few days of November will not bring respite to sweltering states. On Tuesday, more heat records were broken as all-time November record highs were set in Austin, Texas (91 degrees), Birmingham, Alabama (88 degrees), Nashville, Tennessee (88 degrees), and Louisville, Kentucky (85 degrees), among several other cities. Weather.com said record-high temperatures can be expected in parts of the Southeast, Midwest and Great Plains at least through Friday, with daily highs of up to 20 degrees above average. Even parts of New England will see temperatures in the 70s this week, very unusual for this time of year.For the Southeast, where a crippling drought has already dried up rivers and devastated agriculture, the continuing dry and hot weather is expected to further exacerbate drought conditions. “The abnormal warmth contributes to more moisture evaporating out of the soil. When the moisture does not get replenished, it’s like a vicious cycle,” AccuWeather meteorologist Mike Doll said this week. Globally, 2016 is on track to be the hottest year on record.In October, NASA said 11 of the past 12 months had set new global high-temperature records."

The Justice Department filed a statement of interest in the lawsuit on Monday, saying that removing voters from the rolls en masse is a violation of the National Voter Registration Act.Biggs did not rule on the matter on Wednesday and did not say when she would make a decision.

But one park in Manchester, New Hampshire, has been decorated with hundreds of scarves, hats and mittens that were handmade by volunteers in the community.The annual giveaway, which started last year, was organized by Longmeadow Congregational Church in nearby Auburn, New Hampshire. Volunteers were asked to knit or crochet hats, scarves and mittens throughout the past year to help keep those in need warm during the winter. Last year, the group donated 75 items, but this year, more than 400 items were made. The group hung the scarves and other goods in Manchester’s Veteran’s Memorial Park. Longmeadow Congregational Church’s Reverend Ruth Gallot told local TV station WCVB that the group specifically places the items in the park and not in thrift stores because they realize some in need may not necessarily go into stores looking for items.Scarves are displayed with tags that read, “I was not forgotten here and neither are YOU! If you are stuck out in the cold, please take this scarf to keep yourself warm.”Gallot told local TV station WMUR that her church was looking for ways to engage people in more ways than giving financial donations. She hopes the program will expand to churches around the country.Those interested in participating can do anything from donating old yarn to knitting or crocheting some items."

I don’t think it was an endorsement of a particular view that has been floated out there,” Malcolm said, in reference to related suggestions by the likes of Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).Curiously, a Heritage spokeswoman indicated in an email that the fundraising page went live on Oct. 17. That’s the same day McCain became the first Senate Republican to declare that he and his colleagues would be “united against any Supreme Court nominee” put forth by Clinton.It’s in response to these veiled threats that Clinton running mate Tim Kaine said in a recent interview with The Huffington Post that Democrats would seek to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees if they regain control of the Senate.The Heritage plan, as outlined in the fundraising letter, seems to account for even that scenario.“In fact, according to a new Heritage analysis of the Constitution and Senate procedure, it doesn’t require any more than a small number of principled conservatives to hold the line,” reads the missive. “We can use procedural strategies to block a nominee and even prevent the use of the ‘nuclear option’ to force through a nominee by majority vote.”Malcolm, who recently interviewed Justice Clarence Thomas at a Heritage event commemorating Thomas’ 25 years of service, said the direction of the high court is simply something he and his nonprofit deeply care about.“There’s a clear recognition by politicians ― and also by policy think tanks ― on how important the Supreme Court is,” he said.As for Thomas, who knows a thing or two about contentious confirmation battles, he may have offered the most sobering analysis yet of the politicization of the bench he occupies.“At some point,” he said during his conversation with Malcolm last week, “we have got to recognize that we’re destroying our institutions and we’re undermining our institutions. And we’re going to destroy them. The day is going to come, if it’s not already here, that we’ll need the institutions and the integrity of the institutions.”This article has been updated with information about when the Heritage fundraising page went online."

Still, when Rivera was invited to headline her first concert at New York’s Carnegie Hall, she had no interest in making the Nov. 7 performance, simply titled “Chita: Nowadays,” a trip down memory lane.“The show’s not about yesterday. It’s not about tomorrow,” Rivera, 83, told The Huffington Post. “It’s about now.”Fans of Rivera’s classic material needn’t fret, as the set list for “Chita: Nowadays” will draw once again draw from that catalog. This time, however, she’s invited a bevy of special guests, including Alan Cumming, Tony nominee Andy Karl, “Hamilton” star Javier Muñoz and Bruce Springsteen’s guitarist, Stevie Van Zandt, to give songs like “All That Jazz” and “America” a fresh shine. One personal highlight, Rivera said, will be a performance of the “West Side Story” ballad, “Somewhere,” with the New York City Gay Men’s Chorus. With its all-inclusive message, the song will serve as a tribute to victims of recent tragedies, including the June 12 mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub, she said. “I’ve been wanting to work with them for a long time, and just talking about it moves me – to have them in my show,” she said. “At this time in our lives, after the horrible things that have been happening in Florida and all around, we need reminders.

64,POLITICS,Radio Host Hugh Hewitt 'Inclined' To Vote For Donald Trump After Urging Him To Drop Out,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hugh-hewitt-donald-trump-vote_us_581a523be4b08f9841ad069b,"Come on, man!",2016-11-02,"Radio host Hugh Hewitt disavowed GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in early October. Now, he seems to be jumping back on the Trump bandwagon.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581a61361600002f002c80ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In another sign that Donald Trump’s standing among Republicans appears to be improving, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said he was “inclined” to vote for the GOP nominee on Wednesday ― less than a month after calling on Trump to withdraw from the race.“I wait on events. I’ve been surprised so much in this race,” Hewitt said during an interview with MSNBC. “I don’t have to cast my absentee [ballot] for another four or five days. I’m inclined to cast my vote for Donald Trump, but I have to wait and see what happens in this.”Last month, after Trump was heard boasting about sexually predatory behavior in a 2005 conversation with former “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush, Hewitt joined a chorus of Republicans calling on the real estate mogul to drop out of the race “for the benefit of the country, the party and his family.”So what changed for Hewitt? Trump’s poll numbers ability to stay on message, of course.“I like the way he has run the campaign in the last few weeks, I think it’s been much more disciplined,” the radio host told MSNBC. “He gave a great speech on Obamacare yesterday. He promised a special session to repeal it.”Hewitt initially opposed Trump in the GOP primary, associating himself with the #NeverTrump movement. But he later endorsed Trump after he clinched the Republican presidential nomination over the summer, citing the prospect of Hillary Clinton-appointed Supreme Court justices. Hewitt later explained his revised stance by citing the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s private e-mail server and noted, “Facts change.”Hewitt isn’t alone in his waffling. A number of Republicans tied themselves in knots over Trump’s candidacy in the wake of the “Access Hollywood” tape revelations. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the first congressman who unendorsed Trump because he couldn’t look his 15-year-old daughter in the eye, appeared on several television networks pronouncing his disgust with the lewd comments. Recently, Chaffetz announced he would be voting for Trump after all.Other politicians who re-endorsed Trump include Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) and Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.).Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

We’re proud to name that rock star, Bono, our first Man of the Year,” it said.Bono, 56, in 2015 created the Poverty Is Sexist campaign that is aimed at helping the world’s poorest women through better access to education, health services and business opportunities.The campaign is part of the ONE organization he helped found in 2004 to fight poverty and disease in Africa.Bono thanked Glamour for the award, saying in a statement that the “battle for gender equality can’t be won unless men lead it along with women. We’re largely responsible for the problem, so we have to be involved in the solutions.”“We can do much more than we think we can. Leaders are accountable to all of us. If they don’t support women and girls, vote them out of office,” he added.Glamour’s Women of the Year are U.S. singer Gwen Stefani, American Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, the three founders of Black Lives Matter, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, American pop star Zendaya, Italian designer Miuccia Prada, Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad and plus-size model Ashley Graham.They will be celebrated at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Nov. 14."

Black and Brown People Vote, a non-profit organization that promotes civic engagement, teamed up with the Haas Institute to create a compelling 90-second PSA titled #Vote4BlackFutures that highlights the important role voting plays on the state of black lives in America. “Millions of people are standing in long lines right now, despite not having quality healthcare,” Ifeoma Ike, the co-founder of BBPV, told The Huffington Post. “Many will take multiple modes of inadequate transportation just to cast a ballot. Some may have to boil water for their babies to drink before heading to the polls. So we don’t want our people to vote red, or blue, or green. We want them to vote towards a vision still being built. We want them to #Vote4BlackFutures.”In the video, poets Kyland Turner and Walter Finnie deliver a spoken word poem that captures what black people in America had to go through to secure the right to vote. “No more chains on our freedom, no more locks on our mind,” they recite throughout the clip.Ike explained that the video wasn’t designed to highlight any of the candidates. Rather, she said it was created to highlight the “issues that still impact our very existence and survival.”“I am less concerned about who my community votes for, and more concerned that they have the tools to make a decision on November 8th and beyond,” Ike said. “We want our people to know that their struggles are not ignored and their concerns about our local and national politics are valid,” she added. “We want to encourage people to see the connection between their lives and the ballot.”"
67,POLITICS,Alabama's Republican Secretary Of State Calls Voting A 'Privilege',Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-merrill-alabama_us_581a4760e4b0c43e6c1dbadd,Apparently automatically giving people their constitutional rights would also be offensive to civil rights leaders.,2016-11-02,"John Merrill, Alabama's secretary of state, made remarks about voting that seem to conflict with the Constitution.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581a4817190000a304c30870.jpeg?cache=uS9xwx60nN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) said in a recent interview that prospective voters should have to earn the “privilege” to cast a ballot by making an effort to get registered.Filmmaker Brian Jenkins asks Merrill why he opposes automatic voter registration in his forthcoming voting rights documentary, according to a teaser clip posted Wednesday. The secretary of state responds by describing voting in terms that appear to be in conflict with the U.S. Constitution’s language guaranteeing citizens the right to vote.“If you’re too sorry or lazy to get up off of your rear and to go register to vote, or to register electronically, and then to go vote, then you don’t deserve that privilege,” Merrill said.In recent years, a number of states have passed laws to automatically enroll eligible voters when they give information to agencies like the Department of Motor Vehicles. Supporters see this system as a cost-effective way to increase access to the polls and improve the accuracy and security of elections.But Merrill said he didn’t want to see such a simple form of voter registration in Alabama. As a justification, he said it would somehow offend heroes of the civil rights movement ― people like Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who has himself supported federal legislation to implement automatic voter registration nationwide.“These people fought ― some of them were beaten, some of them were killed ― because of their desire to ensure that everybody that wanted to had the right to register to vote and participate in the process,” Merrill said. “I’m not going to cheapen the work that they did. I’m not going to embarrass them by allowing somebody that’s too sorry to get up off of their rear end to go register to vote ― or now, because of what we’ve done, turn the computer on and register to vote ― because they think they deserve the right because they’ve turned 18.”A spokesperson for Lewis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Alabama recently modernized its voter registration system, becoming the 32nd state to allow residents to register online. That additional option leaves people without any excuse not to get registered, Merrill suggested.“As long as I’m secretary of state of Alabama, you’re going to have to show some initiative to become a registered voter in this state,” he said.Merrill has been one of the strongest proponents of Alabama’s controversial voter ID law, despite an apparent lack of evidence of in-person voter fraud. The measure, which went into effect in 2013, has already disenfranchised hundreds of otherwise eligible voters who could not produce valid photo identification."

As of Wednesday afternoon, there was no clear motive for the ruthless crime.Urbandale resident Russell Cheatem said he heard the initial gunshots around 1 a.m., according to The Des Moines Register. Outside his home, he found Martin’s vehicle, riddled with 15 to 30 bullet holes.“I pulled the door open and realized there was nothing I could do for him,” he told the paper.He heard more gunfire minutes later, thought to be the shots that killed Beminio about 2 miles away. Beminio was shot at about 1:26 a.m., according to police. He was transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died.Hours before the shootings, Greene was slapped with a court order to leave his mother’s house after she accused him of emotional and physical abuse, according to The New York Times. It remained unclear if the court order and the shootings were connected.At a press conference on Wednesday, Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek labeled the suspect a “coward” and called the shootings an ambush.“Doesn’t look like there was any interaction between these officers and the coward who shot them as they sat in their cars,” he said.

He was smart and had great social skills. He just had it all.” Martin and Beminio both attended the school.Beminio had three children, according to his cousin Jason Sweeney.“Married and from all accounts a great police officer,” he told HuffPost via Twitter. “We didn’t see each other nearly enough but when we did it was always as if time hadn’t passed. He was such a good guy.”Working for the police force was “in his blood,” Sweeney added. Beminio’s father is a retired sheriff, one uncle a former state trooper and another uncle a former police officer.Beminio was a star football player and wrestler in high school, according to The Associated Press. In a YouTube video uploaded on Oct. 16 by a person calling himself Scott Greene, a man can be seen arguing with Urbandale police officers outside a high school football game, The Des Moines Register reports.“I’ve asked you multiple times to leave this property,” an officer can be heard telling the man.“I was assaulted in the stands,” the man replies.Replying in a comment to his own video, Greene said he was “offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem.

However this is not about Armed forces, they are cop haters.” A separate YouTube video uploaded on Oct. 21 shows what appears to be Greene holding a Confederate flag in the stands of the high school football game he was later told to leave.

Before the suspect was identified, Parizek alluded to the tensions between law enforcement and communities of color after several high-profile shootings of unarmed black men. “There is a clear and present danger to police officers right now,” Parizek said, visibly shaken. “We’re very well aware of the society that we’re living in right now ... and that there are some not so positive views of law enforcement that a segment of our population holds.”Urbandale schools are closed for the day over safety concerns.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine and former President Bill Clinton have canceled a get-out-the-vote event scheduled to take place in Des Moines on Wednesday night because of the shooting.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton both reacted to the tragic shootings on Twitter.President Obama also released a statement expressing his condolences.“All across the country, our police officers go to work each day not knowing whether they’ll come home tonight,” Obama said in the statement. “Their families live each day with the same fears. So as Americans, we owe them our respect and gratitude for their efforts to safeguard our families and our communities. And so as we once again mourn American police officers lost in the line of duty, we must also renew the call to match that same sense of service, that same devotion within our own lives and our own communities.” In July, five police officers in Dallas, Texas, were killed in similar ambush-style attacks.

Paul Parizek labeled the suspect a “coward” and called the shootings an ambush.“Doesn’t look like there was any interaction between these officers and the coward who shot them as they sat in their cars,” he said. Martin, who graduated from the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy in January, had been working for the department for a little over a year.He leaves behind his mother and father, both of whom work in the local education system, friends told The Huffington Post.“He was just an all-around great guy,” said Martin’s high school pal Kole Dudley, 23. “He was never afraid of hard work. He was always a lead-by-example type of person. Christian by the very definition.” “He was a kind, gentle, compassionate man who was always concerned with serving the public,” Fred Jones, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at Simpson College, said of Martin in a statement. “That’s why he went into police work. He was smart and had great social skills. He just had it all.” Martin and Beminio both attended the school.Beminio had three children, according to his cousin Jason Sweeney.“Married and from all accounts a great police officer,” he told HuffPost via Twitter. “We didn’t see each other nearly enough but when we did it was always as if time hadn’t passed. He was such a good guy.”Working for the police force was “in his blood,” Sweeney added. Beminio’s father is a retired sheriff, one uncle a former state trooper and another uncle a former police officer.Beminio was a star football player and wrestler in high school, according to The Associated Press. In a YouTube video uploaded on Oct. 16 by a person calling himself Scott Greene, a man can be seen arguing with Urbandale police officers outside a high school football game, The Des Moines Register reports.“I’ve asked you multiple times to leave this property,” an officer can be heard telling the man.“I was assaulted in the stands,” the man replies.Replying in a comment to his own video, Greene said he was “offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about Armed forces, they are cop haters.” A separate YouTube video uploaded on Oct. 21 shows what appears to be Greene holding a Confederate flag in the stands of the high school football game he was later told to leave. Greene has been accused of domestic assault and harassment in the past, according to Iowa court records. Before the suspect was identified, Parizek alluded to the tensions between law enforcement and communities of color after several high-profile shootings of unarmed black men. “There is a clear and present danger to police officers right now,” Parizek said, visibly shaken. “We’re very well aware of the society that we’re living in right now ... and that there are some not so positive views of law enforcement that a segment of our population holds.”Urbandale schools are closed for the day over safety concerns.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine and former President Bill Clinton have canceled a get-out-the-vote event scheduled to take place in Des Moines on Wednesday night because of the shooting.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton both reacted to the tragic shootings on Twitter.President Obama also released a statement expressing his condolences.“All across the country, our police officers go to work each day not knowing whether they’ll come home tonight,” Obama said in the statement. “Their families live each day with the same fears. So as Americans, we owe them our respect and gratitude for their efforts to safeguard our families and our communities. And so as we once again mourn American police officers lost in the line of duty, we must also renew the call to match that same sense of service, that same devotion within our own lives and our own communities.” In July, five police officers in Dallas, Texas, were killed in similar ambush-style attacks. The gunman wounded seven other officers and two civilians.Those shootings came just hours after Minnesota man Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop.This article has been updated throughout as more information has become available. Clarification: The sequence of events has been amended to reflect that Castile was shot prior to the shooting of police officers in Dallas. This article previously suggested that Castile’s death shortly preceded Wednesday’s shooting in Iowa."

Thailand reported the region’s first confirmed case of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size, linked to Zika in late September.On Sunday, Vietnam’s health ministry reported its first microcephaly case that it said was likely linked to Zika.The ministry said 14 more cases of Zika were reported since Sunday, most in the south of the country. Seventeen of Vietnam’s 23 cases have been in the south’s Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s biggest city.Health officials were not immediately available for comment on the surge in cases.Vietnam last month raised the threat level for Zika and stepped up monitoring of pregnant women.Zika infections in pregnant women have been shown to cause microcephaly - a severe birth defect in which the head and brain are undersized - as well as other brain abnormalities.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last year in Brazil, which has since confirmed more than 1,900 cases of microcephaly.In adults, Zika infections have also been linked to a rare neurological syndrome known as Guillain-Barre, as well as other neurological disorders.There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika, which is a close cousin of dengue and chikungunya and causes mild fever, rash and red eyes.An estimated 80 percent of people infected have no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected.(Reporting by My Pham; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel)"

The only question on our minds was: What happens to that massive $10 million engagement ring on Carey’s finger? Well, our question may have been answered. According to Entertainment Tonight, the “Obsessed” singer plans on keeping the bling. A source told the outlet the two are “currently in discussions” on how they’ll move on from their split, but Carey “is keeping the ring.” Of course she wants to keep it. Just look at it: The songstress was spotted wearing the 35-carat diamond sparkler on Sunday while bringing her kids out for food at Jessica Biel’s Au Fudge restaurant, though she had notably worn the ring on her right hand instead of the left. She was also seen without the ring on Saturday while hanging out with friends at Catch LA, ET reports. There have been plenty of cheating rumors surrounding the couple’s split, but in a statement released to ET last week, Carey’s rep said: Mariah and James had a fight in Greece, and have not seen each other since. The fight was not because of any cheating allegations or excessive spending by Mariah. James is one of the most successful businessmen in the world. They are trying to work it out. Right now, they’re not sure if they will stay together. They are discussing it, and plan to release an official statement together about their future.The Huffington Post has reached out to reps for Carey regarding the ring and will update this post accordingly.

New mom and college senior, Sarah Thompson, posted a photo on Facebook that she took during her math class at Lander University. The photo shows a professor, Dr. Josie Ryan, holding Thompson’s newborn son, Isaiah, during a lecture.In the caption, Thompson wrote that her professor is “amazing.” The mom started Ryan’s real analysis class a week before giving birth to her son and returned just one week after.“She knew I’d be overwhelmed so literally begged me to bring Isaiah to class and even showed me where the breastfeeding room in the health center was at Lander University,” said Thompson. “It’s so reassuring to know there are professors out there like this. Not only is she an amazing person, she’s also one of the best math professors I’ve ever had. Brilliant, really.”The new mom explained that she took the photo during the first class Isaiah attended, at just 3 weeks old. “She taught like this ― holding him ― the whole first class I brought him too,” Thompson wrote. Since then, she’s brought her baby back several times and said he’s been “an angel” so far.“He’ll cut the cheese and make the class giggle from time to time, but we still get down to some serious math in there,” she wrote. “I am in a perfect world when I am learning math in college with my baby right next to me ... or in my teacher’s arms.”Because Isaiah’s father, Chris, is also in school and working, both parents are grateful for the support of their families and educators like Ryan. “[T]he world needs more of these teachers!” Thompson wrote. “Hopefully this post will encourage other educators or moms or pregnant/working women who are students to ask for help.”Thompson’s post received over 6,000 likes and appeared on the popular Facebook page, Love What Matters, where it reached over 130,000 likes. Thompson told The Huffington Post she decided to share the photo to inspire other young moms. “When I was pregnant I had a couple of supportive professors but one or two that were not understanding at all, and it really did increase my level of anxiety and hopelessness about my college career,” she said.“So, I just figured if there were any other women out there with similar circumstances, that I wanted to show them that sometimes all you have to do is be humble and ask for help and tell them your situation,” she added.The new mom also wanted other professors to see how much they can impact their students’ lives. Thompson noted that she’s dealt with a lot of personal issues in college ― from losing loved ones to developing medical problems to experiencing sexual assault ― and found many professors and advisors were very discouraging. “You never know what students are dealing with,” she said. Thompson said Ryan is “amazed” at the wide reach of the post. “We’re both a little overwhelmed at the attention, but happy to make positive news,” she said. “My class is shocked and happy because they know how awesome Dr. Ryan is and how she SO deserves all of the praise and attention.”Expressing her gratitude to her classmates, the mom told HuffPost that she always tells them to let her know if Isaiah ― who’s now about 2 months old ― is a distraction, but fortunately he’s always been very well-behaved in class.In fact, when the baby isn’t at a lecture, Thompson’s classmates often ask her where he is. “Everyone in my class (almost all men) can’t wait to see Isaiah when I bring him to class!”Thompson said she’s grateful to have multiple friends who are also new moms attending college. “We help each other out when we need love and advice from someone with our same perspective,” she said. The mom also credits her family and Christian faith for helping her through the challenges of parenting while attending school.Ultimately, Thompson is happy her story can shine a light on her amazing professor, who helped her feel so supported as a mom in her mostly male-dominated STEM classes. “Everyone who’s ever met Dr. Ryan knows how brilliant, funny, quirky, silly, and caring she is,” she said. “She told the people in class to help me if they can, before I even met them.”Support is everything!

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581a3908170000c3045bb44e.jpeg?cache=3Ld6e2lTYw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested on Wednesday that FBI Director James Comey may need to leave his post after his controversial decision to announce, 11 days before the election, that his agency was reviewing more emails potentially related to its investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “Maybe he’s not in the right job,” Pelosi told CNN’s Jamie Gangel. “I think that we have to just get through this election and just see what the casualties are along the way.”Pelosi did not say specifically that Comey, who is a Republican, should resign or lose his position, but left the possibility open, according to CNN. On Friday, Comey wrote to members of Congress to say the FBI was reviewing emails that could be related to its investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information while using a private email server while secretary of state. He received heavy criticism for doing so from both Democrats and Republicans. It’s unusual for the FBI or Department of Justice to make announcements close to elections, since they have the possibility to influence the result. Comey’s letter was vague and the FBI has released little information since. It’s unknown whether the emails are new or are duplicates of emails the agency already reviewed. In July, Comey said the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton based on its investigation up to that point. That decision made him the target of Republican ire and garnered praise from Clinton ― and from Pelosi. “This is a great man,” Pelosi said in July. “We are very privileged in our country to have him be the Director of the FBI.”On Friday, she issued a statement calling for the FBI to provide more information, “rather than allowing Republicans to stoke innuendo and falsehoods 11 days away from a presidential election.” She told CNN on Wednesday that Comey made a “mistake” and may have a “double standard.” Earlier this year, the FBI and DOJ decided against making announcements about investigations related to Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.President Barack Obama weighed in on the matter on Wednesday, although he said he was making “very deliberate effort” to make sure that it doesn’t look like he was “meddling” in the FBI investigation. “Setting aside the particulars of this case, I know that [Hillary Clinton] is somebody who has always looked out for the interests of America and the American people first, and I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don’t operate on innuendo, we don’t operate on incomplete information, we don’t operate on leaks, we operate based on concrete decisions that are made,” Obama told NowThis News. The FBI is currently going through the emails, which agents uncovered while investigating former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

The goal was set for $10,000 but within days, more than $230,000 was raised. The attack on the historically black church happened overnight and the criminals have not yet been caught. The FBI reportedly said they are aware of the situation and are currently investigating the case to “determine if any civil rights crimes were committed.”“The animus of this election cycle combined with the potent racial history of burning black churches as a political symbol makes this event something we must not ignore,” the Go Fund Me page reads. “Can we do this?” the description pleads. “Can we help show the world, the country, and most importantly, the churchgoers of Hopewell Baptist that we, as a society, are better than this?”Indeed, Americans everywhere came together to help. After all, love always wins. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Ooh-rah!”,2016-11-02,"A member of the III% Security Force militia conducts shooting practice during a field training exercise in Jackson, Georgia, U.S. October 29, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5819ea2b190000a502c3066f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Down a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training ― and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.“How many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!” asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name “Bloodagent.”“Ooh-rah!” shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend.As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton.They say they won’t fire the first shot, but they’re not planning to leave their guns at home, either.Trump’s populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul’s promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be “rigged,” and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraudArmed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizer’s 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people.Their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008.In recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon.Many fear Clinton would push the county further to the left.“This is the last chance to save America from ruin,” Hill said. “I’m surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.” EXTREMIST GROUPS EMBOLDENEDThe Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud.An hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member’s high-powered rifle knocked down a tree.The group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain.Amid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins.He said he doesn’t want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said.“I will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,” said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago.Trump’s candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center.“Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,” he said. “Now these ideas are legitimized.”Over the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence.“If Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket,” former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clinton’s death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday.Back in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come.“We’ve building up for this, just like the Marines,” he said. “We are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.”(Editing by Stuart Grudgings)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

On Tuesday, during a Facebook Live chat with Entertainment Tonight, series stars Shiri Appleby and Constance Zimmer revealed that “Everlasting,” the “Bachelor”-like show within a show on the Lifetime series, will feature its first female suitor in Season 3. The change-up comes after the show featured a black suitor, beating the real “Bachelor” franchise to the punch. The pair teased a few false plot lines during a game of Two Truths and A Lie before making the official announcement. “You won’t only have two strong female leads, but we’re going to add a third one,” Zimmer said excitedly, later joking to her co-star, “I wonder how many of the 25 men you [will] get together with and Quinn will get together with.” After the interview, Appleby spoke to ET one-on-one about the new plot, saying, “We’re so excited and looking forward to it. I think it will be great to add another strong female to the mix, someone to really battle with Quinn and Rachel.” The actress added that she thinks “it will shake up the show and make everything feel really fresh.”News of a female suitor may not come as a total shock to serious fans of the show, as its creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro hinted at the idea earlier this year. “We’ve thought about [a female suitor] a lot,” Shapiro told Decider in June. She echoed a similar sentiment during an August interview with ET. No word yet on who the suitor ― or “suitress” ― will be, but some outlets are seemingly petitioning for Season 1’s Grace (Nathalie Kelley) to make her comeback. We’re here for that.Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait until “UnREAL” returns in 2017 to find out. "
