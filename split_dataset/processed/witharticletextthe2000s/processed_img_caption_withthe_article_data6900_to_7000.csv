His attorney says it's not clear what kind of relationship he'll have with his son, who he conceived with a 12-year-old girl when he was 18.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db704a200000654d085ca5.jpeg?cache=OB2MMoSrgl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Michigan woman who was just 12 years old when she says an 18-year-old held her captive for days and raped her now faces the prospect of sharing joint custody with her attacker, according to the victim’s lawyer.The decision by a Michigan judge last week comes nine years after the boy’s mother was impregnated by Christopher Mirasolo, now 27, the Detroit News reported.It wasn’t until recently that Sanilac County Circuit Judge Gregory S. Ross ordered a paternity test for the now-21-year-old woman’s child after she applied for state aid, lawyer Rebecca Kiessling, who is representing the woman, said in a press release on Saturday.After Mirasolo was identified as the father, the judge ordered that his name be added to the birth certificate and the woman’s address be disclosed to the father, who was also awarded parenting time, Kiessling said.Kiessling, whose client is not being identified because she is the victim of a sex crime, called the judge’s decision “insane.”“Nothing has been right about this [case] since it was originally investigated,” she told the Detroit News. “He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child herself when this all happened.”Kiessling said her client is seeking protection from Mirasolo under the federal Rape Survivor Child Custody Act. The law provides grants to states that offer women who conceive a child through rape the option to terminate the rapist’s parental rights if there is “clear and convincing evidence” of the crime.“This case is believed to be the first case of its kind in Michigan, and perhaps in the U.S., in which a rape victim will seek protection under the new Rape Survivor Child Custody Act and proves why a rape conviction should not be required,” Kiessling said in her press release.The child’s mother, who spoke out against the judge’s ruling to the NBC television affiliate Click on Detroit, said she hopes her son has nothing to do with Mirasolo.The boy “was conceived out of rape, but I don’t look at that. He’s my child. He’s a part of me. Not a part of him,” she told the station. “I hope [Mirasolo] never has any rights to him at all.”Attorney Barbara Yockey, who represents Mirasolo, told HuffPost on Monday that he was only following court orders to take a DNA test and also provide income information to pay child support to the mother, which she said he is doing. “He did not in any way pursue this,” she said by email. “This matter is in the process of being resolved by private agreement.”Yockey, who confirmed to HuffPost that her client had pleaded guilty to attempted third-degree criminal sexual conduct in the case ― which she referred to as statutory rape ― previously told the Detroit News that it’s unclear what kind of relationship her client will have with the woman’s child, if any.Kiessling said that in September 2008, her client slipped out of her house with her 13-year-old sister and a friend to meet up with a boy and his older friend, identified as Mirasolo.During that visit, Mirasolo allegedly suggested they “go for a ride.” He ended up holding the girls captive for two days in a vacant house. When they were finally released, under a threat that if they told anyone what happened he’d kill them, the youngest sister was pregnant. A month after that discovery was made, Mirasolo was arrested, Kiessling said.He took a plea deal for attempted third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and was sentenced to one year in a county jail. He ended up serving just six-and-a-half months.Kiessling said that because Mirasolo’s crime involved a victim under the age of 13, he should have been charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct and faced between 25 years to life behind bars. According to online records for Michigan’s Department of Corrections, just four months after Mirasolo’s early discharge, he committed a second offense ― again for criminal sexual conduct, this time involving someone between the ages of 13 to 15.He was sentenced to a minimum of five years for that crime, but was released after four years, Kiessling said.He’s been on parole since July of 2016, records show. According to the conditions of his release, he is a registered sex offender who’s not permitted to have contact with a child 17 years old or younger without the presence of a responsible adult. He also cannot come within 1,000-feet of a school or child care center without approval, or own a computer or device that’s capable of connecting to the Internet.The next court hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 25.A “victims rights rally” to protest the judge’s decision is being planned outside the courthouse at that time, according to a Facebook event page.Requests for comment from the judge, state prosecutors and Kiessling were not immediately returned. This story has been updated to include comment from Mirasolo’s attorney."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,How Harvey Weinstein Put The Media In A Headlock,Maxwell Strachan and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvey-weinstein-media_us_59d7b846e4b0f6eed35011fc,"""They buy journalists, they threaten journalists, they do whatever they have to.""",2017-10-09,"Harvey Weinstein has had a long, strange relationship with the media. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d7b9ca2d00009c17309052.jpeg?cache=QbYKg8KRd0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was the night before the 2000 presidential election, and Harvey Weinstein had a journalist in a headlock. The reporter, Andrew Goldman of the New York Observer, had walked up to Weinstein at the Tribeca Grand after the mogul had started to berate Goldman’s colleague Rebecca Traister, whom Goldman was dating at the time. They were at a party for former MTV VJ Karen Duffy’s book Model Patient: My Life as an Incurable Wise-Ass, about her recovery from a disease related to her central nervous system. Weinstein was hosting the party, according to Traister, and she had had the temerity to ask him about a film Miramax had shelved. Weinstein didn’t like the question. “I recall that he called me a cunt and declared that he was glad he was the ‘fucking sheriff of this fucking lawless piece-of-shit town,’” Traister wrote in a story for New York magazine’s The Cut. It was around this point that Goldman intervened, which is how he wound up with his head in Harvey Weinstein’s arms.The encounter took place in public, in front of other media, Goldman told HuffPost. But we know what happened that night only because Traister described the fight in a piece published on Thursday, nearly 17 years after the fact, and only hours after The New York Times released an investigation into Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct over multiple decades. In the wake of the Times story, many in the entertainment industry asked why one of Hollywood’s most open of “open secrets” had taken so long to come out. The answer is that in ways both figurative and vividly literal, Weinstein had the media in a headlock.The tactics the Weinstein apparatus allegedly employed are wide-ranging. “Harvey could spin — or suppress — anything; there were so many journalists on his payroll,” Traister wrote, “working as consultants on movie projects, or as screenwriters, or for his magazine.” “They buy journalists, they threaten journalists, they do whatever they have to,” a veteran entertainment reporter told HuffPost of the Weinstein team. The apparatus surrounding Weinstein could be relentless. The veteran reporter said that his news outlet would try to hide reporters’ names from the Weinstein team while they worked on stories about him, out of fear that Weinstein would interfere with ongoing investigations.Journalists have whispered about lucrative book deals or other paid gigs offered to their peers in what some saw as quid pro quo deals to secure future positive press. Occasionally there were more than whispers. “Where’s my script?” Weinstein reportedly once yelled at a Page Six reporter during a party.Just as he could help careers, Weinstein could hurt them too. He became such a powerful force in New York social circles that he could not only get entertainment journalists banned from his parties and screenings, but from other major events as well, according to a veteran Hollywood insider.Weinstein was able to apply pressure on the media from different directions. When Sharon Waxman was working on a story about Weinstein’s bad behavior for The New York Times in 2004, both Matt Damon and Russell Crowe called her about the story. Later, editors “gutted” it, in her words. Producer Scott Rudin once admitted to journalist Nikki Finke that Weinstein’s people had asked him to “protect Harvey” and “lie to Page Six.” Finke herself says Weinstein once ordered her into a “windowless room” and personally berated her for 90 minutes. Weinstein’s lawyer, agent and company didn’t respond to requests for comment.Last year, Benjamin Wallace began investigating the allegations around Weinstein for New York magazine. He told HuffPost that after he started making reporting calls in earnest, he soon got the full Weinstein armada of alpha lawyers and flacks ― including high-powered attorney David Boies ― pressuring the magazine to stand down. Wallace refuted this past weekend’s New York Post story, which claimed that he and his editors had caved to pressure from Weinstein. Wallace said that in fact the pushback did little to deter his reporting. He stayed on the story for three months before deciding he didn’t have enough to publish an expose, and the story was put aside.“I tried hard to report the story,” Wallace said. New York magazine Editor-in-Chief Adam Moss “was staunchly supportive of pursuing it,” Wallace said. “Harvey Weinstein didn’t shut down the story. We would have been thrilled to publish it.”New York magazine had investigated Weinstein’s alleged assaults years earlier, in the ’90s. But Weinstein made things difficult. “The pressure is relentless ― personal calling combined with relentless threats of legal action by his lawyers,” recalled TV producer Michael Hirschorn, who was then an editor at New York. “And also promises of other access. This was at a time when that kind of thing mattered.”In a Facebook post, Hirschorn elaborated further about the ’90s investigation and another he was familiar with. “Both the investigations decided not to print the most problematic materials after extraordinary pressure campaigns by Weinstein and a cadre of top-shelf lawyers against both the publication and the women involved,” he wrote. “Weinstein also went to the owners of the publications with a similar carrot and stick maneuver. Ultimately, the women in question stood down and/or the owners kiboshed our investigation. Or the lawyers assessed the risk-reward equation and advised against publication.”This was the approach for stories of all sizes, according to the veteran entertainment reporter. Weinstein’s people tried to kill even the smallest of stories about the mogul by offering future exclusives.The result of all these efforts was a general softening of coverage. Weinstein’s violent encounter with Traister and Goldman, for instance, was successfully spun as an unfortunate tussle between overly pushy journalists and a saintly film titan. But in Traister and Goldman’s telling, it was anything but.During the altercation, Weinstein repeatedly screamed, “Who let this fucking cunt into this cancer party?” Goldman told HuffPost. When Goldman approached Weinstein, the mogul started berating him as well, Goldman recalled, before noticing Goldman had a tape recorder in his hand.“There were a few exchanges back and forth, and at a certain point he lunged at my recorder, which I wasn’t about to give up, and now we are hand-to-hand in the middle of the Tribeca Grand going back and forth with our hands up in the air,” Goldman said. Unable to obtain the recorder, Weinstein dragged Goldman out in front of the hotel and put him in a headlock, Goldman said. “I remember at this point being like, I can’t fucking believe that this person is doing this ― that this is happening in public,” Goldman said.Goldman said he remembered a photographer from the New York Daily News taking photos during the scuffle ― “probably dozens if not hundreds of frames,” he said. There were several reporters surrounding them, including one who Goldman recalled saying, “Harvey, you don’t want to do this! You don’t want to do this!” Eventually, the scuffle was broken up and Goldman and Traister left.“Holy shit, this is going to be the cover of the Daily News tomorrow,” Goldman said he remembers thinking. “It was a fantastic New York tabloid story. You know, ‘Movie Mogul Puts Nerdy Journalist In Headlock At Posh Party,’” he said. But then, something strange happened. “We wake up and there’s nothing in the papers,” Goldman told HuffPost. “Those photos have never been seen, as far as I know.”Soon, however, Goldman got a call from somebody he knew at the New York Post, who told him that he had it “on good authority” that “Harvey’s spinning this story that you actually went into a party and assaulted somebody.” During the scuffle, a woman had gotten hurt. Goldman told HuffPost he hadn’t noticed it at the time. The New York Post labeled Goldman and Traister as “pushy reporters” who drove Weinstein “to the breaking point.” The Post also made Weinstein look like a saint in its description of his friendship with Duffy, saying he “saved her life” while she was suffering from the disease that became the focus of her book.Weinstein became fast friends with Duff [sic] after he saved her life by getting her to the right doctors and making sure she was treated immediately.The New York Times, for its part, subtly placed the blame on the Observer reporter as well, starting with the snarky title “There’s Observing, Then There’s Not.” In that story, an unnamed “Miramax official” depicted Goldman alone as the aggressor, saying Weinstein and Traister had mutually resolved “that he wasn’t going to continue the interview; that was fine. But then Andrew stepped in.”Goldman’s boss, Observer Editor Peter W. Kaplan, gave the Times a statement defending Goldman, saying, “Andrew acted responsibly and professionally, and he was sticking up for a colleague.” But it was stuck at the bottom of the second-to-last paragraph, long after the Times reporter had allowed the unnamed Miramax official to drive the narrative that “Mr. Goldman’s tape recorder slammed into the head of another guest” and that Goldman “refused” to apologize when Weinstein asked him to. The Post and Times did not respond to requests for comment about the articles.Goldman was shocked by the media’s coverage.“They tried to play it as though I had approached a woman at the party and basically assaulted her by hitting her over the head with a tape recorder, without mentioning the fact that Harvey and I were fighting over a tape recorder that was mine,” he said. The incident was a “wake-up call” for Goldman. He wasn’t sure how, but he knew in his gut that Weinstein had been able to use his influence to shape the story in his favor, and make sure those photos never got out. “The idea that somebody had the power to totally eliminate a perfect New York tabloid story was stunning to me,” Goldman said. “And I have to hand it to him, he’s really good at it,” he added.We want to know all we can about why the media went so easy on Harvey Weinstein for so long.

4,POLITICS,"Offended By Protest, Pence Leaves Football Game; Colts Win Anyway","Alan Singer, ContributorSocial studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of c...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/offended-by-protest-pence-leaves-football-game-colts_us_59db4a47e4b0cf2548b338ce,"On Sunday, Vice-President Mike Pence walked out of an Indianapolis Colts – San Francisco 49er football before the game even",2017-10-09,<p>Vice-President Pence and entourage pledged to the flag and then walked out of an Indianapolis Colt football game in his home state of Indiana.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db4a7e2d00008e173094d8.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday, Vice-President Mike Pence walked out of an Indianapolis Colts – San Francisco 49er football before the game even started. Apparently Pence was directed to leave by President Trump who tweeted “I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country.” Following his leader, Pence tweeted “I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.” Without Pence, the former Governor of Indiana, in the stands to cheer them on, the Colts and 49ers went into overtime tied 23-23 before the Colts pulled out a victory.NFL players have repeatedly explained that they are not protesting the flag, the nation, or American service men and women. They take the “knee” during the national anthem to highlight racism and institutional violence against Black men in the United States. Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49er quarterback who started the current round of protests, refused “to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins explained during a CNN town hall, “This is us, as concerned citizens, trying to play our role in a bigger conversation about race in America, a bigger conversation about our criminal justice system, and our law enforcement.”Political protest has often been connected to athletics and athletes. Jackie Robinson, who is celebrated for the quiet and dignified way he desegregated Major League baseball in 1947, was put on trial while in the military during World War II for refusing to move to the back of a military bus when ordered to by a white bus driver. In 1965, twenty-one 21 African-American football players refused to participate in an American Football League all-star game scheduled to be held in New Orleans because of racial discrimination they faced in the city. A number of white players supported the protest and the league moved the game to Houston. One of the most prominent athletes of the 20th century, Mohammed Ali, was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title and threatened with prison when he refused to be drafted to fight in a Vietnam war that he opposed.Protests and displays by athletes during the national anthem have a long history in the United States. At the Mexican Summer Olympics in 1968 track stars Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised fists in a Black Power salute during the medal ceremony. At the 1972 Munich Olympics track stars Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett refused to stand at attention when the anthem was played. Smith, Carlos, Matthews, and Collett were all expelled from the Olympics. Too avoid controversy, Madison Square Garden was not going to play the anthem at the 1973 Olympic Invitational track and field meet, but reversed itself after a media uproar. The track meet’s media director defending the original decision. He said playing the anthem was not obligatory because “its purpose and relevance to sports events has never been established.” In 1996, the NBA suspended the Denver Nuggets’ leading scorer Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf for refusing to stand during the national anthem. The league’s deputy commissioner accused Abdul-Rauf of violating a league rule requiring players, coaches and trainers to “stand and line up in a dignified posture” during the playing of the United States and/or Canadian anthems. In this case an editorial in the New York Times defended Abdul-Rauf, arguing “It was the N.B.A.’s blindness to the fact that trying to force participation in a patriotic exercise undermines democratic values.” Donald Trump and Mike Pence probably consider a Times editorial “fake news.”The first time the national anthem was played at a sporting event was probably during World War I, when it was not yet the official national anthem. It was sung during the 7th inning stretch of a baseball game by a Red Sox player who was on furlough from the Navy and became a regular feature of Red Sox games. During World War II the anthem, officially the national anthem after 1931, became a common feature at sporting events. However, in the 1950s, there was discussion of suspending the practice, because it was being ignored by fans.Current veneration of the flag and the anthem are political as well. Patriotism at the ballparks and arenas was in style after 9/11 and used to rally public support for questionable military invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Prior to 2009, NFL players remained in their locker rooms until after the national anthem was finished. This changed when the Department of Defense decided to pay the NFL millions of dollars to endorse unquestioning patriotism and promote military recruitment during games and pre-game ceremonies.The American flag is definitely not a religious symbol. There are American flag hats, shirts, and napkins. Men can buy American flag underpants online through Kmart, Walmart, and Old Navy. Women’s low-rise flag panties are available at Bloomingdale’s. Patriots can purchase American flag toilet paper on Amazon.com.Pence and Trump tweets led to an avalanche of critical online responses. New Yorker satirist Andy Borowitz posted on Facebook “Poll: Americans Hope Trump Follows Pence’s Example and Leaves Early.” Political commentator and urban rap artist Reeces Pieces sent Trump and Pence a meme on twitter asking “Will Trump and Pence promise to leave the country if we all take a knee?”Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

The allegations came to light on Friday in a report for Science magazine. According to Science, Jane Willenbring and Deborah Doe are speaking out because they no longer fear retribution. Willenbring, who is now 40 years old and a tenured associate professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of California, San Diego, alleges in the complaint to the university that during a 1999 field visit to Beacon Valley, Marchant repeatedly harassed her. He reportedly encouraged her to sleep with his brother, who was also on the expedition; called her a “slut” and a “liar”; and greeted her every morning by saying, “Today I’m going to make you cry.”“Most days, I would listen to long discussions about how I was a ‘slut’ or a ‘whore,’” Willenbring wrote in the report. Marchant also allegedly threw rocks at her whenever she urinated, so she would go days without drinking water, later developing a urinary tract infection. Toward the end of the trip he also is alleged to have repeatedly pushed her down an icy slope because she hadn’t cried that day. Doe, who opted to remain anonymous, reports that she too was victim to Marchant’s harassment in the late 1990s, also on a trek to Antarctica.She’d initially written a letter of support for Willenbring, but turned that letter into her own formal complaint. “He repeatedly called me a ‘c**t,’ among many other insults ... (bitch being the most common) that were invoked on a daily basis or more ... He would crow that he could say absolutely anything he wanted to because we were ‘in his domain,’” she said, according to Science. Doe also alleges that he threatened to ensure she never got funding if she were to finish her doctorate. “I distinctly remember standing there, aghast, in my red down jacket and black wind pants, watching my career and life plans dissolve as Dr. Marchant smiled triumphantly at me,” she said. Hillary Tulley, a high school teacher from Illinois who witnessed Marchant’s behavior during a National Science Foundation-funded program called Teachers Experiencing Antarctica, wrote a letter supporting Willenbring and Doe in which she detailed her own experiences with Marchant. Marchant apparently refused to take Tulley, who was the only woman on that particular expedition, seriously. “Talk during [group] meals ... always included relentless, snickering mentions of my advanced age (I was 43), my small breasts, and other failings, always initiated by Marchant,” she wrote. “All my attempts to steer the conversation to science were shut down.”Letters of support for both Marchant and his accusers have poured in. One of Marchant’s former graduate students who had also traveled with him to Antarctica denies that the allegations align with his character. “I ... sincere[ly] support ... him as an upstanding and professional individual,” the student wrote in an official letter of support. But another former graduate student, Adam Lewis, wrote that not standing up for both Willenbring and Tulley is “one of the only real regrets I have in my whole life.” He had witnessed both of them being harassed on their separate expeditions. “I had the chance to stand up for people,” he wrote. “And I didn’t.”Sexual harassment is a pervasive issue in academia, with multiple universities like USC and UC Berkeley having settled complaints this year. A 2014 report also showed that scientific research field studies are particularly ripe for harassment ― PLOS ONE, a scientific research journal, conducted a survey that showed 64 percent of respondents had personally experienced sexual harassment while doing field work, and the majority of those people were trainees at the time. UPDATE: BU confirmed to HuffPost that Marchant is under investigation as per Title IX procedures, and Marchant did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

It was a different story at rallies in other cities however, and the OVD-Info monitoring group, a non-profit organization, said at least 262 people had been detained in 27 towns.In St Petersburg, Putin’s home town, a Reuters witness saw riot police roughly detain at least 11 people. OVD-Info said at least 66 people had been detained in the city.Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for violating rules on public meetings, called the rally in Moscow and other cities to coincide with Putin’s 65th birthday.Putin, who has dominated Russia’s political landscape for almost 18 years, is widely expected to run for what would be his fourth term.Navalny hopes to run too, despite the central election commission declaring him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence he says was politically-motivated.One of the Moscow protesters held a homemade poster of Putin sitting on a mountain of banknotes, wearing a crown with the legend: “Happy Birthday you little thief!”Others carried posters citing their right to protest, some waved Russian flags, and a few carried inflatable yellow ducks, a jokey reference to Navalny accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of owning a lavish estate with a duck house.Medvedev called the claims politically-motivated nonsense.In St Petersburg, some 1,500 activists waving red and white banners gathered in a square before heading for the city’s main street shouting “Putin is a thief” and “Free Navalny”.PROTESTS MORE MODEST IN SIZEThe size of Saturday’s Moscow rally and others across Russia looked far more modest than Navalny-backed mass protests in March and June, which were widely recognized to be some of the biggest since 2012.Many of the Moscow protesters were teenagers or in their twenties.Carrying a yellow duck, Ulugbek Apsapayev, 17, said he had turned up because he wanted a better future for Russia.“The duck is a sign that we support Alexei Navalny who also wants only good things for the country. But unfortunately we only have Vladimir Putin and his gang in power.”Putin is popular across the country however, especially outside major cities where his strong leadership style and tough foreign policy stance go down well. He is expected to confirm later this year that he will run for another six-year term.Opinion polls show he would comfortably beat Navalny if the opposition leader was allowed to run. Navalny says such polls are meaningless because there is no fair political competition.Putin spent his birthday taking congratulatory calls from other world leaders, and chaired a security council meeting.Authorities had refused to approve most of Saturday’s rallies, but Navalny says Russians’ right to protest is enshrined in the constitution.A Reuters reporter at a rally in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg saw police detain at least eight people among a crowd of over 1,000 protesters.(Additional reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber in Moscow and Natalya Shurmina in Ekaterinburg; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Andrew Bolton)"

Turn-out for the referendum was 43 percent, with most residents who wish to remain in Spain staying home.The anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself. A month ago, a million people rallied in the city to support independence.“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.” Puigdemont will address the Catalan parliament at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Tuesday on “the current political situation” amid speculation he could ask the assembly to declare independence.Puigdemont said in an interview broadcast on Catalan television on Sunday that a law passed by the Catalan parliament preparing the way for the referendum called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.“We will apply what the law says,” he said, according to a partial transcript released by TV3.Puigdemont said he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because Spain refused to discuss independence. “What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.Rajoy has said repeatedly he will not talk to the Catalan leaders unless they drop their plans to declare independence.The Spanish government sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers fired rubber bullets and charged crowds with truncheons in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and dramatically escalated the dispute.COMPANY MEETINGSLosing Catalonia is almost unthinkable for the Spanish government. It would deprive Spain of about 16 percent of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. There is widespread opposition to a Catalan breakaway among people in the rest of the country.The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia. The board of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis will meet on Monday to discuss moving its head office elsewhere in Spain, a source familiar with the matter said.Real estate firm Inmobiliaria Colonial also called a board meeting for Monday to discuss moving its head office out of Catalonia, a source close to the firm said.Companies that have already decided to move their head offices out of Catalonia include Spain’s third biggest lender, Caixabank, and the fifth-biggest, Sabadell.The exodus adds to pressure on Catalan leaders by potentially undermining tax revenues paid by companies.Concern is growing in EU capitals about the impact of the crisis on the Spanish economy, the fourth largest in the euro zone, and on possible spillovers to other economies.Some European officials are also worried that any softening in Spain’s stance towards Catalan independence could fuel secessionist feelings among other groups in Europe such as Belgium’s Flemings and Italy’s Lombards.Until the weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether he would take the unprecedented step of triggering Article 155 of the constitution, the so-called nuclear option which enables him to sack the regional government and call a local election.However, asked if he was ready to do so, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper on Saturday: “I don’t rule out anything that is within the law ... Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over. He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilize what it believes is a “silent majority” that opposes independence.“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d’etat the Catalan government is fostering.” (Additional reporting by Raquel Castillo and Robert Hetz in Madrid, Elisabeth O’Leary in Edinburgh and Madeline Chambers in Berlin; Writing by Adrian Croft; Editing by Pravin Char and Alison Williams)"

Ideally, we shouldn’t have to take drastic solutions but for that not to happen there would have to be changes.”Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the 4,000 national police the government had shipped in for the referendum, until the crisis was over. He ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said he is open to - and added the issue would not force a snap national election.Sunday’s demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society to mobilize what it believes is a “silent majority” that opposes independence.“The people who have come to demonstrate don’t feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”The rally was addressed by Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who has dual Spanish and Peruvian nationality. He told reporters it showed many Catalans “don’t want the coup d’etat the Catalan government is fostering.” (Additional reporting by Raquel Castillo and Robert Hetz in Madrid, Elisabeth O’Leary in Edinburgh and Madeline Chambers in Berlin; Writing by Adrian Croft; Editing by Pravin Char and Alison Williams)"

PROMESA created a fiscal control board to oversee island budgetary decisions that critics charge has proven far more willing to impose new austerity measures than reduce Puerto Rico’s unsustainable obligations to its creditors. The need to provide Puerto Rico with debt relief “does not mean that we’re going to wave a magic wand and wipe out the debt, which is what many people interpreted the president to say, and it also doesn’t mean we’re going to bail them out, because we’re not,” Mulvaney said. Pressed by host Chuck Todd on what administration officials would do to relieve the debt, Mulvaney said, “We are going to, well, to mitigate the debt.”“We are going to work with them to rebuild the island,” he added. “There is no question about that. How they deal with their long-term debt is actually part of an existing piece of legislation called PROMESA.” Earlier this week, White House officials already sought to dispel any impressions that Trump had intended to suggest that the federal government would simply force creditors to forgive Puerto Rican debt.  Mulvaney’s comments are nearly identical to those of White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday. Thus far, a group of big multinational banks that holds a major chunk of Puerto Rican debt have responded to Hurricane Maria’s devastation of the island by offering its government new loans, rather than a discount on what is already owes.It is not clear how members of the seven-person fiscal control board will respond to the challenges Puerto Rico must now deal with following the hurricane. The board includes financiers Carlos Garcia and Ramon Gonzalez, who progressive critics accuse of profiting from and worsening the island’s debt crisis.Long before Maria, Puerto Rico had been suffering from a massive rise in poverty and emigration from the island to the mainland U.S. Spending cuts and tax hikes implemented to pay down the island’s massive debt have plunged it into a prolonged economic slump with no end in sight."

The bill might be largely symbolic, since bump stocks had been a relatively obscure and unpopular gun accessory. “I am willing to move forward with the Republicans on banning these bump stocks that ... subvert legislation that has been long on the books banning automatic weapons,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “I think you have to walk before you run. And I do think this is an important moment.”Cox said the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives should regulate bump stocks, since it’s already illegal to convert a semi-automatic gun into an automatic one.“The ATF needs to do their job, review these, and if there is [a need for] further regulation, then we will work on further regulation,” he said. He did not offer specifics on what that “further regulation” should be.The NRA released a statement last week maintaining its long-held position that “banning guns from law-abiding Americans, based on the criminal act of a madman, will do nothing to prevent future attacks.”The NRA’s CEO, Wayne LaPierre ― who famously claimed after the 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun” ― similarly argued on Sunday for protecting “the good guys with guns.” “Accessibility is about accessibility for the good guys,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “That’s what the Second Amendment” that protects the right to bear firearms “is all about.”Proponents of stricter gun control note that gun ownership in American is higher per capita than for any other country in the world. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a former Marine, said it makes no sense for citizens to have military-style weapons. “I’ve seen the effects of gun violence firsthand in Iraq, and I know that it has no place at our schools, on our streets, at our concerts,” he said on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday. “You can have restrictions on guns under the Second Amendment,” Moulton said as he debated the gun control issue with to Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) on the talk show.“I mean, a great way to protect your family’s home, as you know as a [former] Navy SEAL, would be to have some land mines out in front and have some grenades stockpiled,” Moulton said. “But we don’t allow that in our community ... We don’t allow families to own tanks. So we have reasonable restrictions that are perfectly respectful of the Second Amendment, and we know from experience that restrictions like this, that common-sense reforms will help.”Taylor said there should be “a high, very high bar” for restricting gun ownership rights.Marina Fang contributed reporting."

JR’s canvas is the world. He uses his work as a photographer of faces to capture humanity and then prints out huge images, which he pastes on crumbling walls of the world ― to dramatic effect.“Everything is about eye contact” JR said back then. And in the six years since he gave this TED talk, his work has continued at a rapid pace.So, when I ventured to see his latest work, a documentary produced jointly by Agnes Varda, the 89-year-old New Wave French cinema filmmaker, and JR, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The goal of the film was to chronicle French rural life. But beyond that, I went in with few preconceptions.“Sheer perfection – that’s the phrase that springs to mind when describing the humanist miracle that is Faces Places, the year’s best and most beguiling documentary,” is what Peter Travers said in Rolling Stone. And he’s spot on.Varda and JR take a journey into art, and faces, and Varda’s history, and politics, and the frailty of life.The film’s conversational tone can be a bit misleading, as it operates at two levels. On the surface it’s a buddy movie, but then just below the surface it’s a deeply political work. Perhaps because of what’s going on in this country - the conversations with french farm workers - who are using new high tech tools like computer controlled harvesters - seem to uncover a deep sadness. Yes, they have fancy tech - but they’ve lost their co-workers and now they are alone in the cab of the almost freakishly large farm equipment. This is the surprising power of this filmmaker/photographer combo. He makes things big, and she finds knowledge and beauty in small things. Together - they are the Thema and Louise of documentary film.“Faces Places” is a film about friendship, memory, and the impermanence of things. JR ’s work is printed on paper, pasted to walls, and then it seems often gone as the elements erase them."

It lasts for five days, and coincides with the Hindu new year.Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs celebrate the religious occasion every autumn in countries throughout South Asia and beyond. In the United States, major Diwali festivals have lit up communities from California to Texas to North Carolina in recent years.The massive Times Square event ― the largest Diwali celebration outside of India ― has been growing in size since its debut in 2013, attracting large crowds including many people from the city’s numerous immigrant communities. It’s the largest South Asian ethnic event in New York City, where at least 3 million residents ― more than one-third of the population ― are foreign-born, per the Department of City Planning.The greater New York area is home to some 717,000 Indian citizens, according to the latest U.S. Census estimates. Nationwide, people of Indian origin represent about 1 percent of the population. In fact, India is currently the largest source of new immigrants to America, surpassing Mexico and China.Diwali at Times Square is the creation of Neeta Bhasin, president and CEO of marketing firm ASB Communications. Bhasin, who moved to the U.S. from India four decades ago, says she is dedicated to teaching people about Indian culture and traditions.“Being an immigrant woman, I felt compelled to showcase the beauty and the richness of our culture, and what better way than bringing our incredible festival of Diwali, that celebrates the victory of light over darkness [and] knowledge over ignorance, to the center of New York, Times Square?” she asked.She believes the annual event is “more important now than ever.” In the wake of the 2016 election, Americans have witnessed a rise in polarizing, anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric from White House officials, including President Donald Trump. One of Trump’s earliest and most controversial executive orders, widely referred to as the “travel ban,” restricts immigration and general entry to the U.S. from specific countries for purported national security purposes. Human rights groups have claimed the ban is unconstitutional and promotes xenophobia.In order to “stand against hate and prejudice,” Bhasin says, it is “extremely important for us to learn from each other.”“Indian culture is part of American culture, as is Mexican, and Chinese and the many cultures that together make up the beautiful tapestry that is the American culture,” she said. “We want to spread a message of acceptance and integration, love and harmony in a society that feels extremely divided at this moment.”Saturday’s event featured a variety of Indian dishes, a digital fireworks display and a lighting ceremony of traditional lamps known as Diyas ― an important Diwali ritual.It also boasted a lineup of celebrity performers, including Bollywood choreographer Terence Lewis; actors Sanjeeda Sheikh and Aamir Ali; as well as singers Hamsika Iyer, Mickey Singh and Raman Mahadevan.In a statement issued prior to his performance, Lewis said he hoped the festival would “spread a little bit of love and happiness” during a time when “there is so much hatred, there’s so much violence [and] there’s so much intolerance.”For Iyer, who traveled from her home in Mumbai to perform at Times Square, this weekend marks her first-ever trip to the U.S. She said she is very grateful for the opportunity “to share the Indian-ness ― music and culture and everything that is very India ― with the audience here.”She performed a number of songs, including the hits “1 2 3 4 Get on the Dance Floor” and “Chammak Challo.”“Diwali is very special because it brings everyone together,” said Iyer, who plans to return to India in time to spend the Oct. 19 holiday with family, as she does every year. “It’s a time of light and happiness. It’s beautiful,” she added.Nivrutti Khandade attended the festival for the first time with his 8-year-old son on Saturday. They donned matching red kurta pajamas, loose-fitting garments traditionally worn in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.“We love watching the dancing and seeing celebrities,” said Khandade, adding the event reminded him of life in India, where he and his wife spent most of their lives.The couple immigrated to the U.S. in 2012 with their son, who was only 3 years old at the time. They now live in New Jersey, but Khandade strives to educate his son about their Indian heritage by bringing him to events like the Diwali festival.“My son grew up in the U.S., so he only speaks English,” he said. “We try our best to understand and adapt to U.S. culture, and we also enjoy celebrating our culture here.”"

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is retiring from office because Trump refused to endorse him for re-election next year ― a claim that a source familiar with the matter disputed.Trump said on Twitter that Corker, an increasingly vocal critic of the president, had “begged” for his blessing.In a pair of subsequent tweets, Trump said he had denied Corker’s request to be named secretary of state, and that the two-term senator is “also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!” He concluded that Corker, 65, would “be a negative voice and stand in the way of our agenda,” and lacked “the guts” to seek re-election.Corker responded on Twitter, saying the White House “has become an adult day care center.”He added: “Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”Todd Womack, Sen. Corker’s chief of staff, contradicted the president’s version of events. Trump actually called Corker on Friday asking him to reconsider his decision not to run for re-election, and offering his support if he chose to do so, according to Womack.As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Corker brokered a bipartisan deal in April 2015 allowing a congressional review of then-President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. But Corker helped lead an effort to use congressional review to kill the agreement. The Iran deal went on to survive a GOP effort to kill it in the Senate thanks to a Democratic filibuster, not the support of Corker or any other Republican.Since Trump’s election, however, Corker has counseled Trump to “radically enforce” the agreement rather than tear it up.Corker in August took Trump to task for his ambiguous response to the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., saying the president “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”Since announcing his retirement in September, Corker has continued his negative assessments of Trump. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly “are those people that help separate our country from chaos,” Corker told reporters on Wednesday.White House budget director Mick Mulvaney responded diplomatically on NBC’s “Meet the Press” when asked about Corker’s “chaos” comments.“I enjoy working with Sen. Corker,” Mulvaney told host Chuck Todd. “I think it’s going to be fun to work with him, especially now that he’s not running for re-election, because I think it sort of unleashes him to do whatever ― and say whatever ― he wants to say. But I don’t think we’re that close to chaos anyway.”Corker’s Senate seat is favored to remain in Republican hands. GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn announced on Thursday her intention to run for it."

The episode was re-edited to feature less on-screen violence following last week’s tragic attack in Las Vegas. FX confirmed in a statement that the altered version of the show will air on the FX channel while the original will be available on demand through viewers’ cable or satellite providers as well as streaming platforms FXNOW and FX+. Read the network’s full statement below.In light of the tragedy last week in Las Vegas, Ryan Murphy and the producers of “American Horror Story: Cult” have chosen to make substantial edits to the opening scene of tomorrow night’s episode (Tuesday, October 10, 10 PM ET/PT). This opening, which was filmed two months ago and which portrays an occurrence of gun violence that has sadly become all too common in our country, contains a sequence that some viewers might find traumatic. Only the edited version of the episode will air on the FX linear channel, while the unedited version of the episode will be available on the VOD platform of your cable, satellite or telco provider, as well as on the FX Networks non-linear platforms, FXNOW and FX+.PREVIOUSLY:Ryan Murphy has decided to re-edit an upcoming episode of “American Horror Story: Cult,” which included a graphic mass shooting scene, in the wake of the attack in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured almost 500 others. The producer spoke about his decision to alter the episode, filmed months before last weekend’s tragedy, during a conversation with Emily Nussbaum at the New Yorker Festival on Saturday. “Should you air it? Should you not air it? How do you be sensitive? My point of view was I believe I have the right to air it, but I also believe in victims’ rights, and I believe that now is probably not the week to have something explosive or incendiary in the culture because someone who was affected might watch that and it could trigger something or make them feel upset,” he said, as reported by E! News. “So our decision was to re-edit it and I felt that that was the right move.” He continued, “Nobody ever talks about victims’ rights. That’s sort of a weird emotional discussion that’s never bridged. … But I felt great sympathy for people who were affected, certainly, and family members and loved ones and people who are upset about the way the world is.”Murphy also noted that the majority of the violence in the episode will now appear off-screen. “It was meant to be an obvious anti-gun warning about society,” Murphy said (per Deadline), discussing his intentions for the episode. “I never do anything to offend,” he added. Murphy’s choice to re-edit the “AHS” episode comes after Netflix canceled an event for its new show “The Punisher,” based on a Marvel comic book series by the same name. The series is about a vigilante who violently avenges the murder of his family. The streaming service was set to premiere the first two episodes in Paris this weekend at an event called “Nuit Noire,” which was meant to coincide with a New York Comic Con simulcast. However, Netflix and Marvel “decided it wouldn’t be appropriate for Marvel’s ‘The Punisher’ to go ahead with the Paris Nuit Noire event and to participate in New York Comic Con.”“Our thoughts continue to be with the victims and those affected” by the Las Vegas mass shooting, Netflix and Marvel said in a joint statement.

It’s something I never thought could have happened to me,” he told HuffPost by email on Sunday.The Cinderella moment followed Zuschlag making national news last week after he was told that he was no longer welcome at Tri-City Christian Academy in Somersworth, New Hampshire ― roughly seven miles southwest of Noble High. It followed him transitioning from female to male in 2015, he told the Seacoast Online at the time.Zuschlag, who said he had a 3.89 GPA and aspired to be valedictorian, said he went to speak with a school administrator in August about being identified as a male but was instead given an ultimatum. He had to confess his sins, stop taking testosterone treatments and receive Christian counseling or find a new school.The school administrator, reached for comment by Seacoast Online, declined to speak about Zuschlag’s case citing privacy issues. A request for comment from the school by HuffPost was not immediately returned.Though the idea of attending a new school “terrified” him, he enrolled at Noble High and made a number of new friends, adding to a few that he already knew.Administrators at Noble High School, reached by Portland station WCSH-6, said Zuschlag is not their first transgender student.“We want all students to feel like they belong here at Noble High School,” the school’s director of counseling, Nancy Simard, told the station. “That’s a small thing we can do to help them feel like they’re a part of the community.”That welcoming feeling apparently wasn’t lost on Zuschlag.Within the first few weeks of school, Zuschlag said an email began circulating seeking nominees for homecoming king and queen and he decided to pursue it, initially “as a joke.”“I asked on Snapchat as a joke to put me in and people actually did it. I didn’t really expect them to. I still can’t believe they did that for me,” he said.His surprise was only magnified when he showed up to the game and won.“After I won at the homecoming game, I almost started crying. My friends all put me in, people I didn’t even know put me in, everyone voted for me on the final ballot,” he said.Today, as painful of an experience as this has been, he sees his removal from the New Hampshire school as a blessing from God ― one that he hopes will raise awareness and inspire others.“I’ve been degraded so much in the past, I’ve conformed to other people’s beliefs and standards just to make them happy and comfortable. I’ve put myself in situations really hurtful to my mental health just to keep peace,” he told HuffPost.“God forced me out of that situation, that school, knowing that my mental health was far more important than my education. The only reason I stayed at the school for so long was for my education, for my GPA, and to just learn about God. But I was also dying there mentally and I suffered a lot,” he said. “God took me away from that to help me be a better person, to breathe again, to be happy again. I’m so grateful He did that for me.”"

Many residents are still bathing and collecting drinking water in limited quantities from freshwater sources, or using bottled water provided by the U.S. military.In an interview on ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday, Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dismissed Yulín Cruz’s comments as “political noise.”“We filtered out the mayor a long time ago,” Long told “This Week” co-anchor Martha Raddatz. “We don’t have time for the political noise.”“The bottom line is, is that we are making progress every day in conjunction with” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, Long said. “And in regards to the power failure, we’re restringing a very fragile system every day.”Cruz and the Trump administration have been engaged in a running battle over the adequacy of the federal response to the damage cause by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that devastated the island.Responding to criticism on Sept. 29 that aid from the United States was arriving in Puerto Rico too slowly, President Donald Trump chalked it up to the logistical difficulty of getting aid to an island “surrounded by water. Big water, ocean water.”In televised remarks that same day that went viral, Cruz lit into FEMA and put the onus on Trump to fix the situation.“Mr. Trump, I am begging you to take charge and save lives,” she declared “After all, that is one of the founding principles of the United States of North America. If not, the world will see how we are treated not as second-class citizens but as animals that can be disposed of. Enough is enough.”Her complaints prompted a public feud with Trump, who took her comments as a personal affront.In a series of tweets, Trump accused Cruz of acting on the advice of mainland Democrats and argued that she was showing “such poor leadership ability.” He added that Cruz and other Puerto Rican leaders “want everything to be done for them,” a comment that prompted charges that Trump was deliberately employing a stereotype of Latinos as lazy.The attacks from Trump drew widespread condemnation from Democrats, who noted that Trump launched the broadside while spending the weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey. Cruz, by contrast, had been seen walking through waist-deep water with a megaphone as part of her personal participation in rescue efforts.The tiff continued when Trump visited Puerto Rico on last Tuesday, attending a meeting with Puerto Rican officials, including Cruz. Trump raised eyebrows by saying Hurricane Maria was not “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina, given that many more people died in the 2005 storm that battered Louisiana and Mississippi. He also tossed paper towel rolls to a crowd of Puerto Ricans as if he were shooting basketballs.Cruz responded by calling Trump the “mis-communicator-in-chief,” denouncing his visit as “terrible and abominable.”This story has been updated with details on the continuing disputes between Cruz and the Trump administration."

Her celebrity indoctrination was swift.In the words of Willem Dafoe, who plays the Magic Castle’s paternal manager, Prince is a “firecracker.” Having met her last week at the movie’s New York junket, I can tell immediately that she’s the type of natural talent undeterred by flashbulbs.

Sitting in a conference room at a hotel, she offered a demonstration. Launching out of her chair, Prince stretched her arms out wide and leaned forward, modeling for a non-existent camera. “I have to be honest,” she said, sitting down again to reflect on her most recent carpet, at the New York Film Festival last weekend. “It was very, very overwhelming because of those people that are like, ‘Brooklynn, Brooklynn, look over here!

To follow photographers’ commands, she’d need to form “L” shapes with her pointer fingers and thumbs ― the standard shortcut taught in elementary school. “But I do not want to do that on the red carpet,” she continued. During our interview, Prince wore a shirt with four names scrawled on it, each stacked atop the other: Dakota, Elle, Emma, Daisy. That would be, respectively, Fanning, Fanning, Watson, Ridley. All she wanted from this lengthy press tour, really, was to meet Elle Fanning, which made Toronto her favorite city to visit. (She’s also traveled to Los Angeles and Miami to promote the movie.) Fanning, she said, specifically sought out Prince while they were both at The Hollywood Reporter’s studio in Canada, though the actresses only had a few minutes together.“She really quickly had to stop by because she had an interview, and I’m like, ‘These interviewers!’” she said in playful protest. “I’m thankful that I got to see her, but I’m like, ’Some of these photographers and interviewers get to look at her face for like two hours!” Prince’s favorite Fanning movie is “We Bought a Zoo.” What does she think of Matt Damon, who plays its lead?“Who’s that?” she asked with the naiveté of someone who hasn’t yet been totally seduced by Hollywood. (She also met Helen Mirren but didn’t know any of her movies. Gary Oldman scored a few points thanks to his “Harry Potter” affiliation.) Cinema is peppered with remarkable child performances ― Tatum O’Neal in “Paper Moon,” Anna Paquin in “The Piano,” Quvenzhané Wallis in “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” Jacob Tremblay in “Room” ― but even the best rarely achieve the resourceful naturalism that Prince displays in “The Florida Project.” Moonee hocks loogies with abandon, but as the two-hour film develops, the gravity of her itinerant lifestyle sends a clear message: She’ll have to grow up hastily.To prepare, Baker studied “The Little Rascals,” “The 400 Blows” and “Kes,” bittersweet stories about kids who exist apart from affluent, mainstream society. Any young actor is indebted to his or her director, and Baker had a tall task before him: to facilitate the aforementioned naturalism, but also to get Prince to hit a hefty emotional note as the film culminates. She needed to burst into tears, à la Drew Barrymore, whom Steven Spielberg famously goaded into crying in “E.T.” But Baker didn’t want, or need, to force it. On the day of the scene, Prince asked her young co-stars not to speak to her ― she needed to concentrate.“Let me tell you the story: OK. They were going to put drops in my eyes, but I didn’t want them because they were so minty,” Prince said. “They would go like ‘boom’ [she motions as if using eyedrops], and I would just have to hold them in. I told them, ‘No, no, no, no, no,’ so then [the makeup artist] was like, ‘If you don’t cry, I have to put the drops in your eyes.’ I thought about the kids going through that situation, and I was like [motions crying].”That’s right ― a 6-year-old put herself in the shoes of nearly-homeless families to capture a finale so stirring it’s like a gut punch. More than a year later, like a true thespian, Prince sees that as a point of pride. “Brooklynn has been loving the ride,” Baker said. “She loves this, that’s the thing. She’s never exhausted. While all of us are exhausted, she’s the one who’s actually still willing to go. She was born to do this. I put her in the same category as a Mickey Rooney or Jodie Foster. I totally see that she just loves this. But we only had eight hours a day to shoot with her because of child labor laws. At the end of the eight hours, we’d be like, ‘Brooklynn, you gotta go home now.’ She would be almost crying because she didn’t want to go home.”Of course, the experience wasn’t all waterworks. During most of the movie, Moonee spends her days playing pranks around the Magic Castle grounds, near strip clubs and gaudy souvenir shops. She eats a lot of soft-serve ice cream along the way, often telling strangers she needs coins to buy cones, because a doctor said they’ll help with her (probably non-existent) asthma. If she’s already mastered red carpets and learned how to delight reporters during interviews, one Hollywood fixture Prince hasn’t yet acquired is a preoccupation with her diet. I asked how many ice cream cones she devoured during the course of the shoot. Wide-eyed at the thought, she flashed all 10 fingers four times, followed by another five. “Forty-five?” I asked, shocked.“Cones!” she proclaimed. Forty-five cones! Her father, seated in the corner of the room, corroborated Prince’s declaration. Brooklynn Prince knows how to put on a show.

The women, both 26, met as students at North Carolina’s Elon University four years ago. “I knew she was the one,” Baldridge quipped, “when she didn’t laugh at my dumb jokes.” Travel, as it turns out, was a priority in the couple’s relationship from the get-go. “We love taking trips together, both big and small,” Baldridge, who is a singer-songwriter, told HuffPost. Shortly after graduation, the pair relocated from North Carolina to Los Angeles, where they now reside. So it only seemed fitting that when Baldridge began brainstorming ways to propose to Capel, she decided that hitting the road was the only way to do it. In September, the couple planned a road trip from Los Angeles to Alaska, and Baldridge instantly knew that “once-in-a-lifetime” adventure would be the ideal time for her to pop the question. Two weeks before they departed, Baldridge began planning the logistics. “It only felt right to begin this next chapter on the road with the things we value most ― our dog Willie Nelson and each other,” she said. Baldridge began documenting the trip in a series of short videos which she’d eventually set to a song she’d written, “Don’t Grow Up Too Fast,” for Capel. The actual proposal came 11 days into the road trip in Anchorage. “One morning I suggested we go wildlife spotting at nearby Kincaid Park. Once there, we came upon a deserted bridge that happened to overlook a bunch of moose. I decided this was the spot,” Baldridge recalled. “Maybe it was the majestic moose in the background. Maybe it was the fact that I couldn’t stand having my stomach in my throat any longer. I set up the camera like I always do, said something goofy to defuse tension like I always do, and asked the girl of my dreams to marry me, like I always knew I would.” Baldridge and Capel are planning on a summer 2018 wedding in Malibu, California. Ultimately, Baldridge hopes the video will “show all the baby butches out there that we can have a happy ending, too.”“I think about myself as a kid ― a little tomboy who felt the need to dive deep into the closet. Other tomboyish or butch women didn’t get a happy ending on television, or in the movies,” Baldridge said. “People that presented like I wanted to, were usually the butt of the joke or a side character.”She added, “I wish I could go back and tell my baby gay self to not get too disheartened, it works out.”Catch the latest in LGBTQ news by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

A Senate committee voted to advance her nomination to be a federal judge.It wasn’t a pretty vote. Every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee opposed her nomination. They scrutinized her past writings on abortion, which include her questioning the precedent of Roe v. Wade and condemning the birth control benefit under the Affordable Care Act as “a grave infringement on religious liberty.” One Democrat, Al Franken (Minn.), called her out for taking a speaking fee from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit that’s defended forced sterilization for transgender people and has been dubbed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.But Republicans don’t need Democrats’ votes, and now Barrett, a 45-year-old law professor at the University of Notre Dame, is all but certain to be confirmed to a lifetime post on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit — a court one level below the Supreme Court.Barrett is the model judicial candidate for this White House: young, conservative, and opposed to abortion and LGBTQ rights. For all the stories about President Donald Trump using his executive power to roll back civil rights protections — in the past day, his administration axed the ACA birth control benefit and ended workplace protections for transgender people — it is here, on the courts, where his team is working most aggressively to reshape the country.“Trump’s speed in nominating judges has been perhaps the most successful aspect of his presidency,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who specializes in judicial nominations. “Trump has easily surpassed Obama, Bush and Clinton at this point in the first year of their presidencies in terms of the sheer number nominated.”He has. Ten months in, Trump has nominated 17 circuit court judges and 39 district court judges. That’s far more than former President Barack Obama’s 10 circuit court nominees and eight district court nominees by this point in his first year of office. Former President George W. Bush had nominated 14 circuit judges and 32 district judges by this point.He’s also got more court seats to fill. He inherited a whopping 108 court vacancies when he became president ― double the number of vacancies Obama inherited when he took office. That’s largely due to Republicans’ years-long strategy of denying votes to Obama’s court picks to keep those seats empty for a future GOP president to fill. It worked.If Trump’s current judicial nominees are a preview of the kinds of judges he plans to nominate in the coming years, prepare for a significantly more socially conservative group of people shaping the nation’s laws.Consider John Bush. The Senate confirmed him in July, on a party-line vote, to a lifetime post on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Bush, 52, has compared abortion to slavery and referred to them as “the two greatest tragedies in our country.” He has also said he strongly disagrees with same-sex marriage, mocked climate change and proclaimed “the witch is dead” when he thought the Affordable Care Act might not be enacted.The Senate also confirmed Kevin Newsom, 44, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in August. He wrote a 2000 law review article equating the rationale of Roe v. Wade to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the 1857 decision upholding slavery. He also argued in a 2005 article for the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal organization, that Title IX does not protect people who face retaliation for reporting gender discrimination. The Supreme Court later rejected that position.Ralph Erickson, 58, was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit in September. As a district judge in 2016, he was one of two judges in the country who ordered the federal government not to enforce health care nondiscrimination protections for transgender people.These are just judges that have been confirmed. Nominees in the queue include Leonard Grasz, Trump’s pick for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. Grasz, 56, proposed amending the Omaha City Charter in 2013 to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ people. He has also compared the “personhood” of fetuses to the civil rights of Native Americans and African-Americans, according to an exhaustive report issued by the Alliance for Justice, a left-leaning advocacy group that focuses on the federal judiciary.Trump’s effort to shift the federal bench to the right isn’t just aimed at district and circuit courts. He nominated Damien Schiff, a 37-year-old attorney, to a 15-year gig on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Schiff has criticized efforts to prevent bullying of LGBTQ students, referring to messages of equality as “teaching ‘gayness’ in schools.” He also argued that states should be allowed to criminalize “consensual sodomy.”Part of the reason the White House has been able to nominate so many judges, so quickly, is because it’s been focused on filling court vacancies in states represented by two Republican senators. It’s easier for Trump’s team to work with Republicans in picking nominees, and then in moving them forward in committee, where it takes both home-state senators turning in a “blue slip” to get the hearing process going.Trump has been less successful in confirming nominees, though. That’s partly because in the mad rush to fill courts seats, the White House isn’t reviewing nominees’ records as thoroughly as, say, the Obama administration did. That means more controversial nominees and more scrutiny. Democrats aren’t exactly eager to cooperate, either, given the way Republicans treated Obama’s judicial nominees (remember Merrick Garland?).But as Trump plows through judicial nominations that will be a part of his legacy for decades, the only thing Democrats can do while they’re in the minority, for the most part, is make noise.If they want real change, says Tobias, “Democrats need to win elections.” CORRECTION: This article originally stated that in the first ten months of former President Barack Obama’s presidency, he appointed seven circuit court nominees and four district court nominees. Obama appointed 10 circuit court nominees and eight district court nominees by this point in his first year of office. This article originally stated former President George W. Bush had nominated 11 circuit judges and 31 district judges by this point. However, Bush had nominated 14 circuit judges and 32 district judges by this point."

He inherited a whopping 108 court vacancies when he became president ― double the number of vacancies Obama inherited when he took office. That’s largely due to Republicans’ years-long strategy of denying votes to Obama’s court picks to keep those seats empty for a future GOP president to fill. It worked.If Trump’s current judicial nominees are a preview of the kinds of judges he plans to nominate in the coming years, prepare for a significantly more socially conservative group of people shaping the nation’s laws.Consider John Bush. The Senate confirmed him in July, on a party-line vote, to a lifetime post on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Bush, 52, has compared abortion to slavery and referred to them as “the two greatest tragedies in our country.” He has also said he strongly disagrees with same-sex marriage, mocked climate change and proclaimed “the witch is dead” when he thought the Affordable Care Act might not be enacted.The Senate also confirmed Kevin Newsom, 44, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in August. He wrote a 2000 law review article equating the rationale of Roe v. Wade to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the 1857 decision upholding slavery. He also argued in a 2005 article for the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal organization, that Title IX does not protect people who face retaliation for reporting gender discrimination. The Supreme Court later rejected that position.Ralph Erickson, 58, was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit in September. As a district judge in 2016, he was one of two judges in the country who ordered the federal government not to enforce health care nondiscrimination protections for transgender people.These are just judges that have been confirmed. Nominees in the queue include Leonard Grasz, Trump’s pick for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. Grasz, 56, proposed amending the Omaha City Charter in 2013 to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ people. He has also compared the “personhood” of fetuses to the civil rights of Native Americans and African-Americans, according to an exhaustive report issued by the Alliance for Justice, a left-leaning advocacy group that focuses on the federal judiciary.Trump’s effort to shift the federal bench to the right isn’t just aimed at district and circuit courts. He nominated Damien Schiff, a 37-year-old attorney, to a 15-year gig on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Schiff has criticized efforts to prevent bullying of LGBTQ students, referring to messages of equality as “teaching ‘gayness’ in schools.” He also argued that states should be allowed to criminalize “consensual sodomy.”Part of the reason the White House has been able to nominate so many judges, so quickly, is because it’s been focused on filling court vacancies in states represented by two Republican senators. It’s easier for Trump’s team to work with Republicans in picking nominees, and then in moving them forward in committee, where it takes both home-state senators turning in a “blue slip” to get the hearing process going.Trump has been less successful in confirming nominees, though. That’s partly because in the mad rush to fill courts seats, the White House isn’t reviewing nominees’ records as thoroughly as, say, the Obama administration did. That means more controversial nominees and more scrutiny. Democrats aren’t exactly eager to cooperate, either, given the way Republicans treated Obama’s judicial nominees (remember Merrick Garland?).But as Trump plows through judicial nominations that will be a part of his legacy for decades, the only thing Democrats can do while they’re in the minority, for the most part, is make noise.If they want real change, says Tobias, “Democrats need to win elections.” CORRECTION: This article originally stated that in the first ten months of former President Barack Obama’s presidency, he appointed seven circuit court nominees and four district court nominees. Obama appointed 10 circuit court nominees and eight district court nominees by this point in his first year of office. This article originally stated former President George W. Bush had nominated 11 circuit judges and 31 district judges by this point. However, Bush had nominated 14 circuit judges and 32 district judges by this point."

Brown raised his right fist during the national anthem before a game against the Florida Panthers on Saturday night, becoming the first NHL player this regular season to join the silent protests that have been sweeping the NFL and other U.S. sporting leagues.Unlike Colin Kaepernick, the football player last year who began taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racial inequality, Brown — who, according to The Tampa Bay Times, is one of about 30 black players in the NHL — chose to stand throughout the anthem. Video shows Brown with his eyes closed and head bowed as the anthem played, his left hand wrapped around his hockey stick and his right hand raised in a closed fist.As ESPN notes, the NHL has no specific rules “governing what players must do during the national anthem.” Following the game, Brown said he chose to raise his fist during the anthem to “show my support.” “There are some issues that we have to talk about,” the 27-year-old told the Times. “So, in my mind, just trying to bring a little more awareness, and any type of conversation that we can get started would be great. I know there’s going to be negative backlash. But, in my heart, I know I did what was right.”He had protested similarly in at least one preseason game. In a statement, the Lightning said they “respect[ed]” Brown’s decision to protest. “We respect our players and individual choices they may make on social and political issues,” the team said. "

32,POLITICS,The NRA Museum Showcases Guns From The Same Hollywood It Says Is 'Glorifying' Violence,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nra-hollywood-guns-museum_us_59d7ba98e4b072637c43d04a,"The ""Hollywood Guns"" exhibit ""spotlights 125 firearms that have thrilled moviegoers for generations,"" the NRA website says.",2017-10-07,"American actor Clint Eastwood points his pistol in a still from the film ""Dirty Harry"".",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d835ea1400008b234938a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the wake of one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history, the National Rifle Association turned to a familiar tactic: pointing the finger at Hollywood for promoting a culture of violence. But at its museum in Fairfax, Virginia, the gun rights advocacy group continues to celebrate the very firearms that it has accused the movie industry of using to glorify gun violence and make billions of dollarsThe “Hollywood Guns” exhibit, in the National Firearms Museum’s William B. Ruger Gallery, “spotlights 125 firearms that have thrilled moviegoers for generations,” according to the NRA’s website. Among the weapons on display are the Smith and Wesson revolver used by Clint Eastwood in the films “Dirty Harry” and “Magnum Force”, the suppressed shotgun of Javier Bardem’s character in “No Country for Old Men”, a submachine gun used by Bruce Willis in “Die Hard”, and Captain Jack Sparrow’s flintlock pistol from “Pirates of the Caribbean”. There are also guns from “Pulp Fiction”, “Reservoir Dogs”, “The Departed” and a number of westerns, including “3:10 to Yuma” and “True Grit”.“These guns have never before been seen together, and probably never will again,” museum director Jim Supica is quoted as saying on the exhibit’s website. A second exhibit of Hollywood weaponry can be found at the NRA National Sporting Arms Museum at the Bass Pro Shops in Springfield, Missouri. The pair of exhibits debuted as “Reel Guns of Reel Heroes” in 2002, according to an NRA blog post. The collection at the Virginia museum has been a permanent fixture since 2010. New guns were added to the collection as recently as October 2016. That the NRA showcases such items is neither new nor surprising. But given comments by the association’s leadership, it’s hard not to question that if by maintaining such exhibits the NRA isn’t guilty of the same glorification for which it has skewered the film industry.In December 2012, about a week after a gunman murdered 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre held a press conference and did what the group so-often does. He called for more guns. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he said, while calling for armed guards at every school in the nation.He took no responsibility for the role the NRA might play in deadly shootings by encouraging the nation to be flooded with more weapons and working to sink numerous efforts to pass gun control legislation. Instead, he has consistently pinned mass killings on seemingly everything else — video games, Hollywood and the media.“Then there’s the blood-soaked slasher films like ‘American Psycho’ and ‘Natural Born Killers’ that are aired like propaganda loops on ‘Splatterdays’ and every day,” he said during his 2012 press conference, adding that “fantasizing about killing people” is the “filthiest form of pornography.”The NRA took the same approach on Thursday, nearly a week after 59 people were killed and hundreds more were injured by a gunman at a country music festival in Las Vegas. “The NRA spends millions of dollars every year teaching safe and responsible gun ownership, and Hollywood makes billions promoting and glorifying gun violence,” Chris Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. “And then the same hypocrites come in and suggest we’re to blame for this.” LaPierre echoed that same message in a separate interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “This Hollywood crowd makes billions ... teaching gun irresponsibility to the American public,” he said. “The hypocrisy is beyond belief. They criticize me for saying people ought to be able to protect themselves from murderers, rapists and robbers, and then they make billions depicting every night those same situations.”In a 2013 report entitled “Bloody Reel,” gun control advocate Tom Diaz documented how the NRA and gun industry “exploit images of guns in extremely violent movies to sell the increasingly lethal military-style guns that define today’s civilian gun market.” He wrote, “it would be hard to find a more hypocritical statement” that the one made by LaPierre against Hollywood in the wake of Sandy Hook. “The fact is that neither movies nor video games, nor any other of the wondrous excuses the NRA can dream up are the cause of America’s gun violence epidemic,” Diaz wrote in the report. “Guns are.”The NRA did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Friday.The National Firearms Museum highlighted its Hollywood firearms exhibit in a 2010 promotional video. In it, museum senior curator Phil Schreier encourages viewers to “come by and visit this sequel and come see a true blockbuster here in Fairfax, where all the stars of the silver screen have descended into these galleries and are represented by some of the firearms that we’ve fallen in love with in our youth and our adulthood, wishing that we too could be like our matinee idols.”The video was deleted from the NRA’s YouTube channel, but not before being archived by Media Matters for America. Several other videos about the the NRA’s Hollywood collection remain online. In one, Schreier shows off the MP5 submachine gun from “Die Hard”. In another, Jim Supica, the museum’s manager, demonstrates shooting both blank and live rounds from the same type of gun.“Here to kick ass and chew gum,” Supica says before unloading a magazine of blanks at large jars filled with bubble gum, a reference to a line from the 1988 film “They Live”.Supica then switches to live ammo. “Me personally, I prefer the real thing,” he says.

33,GREEN,Trump Administration Denies Endangered Species Protection To Walruses Threatened By Climate Change,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pacific-walrus-endangered-species-act-trump_us_59d7d43ae4b0f6eed350356b,"It's a ""death sentence for the walrus,"" a conservation group said.",2017-10-07,Pacific walruses on the shore of Arakamchechen Island in the Bering Sea.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d7dc121400008b234937e6.jpeg?cache=jiDxxqKdFR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has denied Endangered Species Act protections to the Pacific walrus, and some environmentalists are not happy.“This disgraceful decision is a death sentence for the walrus,” Shaye Wolf, climate science director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a press release. “Walruses face extinction from climate change, and denying them critical protections will push them closer to the edge.”The USFWS is defending the decision, saying it’s based on the walruses’ demonstrated ability to adapt to environmental changes and that there’s not sufficient data to indicate the animals need to be listed as “threatened” or “endangered” at this point in time.The primary issue at hand is sea ice, which has been declining over the past few decades as the planet warms. Pacific walruses, which live in Arctic waters, use sea ice for crucial behaviors like giving birth, nursing and resting.Declining sea ice means the walruses must increasingly “haul out” ― meaning congregate in large numbers ― on land instead of on sea ice. And when females and their young perform those behaviors on land instead of on ice, there are serious risks. “When walruses are forced to land, they have reduced access to their food and have to swim farther to find food,” Wolf said. (Their diet is largely bottom-dwelling prey like clams.) Scientists have observed a lack of sea ice resulting in walrus pups being separated from their mothers and left to starve or drown.And on land, young walruses are more vulnerable to predators and are susceptible to being trampled by the much larger adults.The USFWS acknowledges these hazards. But it sees the fact that walruses have been able to shift to land at all as a sign of the subspecies’ adaptability, and says there are ways to mitigate some of the risks that come with the shift. Patrick Lemons, chief of the Marine Mammals Management Office in Anchorage, Alaska, told HuffPost that in recent years officials in Alaska and Russia have implemented ways to reduce the kinds of trampling events that have previously killed thousands of walruses. Primarily, they created rules to reduce human disturbances like hunting and air traffic that can spook walruses into stampeding. (Trampling events can also occur when walruses become panicked by natural occurrences, like the sight of predators.)When it comes to reduced access to food, Lemons said that researchers previously weren’t sure that land-living walruses would be able to make “very long off-shore foraging trips,” but that it’s now clear they’ve shown the ability to do so. Wolf, however, says that walruses moving from ice to land should absolutely not be seen as a sign of adaptability, but a signal that something is seriously wrong.“Walruses are ice-dependent,” she said. “Being forced to move from ice to land when the ice disappears is causing lots of harms to walruses ... This is no happy adaptation story.”She noted that listing the walrus under the ESA would have had several major benefits.“It raises awareness that climate change is driving walruses toward extinction, and opens up resources for conservation action,” Wolf said. “ESA listing would require protection of the walrus’s core habitat, a recovery plan with the science-based steps needed for walrus survival and recovery, and require the Fish and Wildlife Service to work with other federal agencies to ensure that the federal government’s actions don’t harm the walrus and its habitat.”Lemons said that the Pacific walrus population ― now estimated to be at about 280,000 ― appears to have decreased by about 60 percent since 1980. But he said it’s not totally clear why. Declining ice, he said, is one potential factor. He also noted there was a “significant amount of subsistence hunting in the mid 1980s,” which has since lessened, but may have been responsible for population drops around that time. The most recent data, he says, suggests the population is “the highest it’s been since 1980 and is approaching sustainability.”The USFSW could be open to listing the Pacific walrus as threatened or endangered in the future if the data changes, he said.“We will continue to monitor the population and work with our partners here in Alaska,” he said.CBD had petitioned the USFWS to place the Pacific walrus on the endangered species list in 2008. In 2011, the USFWS named the subspecies as a “candidate” for the list. Legal action on the part of CBD meant that the USFWS had to make their final decision by the end of September this year.The administration also announced it would be declining ESA protections for 24 other types of animals. Three new animals were added. "

No he didn't buy me and I wasn't scouting for clients! </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d89fd6140000a8234938d4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In high spirits after having dinner in London with old friends that I hadn’t seen for a long time, I jumped off the Tube at Bond Street Station, waved goodbye to my friend Poli and made my way back to the hotel where I was staying.The bellhop held open the heavy wooden doors and I stepped inside the lobby. It was just past midnight but the hotel was empty, and the clip-clopping of my heels on the marble floor echoed throughout the building. Deep in thought, I made it halfway up the carpeted stairs when I realised that someone was following me and shouting in my direction. Alarmed, I turned around and was met with a Concierge who squared up in front of me as if to assert his authority.“Are you a guest at this hotel Madam? If so, I’ll need to see your room card. If you’re joining someone, can you please tell me his name and room number? We can’t have unregistered guests staying at the hotel”Taken aback, I didn’t really handle the situation the way that I wish I had. “Erm yes, yes I am” I stuttered as I fumbled around in my handbag trying to find my door pass among the clutter while he stood watching impatiently as if this “search” was just a front to save face. I retrieved the door pass from a sea of pens, foreign currency and subway ticket stubs, handed it to him for closer inspection and then went on my way, self consciously zipping up my coat as I climbed the rest of the stairs.(For the record, and since I know we live in a society of “victim blaming,” I was dressed conservatively - a long skirt, a trench coat and heels; though I am a believer of the school of thought that women should be entitled to dress as they please without being victims of ignorance and prejudice).Sitting in my hotel room, my shock soon transformed to fury and as much as I tried to get to sleep, I couldn’t rest thinking about the concierge. I called my friend, I ranted on Twitter, and then eventually, at 3am I threw on my hotel slippers and gown and shuffled to the Reception desk. I explained the situation to the man that greeted me and without an apology, was met with an indifferent response of “Well Ma’am, it really is at the Concierge’s discretion as to who he decides to stop for security reasons”. Bewildered, I shuffled back to my room assuring myself I’d write a strongly worded email of complaint in the morning. (The funny thing about this situation was, I was in town reviewing the hotel as a Travel Writer!) The situation was humiliating, and not representative of how you expect to be treated as a guest of a luxury hotel; however the worst part about this experience was that this type of thing has happened to me before. Several times actually, though admittedly this was the most confrontational. There just seems to be something about a woman that takes care of her appearance being by herself in certain locations that rubs people up the wrong way. As though it is completely out of the question that she could be in a luxury hotel by herself as a result of her own successes. As though just because she isn’t donning a backpack and staying in a hostel, she couldn’t possibly be a solo traveller. As though a woman wearing makeup couldn’t possibly have an interest in history, culture, and world issues.As a woman in her late twenties who earns her own money and prefers the comforts of a hotel to the chaos of an eight person backpacker’s hostel dorm, I am no stranger to this ignorance. I have received plenty of lecherous looks from males thinking that I was on sale, and disapproving looks from females about my lack of self-respect. To feel eyes burning into you, silently judging you because of this untrue and ignorant assumption is probably one of the most humiliating feelings in the world. It knocks your confidence, causes you to be hypercritical of yourself, your appearance, and your surroundings, and almost makes you feel ashamed as if you were actually there soliciting.My experiences are not just restricted to hotel stays. Living in Seoul, white women are somewhat fetishised and to satisfy this “demand” there are plenty of Russian prostitutes on hand. I cannot count the number of times that I have been approached and offered money for sex in Korea. Most of the time, I was dressed in the most unflattering attire and buying groceries or doing the recycling. I can’t exactly go around with a billboard attached to me that states my accolades and the intricacies of my resume but I wish that people could be open minded about the fact that there are many plausible reasons why a young woman may be sitting in a hotel lounge at 7pm, scribbling on her notepad by herself that don’t involve selling sex. Obviously not everyone I encounter while travelling alone makes this assumption about me (at least I hope they don’t!), but it’s happened enough that I felt the need to share it. I am a huge ambassador for solo female travel and I strongly believe that every woman should try it at least once in her life. These incidents were in the minority, but maybe my sharing this here will provide some comfort to anyone that has experienced the same (or if they do in the future, and then they don’t have to go through the same “what is it about my appearance?” self-analysing process that I did.) Melissa Douglas is a full time Travel Writer and Blogger who has been traveling the World solo for 6 years and believes in pushing the boundaries of solo female travel.

36,QUEER VOICES,Electronica Hitmaker Gryffin: Musicians 'Being True' To Sexual Identity Is 'Huge',"Pollo Del Mar , ContributorDrag queen on the SF social, political, editorial and fundrais...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/electronica-hitmaker-gryffin-musicians-being-true_us_59d8ff82e4b0705dc79aa84c,Gryffin achieved arguably his greatest success to date earlier this year with “Feel Good.” Featuring fellow Bay Area-raised,2017-10-07,"<p>Music producer and DJ Gryffin has launched his “ambitious,” multi-city North American “Castle in the Sky” Tour.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d900a42d00002b0030921a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Growing up just a short drive from San Francisco inspired Dan Griffith’s strong appreciation for diversity. Now those influences — from the Bay Area’s broad ethnic and social spectrum to its eclectic music scene — have helped shape the producer known as Gryffin into one of electronica’s hottest new tastemakers. “I admire working with different cultures and backgrounds,” Gryffin told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl, “They bring something different to the table I might not bring on my own.”Since launching his professional career in 2014 — initially through remixes for major pop artists — the majority of Gryffin’s work has centered around foreign-based acts. He gave new life to “Talking Body” by Swedish singer Tove Lo and reworked “Desire” by British band Years & Years. Finally in 2016, the multi-instrumentalist opted to stake his claim as a solo artist. Gryffin’s debut “Heading Home,” a No. 1 single on the Spotify Viral 50 Chart, showcased vocals by Australian singer Josef Salvat. The trend continued with sophomore release “Whole Heart,” a Top 20 hit on Billboard’s “Dance Club Play” chart featuring Britain’s BiPolar Sunshine.“There’s definitely a different vibe that they bring to the table,” said the producer when asked about his overwhelming affinity for international collaborations, a pattern even he had never noticed.“I guess there is just something that stands out to me from them artistically that makes me want to work with them,” Gryffin told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “Maybe it is because they are from different cultures and backgrounds, and I find the difference inspiring.”Working with others from around the world contributes to each recording being “special” and having “a unique quality,” Gryffin said. According to the producer, the musical approach of global artists varies significantly from what is common practice at home.“Even their recording process — they don’t want auto tune on their vocals, because they want to keep it more raw and organic,” he shared. “They push back on certain things...things creatively that are just so different than the U.S.”LISTEN: Gryffin Feat. Sinead Harnett “Love in Ruins”Gryffin’s appreciation for the value of artistic differences and individual life experiences, and how those shape music, extends beyond ethnicity and nationality though. Early life in the Bay Area exposed him to a spectrum of sexual orientations and identities as well, he said. “I’ve always been open to and accepting of that,” Gryffin said of the LGBTQ influences the Bay Area provided. “That’s a part of why I am so grateful your community has accepted me.” “I’ve made a lot of music, actually, which features artists who are publicly gay — like Troye Sivan and Oly Alexander of Years & Years,” he continued. “Working with them has been an awesome experience for me. It really opened the door for my music to be heard by the community.”Gryffin, who is heterosexual, commends Sivan and Alexander for their authenticity. Calling it “awesome for an artist” to be honest about sexual identity, he is “in full support” of both.“First of all, he is being true to himself and his own artistic and personal integrity, which is huge,” said Gryffin specifically of Sivan, whose hit single “Youth” he remixed to great acclaim in 2016. “I think he is giving people within the community confidence as well, to be like ‘This is who I am,’” he continued. “That’s a beautiful thing. I’m all about Troye doing that, and Oly does that as well.”LISTEN: Gryffin Discusses Troye Sivan, Oly Alexander, TouringGryffin achieved arguably his greatest success to date earlier this year with “Feel Good.” Featuring fellow Bay Area-raised DJ and producer Illenium and Grammy-winning vocalist Daya — the first two American-based collaborators of his solo career — the hit returned Gryffin to the US Dance Charts Top 20. However, as he embarks on his “very ambitious” 56 city “Castle in the Sky” North American headlining tour, Gryffin has again turned his attentions to a project incorporating foreign-born talent. Latest single “Love in Ruins” features Londoner Sinéad Harnett.Gryffin first became “a fan” of Harnett after one of her guest appearances on tracks by Disclosure, the electronic outfit whose global smash “Latch” helped popularize Sam Smith. Around the time of “Heading Home,” he says, they began work on the new single. Unfortunately, it was placed on a back burner until recently.“It’s funny with music, because sometimes it takes forever for a song to come out — for so many reasons,” Gryffin said. “Whether it’s the label or the other artist you’re working with has their own project, things get delayed so often.”After nearly 18 months on the shelf, though, Gryffin still felt an attachment to the song and decided to release it. International support for “Love in Ruins” continues to grow, and an extensive new package of remixes — plus his tour — is sure to only build interest. “It emphasizes making quality records that last, because you ultimately never know when it’s going to come out,” Gryffin said of the track sounding as fresh now as when it was first recorded.“Trends in music change so much,” he concluded, “But [my goal is] to fundamentally have a good record that’s going to resonate and last, no matter what the time you put it out.”For More Info, Visit Gryffin’s Site.LISTEN: Gryffin Discusses Music, Career, Diversity on Party Foul Radio"

The problem is, even believers don’t always show up for church. Dismayed by how low environmental concerns like climate change, pollution and pipelines rank on surveys of voter priorities, Stinnett founded the nonpartisan Environmental Voter Project three years ago on the hunch that a substantial number of people care about environmental issues and are registered to vote, but don’t show up on Election Day. The veteran Boston-based campaign strategist developed a formula for identifying these voters. He builds profiles based on consumer demographic and behavioral data, then runs a series of polls to verify the data and find out how likely voters are to list environmental causes among their top two political priorities. Stinnett and his team of three sift through the survey reponses to identify patterns. After that, they run those profiles through a model that scores voters based on how likely they are to be so-called “super environmentalists.” Finally, they cut out people whose public voting records show they turn out for most elections. What’s left is a group of registered voters who don’t need to be sold on the reality of climate change or the dangers of air pollution ― they just need to be convinced to get to the polls. “We’re laser-focused on creating an army of environmental super voters who will drive the agenda at the local, state and federal levels,” Stinnett told HuffPost. “Driving all of these environmentalists into the electorate is going to have an enormous impact on policy-making.”Stinnett put his system to the test in a Boston city council election in November 2015, targeting roughly 25,000 voters he had identified as likely to list environmental issues as a top concern, but unlikely to cast a ballot. He set aside a small control group and hit the rest of the nonvoters with the full treatment ― door-to-door canvassing, digital ads, mailers, emails, texts and phone-bank calls. He saw a 4.8 percent increase in turnout compared to the control group.Four months later, he did the same thing with a group of around 70,000 voters in Boston and its surrounding suburbs. Turnout in that group increased 5.1 percent compared to the control group. Then came the big test ― last November’s presidential election. His three-person team targeted 150,000 voters across the entire state of Massachusetts. They found a 4.7 percent bump in turnout among targeted voters compared to those who didn’t receive the canvassing. “That’s the one we’re most proud of,” Stinnett said. “People who don’t vote in presidential elections pretty much don’t vote in anything.” The Environmental Voter Project expanded its work to Georgia earlier this year for the closely-watched special election for the state’s 6th District. It has yet to fully quantify its efforts there, but is already planning to expand to other states. The group now plans to launch in Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where it has identified 2.4 million “non-voting super environmentalists.” All four states are likely to be key battlegrounds in the 2018 midterm and gubernatorial elections, but Stinnett’s goal isn’t to secure victories for specific candidates.“We’re not an election-winning organization, we’re an electorate-changing organization,” he said. In that sense, Stinnett’s most critical metric of success comes from the roughly 15,000 voters targeted in every election in Massachusetts since the Environmental Voter Project began nearly two years ago. Compared to the control group, those voters turned out at a 12.1 percent higher rate across all of the elections combined.“We want them to vote as often as NRA members do,” Stinnett said, referring to the National Rifle Association’s record of registering its members to vote and mobilizing them to cast their ballots for certain candidates, who tend to win after receiving NRA support. “Environmental voters have the potential to overwhelm the electorate.”The NRA only spends about $3 million a year on lobbying, but the group spurs its members to be politically active. In one study cited by The New Yorker, gun rights supporters were four times more likely to have donated money or written to a politician than people who favored stricter permits on guns. The Environmental Voter Project, by contrast, depends on fastidiously tested data and old-fashioned peer pressure.While the group focuses on people who have demonstrated sympathies for the environmental movement, its get-out-the-vote materials barely mention the environment. The Environmental Voter Project’s name makes clear what it stands for, but Stinnett focuses instead on the need to vote in mailers, emails and scripts provided to phone bank volunteers. The group tests its messaging as rigorously as it does its targets. “Even people who never vote still buy into the societal norm that voting is a good thing,” Stinnett said. The pitch usually goes something like this: “Did you know the last time there was a city council election, 93 people on your block of Main Street voted? Whether you vote or not is public record. There’s an election Tuesday, and we know it’s important for you to be a good voter. We’ll follow up after the election to see how your experience was at the polls.”“I’m not ashamed to admit that we use shame,” Stinnett said. “I readily admit that that’s a little aggressive, but it works.”Stinnett’s initial success has attracted ardent supporters. Charlie Baker III, the former chief administrative officer of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, became an early donor. “In the last cycle, they meaningfully increased turnout,” Baker, president and co-founder of the strategy firm Dewey Square Group, told HuffPost. “One of the hardest things to do is to get people who don’t normally vote to vote. And they’re tackling the toughest of the toughest in terms of people who passionately care about the environment but don’t have a solid voting history.”The Environmental Voter Project has advanced with very little funding. It raised $400,000 through online crowdfunding ahead of its launch, and another $1.1 million from 1,509 individual contributions in the last two years. The largest donations came from billionaire investor Jeremy Grantham, who has recently focused his philanthropy on “trying to buy time for the world to wake up” to climate change. The projected combined budget for 2017 and 2018 is $2 million, though Stinnett said that could increase if donations continue to grow. “We had to revise twice in the last five to six months because we’re getting good results and people are increasingly excited about what we’re doing,” he said. That may sound like a lot, but compared to other nonprofits doing similar work, it amounts to peanuts. The League of Conservation Voters raised nearly $11.5 million in 2015 and spent $45 million on the 2016 election. Earthjustice, which doesn’t spend on elections, had a 2017 budget of about $51.5 million. For Sambhav Sankar, a senior technology adviser at The Nature Conservancy, donating to the Environmental Voter Project felt like investing in “a durable movement” with a longer outlook than most other green advocacy groups. “All of them chase the next election or the next six months, but don’t know how to think about this long term,” Sankar told HuffPost. “This guy is doing exactly the opposite.”Despite how counterintuitive the Environmental Voter Project’s model may be in environmental politics, Stinnett argues for its mission with simple logic. “We’ve already won the battle for the hearts and minds. Now we just need to do the easiest thing and take 20 minutes out of our day once or twice a year and vote,” Stinnett said. “It’s a heck of a lot easier than getting a climate skeptic to change his or her mind.” "

Best time to catch up on emails.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d915652d00009e17309239.jpg?ops=crop_810_140_3222_2884%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"My psychiatrist told me this week that even working moms today spend more time with their kids than stay-at-home moms did in the 1950s. To be honest, I could use a little dose of throwback parenting. I’d love to be like those moms, sipping gin and tonics together on the porch in their tennis dresses while their kids ran around the neighborhood until dinnertime. Instead, I’m hunched over my phone, my fingers flying trying to keep up with eight million kid-related emails, while simultaneously trying to have “quality time” with whichever kid I’m currently dropping off somewhere. How did we go from there to here?! Those moms wouldn’t be able to survive an afternoon in today’s parenting framework.Now in 2017, I’m a typical mom on the verge of a nervous breakdown. With four kids at three schools in New York City, I have to work full-time just to keep up with everything. Mind you some of these are things I’ve created as problems for myself, like why did I sign them up for football, gymnastics, soccer and animal care class if it’s so stressful for me to get them all there on time? But how could I not?!! I’d be missing an enriching childhood experience! My kids would be deprived! Behind! Under-stimulated! AHHHH! Never mind the fact that in the unstructured time at home, they’re almost never bored. The other day my little ones spent over an hour pulling each other around the living room on a broom laughing hysterically. The laundry “claw” is the hottest “toy” we have. My inbox is a joke. Every class has a curriculum night, a parents’ cocktail party, a mom’s coffee or drinks session and parent-teacher conference. All classes have some sort of special snack, event or donation that would be absolutely and totally life-ending for my kids if I forgot it, like bringing in a stuffed animal for chapel or donating the box of required rice (rice!! I’m not kidding!) for the school picnic. I just added an iCal event for the days when Eli the stuffed elephant will be coming home from school with us. Those 1950s moms didn’t even have email!Plus, it’s not just their schools. Every single activity now seems to have an orientation, a parent viewing class (with medals!) and required outfit changes. “This week, wear black shorts and a white t-shirt!” Why?! Why?!!! Class trips, chaperoning field trips, picture day, dress up day, dress down day, PA meetings, class meetings, the food allergy affinity group meeting, the winter carnival kick-off. I have so many overlapping events on my calendar that I can’t even see what’s underneath it all. Plus all the apps and group shares I have to subscribe to so I can, say, watch my daughter’s science class in action or monitor my son’s homework assignments. God forbid I add anything for myself in my calendar, even like get myself to the dentist for that tooth that’s been electrifying me every time I eat for the past six months. And hmm, why would I be eating? The stress of the 24/7 parenting vortex hardly ever ends, except, at least for me, from 9:30 pm after my oldest goes to bed, until around 11 pm when my youngest starts coming in my room saying he needs more water or my little daughter sneaks in to start spooning me. I could use that time to bond with my husband or deal with the six thousand digital photos I need to do something with, but instead I usually hit the pantry. My go to's right now are vanilla animal crackers. With a shot of tequila. Speaking of drinking, I’ve never felt so dependent on an evening glass of wine. The other day, my doctor had to put me on an antibiotic, because at some point my body starts breaking down. “But,” the doctor said, “you can’t drink for three days when you’re on it.” I waited to take that antibiotic for almost two weeks until I could bear to part with my coveted evening drink.I used to love to work out but with the kids’ athletic practices and sports classes, my workouts now are just getting there. I know even 30 minutes on an elliptical would make me feel better, but usually once I hop on, I have to field calls from the school nurse, the doctor’s offices confirming appointments, or other essentials until I realize I haven’t even heard a single song on the headphones I retrieved from my older daughter’s trash heap of a desk drawer and it’s time to pick up my little son from school.I am beat. I am throwing in the towel: you know, the one with my daughter’s pre-printed name tag label affixed on it. I can’t do it all anymore. I can’t remember the Kids in Sports t-shirt on Tuesday afternoons - or is it Mondays? I can’t remember to get perfect birthday gifts for kids’ parties, not to mention my own friends and family. I can’t rush from reading them books at bedtime to another class cocktail party, then back to do spelling quizzes and greatest common factor math homework with my big kids. (What did that math term even mean?!!) I don’t even have time to shave my legs anymore. Mani/pedis? We’re talking annually. Forget my eyebrows. Somehow I still manage to look put together, but inside I’m a mess.There has only been one night in the last four years that no kids have woken me up, at least on my days. And by “my days,” I should throw in that the stress of the four kids didn’t exactly help my first marriage so I also have custody schedules, packing for different houses and interacting with my ex while simultaneously celebrating my recent wedding. The other morning in bed, as I reached over to check email and started responding about a kids’ playdate while digesting another note from my ex, my new hubby reached over and tried to put his hand up my shirt. Are you kidding me? I’m like in mom ninja warrior mode here!In fact, with the two little ones coming in every night no matter what failed methods I’ve tried to get them to stay in their beds, it’s practically impossible to have sex. How do any relationships survive this parenting overdrive? I know I’m “lucky” in that my new husband and I get to spend time together every other weekend when my ex has the kids, but I swear, if we didn’t, I don’t know how we’d survive. And I’m madly in love with him. Having kids today (perhaps worse with multiple kids, perhaps worse in the city, but who knows?!) is a recipe for marital discord and psychological catastrophe. But what can be cut out? I’m not sure. Maybe moms could tag team some of the events, like “Hey, you go to curriculum night and write my kid a note and I’ll take both our parent-teacher conferences?” Maybe we could ask the schools to tone down the communications and events. Maybe I should just start skipping it all. But then I’d never get to interact with anyone who doesn’t watch “Paw Patrol.” Maybe I should kick up my heels and talk to my friends on the phone, 1950’s style, while the kids zone out in front of the TV. I almost never get to talk to my friends anymore except the ones doing the same drop-offs and pick-ups, but thank god for those moms because without a little venting, I wouldn’t be able to make it through each day. Because the thing is, I had all these kids because I adore kids, especially mine, and I just want to be with them, snuggle with them, laugh with them, play. I don’t want to be so wrapped up in managing their lives that I can’t just sit on the floor in the afternoon and have a tea party. That’s why I signed up for the stay-at-home-mom gig, not to use my MBA skills to organize class car pools.I think there needs to be a movement to reclaim a mother’s (or father’s!) right to sanity, even a mother’s right to just to play with the kids without getting hopelessly behind on texts and emails. A mother’s right not to constantly deal with school reminders, newsletters and lice check alerts. I don’t want to be so busy all the time being a full-time kid-manager than I can’t just be with the kids. Parenting shouldn’t be this much of an office job, every day filled with forms and sign-ups, spreadsheets and logisitics management. Moms need a break from it all so we can be good moms, the caregivers we long to be, not stressed executives at home too. Yesterday, I got a school email to bring in empty toilet paper rolls. No. No! I’m not doing it. I just can’t do it anymore. I’m taking my kids to the neighborhood bookstore for an hour to read and color, play and just be with them. If that makes me a bad class mom, sign me up.

The burger, which includes a soy-based patty, will be available at the location from Oct. 4 through Nov. 21, according to Business Insider.Several vegan burger enthusiasts have already posted photos of the sandwich on social media.McDonald’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost. However, a representative told Today that the company does not have any plans to sell the McVegan outside of Finland. The chain already offers some vegetarian burger options internationally, in countries including Germany and India.This article has been updated to note that McDonald’s offers vegetarian burgers in other countries."

Additionally, breeders who care about the wellbeing of their animals will want to make sure they go to good homes. That means they typically will not want to sell animals through pet stores or other means that don’t allow them to meet potential buyers."

It starts with a horrific, mass shooting. People call for better gun control. Nothing happens. Another mass shooting happens. And the cycle repeats itself, causing the loss of more innocent lives at the hands of someone who was too easily able to access a deadly weapon.This week’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, which saw 59 people dead and over 500 injured, was the worst in American history. In June 2016, 49 people were killed in the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. In December 2012, 28 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut. After mass shootings, satire site The Onion publishes the same article with the same headline: “‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Happens Regularly.” Although they change the details and location of the story, it’s the same every time—because after every mass shooting, a conversation ensues about the need for better gun control laws but little, if anything, ends up happening. Barack Obama spoke passionately about the need for gun control, especially in the wake of Sandy Hook. But he had to use executive action to make progress because of the Republican congress. Barely a week after Donald Trump’s Inauguration, his new administration was already revoking certain gun control policies set out by Obama.It’s unthinkable, really, that after young children were shot and killed, legislation making it harder to purchase guns still couldn’t pass. Even in addition to the terrible mass shootings, there are examples of gun violence every day in America. Mass shootings (defined as an incident in which four or more people are killed, which can include the shooter) average out to more than one every day in America. In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Vox published an article containing 17 infographics that paint an eye-opening picture of America’s problem with guns. Two infographics tell an important story: that the states that have more guns have more deaths caused by guns; and that the states that have tighter laws around gun-control have less deaths caused by guns.Want more proof that gun control works? Check out the example set by Australia—the government banned automatic and semiautomatic firearms after a shooting where 35 people were killed in 1996. Australia hasn’t had a mass shooting since (again, a mass shooting is defined as an incident where four or more die). To summarize: if laws make it harder for people to get guns, then there are less guns out there and less people die from guns. It’s not that complicated, except some people make it out to be.Some say that the debate around gun control is a debate around the second amendment; the right to bear arms. But at its core, the debate around gun control is a debate about people’s lives—the tragic events in Las Vegas, along with all of the other examples in American history, are proof of this. When people attending a concert, enjoying a night out with friends or going to school are targeted, injured and killed, gun control is a question of life or death.I’m 19 and there have been far too many mass shootings in my time on this Earth. I’m not American, but I don’t want young people in the U.S. to grow up in a place where they have to be fearful for their safety. I’ve had discussions with friends where we talk about the fact that, because of shootings in public places, we’re always conscious of checking emergency exits in crowded areas. It’s good to be vigilant, of course, but I don’t think anyone should have to be concerned about something like gun violence when there are legitimate options on the table to reduce its prevalence.In the days since the Vegas shooting, there have been conversations about gun control. Jimmy Kimmel made a tearful plea for action; social media has been awash with people fed up with the lack of anti-gun legislation. We need to leverage the sadness, anger and frustration we feel after the senseless violence in Las Vegas, and we need to demand action and accountability from America’s elected leaders. Thoughts and prayers are wonderful, but they are not enough when people are dying and it is in the power of the American government to prevent their deaths."

It began in Australia and was officially launched in Vienna in 2007.“We live in a world where the risk of nuclear weapons being used is greater than it has been for a long time,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.In July, 122 nations adopted a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, although the agreement does not include nuclear-armed states such as the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.“This award shines a needed light on the path the ban treaty provides toward a world free of nuclear weapons. Before it is too late, we must take that path,” ICAN said in a statement on its Facebook page.“This is a time of great global tension, when fiery rhetoric could all too easily lead us, inexorably, to unspeakable horror. The specter of nuclear conflict looms large once more. If ever there were a moment for nations to declare their unequivocal opposition to nuclear weapons, that moment is now.” The Nobel prize seeks to bolster the case of disarmament amid nuclear tensions between the United States and North Korea and uncertainty over the fate of a 2015 deal between Iran and major powers to limit Tehran’s nuclear program.The Iran deal is seen as under threat after U.S. President Donald Trump called it the “worst deal ever negotiated”. A senior administration official said on Thursday that Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the pact, a step toward potentially unwinding it.The committee raised eyebrows with its decision to award the prize to an international campaign group with a relatively low profile, rather than giving it to the architects of the Iran deal, who had been widely seen as favorites after hammering out a complex agreement over years of high-stakes diplomacy.“Norwegian Nobel Committee has its own ways, but the nuclear agreement with Iran achieved something real and would have deserved a prize,” tweeted Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister who has held top posts as an international diplomat.The leader of the Norwegian Nobel committee denied that the prize was “a kick in the leg” for Trump and said the prize was a call to states that have nuclear weapons to fulfill earlier pledges to work toward disarmament.“The message is to remind them to the commitment they have already made that they have to work for a nuclear free world,” Reiss-Andersen told Reuters.The United Nations said the award would help bolster efforts to get the 55 ratifications by countries for the U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to come into force.“I hope this prize will be conducive for the entry into force of this treaty,” U.N. Chief Spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci told a news briefing."

To this day, many people in the areas hardest hit by the storm are still struggling to put their lives back together.The recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico killed several hundred people and displaced or otherwise affected many thousands more. They are at the beginning of a long and difficult journey that will require courage, resilience, and the support of an array of government and private disaster relief programs. Among these are nonprofit legal services groups like ours that in the last several years have become recognized as a vital social service in the immediate and long-term aftermath of a natural disaster.When Sandy hit our shores on October 29, 2012 we had no capacity, and no real understanding of what it would take to build a storm response legal team. But within days we were able to confer with legal services organizations on the Gulf Coast who shared what they had learned after Hurricane Katrina. They advised us on how to gear up to help victims unable to afford an attorney to navigate various relief programs, do battle with insurance companies and begin the long process of making repairs.Five years later, with the support of a cadre of pro bono lawyers from the private bar, we have assisted clients in New York City and on Long island with more than 13,000 legal matters, a number that continues to rise as people still find themselves dealing with local recovery programs, flood insurance claims, rampant contractor fraud and other storm-related problems. Recently, we had the opportunity to pay forward the invaluable support we received from our legal services colleagues in Louisiana and elsewhere by conducting post-disaster legal services training programs for legal services groups in Texas and Florida that reviewed FEMA and the other major federal relief programs, significant potential legal issues, and longer-term recovery issues. (We are still formulating the best way to be of assistance to our peers in Puerto Rico.)The back-to-back-to-back devastation we saw in the span of just a few weeks this September is a stark reminder that our coastal areas continue to remain at risk. Due to the billions of dollars of debt the National Flood Insurance Program has incurred in recent years, flood insurance rates have increased and will continue to rise. Homeowners should take advantage of programs and services that can help them prepare now for future floods that are expected to occur due to sea levels rising. FloodHelpNY, for example, is funded by the New York Governor’s Office of Storm and Recovery and provides elevation certificates and flood insurance counseling free-of-charge to inform New York City homeowners about how they can protect their home and finances from future floods.Recovering from a disaster is time consuming, requires a great deal of work and an ample amount of patience. If it happens to you, here are some key things we have learned that can help make a terrible situation a little more bearable:Be Organized: Make note of filing deadlines and photograph and videotape damages and retain all records. (Most of the disputes we are handing now, five years out, have to do with missing documentation.) Thoroughly document repair efforts on an on-going basis and keep and organize receipts – your future recovery depends upon it.Be Proactive: Call FEMA, the Small Business Administration and other agencies early and often to try to resolve problems before they get worse. Don’t rely on the first answer you receive.Plan for a long haul: Be prepared for substantial insurance and contractor disputes that will cut across multiple interacting issues. Five years after Sandy, we have plenty of clients who are still suing or being sued.Most important: Find a lawyer versed in disaster legal services. If you cannot afford an attorney, there are several hundred non-profits, pro bono programs, court-based services, and others across the US that may be able to help. www.lawhelp.org is a good resource to help you find one."

A flawless cast led by The Leftovers’ Carrie Coon brings to gorgeously odd life the story of a mother whose devotion to her son breaks the limits of reason, bleeding into something either mad or profound. Pairing a deceptive lightness with fearless emotional directness, this exploration of the heights and depths humans are capable of is layered atop ordinary details of daily existence in a way that feels both familiar and startling.Mary Jane’s multiply award-winning director, Anne Kauffman, a cofounder of the Civilians theater group, has earned a reputation as a helmer skilled at creating the perfect stage language for boldly original works, including Detroit, Slowgirl and Maple and Vine. The director spoke with me by phone about past, present and future art.Congratulations on the exquisite production of “Mary Jane.” It's a miracle when everything comes together so magically. Have you had that happen a lot? Anne Kauffman: No, I have not had that happen a lot. And we theater people are just, we’re after that rush, you know what I mean? We kill ourselves to get that, and it's so infrequent that it happens. You wonder how we can stand the rest of the time.What do you do when it doesn't happen—or do you always see glimpses of it?I think so. If it’s worth it, it’s pursued, then there’s something—it sounds Pollyanna-ish, but there's a part of it that feels like that, hopefully. I would say it’s more rare for me to feel that there's nothing redeemable about a piece.When did you first know that theater was for you? I don’t think I’ve ever not known. I can’t remember, really, a time—I actually did stuff in grade school, and then I didn’t do any of it in high school, because I followed in my sisters’ footsteps—I’m one of six children, and I’m number five out of six, so I often say that probably my exhibitionism is a huge part of why I went [into it], and the need for attention. But when I was in high school, I was a cheerleader, I was in student government—I was one of those types.Your exhibitionism may have led you to the theater as an actor, but directing is selfless. You’re giving yourself over to others, serving everyone else, the writer and the actors. But we also like control, which I realize is another part of my personality. I think I figured out in college that I wasn't the star, the musical theater star, that I hoped I would be. I also found I sort of lost interest—just focusing on one thing grew dull to me. Something about the challenge of being responsible for the entire orchestration of things was the thing that actually really kept me engaged, and satisfied my need to dig in and organize and orchestrate and bring a vision—whatever that vision was—to life.How did you come to directing?I took a class in undergrad, I'm not sure why—it was terrifying to me. It's still terrifying, directing is a terrifying pursuit. It's an impossible thing that we do, and it's way overwhelming, and it's really the reason to do it too, like I said, it's really the thing that keeps me fully engaged, to be overwhelmed. I don't really understand why I started doing it, but I think I directed something in my dorm [at Stanford], and then I took a class, and I remember very distinctly the professor pulled me aside one day and said, ""How does it feel to be a director?"" And I found that astonishing, just out of control. Like some sort of mantle had been placed on my shoulders that was both exhilarating and hugely burdensome. It was a very exciting moment.From school in California, how did you find your way to New York City? I'm actually from Phoenix, Arizona. When each of us graduated from the eighth grade, my dad would take each of us, on our own, to our first trip back east, so he took us to New York City and Washington, D.C. And there were several things that we were put through in order to earn the trip. We had to memorize the preamble to the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights. This was in the days when you could actually walk up the Statue of Liberty, so every night we'd do squats in my parents’ bedroom to get ready to go up. And in New York, every night and every matinee, we went to go see a show. I remember really not liking New York City because we went in the summer when it was very humid and disgusting and crowded and horrible. But when I went to the theater I was just, I was 13 years old and I already had aspirations. We would go home to the hotel after the shows and I would cry myself to sleep. I was very passionate about it—despite the humidity and the disgusting pollution and the stench at that time—that was 1982.Is it strange to find yourself now doing the thing that transported you?I think about this so much. I think about that girl and I think about how hard, how challenging the road is to become a director, I think about that every single day. I’m never far from it–I feel very close to not making it. It’s so precarious, because there truly is no path. The path to director, each of us is creating our own path, we’re trailblazing our own, because no one’s getting there the exact same way.Particularly for women, it feels like it’s almost impossible to have opportunities.There’s more of us who are in a greater position of influence, but yeah, definitely, the ratio is not what it should be, that’s for sure.How did this project come to you? Is there some particular thing you look for in the plays you want to do?In this particular instance, Amy Herzog and I worked together on a play called Belleville a few years ago. I establish relationships with playwrights, so pretty much if someone like Amy Herzog—and Amy Herzog in particular, I would say—comes to me with a play, I’m pretty predisposed to say yes. She’s such an extraordinary writer and just an extraordinary human being. She’s a very sly writer, because it seems as though she’s a mainstream writer, but in fact she’s quite experimental. This play is extraordinary on so many levels: she’s playing with so many different levels of genre and consciousness and pursuit and text. She’s an astonishing thinker and writer. Honestly, I had no idea—I was like, “Okay, Amy, sure, let’s do this play, this is a difficult play, it’s a difficult emotional play.” And even I who know Amy very well can take her work at face value, when in fact it has nothing to do with face value. It all lives underneath. So I didn’t really know what I was in for. When we did this at Yale, we did the production that I thought was there, and we did it well. Revisiting it—it’s extraordinary when you know you’ll have another chance; to have that second chance, which we got with Belleville too—it flowered in a completely different way. My interaction with it and its profound effect on me—it opened up even more. You know, the high holidays were this past week, and I haven’t been to synagogue, it’s got to be 10 years. And this year, after working on Amy’s play and talking to a very particular rabbi about the Hasidic woman in the play, I was like, “I need to go to synagogue!” [Laughs] Because the play is actually in such complex pursuit of spirituality and what it is to become—who you were, who you are now, and what it is to become in your next iteration—it made me go to temple!I would get more meaning from the play than temple, but that’s just me.The combination of going back to synagogue and having a very particular experience there, and merging how I felt like our rehearsals were like a kind of philosophical rumination—combining what it felt like in the rehearsal room with these particular women talking about the stuff that we were talking about, in conjunction with temple—this is going to sound very crazy, but I actually figured out, finally, my interpretation of God. [After] many, many years of people being like, “Do you believe in God? Do you believe in God?” and [my saying], “There’s probably a higher power, I don’t know what it is,” but completely avoiding and avoiding and avoiding it, suddenly it was like, “Oh, that’s what it is!” And it’s very simple and very clear to me, and very reassuring. [Pause] If I tell Amy I found God going to temple because of the show, she’s going to laugh at me.I can see the play leading you to that conclusion. In essence it is a pure portrait of love and devotion. It’s so unwavering in its pursuit of what’s real, no matter how difficult; it looks it in the eye. One of the reasons Mary Jane is such a remarkable character is that she doesn’t flinch from anything. We’re accustomed to characters who are too cheerful in the face of horrors, we think of them as deluded, and Mary Jane is transcendent. She is fearless in everything she addresses, and naked in her emotions and honesty, and it leaves an indelible mark because it’s so powerful. You just came off of directing Scott McPherson’s “Marvin’s Room” on Broadway. I remember seeing the original and thinking there were good things about it, but when I saw your production, I realized what a great play it is. I wasn’t prepared for how much I liked it, how both of your movie stars gave such beautiful performances, far beyond what I thought either was capable of. I didn’t even recognize the voices they were using, the lightness and the nuance—and of course the young man was remarkable. I know it probably did not do as well as it deserved to do. Did you feel a lot of pressure going into that production? Was it scary to go to Broadway?You know, it’s funny, it was not scary. It’s taken me a long time to get there. It’s also nonprofit Broadway, so it has a different kind of feel to it—I haven’t done commercial Broadway, so I don’t really know. But it felt like a very comfortable graduation. You know, I came to New York when Marvin’s Room was originally produced in New York—I like to think that both Scott and I made our move at the same time [laughs]. That genre of theatre, that’s what I was raised on, the kind of wacky sense of humor, with darkness. He’s not quite as strange as Harry Kondoleon, but I feel like he shares the absurdity.Grounded in emotion, addressing meaningful things.So I was very happy to do that. Of course, my tastes have changed, and my sensibility is different, but I love the idea that I’m someone who directs Amy Herzog’s play and brings that sensibility to a Scott McPherson play that was done in the ’90s—because that’s what that production was for me; I felt like I was exploring the more ruminatory aspects of it. Also, doing that play right before doing Mary Jane—actually, that play was sandwiched between the Yale production of Mary Jane and the New York Theatre Workshop production of Mary Jane, so I was sort of dumped into the deep end of caretaking, and women who are caretakers. Putting caretaking and disability at the center of a piece and looking right at it is something that we do not do in this country, and Scott McPherson, by gosh, he did that. He did. Laura Jellinek, who did the set for A Life and for Marvin’s Room and for Mary Jane, we were laughing, because we were working on two shows where a character who is ill is behind a wall. And what you experience are the reverberations of that human being who is so deeply loved by the people that we’re actually seeing roam around the stage. You see that person very much in the DNA of the people we’re looking at, but it’s not about that person, just like Mary Jane’s not about [her son] Alex, it’s about Mary Jane.If you could do anything at all, what would it be?I would like to revisit Spring Awakening, the actual play. The play is so much darker than the musical. It has everything that I love about the theater in it. Another thing I’m working on very passionately and diligently is to bring The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window, the Lorraine Hansberry play that I did in Chicago, to New York. It’s a beautiful play.I don’t know it at all. What’s your next adventure?I’m doing the next show at the New York Theatre Workshop, which is a theatrical concert called Hundred Days by the Bengsons, who are a husband-and-wife composing-musician team. And then we’re doing their next project at Ars Nova in the winter. They’re an extraordinary duo, and they make beautiful work. And it continues in the tradition of the darkness that I explore.The dark time we’re living in is so surreal. Each day somebody dies too young, I think, “Trump killed him/her,” because the added stress and aggravation and horror and anxiety, I just feel, is pressing down on all of us. Does it ever seem like doing art is a luxury we can’t afford in these dire times?I find that art is a pretty important part of the ecosystem of a society. I think of it as a necessity. I don’t think my work can change the world, but I think it’s a necessary part of the conversation. I said yesterday to a group of people: “I’m so lucky, because I’m not a policymaker, I don’t have to make policy, I don’t have to make decisions. But what I do do, what I’m committed to doing is presenting and reminding people of the complexities of who we are as human beings, so that when those policymakers are making those policies, that they remember, they look before they leap.” That is, I think, the role of art—to remember ourselves to us, and to complexify things that are so black-and-white. Certainly Trump is making things black-and-white. But in order to make a decision, things have to kind of come down to a black-and-white situation. Gradations of gray are a difficult thing, but they have to go into the decision-making. And that’s what I think art does. It remembers that."

A flawless cast led by The Leftovers’ Carrie Coon brings to gorgeously odd life the story of a mother whose devotion to her son breaks the limits of reason, bleeding into something either mad or profound. Pairing a deceptive lightness with fearless emotional directness, this exploration of the heights and depths humans are capable of is layered atop ordinary details of daily existence in a way that feels both familiar and startling.Mary Jane’s multiply award-winning director, Anne Kauffman, a cofounder of the Civilians theater group, has earned a reputation as a helmer skilled at creating the perfect stage language for boldly original works, including Detroit, Slowgirl and Maple and Vine. The director spoke with me by phone about past, present and future art.Congratulations on the exquisite production of “Mary Jane.” It's a miracle when everything comes together so magically. Have you had that happen a lot? Anne Kauffman: No, I have not had that happen a lot. And we theater people are just, we’re after that rush, you know what I mean? We kill ourselves to get that, and it's so infrequent that it happens. You wonder how we can stand the rest of the time.What do you do when it doesn't happen—or do you always see glimpses of it?I think so. If it’s worth it, it’s pursued, then there’s something—it sounds Pollyanna-ish, but there's a part of it that feels like that, hopefully. I would say it’s more rare for me to feel that there's nothing redeemable about a piece.When did you first know that theater was for you? I don’t think I’ve ever not known. I can’t remember, really, a time—I actually did stuff in grade school, and then I didn’t do any of it in high school, because I followed in my sisters’ footsteps—I’m one of six children, and I’m number five out of six, so I often say that probably my exhibitionism is a huge part of why I went [into it], and the need for attention. But when I was in high school, I was a cheerleader, I was in student government—I was one of those types.Your exhibitionism may have led you to the theater as an actor, but directing is selfless. You’re giving yourself over to others, serving everyone else, the writer and the actors. But we also like control, which I realize is another part of my personality. I think I figured out in college that I wasn't the star, the musical theater star, that I hoped I would be. I also found I sort of lost interest—just focusing on one thing grew dull to me. Something about the challenge of being responsible for the entire orchestration of things was the thing that actually really kept me engaged, and satisfied my need to dig in and organize and orchestrate and bring a vision—whatever that vision was—to life.How did you come to directing?I took a class in undergrad, I'm not sure why—it was terrifying to me. It's still terrifying, directing is a terrifying pursuit. It's an impossible thing that we do, and it's way overwhelming, and it's really the reason to do it too, like I said, it's really the thing that keeps me fully engaged, to be overwhelmed. I don't really understand why I started doing it, but I think I directed something in my dorm [at Stanford], and then I took a class, and I remember very distinctly the professor pulled me aside one day and said, ""How does it feel to be a director?"" And I found that astonishing, just out of control. Like some sort of mantle had been placed on my shoulders that was both exhilarating and hugely burdensome. It was a very exciting moment.From school in California, how did you find your way to New York City? I'm actually from Phoenix, Arizona. When each of us graduated from the eighth grade, my dad would take each of us, on our own, to our first trip back east, so he took us to New York City and Washington, D.C. And there were several things that we were put through in order to earn the trip. We had to memorize the preamble to the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights. This was in the days when you could actually walk up the Statue of Liberty, so every night we'd do squats in my parents’ bedroom to get ready to go up. And in New York, every night and every matinee, we went to go see a show. I remember really not liking New York City because we went in the summer when it was very humid and disgusting and crowded and horrible. But when I went to the theater I was just, I was 13 years old and I already had aspirations. We would go home to the hotel after the shows and I would cry myself to sleep. I was very passionate about it—despite the humidity and the disgusting pollution and the stench at that time—that was 1982.Is it strange to find yourself now doing the thing that transported you?I think about this so much. I think about that girl and I think about how hard, how challenging the road is to become a director, I think about that every single day. I’m never far from it–I feel very close to not making it. It’s so precarious, because there truly is no path. The path to director, each of us is creating our own path, we’re trailblazing our own, because no one’s getting there the exact same way.Particularly for women, it feels like it’s almost impossible to have opportunities.There’s more of us who are in a greater position of influence, but yeah, definitely, the ratio is not what it should be, that’s for sure.How did this project come to you? Is there some particular thing you look for in the plays you want to do?In this particular instance, Amy Herzog and I worked together on a play called Belleville a few years ago. I establish relationships with playwrights, so pretty much if someone like Amy Herzog—and Amy Herzog in particular, I would say—comes to me with a play, I’m pretty predisposed to say yes. She’s such an extraordinary writer and just an extraordinary human being. She’s a very sly writer, because it seems as though she’s a mainstream writer, but in fact she’s quite experimental. This play is extraordinary on so many levels: she’s playing with so many different levels of genre and consciousness and pursuit and text. She’s an astonishing thinker and writer. Honestly, I had no idea—I was like, “Okay, Amy, sure, let’s do this play, this is a difficult play, it’s a difficult emotional play.” And even I who know Amy very well can take her work at face value, when in fact it has nothing to do with face value. It all lives underneath. So I didn’t really know what I was in for. When we did this at Yale, we did the production that I thought was there, and we did it well. Revisiting it—it’s extraordinary when you know you’ll have another chance; to have that second chance, which we got with Belleville too—it flowered in a completely different way. My interaction with it and its profound effect on me—it opened up even more. You know, the high holidays were this past week, and I haven’t been to synagogue, it’s got to be 10 years. And this year, after working on Amy’s play and talking to a very particular rabbi about the Hasidic woman in the play, I was like, “I need to go to synagogue!” [Laughs] Because the play is actually in such complex pursuit of spirituality and what it is to become—who you were, who you are now, and what it is to become in your next iteration—it made me go to temple!I would get more meaning from the play than temple, but that’s just me.The combination of going back to synagogue and having a very particular experience there, and merging how I felt like our rehearsals were like a kind of philosophical rumination—combining what it felt like in the rehearsal room with these particular women talking about the stuff that we were talking about, in conjunction with temple—this is going to sound very crazy, but I actually figured out, finally, my interpretation of God. [After] many, many years of people being like, “Do you believe in God? Do you believe in God?” and [my saying], “There’s probably a higher power, I don’t know what it is,” but completely avoiding and avoiding and avoiding it, suddenly it was like, “Oh, that’s what it is!” And it’s very simple and very clear to me, and very reassuring. [Pause] If I tell Amy I found God going to temple because of the show, she’s going to laugh at me.I can see the play leading you to that conclusion. In essence it is a pure portrait of love and devotion. It’s so unwavering in its pursuit of what’s real, no matter how difficult; it looks it in the eye. One of the reasons Mary Jane is such a remarkable character is that she doesn’t flinch from anything. We’re accustomed to characters who are too cheerful in the face of horrors, we think of them as deluded, and Mary Jane is transcendent. She is fearless in everything she addresses, and naked in her emotions and honesty, and it leaves an indelible mark because it’s so powerful. You just came off of directing Scott McPherson’s “Marvin’s Room” on Broadway. I remember seeing the original and thinking there were good things about it, but when I saw your production, I realized what a great play it is. I wasn’t prepared for how much I liked it, how both of your movie stars gave such beautiful performances, far beyond what I thought either was capable of. I didn’t even recognize the voices they were using, the lightness and the nuance—and of course the young man was remarkable. I know it probably did not do as well as it deserved to do. Did you feel a lot of pressure going into that production? Was it scary to go to Broadway?You know, it’s funny, it was not scary. It’s taken me a long time to get there. It’s also nonprofit Broadway, so it has a different kind of feel to it—I haven’t done commercial Broadway, so I don’t really know. But it felt like a very comfortable graduation. You know, I came to New York when Marvin’s Room was originally produced in New York—I like to think that both Scott and I made our move at the same time [laughs]. That genre of theatre, that’s what I was raised on, the kind of wacky sense of humor, with darkness. He’s not quite as strange as Harry Kondoleon, but I feel like he shares the absurdity.Grounded in emotion, addressing meaningful things.So I was very happy to do that. Of course, my tastes have changed, and my sensibility is different, but I love the idea that I’m someone who directs Amy Herzog’s play and brings that sensibility to a Scott McPherson play that was done in the ’90s—because that’s what that production was for me; I felt like I was exploring the more ruminatory aspects of it. Also, doing that play right before doing Mary Jane—actually, that play was sandwiched between the Yale production of Mary Jane and the New York Theatre Workshop production of Mary Jane, so I was sort of dumped into the deep end of caretaking, and women who are caretakers. Putting caretaking and disability at the center of a piece and looking right at it is something that we do not do in this country, and Scott McPherson, by gosh, he did that. He did. Laura Jellinek, who did the set for A Life and for Marvin’s Room and for Mary Jane, we were laughing, because we were working on two shows where a character who is ill is behind a wall. And what you experience are the reverberations of that human being who is so deeply loved by the people that we’re actually seeing roam around the stage. You see that person very much in the DNA of the people we’re looking at, but it’s not about that person, just like Mary Jane’s not about [her son] Alex, it’s about Mary Jane.If you could do anything at all, what would it be?I would like to revisit Spring Awakening, the actual play.

In this RaiseAChild “Let Love Define Family®” series for HuffPost Queer Voices, contributing writer Beth Hallstrom shares the family building story of Victor and Randy Ray.""There's lots more laughter, noise and grocery shopping,"" Victor said. ""Our house is the teen house hangout and, let me tell you, teenage boys can eat! But that's how I always wanted my house to be.""Dallas residents for the past 28 years, Randy is a partner in a law firm while Victor retired as a mortgage loan officer when they welcomed their first child, a daughter who is now 15 and a sophomore in high school. They are also parents to a 13-year old son who is in the eighth grade. Both children were adopted as infants.“She is a writer and a reader who hopes to have her first book published before she gets out of high school. He is a gamer who dreams of a job as a game tester for Nintendo. They are both debaters due to their intellect and personalities. God help us,” Victor wryly said.Together for 31 years and married for 11, Victor and Randy met while performing in a community theater production of “Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” when they were both 26 years old.""When people ask how we met, I always say we met in a whorehouse. It stops conversation for a few awkward seconds,"" Victor said, laughing.The couple had been together for nearly 10 years before broaching the possibility of fatherhood, Victor recalled.""I always wanted kids, but, as a lot of gay men, there comes a point where you just decide it isn't going to happen for you because you're gay.""Once I realized my relationship was stable and long term, then it became a real possibility. It took Randy a bit longer to come to the realization that we could do it,"" he explained.Both families were very supportive of their adoption plans, Victor said, and they joke about the irony of the gay son producing the first grandchild.He remembered the night they brought their daughter home: ""Randy's mother was dying for grandchildren. Randy's parents arrived at our house about 20 minutes after us. I walked out to the driveway, handed her the baby and told her, 'I know you waited a long time, so I'm not going to make you wait until you get inside the house!'""They also found an advocate in their son's birth mother, who Victor described as, ""Dead set on a gay family because she knew that this was one of only ways they could have a baby.""According to Texas law at the time, Randy adopted the children as a single man and then created a conservatorship giving Victor half of the parental rights.Victor said he chose to take the surname Ray once they became Dads so everyone shared the same name. That decision made dealing with schools much easier, he noted.""And the irony is that they look like they could be my biological children. People always assume they are biological siblings because they look so much alike,"" he said.While Randy is busy with his law firm, Victor is a stay-at-home Dad who said their life today is typical-busy, crazy and wonderful. “Life is now laundry, school, homework, activities, friends, computer arguments. I wonder what I did with all my time before kids! There was a lot more traveling, spontaneous weekend getaways and definitely lots more sleep. But, life is fuller. Both good and bad,” Victor said.It’s this mix that makes parenthood so satisfying, Victor advised.“I tell people who say they want a baby that they don’t stay babies. They become argumentative little people who can actually argue logically. And then they become teenagers who won’t argue because they won’t talk to you.“If you want a child, don’t just focus on the ‘ooh/coo’ stage. Think about the hard stuff: the tears, the anger, the frustration on both their side and yours. The two things you should embrace are patience and laughter,” Victor explained.The security found when love and discipline work in tandem is the key to successful kids and a happy home, he continued.""Our children know that they are loved, but they also know what is expected of them. Lots of people who know us think our kids are extraordinary and they are.""They also clear their dishes, sort their laundry and make their beds every morning before they leave the house. They know we want them to be the best them they can be, but we don't require them to be the best.""When my kids ask me what I want them to be when they grow up, the only thing I say is 'happy,'"" he added.

I will, however, use them to administer proper weight to the notion that we are the sum of all that has come before us. From this, we cannot hide. Although sometimes, when it serves our purpose, we try with all our might.When Colin Kaepernick took a knee for the first time during the national anthem, he did so to bring attention to, in his mind, an epidemic of police brutality. I believe he knew that although it was a peaceful attempt at protest, it was indeed a quiet riot destined to be met by a legion of misunderstanding. A hurricane of hatred and bigotry. A history driven need not to see the forest for the trees.Now, “the knee” seems to have nothing to do with the death of Philando Castile and others. Now, much of white America is screaming that Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are unpatriotic. That they are spoiled, rich, black men who are disrespectful of an anthem, which if read in its entirety, spins a sinister rhyme scheme of black slavery, black death and white supremacy.“No refuge could save the hireling and slave, from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave. And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave…”Now, much of white America is demanding that a wave of African-American bended knees recant and stand for the flag that has provided them with the care free lives that they now enjoy. Demanding that they stand in recognition of the men and women of the American military who have sacrificed for them. On NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Rich Lowry of The National Review, lectured African-American journalist Stephen Henderson. “People have died under that flag,” he said before adding. “You can have opinions about policing and what not, but don’t disrespect the flag.”Yet, I wonder. Will Lowry and his like muster an iota of respect for the lives of black men who have died under the flag, choked and shot to death on camera. Lives that should not be reduced to what nots. How can he and others stand in front of African-Americans and demand anything from them with regard to the flag of the United States of America? Black Americans who have sacrificed as much as any other race in this nation, including a legacy of doing so for centuries while laboring in brutal bondage. Can you not recognize this sacrifice?Lest it be forgotten, let us remember who sacrificed first. Crispus Attucks, a black man was the first to die as the American Revolution began. The first martyr to American freedom. And African-Americans have fought and died in every war since. Because there are movies to prove it, maybe you will remember the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment which suffered a casualty rate of forty percent, wounded, missing or killed as they assaulted Fort Wagner during the Civil War. Or the Tuskegee Airmen, who had to vigorously lobby to assume their right to fly in defense of their own country. They knew sacrifice.I have not served in the military, but military service is well represented on both sides of my family, including my father. My family members served with distinction and returned home, suffering from wounds of the body and mind. Wounds acquired as members of the United States Army, the United States Marines, the Coast Guard and the United States Navy.What many whites should know, or should remember, if they choose not to hide from our history, is what sacrifice actually earned African-American veterans. It earned them a society which, under the American flag, rejected their service. As The Equal Justice Initiative states,“No one was more at risk of experiencing violence and targeted racial terror than black veterans who had proven their valor and courage as soldiers during the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Because of their military service, black veterans were seen as a particular threat to Jim Crow and racial subordination. Thousands of black veterans were assaulted, threatened, abused, or lynched following military service.”Sacrifice that earned the charred, chained and mutilated bodies of black civilians as well.Sacrifice that earned a society represented by the United States flag, under which those men who served their country bravely, were not allowed to march alongside white soldiers in victory parades. Those men who came home to states and towns where they couldn’t vote, where they had to use colored only bathrooms and sit in the back of the bus. Where they suffered from discrimination in housing and from universities. Where their children received a separate but unequal education.Remember, when it served your purpose, you refused African-Americans the honor of being respected by or showing respect for the flag. Now, when it serves your purpose, you demand we stand up and without acknowledging our history, pay homage to a flag that took its time recognizing that we were even Americans. Sorry to disappoint.Even today, Colin Kaepernick wants you to know that African-Americans lag behind in income, home ownership and quality healthcare. African-American school children perform at substantially lower levels than the national average. And 12-year old black boys, like Tamir Rice, playing with toys are shot dead by police officers even as we remember a murdered 14-year-old named Emmett Till, about whom, Mr. Faulkner had this to say.“If we in America have reached the point in our desperate culture when we must murder children, no matter for what reason or what color, then we don’t deserve to survive, and probably won’t.”When I was young, I saw a picture. In it, hundreds of Ku Klux Klansmen marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC without shame, their faces exposed. Almost every Klansman carried The Stars and Stripes, Red, White and Blue, Old Glory, The American Flag, The Star-Spangled Banner. In the background, the grand dome of the United States Capitol, rose into the sky. Years later, when I first heard the phrase “state sponsored terrorism”, this is the picture that filled my mind.This is my perspective and that of many other African-Americans. Colin Kaepernick’s peaceful protest cannot be sincerely, thoughtfully or open-mindedly considered without the benefit of said perspective. It is my hope that, in due time, those raging against the knee, those who see a completely different flag than I do, will recognize all that Mr. Kaepernick has sacrificed by attempting to move us all toward a more perfect union."

Jones is competitive with Moore in several recent polls ― unusual for a Democrat in the heavily GOP state ― in the special election to be held on December 12 to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became President Donald Trump’s attorney general. “This is the way I take it ― I’m not sure it’s the way he meant it, because he says one thing and means something else,” Jones said in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress on Wednesday. “But the way I take that is, if my true colors are talking about the working class families in this state and around the country; if my true colors are trying to get affordable health care for everybody, trying to make sure that we protect our rural hospitals with Medicaid and Medicare; if it means getting affordable education, those are the kinds of issues that Joe Biden speaks to.”“So if that’s revealing my true colors about what I really care about the people of Alabama, ” he continued, “then I accept that, and I welcome that, because that is my true colors.”Jones warned of the white nationalist fervor that Moore, a far right Christian evangelical who has the strong backing of former White House strategist Steve Bannon, had tapped into during the GOP primary and which Moore seeks to energize during the general election. “Over the years we’ve seen a rise in the white nationalists [and we are] kind of going backwards,” Jones said. “Whether it’s in voting rights ― that’s where it’s most significant to me, going backwards on the access to the ballot box. You know, those were all issues I dealt with as a young man. I tried to deal with them as a lawyer. I want to try to take that to the U.S. Senate, so that you have a voice of reason. And I think it’s important, quite frankly, that a Southern voice is going to be that voice of reason on issues of race and reconciliation and equality.”Jones also pushed back against the extreme positions of Moore, who has said that “laws are superseded by God,” and believes homosexuality should be illegal, claiming “it is not a public right.” Moore was twice removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for violating the oath of office while pushing his personal religious beliefs. The second time, in 2016, Moore was suspended for ordering probate judges in the state of Alabama not to follow the U.S. Supreme Court’s Obergefell ruling which decided that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marriage.“He exploited an issue that divides people,” Jones commented about Moore’s 2016 suspension. “He exploited the gay marriage issue, the equality issue, for his own personal gain, for his own very personal political agenda, to shore up that very right-wing base. And to stand up for what he believes, so to speak ― [but] no one should consider standing up for what they believe and disobeying the rule of law.”No Democrat has won a U.S. Senate race in Alabama since the ’90s, when Howell Heflin served as senator. But Jones, who was a staffer for the late Heflin, believes that in 2017, with the combined energy of progressives in the Trump era and Moore’s blatant extremism, Alabama is ready for a change.Follow Michelangelo Signorile on Twitter: www.twitter.com/msignorile"

53,ENTERTAINMENT,The Return Of The Greatest %*#@$!^ Mouth On Television,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susie-essman-curb-your-enthusiasm-season-9_us_59c40221e4b063b25318b1f5,"Susie Essman swears she's nothing like Susie Greene, the foul-mouthed ball of rage she plays on “Curb Your Enthusiasm."" Is she right?",2017-10-06,"“What is hilarious to me is that I have now become beloved and iconic for telling people to go fuck themselves,” Susie Essman said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cbc5511800008e02c9d1e3.gif?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Susie Essman was a few minutes late, thanks to the %*#@$ leader of the free world.“Asshole’s in town,” she muttered as she sat down. President Donald Trump had returned to New York City to address the United Nations, causing a presidential buildup of traffic between Essman’s prior engagement and ours on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just down the block from her apartment.Essman’s mouth is famous, perhaps even more so than she is. It is certainly one of the most iconically foul weapons on television. Eighteen years since Essman first agreed to join Larry David’s HBO show “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” it is hard to read certain phrases without hearing her distinctive New York cadence. Four-eyed fuck! Fat piece of shit! Sick fucko asshole! Freak of fucking nature! Car-wash cunt!Essman and those around her say she shares little in common with the character she plays on television. “She’s not like Susie Greene in real life,” said Joy Behar, her best friend of more than three decades. Greene is the justifiably embittered housewife of Hollywood manager Jeff Greene, played by “Curb” executive producer Jeff Garlin ― the kind of woman who tells her perpetually cheating husband that if he so much as utters the word “divorce,” she will take him for everything he’s worth and then thumbtack his testicles to the wall. Essman, 62, is kind, quiet and thoughtful ― a seasoned stand-up comedian, shaped by the New York City clubs of the 1980s and happily married to a man who works far outside the industry.But as “Curb Your Enthusiasm” returned last Sunday for its first season in six years, and its ninth in total, there’s no question that the character and her creator have one thing in common: Neither is going to let any stupid fuck tell her how to live her life anymore. Even as a young girl watching “I Love Lucy,” Essman always gravitated to the Ethel Mertzes of the world, not the Lucy Ricardos.“Lucy always pissed me off because it was always like, ‘Wah, wah, wah ― Ricky’s going to be mad at me that I bought a hat,’ you know?” she said as she ate her bacon and scrambled eggs (well-done) last month. “Grow some balls.”“I didn’t feel that way about Ethel,” she added. “Ethel wasn’t beholden to Fred in the same way.”Essman had wanted to be an actress ever since she was a child growing up just north of New York City in Westchester County. But in elementary school, Essman realized she wouldn’t be able to live life as a Lucy even if she wanted to. In first grade, the part of Mrs. Claus in a school play went to her best friend. At her sleepaway camp’s production of “The Wizard Of Oz,” Essman didn’t get the role of Dorothy either. The part went to a supposedly talentless blonde instead, leaving a young Essman with the role of the Wicked Witch of the West. Enraged, she performed the part with an incomparable passion, repeatedly screaming “I’m melting” during her character’s death scene. The performance earned her a standing ovation. Watching as the crowd cheered, she realized something.“I was never going to be the ingenue,” she says now. “Because I was too New York, too Jewish, too whatever. I was always going to be the best friend.” But she didn’t care. That night, Essman decided she liked being the Wicked Witch of the West plenty.Those closest to her were often less than supportive of Essman’s acting ambitions growing up. Her mother, who taught Russian at Sarah Lawrence College, and her father, an internist, wanted Essman to apply to law school. Her college boyfriend told her that her dream was ridiculous.“I had very little encouragement from anybody,” she said.After graduating SUNY Purchase with a degree in urban studies, Essman spent most of her 20s waitressing in the city, too scared to dive headfirst into acting but not quite able to give up the idea. She took a few classes here and there, but found herself simultaneously bored by them and ridden with performance anxiety. When there were assignments, she’d skip class altogether. “I was so scared to get up and do anything,” she said. She met a man, and the two of them entered into an unhealthy relationship. At one point, she even applied to law school like her parents wanted ― and got in ― but she couldn’t bring herself to go. Confused as to where her life was headed, she entered a depression. “I was just so lost,” she said.In July 1983, a broken Essman entered intensive psychoanalysis at the advice of her therapist. That same month, she got onstage at an open mic at the Mostly Magic comedy club on Carmine Street. She pulled together a couple characters that would get a laugh in her acting classes ― among them a Jewish mother and a “jappy” girl from Long Island ― and did five minutes. It was a decision that would change her life, even if it didn’t seem like it at the time.About two months later, she received a call from a man she had met that night named Burt Leavitt. He had opened a club called Comedy U. with a friend in the city, and he wanted Essman to perform, but she was still struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. “I was in a very bad place,” she said. “I was in the worst place I ever could have been in.” Nevertheless, she agreed ― it might have even helped her to overcome her usual anxiety. “[I]f I hadn’t been in such dire straits — suicidal and depressed and feeling like I had no options in life at all — I don’t know if I ever would have gotten up on stage,” she later wrote in her memoir, What Would Susie Say? Bullsh*t Wisdom About Love, Life and Comedy.The first time went fine. The second time went great. But the night after, she spiraled and decided to take “every pill in my medicine cabinet from aspirin to Valium to Tums,” she later recalled. Quickly, she realized she didn’t want to die. She called her friend and then her father, who told her to make herself vomit.“I did, and the rest is a blur,” she wrote.Essman came out of the experience changed. “There was something about actually having acted on my suicidal thoughts that banished them,” she wrote. A few days later, Leavitt called her again and offered her a paying gig on the weekends at the Comedy U. She took it and started working there regularly. After a while, she tried speaking in her own voice, rather than hiding behind characters. She began performing at other clubs.“After about three months, I remember feeling like this is what I was meant to do with my life,” she said, smiling. “And I became a comic.”Over the next half-decade, Essman worked relentlessly to perfect her newly discovered talent. “Seven nights a week, many clubs a night,” she said. In 1987, she performed over 400 shows. By 1988, she had appeared on an HBO special. By 1989, she had appeared on Johnny Carson. “She was very much well-respected,” said Behar.She stopped caring so much about what other people thought, too. To stand out, she had to. There had been “nearly a hundredfold increase” in full-time comedy clubs since the early 1970s, Rolling Stone wrote in 1988. But there was something a bit different about Essman. With her thick New York accent, she was so distinctly a product of the tri-state, which she played up in her act, joking about her hunky Italian ex-boyfriend from the Bronx and how the gentile bridal showers of Connecticut compared with her own Jewish family’s more brash get-togethers. She also adopted something of her father’s dirty mouth ― “‘Fuck’ every other word,” as she described it. But most notable was the way Essman talked about sex. “She was ahead of her time,” said Ilana Glazer, co-creator of Comedy Central’s “Broad City,” a blissed-out riff on life at loose ends for two sexually liberated twentysomething women in New York City. When joking about men, Essman could be simultaneously honest and brutal. Often single and unashamed of it, a Fredless Ethel, she talked about the men who turned her on and the men who turned her off ― sex every which way. When Oscar-winning actress Sally Field needed a stand-up coach for a 1988 film she starred in called “Punchline,” she looked through hundreds of tapes before eventually deciding on Essman, saying, “[Essman] commands the audience to be with her and a lot of it comes from her sexuality.”Over time, Essman began to create what Glazer described as “a space where women can be loud [and] opinionated ... not the standard-narrative white woman.”“She was single and fucking people and living that real New York life before ‘Sex In The City,’” Glazer added. “‘Broad City’ is trying to capture some essence of what Susie really lived.”It wasn’t always easy being a woman in the New York City comedy scene. “They would never put two women on a show together,” Essman said. “They kind of assumed that if you have two women on a show, they’re both going to be talking about their periods.” But she was unwilling to blame any lack of success on her gender. “I hate victimhood ― hate it,” she said. “I was always just like: ‘I’m going to be so good that they can’t deny me. I’m going to be such a great comedian that they cannot use this against me.’ And that was my goal.”Standing there with a microphone in her face and the comedy world in front of her, Essman was ready to show them all. Comedy Central had initially resisted the New York Friars Club’s suggestion that Essman participate in the televised 1999 roast of comedian Jerry Stiller. “I’m not sure why,” she later wrote. “Too old, too female, too Jewish, too who knows?” Essman had joined the exclusive club, famous for its extravagantly vulgar celebrity roasts, a few years before, in 1995. The club was the stuff of legend ― Frank Sinatra signed Essman’s admission certificate ― but it hadn’t allowed women in until 1988, and it hadn’t let women onto the dais during a roast until 1990. Even after those walls were broken down, biases against female comedians remained. “They didn’t think women were funny. Especially if you were relatively attractive. That confused the shit out of them,” Essman said.But she earned the Friars Club’s respect, enough that it pushed for her to perform against Comedy Central’s wishes. Eventually, the network relented. She wanted to prove women could keep up ― for more reasons than one. By the mid-’90s, Essman had started to get a bit fed up. She had been in the comedy scene for over a decade. Many of her friends had headed West for jobs in Los Angeles, but she had been unwilling. “I never thought about moving,” she said. “[Los Angeles] just doesn’t feel like home to me.” The decision cost her. She was in her 40s and still struggling to make a decent living. Sure, she had bit parts here and there, but nothing was sticking. “I was very frustrated because ― I mean, especially in those days, I was good,” she said. “It was like, ‘OK, how much better do I have to be before I start making some money?’”Up onstage during the roast, the frustration was transmuted into one of the dirtiest, filthiest, most heinous sets of the night. To start: “I’m very hoarse tonight. I have a sore throat. Jerry knows why. I know why. Enough said,” she said. She turned to Maury Povich: “You know, Maury, I always wondered why you married Connie Chung. And then I realized: We all know Jews love to eat Chinese. Once a week, right?” And on and on. She was the kind of woman whom she had admired as a child ― wicked, beholden to no one ― and she killed. One man took notice. Just before he sat down to watch the Stiller roast, “Seinfeld” co-creator Larry David had wrapped a one-hour mockumentary for HBO called “Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.” He was planning to transform the special into a full-on television show, and he needed someone to play his best friend’s wife. For the part, he needed a woman who could be ferocious and crass, with a mouth that had to be heard to be believed. Watching the roast, he realized what he needed was Susie Essman.The two had known each other back in the 1980s, when they were both in the stand-up scene. When David called up his old acquaintance and told her about the part, she asked for a script. No script, he said, just rough outlines of scenes. He added that the show would be more or less improvised. Oh, and Essman would only receive union day scale, too. With no contract and no real commitment, she decided to accept the role and see where it went anyway.Essman and David never really discussed the character of Susie Greene. But Essman knew exactly whom she wanted her to be. In high school, she had marveled at girls who, unlike her, were totally secure in themselves. That was what she wanted to create in Greene ― an East Coast housewife who never second-guessed her choices, fashion or otherwise. Essman appeared in a few episodes of Season 1. But Susie Greene didn’t become a fully formed man-killing machine, Essman said, until seven episodes into Season 2. Larry and Jeff have stolen the head of one of her daughter’s dolls, and here is Susie Greene, confronting them on the driveway, snarling, Spaghetti Western music playing in the background. “Where’s the head?” she asks, arms folded across her chest. Jeff and Larry are silent, terrified. Susie asks again: “I know you took the doll’s head. Where is it?”Then once more, with power.“WHERE’S THE FUCKING HEAD?”It was a little slice of the Jersey Turnpike, set down in Pacific Palisades. The scene, in an episode entitled “The Doll,” would serve as Essman’s breakout moment, which is probably why she still considers the episode her favorite. “It’s the first time you see how deeply feared I am with Jeff and Larry,” said Essman.Over the seasons, she would skewer her “fat piece of shit” husband plenty. But her real wrath was saved for Larry. Whether it was because he didn’t want an house tour, got her daughter drunk, ruined a school tour, doubted her respect for wood or didn’t love her shimmering Packers sweater, Essman let that four-eyed fuck have it. The show, in general, revolved around everyone ridiculing Larry into moral oblivion, and no one ridiculed better than Essman.By Season 3, “Curb” fans were regularly stopping Essman in the streets of Manhattan and begging her to rip into them. Women in particular have come to love Susie Greene, Essman has said, going so far as to tell her that Greene is “their hero.” “The thing that people really love about Susie … is her comfort with her anger, especially women,” she said. “Her complete comfort with being angry unapologetically, I think, is liberating for women to see.” She enjoys the physical process of playing her, too. “After we do a screaming-shouting scene, I go back to my hotel [and] I feel so relaxed, I fall asleep. I feel like I got a massage, you know?” she said.In the almost two decades that she’s been playing Susie Greene, Essman has come to be defined by the role, and in some ways limited, too. “I’m definitely pigeonholed and typecast,” she said. While many of TV’s most famous male comedians are well known for their stand-up routines, few people know of Essman as a stand-up comedian who woodshedded for two decades before “Curb.” “People really have trouble giving credit to women. I mean, they just fucking do,” Glazer said. “And I get it ― it’s uncomfortable. It’s not what we’re used to seeing. But Larry David didn’t create Susie Greene. He knew Susie Essman, who perfected herself.”Years ago, when Glazer and “Broad City” co-creator Abbi Jacobson were working on the web series that would become their hit Comedy Central show, they dreamed of having Essman play Glazer’s mother. “She [was] just so Jew-y and ethnic and New York and unapologetic,” said Glazer. But Glazer wasn’t a “Curb” diehard. She was a fan of Essman, the stand-up comedian, who had helped inspire Glazer to speak proudly and frankly about sex and a woman’s place in the world. A few years after Season 8 of “Curb” wrapped up, the pair finally got their wish when Essman joined the show as Ilana’s handbag-addicted mother, a casting decision that looked instantly perfect as Glazer and Essman ran around New York City together. In real life, Essman became something like family to the two comedians. “I have the deepest respect for them. I feel like they’re my little sisters [and] that they’re my legacy in a certain way,” Essman said. “They are the outgrowth of some of the stuff I was doing.”Glazer agrees. “‘Broad City’ would not be covering the content that it is had Susie Essman not been doing the stand-up that she did starting in the ’80s,” Glazer said. “She really feels like our mother ― who created a world for us.”Last spring, Essman got a call from Larry David. After five years, he was seriously thinking about Season 9. She’s hopeful it won’t be the last one. “It’s not as though these are the characters that we’re going to grow out of. It’s not ‘Baywatch,’” she said. Since the show first started, Essman’s life has both changed dramatically and not at all. She still does some stand-up comedy and still lives in and loves New York City. But the once-perpetually single Essman is married, a little older and a bit more removed from the scene. She hasn’t become a star. She still has to work to pay the bills. But she’s fine with all that, and she doesn’t care what you think about her life or her world anyway. In a way, she’s become a bit more like her character ― secure in herself and her ability to tell everyone else to fuck off. “What is hilarious to me is that I have now become beloved and iconic for telling people to go fuck themselves,” she said. “For the rest of my life, that will be my legacy.”How does she feel about that? “It’s fine. You could be known for worse.”That’s fucking right. "
54,ENTERTAINMENT,The Return Of The Greatest %*#@$!^ Mouth On Television,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susie-essman-curb-your-enthusiasm-season-9_us_59c40221e4b063b25318b1f5,"Susie Essman swears she's nothing like Susie Greene, the foul-mouthed ball of rage she plays on “Curb Your Enthusiasm."" Is she right?",2017-10-06,"By 1988, Susie Essman was performing as part of HBO stand-up comedy specials.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d656042000000e340853fc.gif?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Susie Essman was a few minutes late, thanks to the %*#@$ leader of the free world.“Asshole’s in town,” she muttered as she sat down. President Donald Trump had returned to New York City to address the United Nations, causing a presidential buildup of traffic between Essman’s prior engagement and ours on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just down the block from her apartment.Essman’s mouth is famous, perhaps even more so than she is. It is certainly one of the most iconically foul weapons on television. Eighteen years since Essman first agreed to join Larry David’s HBO show “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” it is hard to read certain phrases without hearing her distinctive New York cadence. Four-eyed fuck! Fat piece of shit! Sick fucko asshole! Freak of fucking nature! Car-wash cunt!Essman and those around her say she shares little in common with the character she plays on television. “She’s not like Susie Greene in real life,” said Joy Behar, her best friend of more than three decades. Greene is the justifiably embittered housewife of Hollywood manager Jeff Greene, played by “Curb” executive producer Jeff Garlin ― the kind of woman who tells her perpetually cheating husband that if he so much as utters the word “divorce,” she will take him for everything he’s worth and then thumbtack his testicles to the wall. Essman, 62, is kind, quiet and thoughtful ― a seasoned stand-up comedian, shaped by the New York City clubs of the 1980s and happily married to a man who works far outside the industry.But as “Curb Your Enthusiasm” returned last Sunday for its first season in six years, and its ninth in total, there’s no question that the character and her creator have one thing in common: Neither is going to let any stupid fuck tell her how to live her life anymore. Even as a young girl watching “I Love Lucy,” Essman always gravitated to the Ethel Mertzes of the world, not the Lucy Ricardos.“Lucy always pissed me off because it was always like, ‘Wah, wah, wah ― Ricky’s going to be mad at me that I bought a hat,’ you know?” she said as she ate her bacon and scrambled eggs (well-done) last month. “Grow some balls.”“I didn’t feel that way about Ethel,” she added. “Ethel wasn’t beholden to Fred in the same way.”Essman had wanted to be an actress ever since she was a child growing up just north of New York City in Westchester County. But in elementary school, Essman realized she wouldn’t be able to live life as a Lucy even if she wanted to. In first grade, the part of Mrs. Claus in a school play went to her best friend. At her sleepaway camp’s production of “The Wizard Of Oz,” Essman didn’t get the role of Dorothy either. The part went to a supposedly talentless blonde instead, leaving a young Essman with the role of the Wicked Witch of the West. Enraged, she performed the part with an incomparable passion, repeatedly screaming “I’m melting” during her character’s death scene. The performance earned her a standing ovation. Watching as the crowd cheered, she realized something.“I was never going to be the ingenue,” she says now. “Because I was too New York, too Jewish, too whatever. I was always going to be the best friend.” But she didn’t care. That night, Essman decided she liked being the Wicked Witch of the West plenty.Those closest to her were often less than supportive of Essman’s acting ambitions growing up. Her mother, who taught Russian at Sarah Lawrence College, and her father, an internist, wanted Essman to apply to law school. Her college boyfriend told her that her dream was ridiculous.“I had very little encouragement from anybody,” she said.After graduating SUNY Purchase with a degree in urban studies, Essman spent most of her 20s waitressing in the city, too scared to dive headfirst into acting but not quite able to give up the idea. She took a few classes here and there, but found herself simultaneously bored by them and ridden with performance anxiety. When there were assignments, she’d skip class altogether. “I was so scared to get up and do anything,” she said. She met a man, and the two of them entered into an unhealthy relationship. At one point, she even applied to law school like her parents wanted ― and got in ― but she couldn’t bring herself to go. Confused as to where her life was headed, she entered a depression. “I was just so lost,” she said.In July 1983, a broken Essman entered intensive psychoanalysis at the advice of her therapist. That same month, she got onstage at an open mic at the Mostly Magic comedy club on Carmine Street. She pulled together a couple characters that would get a laugh in her acting classes ― among them a Jewish mother and a “jappy” girl from Long Island ― and did five minutes. It was a decision that would change her life, even if it didn’t seem like it at the time.About two months later, she received a call from a man she had met that night named Burt Leavitt. He had opened a club called Comedy U. with a friend in the city, and he wanted Essman to perform, but she was still struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. “I was in a very bad place,” she said. “I was in the worst place I ever could have been in.” Nevertheless, she agreed ― it might have even helped her to overcome her usual anxiety. “[I]f I hadn’t been in such dire straits — suicidal and depressed and feeling like I had no options in life at all — I don’t know if I ever would have gotten up on stage,” she later wrote in her memoir, What Would Susie Say? Bullsh*t Wisdom About Love, Life and Comedy.The first time went fine. The second time went great. But the night after, she spiraled and decided to take “every pill in my medicine cabinet from aspirin to Valium to Tums,” she later recalled. Quickly, she realized she didn’t want to die. She called her friend and then her father, who told her to make herself vomit.“I did, and the rest is a blur,” she wrote.Essman came out of the experience changed. “There was something about actually having acted on my suicidal thoughts that banished them,” she wrote. A few days later, Leavitt called her again and offered her a paying gig on the weekends at the Comedy U. She took it and started working there regularly. After a while, she tried speaking in her own voice, rather than hiding behind characters. She began performing at other clubs.“After about three months, I remember feeling like this is what I was meant to do with my life,” she said, smiling. “And I became a comic.”Over the next half-decade, Essman worked relentlessly to perfect her newly discovered talent. “Seven nights a week, many clubs a night,” she said. In 1987, she performed over 400 shows. By 1988, she had appeared on an HBO special. By 1989, she had appeared on Johnny Carson. “She was very much well-respected,” said Behar.She stopped caring so much about what other people thought, too. To stand out, she had to. There had been “nearly a hundredfold increase” in full-time comedy clubs since the early 1970s, Rolling Stone wrote in 1988. But there was something a bit different about Essman. With her thick New York accent, she was so distinctly a product of the tri-state, which she played up in her act, joking about her hunky Italian ex-boyfriend from the Bronx and how the gentile bridal showers of Connecticut compared with her own Jewish family’s more brash get-togethers. She also adopted something of her father’s dirty mouth ― “‘Fuck’ every other word,” as she described it. But most notable was the way Essman talked about sex. “She was ahead of her time,” said Ilana Glazer, co-creator of Comedy Central’s “Broad City,” a blissed-out riff on life at loose ends for two sexually liberated twentysomething women in New York City. When joking about men, Essman could be simultaneously honest and brutal. Often single and unashamed of it, a Fredless Ethel, she talked about the men who turned her on and the men who turned her off ― sex every which way. When Oscar-winning actress Sally Field needed a stand-up coach for a 1988 film she starred in called “Punchline,” she looked through hundreds of tapes before eventually deciding on Essman, saying, “[Essman] commands the audience to be with her and a lot of it comes from her sexuality.”Over time, Essman began to create what Glazer described as “a space where women can be loud [and] opinionated ... not the standard-narrative white woman.”“She was single and fucking people and living that real New York life before ‘Sex In The City,’” Glazer added. “‘Broad City’ is trying to capture some essence of what Susie really lived.”It wasn’t always easy being a woman in the New York City comedy scene. “They would never put two women on a show together,” Essman said. “They kind of assumed that if you have two women on a show, they’re both going to be talking about their periods.” But she was unwilling to blame any lack of success on her gender. “I hate victimhood ― hate it,” she said. “I was always just like: ‘I’m going to be so good that they can’t deny me. I’m going to be such a great comedian that they cannot use this against me.’ And that was my goal.”Standing there with a microphone in her face and the comedy world in front of her, Essman was ready to show them all. Comedy Central had initially resisted the New York Friars Club’s suggestion that Essman participate in the televised 1999 roast of comedian Jerry Stiller. “I’m not sure why,” she later wrote. “Too old, too female, too Jewish, too who knows?” Essman had joined the exclusive club, famous for its extravagantly vulgar celebrity roasts, a few years before, in 1995. The club was the stuff of legend ― Frank Sinatra signed Essman’s admission certificate ― but it hadn’t allowed women in until 1988, and it hadn’t let women onto the dais during a roast until 1990. Even after those walls were broken down, biases against female comedians remained. “They didn’t think women were funny. Especially if you were relatively attractive. That confused the shit out of them,” Essman said.But she earned the Friars Club’s respect, enough that it pushed for her to perform against Comedy Central’s wishes. Eventually, the network relented. She wanted to prove women could keep up ― for more reasons than one. By the mid-’90s, Essman had started to get a bit fed up. She had been in the comedy scene for over a decade. Many of her friends had headed West for jobs in Los Angeles, but she had been unwilling. “I never thought about moving,” she said. “[Los Angeles] just doesn’t feel like home to me.” The decision cost her. She was in her 40s and still struggling to make a decent living. Sure, she had bit parts here and there, but nothing was sticking. “I was very frustrated because ― I mean, especially in those days, I was good,” she said. “It was like, ‘OK, how much better do I have to be before I start making some money?’”Up onstage during the roast, the frustration was transmuted into one of the dirtiest, filthiest, most heinous sets of the night. To start: “I’m very hoarse tonight. I have a sore throat. Jerry knows why. I know why. Enough said,” she said. She turned to Maury Povich: “You know, Maury, I always wondered why you married Connie Chung. And then I realized: We all know Jews love to eat Chinese. Once a week, right?” And on and on. She was the kind of woman whom she had admired as a child ― wicked, beholden to no one ― and she killed. One man took notice. Just before he sat down to watch the Stiller roast, “Seinfeld” co-creator Larry David had wrapped a one-hour mockumentary for HBO called “Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.” He was planning to transform the special into a full-on television show, and he needed someone to play his best friend’s wife. For the part, he needed a woman who could be ferocious and crass, with a mouth that had to be heard to be believed. Watching the roast, he realized what he needed was Susie Essman.The two had known each other back in the 1980s, when they were both in the stand-up scene. When David called up his old acquaintance and told her about the part, she asked for a script. No script, he said, just rough outlines of scenes. He added that the show would be more or less improvised. Oh, and Essman would only receive union day scale, too. With no contract and no real commitment, she decided to accept the role and see where it went anyway.Essman and David never really discussed the character of Susie Greene. But Essman knew exactly whom she wanted her to be. In high school, she had marveled at girls who, unlike her, were totally secure in themselves. That was what she wanted to create in Greene ― an East Coast housewife who never second-guessed her choices, fashion or otherwise. Essman appeared in a few episodes of Season 1. But Susie Greene didn’t become a fully formed man-killing machine, Essman said, until seven episodes into Season 2. Larry and Jeff have stolen the head of one of her daughter’s dolls, and here is Susie Greene, confronting them on the driveway, snarling, Spaghetti Western music playing in the background. “Where’s the head?” she asks, arms folded across her chest. Jeff and Larry are silent, terrified. Susie asks again: “I know you took the doll’s head. Where is it?”Then once more, with power.“WHERE’S THE FUCKING HEAD?”It was a little slice of the Jersey Turnpike, set down in Pacific Palisades. The scene, in an episode entitled “The Doll,” would serve as Essman’s breakout moment, which is probably why she still considers the episode her favorite. “It’s the first time you see how deeply feared I am with Jeff and Larry,” said Essman.Over the seasons, she would skewer her “fat piece of shit” husband plenty. But her real wrath was saved for Larry. Whether it was because he didn’t want an house tour, got her daughter drunk, ruined a school tour, doubted her respect for wood or didn’t love her shimmering Packers sweater, Essman let that four-eyed fuck have it. The show, in general, revolved around everyone ridiculing Larry into moral oblivion, and no one ridiculed better than Essman.By Season 3, “Curb” fans were regularly stopping Essman in the streets of Manhattan and begging her to rip into them. Women in particular have come to love Susie Greene, Essman has said, going so far as to tell her that Greene is “their hero.” “The thing that people really love about Susie … is her comfort with her anger, especially women,” she said. “Her complete comfort with being angry unapologetically, I think, is liberating for women to see.” She enjoys the physical process of playing her, too. “After we do a screaming-shouting scene, I go back to my hotel [and] I feel so relaxed, I fall asleep. I feel like I got a massage, you know?” she said.In the almost two decades that she’s been playing Susie Greene, Essman has come to be defined by the role, and in some ways limited, too. “I’m definitely pigeonholed and typecast,” she said. While many of TV’s most famous male comedians are well known for their stand-up routines, few people know of Essman as a stand-up comedian who woodshedded for two decades before “Curb.” “People really have trouble giving credit to women. I mean, they just fucking do,” Glazer said. “And I get it ― it’s uncomfortable. It’s not what we’re used to seeing. But Larry David didn’t create Susie Greene. He knew Susie Essman, who perfected herself.”Years ago, when Glazer and “Broad City” co-creator Abbi Jacobson were working on the web series that would become their hit Comedy Central show, they dreamed of having Essman play Glazer’s mother. “She [was] just so Jew-y and ethnic and New York and unapologetic,” said Glazer. But Glazer wasn’t a “Curb” diehard. She was a fan of Essman, the stand-up comedian, who had helped inspire Glazer to speak proudly and frankly about sex and a woman’s place in the world. A few years after Season 8 of “Curb” wrapped up, the pair finally got their wish when Essman joined the show as Ilana’s handbag-addicted mother, a casting decision that looked instantly perfect as Glazer and Essman ran around New York City together. In real life, Essman became something like family to the two comedians. “I have the deepest respect for them. I feel like they’re my little sisters [and] that they’re my legacy in a certain way,” Essman said. “They are the outgrowth of some of the stuff I was doing.”Glazer agrees. “‘Broad City’ would not be covering the content that it is had Susie Essman not been doing the stand-up that she did starting in the ’80s,” Glazer said. “She really feels like our mother ― who created a world for us.”Last spring, Essman got a call from Larry David. After five years, he was seriously thinking about Season 9. She’s hopeful it won’t be the last one. “It’s not as though these are the characters that we’re going to grow out of. It’s not ‘Baywatch,’” she said. Since the show first started, Essman’s life has both changed dramatically and not at all. She still does some stand-up comedy and still lives in and loves New York City. But the once-perpetually single Essman is married, a little older and a bit more removed from the scene. She hasn’t become a star. She still has to work to pay the bills. But she’s fine with all that, and she doesn’t care what you think about her life or her world anyway. In a way, she’s become a bit more like her character ― secure in herself and her ability to tell everyone else to fuck off. “What is hilarious to me is that I have now become beloved and iconic for telling people to go fuck themselves,” she said. “For the rest of my life, that will be my legacy.”How does she feel about that? “It’s fine. You could be known for worse.”That’s fucking right. "

Price stepped down after Politico reported on the Cabinet member’s frequent use of chartered and military flights, which reportedly cost taxpayers more than $1 million. Five of those chartered flights occurred during the same week and were used for domestic travel between cities ranging from Washington, D.C., to Waterville, Maine.The reported details of Mnuchin’s military aircraft travel since March were similarly lavish. Mnuchin flew on a military flight to meet with President Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, a round trip that cost $15,000, The New York Times reported.According to Politico, Cabinet members’ travel aboard military aircraft is approved by the White House on a case-by-case basis, and is sometimes necessary for Cabinet members dealing with national security. The Times cited an internal email that said Mnuchin needed a military plane in order to have a classified telephone conversation with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.In another case, Mnuchin cost taxpayers $43,725.50 to fly to Miami for a meeting with the Mexican finance minister, the Times reported. A commercial round-trip flight would have cost less than $1,000.Still, the Treasury’s Office of the Inspector General found that Mnuchin’s use of military aircraft on seven official trips broke no laws, but asked the secretary to provide more justifications for such travel in the future. “I recommend that the OIG advise that future requests be ready to justify government air in greater detail, especially regarding cost comparisons and needs for security and other special factors,” OIG counsel Rich Delmar wrote in his report, according to Reuters.Mnuchin’s travel habits came under official scrutiny in August after his wife, Louise Linton, posted a photograph to Instagram highlighting the luxury designers she was wearing as the couple descended from a government plane they took to Kentucky for an official trip that just happened to coincide with the path of the total solar eclipse. Mnuchin, a multimillionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, pushed back against criticism from Democrats and watchdog agencies about the trip.“People in Kentucky took this stuff very seriously,” he said in an interview with The Washington Post. “Being a New Yorker, I don’t have any interest in watching the eclipse.”Reports also surfaced over the summer that Mnuchin requested use of a government jet for his European honeymoon to Scotland, France and Italy. Such an aircraft would have reportedly cost taxpayers $25,000 per hour to operate. His office eventually withdrew the request."

In a new interview, she opened up about what she wants to teach these young people, and what they’ve taught her.Chatting with Romper, Clinton discussed her new children’s book, It Takes a Village, which was inspired by her 2006 book of the same name. The author mentioned that she’s met several people throughout her life as a public figure and noted the kids were just as impactful as the adults. “It’s safe to say I’ve learned as much from the children I’ve met over the course of my career as I have from the adults,” she told Romper. “In parts of the world that have experienced conflict, I’ve seen children reach across divides to play together and learn from each other.”Clinton also said many kids have reminded her of the importance of standing up for your beliefs and openly sharing your fears in order to bring about change. “I’ve been so moved by the children I’ve met who were brave enough to share their hopes, dreams and fears with our country and the world — from the young people who helped raise awareness in the effort to pass the Children’s Health Insurance Program back in the ’90s to the children of immigrants who are speaking out today,” she said. “For all our talk about listening to the ‘adult in the room,’ in my experience, the most compelling wisdom sometimes comes from the child in the room.”Just last month, Clinton responded to a sweet photo on Twitter that shows a girl who wore a pantsuit (Clinton’s signature look) to meet her at a book signing.Clinton responded by tweeting that it was “great to be back in Brooklyn sharing #ItTakesAVillage with readers of all ages!”In her interview with Romper, Clinton encouraged parents to teach their kids the importance of “critical thinking, an open heart” and an appreciation for diversity. She also stressed that “raising feminist sons is just as important as raising feminist daughters,” and described what it’s like to see her own feminist daughter, Chelsea, as a mom.“She can recite the latest American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on just about everything, from infant feeding to screen time,” she said. “As the mother, she’s the expert, and I get to enjoy the special pleasure that comes from knowing you can just focus on being the most loving and helpful grandparent you can be.”Read Clinton’s interview in full on Romper."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d7ca562000000e340857fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"History will be made at Stonewall once again. The inn, which is located in New York’s Greenwich Village, was the site of the June 28, 1969 riots which are considered the symbolic start of the modern day gay rights movement. In 2016, former President Barack Obama designated the inn, an adjacent park and its environs as the country’s first national monument to LGBTQ rights. With this designation, the 7.7-acre area became federally protected to ensure its preservation for future generations. So it’s only fitting that the Stonewall National Monument will soon become the home of the first rainbow flag to be permanently placed on federal land and maintained by the National Park Service. The flag will replace the New York state flag on a nautical flagpole outside Stonewall and be raised in a dedication ceremony Oct. 11, which is also designated as National Coming Out Day. Activist Michael Petrelis, who spearheaded the effort, said in a Thursday statement that the news was bittersweet given that many in the LGBTQ community are concerned for their future under President Donald Trump, who ran on an explicitly anti-queer platform. “It is a victory for our community to have these symbolic colors flying majestically over our Stonewall, designated as a National Monument by President Obama, even as our LGBTQ brothers and sisters are under attack by the current regime in power,” he said.Oct. 11 also marks the 30th anniversary of the March on Washington for LGBT Rights, as well as the first time the AIDS Memorial Quilt was displayed on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The significance of the date wasn’t lost on Petrelis, who likened Trump’s stance on LGBTQ issues to that of former President Ronald Reagan, who didn’t publicly acknowledge the AIDS crisis until 1987. By that point, more than 20,000 Americans had died from HIV/AIDS-related causes. “As we gather today, we are reminded of another Oct. 11, 30 years ago,” he added, “when the names of fallen comrades were symbolically celebrated on another national monument ― the AIDS Quilt ― during the reign of another president who waged an attack against us.”Another LGBTQ rights activist, Ken Kidd, told Newsweek that he was surprised plans for the flag display got approved under the Trump administration. “Our rainbow colors flying in tandem with the stars and stripes is a source of inspiration, a recognition of equality, a recognition of a struggle for equality,” he said, “that is not over by any stretch of imagination.”For more ways to combat bigotry, check out the Queer Voices newsletter."

These jabs are funny from the mouth of a petite grandmother and easy to overlook, coming from a woman who has taught me unconditional love.I’ve watched you bury your husband and your son, and have never seen a single one of your tears. You once told me that you are afraid that if you start crying, you will never stop. Do you remember the last time that you cried? We don’t talk about these things.I am collecting your letters, and I have them scattered across the house. Maybe it’s part of my usual messiness, but I like these reminders of you. We have one on the refrigerator, open so it can be read. So the children absorb your handwriting into their everyday consciousness. I have another one on the shelf next to their clothes. When I see it in the morning, I remember that you raised three boys, and I try to channel the force of your love, as my own son and I have our daily argument over pants or shorts. I somehow expect a two-year-old to understand weather, and I can imagine your laugh as I describe this. Or more accurately, your voice saying, “So let him wear it, what’s the harm?” Today he wore boxer shorts to daycare, and a fleece vest that was at least one size too small.He was named for Grandpa, which of course you know. We didn’t tell anyone his name before he was born, except for you. You won that battle by saying you were afraid that you would die and never know his name. That was a cheap trick, Grandma. You’re 98 now and still living on your own. Only people who don’t know you are amazed.I cry when I talk about you because I am afraid I disappointed you. “How could you?” you asked me, when I told you that we were moving to Germany. You will never forgive Germany, and I wonder if you will forgive me. We don’t talk about these things. Next time I see you, though, I will ask you about motherhood. Whether you ever lost your patience with “the boys.” I love how you still call them that, even though they’re in their 60s and 70s now.My children, and being apart from you during the High Holy Days, make me brood about life. An engineer friend said she knows that if she accomplishes nothing else, when she dies, the bridge that she designed will still be here. I will never have a bridge, and neither will you. When we go, only our family and friends will have a piece of us. Some days, I worry that’s not enough. I try to plan something “great” that will leave a mark on the world forever, and I go to sleep a little sad and desperate, knowing that likely will never happen. I am not special, and we are not extraordinary. Other days, making breakfast or tidying the kitchen feels sublime. With children at my feet and love in the home, I wonder what more a person could possibly want. On the days that I miss you most, it helps to picture you in your own kitchen. I don’t cook much, but I still remember that you told me the secret to good cooking is, “Never use the fake stuff.”Our written voice is so different than our spoken voice, but in both, I am careful. I know that you want us to be happy, but don’t know if you can stand to hear how much we love Berlin. It is a city that embraces family the way that we do, you and I. It provides the most wonderful playgrounds for children to explore and grow. It is a culture that cherishes family, and (at least in my field) does not expect people to stay at the office instead of going home for dinner. The government provides subsidies for the children and my maternity leave this year, so I can stay home with the baby.We came here seeking maybe what your parents sought when they moved to New York. In some ways, our family story has now come full circle. We are back in Europe now, it is safe for us again, and once again our home country is awash in anti-Semitism, racism, and a rising nationalism. These comparisons are extreme in many ways, I know. In others, they are apt. I wish you would forgive the Germans. Or rather, I wish you would understand that my Berlin is not the Berlin of your day. Maybe you do.I am out of words for today, Grandma. Please be well.All my love, AnniePreviously published as ‘Dear Grandma Bea’ in Annie’s LETTERS FROM BERLIN column for The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:Why We Need to Break the Silence on Gun Control by M.L.

59,ENTERTAINMENT,Carson Daly Isn't Sure About This 'TRL' Reboot,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carson-daly-isnt-sure-about-this-trl-reboot_us_59d79b74e4b072637c43aa32,Especially following MTV's decision to launch the show right after the Vegas shooting.,2017-10-06,"DJ Khaled, Ed Sheeran, Ethan Dalton and Grayson Dalton view Nike Air Jordan sneakers during the MTV TRL Kick-Off at Times Square on October 2, 2017 in New York City. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d7a6512000000e3408575a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the late ’90s, as soon as that final school bell would ring, kids everywhere rushed out of the hallways to make it home in time for the start of “TRL.” It was the show for all things music, celebrity and pop culture ― and it was a smash success. The boisterous crowd outside the studio in Times Square would gaze up at co-creator and host Carson Daly as he counted down the top 10 music videos of the day, while simultaneously interviewing pop princess Britney Spears or that boy band *NSYNC. As Daly recalls to HuffPost, “the passion of the youth of America literally shut down the busiest intersection in the world, and that was powerful to me.” This week, the new “TRL” debuted to pretty awful reviews. Entertainment Weekly said it “never had a chance.” The AV Club called it a “nightmare.” Vanity Fair insisted it “doesn’t quite know what it wants to be.” Although Daly hasn’t watched the revived show’s inaugural episodes, he’s read a few things about the kick-off. What sticks out most to him, as a host and producer of the highly successful “The Voice,” is that they went on with their launch a day after the country was devastated by the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas at the Route 91 Harvest festival. “Well, they’re going to postpone the launch after the tragedy that just happened, especially with it being at a concert,” Daly thought. “How are they going to launch a happy go-lucky video show?” Well, MTV did launch it. But amid rocky segues, numerous production snafus and off-color moments, did they pull it off? If anyone understands how hard it is to get a show off the ground, it’s Daly. Although “TRL” was a cultural phenomenon from 1998 to its end in 2008, like any other program it had to test the waters before cranking the ship up to full speed. Daly says MTV has a “tough task” ahead of it, relaunching a show that served a certain purpose 20 years ago ― a purpose that, he says, no longer exists. “The world has changed so much, especially in the consumption of music and technology and the internet and smartphones,” he explained. “You were stuck watching me, *NSYNC and Kid Rock back then because we were the only show in town. You know? It was like ‘American Bandstand.’ Now, you don’t have to do that anymore.” Who knows if “TRL” would have sustained its initial success if MTV didn’t switch to scripted reality shows ― in Daly’s mind, “Laguna Beach” signaled the downfall of the program. “The network made a choice to move out of the music space and go into that [reality realm], and then I knew it was time for me to go, because I’m a music guy,” Daly told HuffPost of his departure in 2003, “And now, they’re trying to come back to it? Can they do it? I don’t know.” But aside from his mixed feelings on the new show, Daly says “Total Request Live” ― which he himself shortened to “TRL” “as a joke” ― provided him with so many experiences and memories he’ll cherish forever. “I was cleaning out my mom’s [Patti Daly Caruso, who died last month] house and I found a ‘TRL’ poster ... a big picture of an episode that somebody framed and matted. It’s from my vantage point on the ‘TRL’ set as it was ending and Eminem came for maybe ‘8 Mile,’ and it was that typical 40th and Broadway ― just a sea of kids and cops and we literally had to shut down [Times Square]. That picture, to me, just typifies that entire ‘TRL’ era.” “It’s a tough nut to crack to bring back the glory of yesteryear,” he added of the revival, “but I do wish them well.”"
60,WOMEN,Harvey Weinstein And The Danger Of Performative 'Wokeness',Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvey-weinstein-and-the-danger-of-performative-wokeness_us_59d6b43be4b0f6eed34f421e,Being a public progressive doesn’t preclude you from being a private creep.,2017-10-06,"Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and producer Harvey Weinstein attend the TIME 100 Gala, TIME'S 100 Most Influential People In The World, cocktail party at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 24, 2012 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d79320140000a6234936a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the last 30 years, Harvey Weinstein has positioned himself as a left-wing political champion ― a feminist, even.He fundraised for Democratic politicians like Al Gore, Barbara Boxer, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama. He helped endow a Rutgers chair in feminist activist Gloria Steinem’s name. His company distributed “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary on the epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses and the hell victims go through when they try to seek justice. He participated in a Women’s March in Park City, Utah this past January. (Scroll down for photographic proof. A befuddled-looking Weinstein is in the center.)But according to the New York Times, while he was publicly championing films about women and fundraising for woman politicians, privately he was allegedly requesting massages from his female underlings while in the nude.On Thursday, the NYTimes reported that Weinstein has reached monetary settlements with at least eight women over three decades, including actress Rose McGowan, and that many more women allege that they have experienced sexual harassment or misconduct at his hands. Ashley Judd told the Times that Weinstein had “appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower” during a breakfast meeting. A former temporary employee of Weinstein’s described being offered a career in exchange for accepting his sexual advances. And a 2015 memo written by another former employee, Lauren O’Connor, calls the Weinstein Company “a toxic environment for women.” Over the last 24 hours, more stories about Weinstein’s interactions with young women have begun to emerge.This juxtaposition ― between an outward-facing promotion of women’s rights, experiences and gender-based injustices, and then alleged private predatory behavior ― is a narrative that has long followed Weinstein. The gap between his professed values and his behavior is staggering, if not surprising. Hollywood (and Silicon Valley... and DC...) are littered with public progressives who are alleged to be private creeps; men who use their “feminist cred” to excuse or conceal the ways they treat women like dirt. Director and screenwriter Joss Whedon, who has long been praised for his “strong woman characters” and feminist speeches, was recently put on blast by ex-wife Kai Cole for “preaching feminist ideals” publicly, while privately gaslighting and deceiving her. According to Cole, Whedon went so far as to blame his marital failings on the patriarchy. And on Thursday, a BuzzFeed report on right-wing ideologue Milo Yiannopoulos and Breitbart revealed that several established, mainstream male journalists had been in correspondence with Yiannopoulos, encouraging him to target feminist writers and activists. One of those journalists was Mitchell Sunderland, who has written for Vice’s women’s site Broadly about topics like Amber Rose’s SlutWalk and Scottie Nell Hughes’ alleged rape. BuzzFeed reported that in May 2016, Sunderland emailed Yiannopoulos about author Lindy West. “Please mock this fat feminist,” he wrote. (Sunderland has since been fired from Vice.)Even “good guys” are not inoculated from doing very bad things. But a “good guy” persona both increases the likelihood that a woman will let her guard down, and decreases the likelihood that she will be believed if she says something. After all, how could the feminist creator of “Buffy” who claps back at misogynists online be a philandering creep? How could good ol’ Cliff Huxtable be a rapist? How could a film executive who raised thousands of dollars for Hillary Clinton take advantage of the women in his professional orbit?Male allies are few and far between, so it can be difficult to let the dream of one die. It’s why just three weeks after Kai Cole’s essay was published, I got a press release from women and girls’ rights organization Equality Now listing Joss Whedon as creative director of their 25th anniversary gala.This is the danger of tying the project of gender equality too closely to its most public male champions. Public-facing “wokeness” does not necessitate a private follow-through on those values. When we pretend it does, we inadvertently offer cover to men who don’t deserve it. After the NYTimes story broke, actress Constance Wu, star of ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat,” tweeted about how common stories of harassment at the hands of Hollywood “good guys” are. “It’s happened to me a lot,” she later told me, clarifying that she had never interacted with Weinstein and was speaking more generally about Hollywood producers. “Thing is, the men often don’t even realize that they are private creeps. They fool even themselves. Delusion is strong.”She also pointed to the way these powerful men tend to use that lack of self-awareness as a defense when they are called out for acting inappropriately. ″[They] attempt to say that because their ‘intentions’ were good or unaware, their actions are therefore exempt? It’s a horrible cycle,” said Wu. “It gets even muddier when you’re a woman of color talking about a man of color doing it.”The delusion Wu references is apparent in Weinstein’s response to the allegations made against him. In the statement he released following the Times report, Weinstein blamed the fact that he “came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different” for his behavior. Apparently, until the last year, he couldn’t grasp why it might be unacceptable to be naked in front of his young, female employees or ask actresses to watch him shower. In fact, Weinstein was supposedly so divorced from the reality of appropriate professional interactions with women that he needed to hire attorney Lisa Bloom to “tutor” him on the ins and outs of treating women with basic human dignity. In her initial statement on the matter, Bloom characterized Weinstein as “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” Someone should let Bloom know that even old dinosaurs can be incredibly vicious.And, of course, Weinstein couldn’t help propping up his own righteousness while apologizing to the women he has hurt.“I am going to need a place to channel that anger so I’ve decided that I’m going to give the NRA my full attention,” he wrote, immediately plugging a movie he is making about Donald Trump and a foundation he is setting up: “One year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC. While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year.” What a #WokeBae. If you have more information about Harvey Weinstein, send us an email: scoops@huffingtonpost.com."

Nope, still not as distressing as this never-ending “Sex and the City” drama.We’ve been hearing different stories all week from the cast of the HBO series about a third movie installment, which was apparently scheduled to begin filming this month. After Sarah Jessica Parker announced that the project was officially not happening, attention turned toward co-star Kim Cattrall, whose demands allegedly halted production. Cattrall, who played Samantha Jones in the franchise, has since gone on the defense. The English actress shut down the rumors and called out her “Sex and the City” co-stars in one particularly inflammatory interview with Piers Morgan.Now, she’s continuing the conversation with fans on social media, shedding some more light on her decision to step away.“I’ve moved on,” Cattrall wrote on Instagram, according to People. “61 isn’t 53 or 41. I have learned so much from our Sam. She was my hero but I want to rest & not work as much as I have been doing for years. I want a less hectic life. My decision reflects where I am in my life & I can’t change that without being unhappy. I hope you’ll understand.”The actress also expressed a bit of frustration over some fans’ reactions to her decision to forego another sequel.“I’ve been wanting to change my life for some time. I have to much I want to experience before much time goes by,” she wrote on Instagram. “I don’t completely understand why that is so foreign to people or difficult to understand. Going back to playing this role wouldn’t make me happy. I’ve worked hard and I’d like to enjoy what I’ve accomplished with the people closet to me. Why wold anyone begrudge you having that? I was naive enough to think people would get it & wish me well.”While Cattrall maintains that she put her foot down in December 2016, her cast members have questioned her version of events, considering that production had been slated to begin soon.Earlier in the week, “Sex and the City” actor Willie Garson, who played Stanford Blatch in the show, shaded Cattrall and then some on Twitter. His co-star Evan Handler ― who played Charlotte’s husband, Harry ― weighed in, too.“I was suddenly contacted, just two or three months ago, and told that a third movie was definitely happening,” Handler wrote on Facebook. I was astonished, but delighted. Then, less than three weeks later, that ‘they are pulling the plug,’ and it was not to be.”We’re sure this isn’t the last we hear on “Sex and the City.”"

The title of the drama is a reference to the six state officials who were criminally charged for their roles in the water crisis.“It’s a redemption story,” Green, a Flint native, told HuffPost, explaining that he doesn’t want the public to only see Flint residents as victims of the crisis. “These people are so resilient that they’re victors as well. I want to show that side, I want to show them taking things into their own hands and being victorious.” For Green, that meant actually filming in Flint to help better capture the events that unfolded as lead-contaminated water was discovered throughout the city.So Green says when he was offered $3.75 million by producers hoping to finance the film, he was over the moon. But once he learned of their hopes to scout for film locations outside of Flint, which Green attributed to Michigan’s absence of film incentives, he immediately rejected the offer.“I said no,” Green told HuffPost. “I can’t compromise the integrity of the story. I’m from Flint and I can’t treat the people like this because they deserve better.” Green said the film brokers loved the film’s script, but wanted to tape it outside of Flint after discovering that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) signed a bill in 2015 ending tax incentives that would benefit filmmakers and attract Hollywood directors to film in the state. The incentive had previously drawn big-budget films like “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” “Red Dawn” and the “Transformers” franchise, according to the Detroit Free Press. “The same governor that needs to be held accountable for the water crisis is the same governor that canceled the tax incentive for films,” Green said. Green, who has starred in several big productions including OWN’s “Greenleaf,” said it was important to not only maintain the integrity of the movie but also offer opportunities to Flint residents to be a part of the project.“I thought it would be dope to take this film to Flint and teach people how to audition, learn to be a production assistant, or get some experience in different parts of the film industry,” he said. After rejecting the multimillion-dollar offer, Green opted to fundraise the money himself and later launched a campaign on Indiegogo. He said he is relying on the support of his community, fans and other backers to raise money to help make the film happen.“We want to keep this as relevant as possible until the problem is fixed,” a description on the fundraiser page reads. “Our Contributors will also allow us to use our story, our film, as a way to earn money to give back directly to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint.” The goal for the fundraiser is set at $75,000, but the full budget for the film will cost approximately $540,000, Green said. He plans to start production in March and has already identified most of the movie’s lead actors, including himself.“After growing up in Flint, it is one of the roughest places ever and if you can make it from Flint, you can make it anywhere and do anything,” Green said. “And if you can get the people of Flint, you can do anything.” “The good thing about this story is that the whole city is behind it,” Green said. “Even the mayor loves this story; she read it, she loved it.” The water crisis in the city has continued to plague residents as officials are working to replace corroded lead pipes. The crisis could have long-term health effects on children, and many residents still use bottled water to wash, consume and bathe, including Green’s parents.“I’m pissed,” Green said. “I’m going to be pissed about it until it’s fixed, and even after it’s fixed, I’m gonna be pissed that it happened.” “My goal with this film is that it sparks some minds to figure out how to fix this as a national problem,” he added. “Of course I want my city to heal, but the water crisis is a national problem.”"

Or has it?Based on my years in the industry and unfortunately, my own personal experience with Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you that I believe every single word that was written in the extremely disturbing, but not all that shocking, New York Times piece published yesterday. Not all that shocking because very similar things happened to me. I was naive, new to the industry, and didn’t know how to deal with his aggressive advances ― work invitations with a friend late-night at The Toronto Film Festival, and later an invitation to meet with him about a role in The Peninsula Hotel, where staff were present and then all of a sudden disappeared like clockwork, leaving me alone with this extremely powerful and intimidating Hollywood legend.Like so many young women, I was taught from the earliest of ages to be polite and keep things “nice.” I was socialized to respect powerful men. This experience, among many others, was part of what inspired me to make Miss Representation. I couldn’t stomach that the industry that had so much power in creating our culture was so entirely demeaning, disrespectful, and diminishing of women and girls.The pattern with Harvey is one we are now familiar with. Scores of women, adding upon years of rumors and heaps of settlements, created a tower so tall that it finally started to tip over. I am so grateful for the many women who courageously spoke out against his behavior despite understanding that “speaking up could have been costly.” Despite knowing that “The balance of power is [us]: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.” I am grateful for their bravery. I am grateful for their fight against the odds and for inspiring me to publically speak the truth.But I am also extremely exhausted, as I know they are. Why should so many of us women have to be both the victims and the brave heroes?! Why isn’t one of us speaking the truth enough to end this cycle of violence?!!Because however many hotel robe-wearing incidents, private conversations, and settlements later, it is clear that his behavior was not just widespread, but also well documented. A cadre of witnesses and a paper trail of evidence was as clear as the eye could see. It was an “open secret.” And the entire engine of Harvey Weinstein’s business and legal machines seem to have been working overtime to silence decades and dozens of accusations.I am dumbfounded by the culture of silence. It’s clear that there were many who knew but who did not stand with the victims. It’s clear that there were many who were too driven to protect their own power and privilege to ensure the perpetrator suffered the consequences.Until now, I hope.Women have been exposing this “secret” for years and reporters have been trying to report his predatory behavior for years. But perhaps those in power now finally recognize there must be consequences for men like Harvey. There must be consequences for behavior that systemically harms and oppresses women. And if these consequences can’t or won’t be won in the legal realm (as has yet to be the case for any of the men mentioned above, not to mention the culprit-in-chief, our current President) then at least their reputations, powerful perches, and business opportunities should suffer. Right? I mean, shouldn’t good trump evil in the end?Certainly the public consciousness around these issues has been raised. But this is only the first step. What will we ultimately do with this newfound consciousness? Will the “code of silence” on sexual harassment and assault finally be broken in the highest offices and most powerful industries across the land?Let this be the end of “open secrets.” Let there be no more passive waiting for the victims to reach a certain number before we actually do something about this culture of sexual harassment and assault. And let this really be the end of Harvey Weinstein and the Weinstein’s of the world― no matter their wealth, no matter their power, no matter their privilege. Because the Harveys of the world will do whatever it takes to put up a fight and silence their victims, intimidate them from coming forward.There is so much strength in our numbers, but we cannot do this on our own.We need more people in power ― particularly men in power ― to break the code of silence and stand up for what is right and what is just and challenge this culture of sexual harassment and assault against women. This requires empathy and conviction and most of all it requires bravery. We must listen to the pain and suffering of others and stand proudly and loudly alongside them. To that end, we need more powerful men like Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria, Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr, Jimmy Kimmel, John Legend, Lebron James and my very own husband Gavin Newsom who understand their place of privilege in the public eye and use it to defend and protect those who need defending. Not when it’s popular, not when it’s safe, not when it’s low stakes ― but actually when it isn’t. And, we need more men in particular to do this for women.Perhaps when enough male allies do that ― we can start to really shift attitudes and behavior towards creating a more just and equitable culture for all ― where women, people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ communities are valued for their whole humanity. Where women are seen as so much more than their youth, their beauty, and their sexuality.Imagine that world for our kids. Where there are enough of us standing proudly and loudly for what is right that the injustices do not happen in the first place. It’s up to ALL of us to make it happen. I know we can.If you have more information about Harvey Weinstein, send us an email: scoops@huffingtonpost.com."

On ISIS? On what?”“We have the world’s great military people,” Trump replied. “Thank you all for coming.”When pressed once more by NBC News’ Kristen Welker on what the “storm” was, the president responded: “You’ll find out.”Reporters at the gathering expressed confusion around the event ― which was called after the day’s press “lid” was placed for the evening. A lid is called when the president has no more scheduled public appearances and is effectively done for the day. It was reinstated after photos were taken.Before the photo spray was called, Trump was hosting a dinner with military officials and their spouses in the Blue Room of the White House.

FEMA Director of Public Affairs William Booher told the newspaper that the figures were still being reported on www.status.pr, a Spanish-language only site that is run by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló.The language barrier would have likely been a limiting factor for non-Spanish speaking American citizens looking to stay up-to-date on figures during Puerto Rico’s current crisis. It might have also made it harder for the English-dominated U.S. media to cover the critical situation. Booher told CNN on Friday morning that the Status.pr website is being “updated daily with different information.”“In fact, [the water and power statistics] cited have moved in a positive direction since that post, so no reason to ‘remove’ it,” he added. “To characterize updating a webpage as ‘removing’ information is and was misleading by the original story.”In a statement to HuffPost on Friday afternoon, Booher said they had added the data back onto the FEMA website. Read the full statement below:FEMA officials provide response and recovery updates in a variety of ways, to include through daily press conferences, news releases and social media posts. The Government of Puerto Rico provides information on the status of infrastructure on its publicly available website (http://www.status.pr) that we regularly use as a source of information for our reports. FEMA’s Hurricane Maria website includes a range of information directly related to the federal response, and we often include some data from the Puerto Rico website. While some information was not included in yesterday’s update to our website, at no point was the data not publicly available. Reports suggesting an effort to ‘remove’ any data points are simply erroneous.More than two weeks after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, the number of citizens without drinking water has gone from 55 percent on Sunday to 44.5 percent as of Friday. While the number of Puerto Ricans with power has increased from around 7 percent on Tuesday to 10.7 percent on Friday. But these gains are marginal as the Trump administration and federal agencies struggle to offer adequate and efficient aid to the U.S. territory with more than 3.4 million people.On Twitter, some expressed concern that removing these crucial statistics from FEMA’s English-language website came off as an attempt to hide the slow recovery efforts on the island. The data’s temporary removal from FEMA’s main website comes after President Donald Trump visited the island on Tuesday. During his visit, Trump repeatedly applauded federal relief efforts on the island and suggested that the then-death toll of 16 meant Puerto Rico’s situation was not “a real catastrophe like Katrina.”“Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said on Tuesday. “You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everyone around this table, and everyone watching, can be very proud of what’s taking place in Puerto Rico.”"

One woman, however, had her own terrifying experience with Weinstein 17 years ago, and that woman, Rebecca Traister, went on to become a New York Times best-selling author and award-winning journalist. In a piece for the Cut published on Thursday night, just hours after the Times published its report, Traister described her personal experience meeting the Hollywood producer, and how Weinstein’s untouchable power made it feel impossible to challenge him or call out his abusive behavior. It was the night before the presidential election in 2000, and Traister was in her mid-20s, working on a story about a film Miramax ― and therefore Weinstein ― was producing. She attended an event with her then-boyfriend, fellow journalist Andrew Goldman, in hopes of tracking down Weinstein for comment. The night before the 2000 election, I was working on a story — perhaps my first seriously reported story — about O, the violent reimagining of Othello that Miramax’s Dimension division was then sitting on, perhaps out of deference to the cringey clean-media message of the Al Gore–Joe Lieberman campaign, which Weinstein was publicly supporting; already there was talk of Weinstein’s ambitions in Democratic politics. After Weinstein failed to respond to my calls for comment, I was sent, on Election Eve 2000, to cover a book party he was hosting, along with my colleague Andrew Goldman. Weinstein didn’t like my question about O, there was an altercation; though the recording has alas been lost to time, I recall that he called me a cunt and declared that he was glad he was the “fucking sheriff of this fucking lawless piece-of-shit town.” When my colleague Andrew (who was also then my boyfriend) intervened, first calming him down and then trying to extract an apology, Weinstein went nuclear, pushing Andrew down a set of steps inside the Tribeca Grand — knocking him over with such force that his tape recorder hit a woman, who suffered long-term injury — and dragging Andrew, in a headlock, onto Sixth Avenue.Traister writes that, though she’d witnessed his explosive character first-hand, and had heard rumblings about his predatory sexual behavior for years, she never considered writing about the incident or any allegations against him ― Weinstein simply wielded too much power to be checked. “I remembered what it was like to have the full force of Harvey Weinstein — back then a mountainous man — screaming vulgarities at me, his spit hitting my face. I had watched him haul my friend into the street and try to hurt him,” Traister wrote. “That kind of force, that kind of power? I could not have won against that.” HuffPost has reached out to The Weinstein Co. for comment and will update this piece accordingly. Check out the full piece here. "

We would like to make a sincere and formal apology to the Chinese community and wish to assure them that this game was not created with an intentional interest of inflicting harm or malice against Chinese culture.The game, as originally promoted, centered on a character named “Wong Fu,” who was running the sketchiest restaurant imaginable. The developers said that players would score points by evading taxes and immigration officials and by saving food costs via dumpster diving or chasing after dogs and cats with a cleaver.Although the game was first announced in 2016, it came under fire late last month when Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) denounced it on Facebook.“This game uses every negative and demeaning stereotype that I have ever come across as a Chinese American,” she wrote. “From the names used for the characters of the game, to the types of food they cook, to the disturbing depiction of their faces, this game epitomizes racism against Asian Americans.”"

But one thing was missing from the hopeful headlines: There’s a major gap in mortality between black and white women.According to a new report from the American Cancer Society, breast cancer death rates declined 39 percent between 1989 and 2015. As of 2015, white women have a 39 percent greater chance of surviving the disease than black women do. That racial disparity emerged in the early ’80s, widened through 2015 and has remained steady since, the report says. Meanwhile, Native American, Latina and Asian women have lower rates of breast cancer and death from breast cancer than white women. Experts say that biological differences in breast cancer tumors, along with health care policy, keep the gap wide. Black women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form that’s harder to treat. And tamoxifen, a drug that’s hugely responsible for the overall improvement in death rates, treats another type of breast cancer, called hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, that black women are less likely to get.Unequal access to preventive screenings and treatment is another reason for the difference in death rates between white and black women. Black women get mammograms slightly more often than white women nowadays, but they had lower screening rates in the past, which “may be one possible reason for the difference in survival rates today,” according to the Susan G. Komen website. Access to follow-up care can also differ among the races, they add.Less access to screening means black women might wait longer between mammograms, be diagnosed late or be unable to follow up altogether when a mammogram comes back abnormal, said Beth Glenn, associate director for the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity. For black women who live in poverty, clinics might be too far away. Poverty indeed blocks some black women from care, said Christine Ambrosone, a cancer prevention chair at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.“Things like transportation for cancer treatment can be a barrier,” she told HuffPost, “particularly for women who need radiation therapy, a treatment that needs to be given daily, and who cannot get that time off from work.”But even when economics is controlled for, black women face barriers due to the biological factors mentioned above, as well as racial discrimination in health care settings.Interestingly, the report mentions three U.S. states ― Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware ― that have managed to close the gap, likely by widening health care access so it’s easier for everyone to get treatment when they need it. The prime example is Massachusetts, which passed a health care reform law in 2006 requiring all residents to have health insurance and offering free health insurance to poor residents who qualify.“In general, states with more coverage for low-income women tend to have better outcomes” regarding breast cancer deaths, Glenn said. Wide-ranging health insurance laws aren’t the only way states can improve mortality rates for black women with breast cancer, Carol Desantis, the report’s lead author and a director at the ACS, told HuffPost. Targeted investments in breast cancer programs could go a long way to helping patients get the care they need, too.Glenn pointed to programs like the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, a government program that helps low-income women get access to screenings. While these federal government programs do exist, she said, ultimately states control how they’re enacted. States could give more funding to these programs to help close the gap. They could also pass policies requiring insurance companies to pay for all recommended breast cancer treatments and making it easier for patients to get insurance authorizations for the treatments they need.Experts also say hospitals need to factor diversity into hiring and training and work to make health care settings more inclusive. Ambrosone said speaking up about racial differences is key, too. “These [report] results show that we need to advocate for one another ― as individuals and communities ― to try to eliminate these inequalities in diagnosis and care,” she said.

Pax, his mother Cheryl and father Mark, spoke at the ACLU press conference in Seattle about the lawsuit.Pax was assigned female at birth, but never felt quite right about himself. He suffered severe anxiety starting when he hit puberty at age 11 and was eventually diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition marked by persistent and clinically significant distress caused by incongruence between an individual’s gender identity and that individual’s sex designated at birth. Gender dysphoria is a condition codified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).In order to properly treat Pax’s gender dysphoria, Pax’s doctor prescribed chest reconstruction surgery. Not only did PeaceHealth deny the request after his insurance approved it, they refused treatments on the basis of his admission of being transgender.The lawsuit asserts PeaceHealth’s blanket policy of refusing to pay for medically necessary healthcare for otherwise covered transgender individuals simply because of who they are discriminates on the basis of sex and gender identity, violates the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), and is harmful to the health of transgender individuals.“PeaceHealth’s blanket of exclusion of ‘transgender services’ is not based on standards of medical care,” said ACLU-WA Staff Attorney Lisa Nowlin. “This is discrimination, and it is plainly illegal. Under state and federal law, no company is allowed to single out and exclude one group of individuals from medical care that is prescribed for them by their doctors and that the company routinely provides for others.”In the past, some public and private insurance companies excluded coverage for gender dysphoria (or “transition-related care”) based on the erroneous assumption that such treatments were cosmetic or experimental. Today, however, every major medical organization recognizes that such exclusions have no basis in medical science and that transition-related care is effective for the treatment of gender dysphoria.Discrimination by health care providers routinely causes transgender people to delay or forgo preventative and necessary medical care, putting them at greater risk for debilitating anxiety, depression, self-harm, and even suicide.As a result of PeaceHealth’s exclusion for “transgender services,” the Enstads were forced to remove $10,000 from their son’s college savings account and take out a second mortgage on their house in order to get the help Pax needed to live a full and healthy life.“We were willing to do whatever it took to get Pax the medical care he needed - as any parent would,” Cheryl said. “When your child is singled out and rejected simply for being themselves, it’s heartbreaking, and it isn’t fair. We’re bringing this lawsuit to ensure no family has to go through what we did.”Cheryl worked at PeaceHealth over 20 years in social work and continues to be employed at the facility on an on-call basis. She admitted that it has become a strained environment since her son was denied life-saving coverage. Her husband works as a marine engineer.The lawsuit asks the court to declare PeaceHealth’s blanket exclusion of “transgender services” discriminatory and illegal. It also seeks unspecified damages for the Plaintiffs.The lawsuit, Enstad v. PeaceHealth, was filed in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington. PeaceHealth operates 70 sites in Washington, Oregon, and Alaska and has approximately 16,000 employees.In addition to Nowlin, attorneys for the Enstads include Josh Block and Leslie Cooper with the ACLU LGBT & HIV Project and Denise Diskin and Beth Touschner of Teller & Associates."

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) speak in support of the Dream Act with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients who traveled to Washington to advocate for their cause.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d5752d2d00009c17308b90.jpeg?cache=GOlMMmJnus&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — If Congress does not pass an immigration bill, Jesus Perez will not be able to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor. Brisa Ledezma will have to quit her job as a sixth-grade teacher. Both of them, along with hundreds of thousands more who currently have protections, will be at risk of deportation from a country they’ve lived in since they were children. They were two of more than 100 so-called Dreamers ― young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ― who descended on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to ask lawmakers to support a bill that would allow them to gain legal status and eventual citizenship. The clock is ticking. President Donald Trump last month rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which means that without congressional intervention, 700,000 current DACA recipients will lose their two-year work permits and deportation protections. The administration will stop accepting applications for renewal for a small subset of those DACA holders on Thursday, and in six months recipients will begin to lose protections en masse as their permits expire. Trump told Congress he wants lawmakers to act, and many from both parties say they want to. Now they just have to be convinced to follow through ― which is where the Dreamers come in. “I hope they see that we’re good people, the Dreamers are good people,” Perez said in an interview.The Dreamer movement has used personal stories for years to gain support for granting legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Even immigration hardliners sometimes adopt sympathetic language for them ― that they were brought here by their parents through no fault of their own, or that this is the only country they know. Sixty-three percent of Trump voters ― who supported a candidate who campaigned on mass deportations ― believe Dreamers should be given a path to citizenship, according to a recent Fox News poll. Perez hadn’t shared his story much before, but did so in a very public way on Wednesday: during a press conference with Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in support of the Dream Act, a bill that would grant legal status to Dreamers and eventually allow them to become citizens. Perez flew into D.C. from Oklahoma early Wednesday with several other DACA recipients and allies for a day of lobbying organized by pro-immigration reform group FWD.us. He said he was a bit nervous about his speech beforehand, but his experience performing music made him a more comfortable in front of the cameras, and he felt confident people back home wouldn’t think of him any differently for knowing his immigration status.He told the reporters gathered that DACA has allowed him to work in a hospital, where he can help patients “feel comfortable and get the care they need in very scary moments in their lives,” and has helped him pay for his pre-med courses at Oklahoma State University.“When my DACA protections end, I would lose my job and won’t be able to pay for class, putting my dreams and the care of patients at my hospital on hold,” Perez said during the press conference. “If the Dream Act passes, I’ll be able to continue my studies, apply for medical school, and become the cardiothoracic surgeon I know I am meant to be.”Afterward, he and the other Oklahoma Dreamers walked to the House office buildings to meet with two lawmakers from their state: first Steve Russell, and then Markwayne Mullin, both Republicans.Neither member is sponsoring the Dream Act, which has five Republican backers in the House. Nor are they currently signed onto the Recognizing America’s Children Act, a House Republican alternative to the Dream Act with narrower eligibility, which has 34 GOP co-sponsors. But they seemed convincible. Russell has said publicly he believes Dreamers should be allowed to become citizens, and Oklahoma advocates said their time with him and a meeting with his staffer were encouraging. The Mullin meeting was an even bigger success ― they said the congressman met with them for nearly 45 minutes, and said he would love to talk to them all day if he could. Mullin told the group that he knows undocumented immigrants and that the issue is personal for him, they said. He also told them that the fact DACA recipients will begin to lose protections in larger numbers should force Congress to act, Ledezma said. “Having deadlines is very important to them, so this deadline makes it a priority,” she said. “We want to trust that he means what he says.” The Dreamers said Mullin told them they could help back home by sharing their stories more with the community and encouraging others to reach out to members of Congress and ask them to support legislation. The group was urging lawmakers to support the Dream Act specifically. But they say it would still be a good step if Congress backed another bill to provide legal status to Dreamers ― the SUCCEED Act from their home-state Sen. James Lankford (R), along with Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) ― even though Dreamers and advocates have concerns about that bill.“Maybe we have a foot in,” Ledezma said.Perez said he believes the Dream Act is the best choice for them, but he might be willing to accept something else if it meant he could stay in the U.S. and become a doctor.“The community in Oklahoma has given me so much that I want to give back to them,” he said in an interview. “If I’m able to achieve that goal, then I’d be more than happy.” "
74,QUEER VOICES,Norwegian Singer Astrid S: Troye Sivan Tour Introduced 'Unconditional Love' Of LGBTQ Fans,"Pollo Del Mar , ContributorDrag queen on the SF social, political, editorial and fundrais...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/norwegian-pop-princess-astrid-s-troye-sivan-tour-introduced_us_59d5e531e4b0666ad0c3cae0,"With a population of just over 5.3 million, Norway is historically known for fishing, its petroleum industry and as home",2017-10-05,<p>New single “Think Before I Talk” is poised to make Norwegian pop princess Astrid S a global sensation.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d5e6c52d0000ef08308c21.png?ops=crop_26_2_606_396%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"With a population of just over 5.3 million, Norway is historically known for fishing, its petroleum industry and as home of the Vikings. More recently, the Scandinavian nation has become a hotbed for electronica – birthing dance music tastemakers Kygo and Matoma. Soon singer Astrid S could join their ranks as Norway’s hottest pop music export.“Last year I worked my ass off, and it is really nice to see this year it has paid off,” Astrid S told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “Hopefully my hard work this year will pay off next year too.”For now, Astrid S is Scandinavia’s own little secret – but perhaps not for long. She first shot to fame in her “small and intimate” homeland in 2013, as a favorite on televised singing competition Pop Idol. Since, the 19-year-old has hit the country’s Top 10 a cool half-dozen times.“In Norway, everyone knows everyone, and everyone is very supportive of each other,” she stated, “If there is anyone new, or a new song is coming out, everyone will probably know about it.”For Astrid S – real name Astrid Smeplass – that fueled early success at home. Of nine total singles, all but one have landed in the upper half of the Norwegian Top 40. In 2016, she tasted her first intercontinental success. “Hurt So Good” became a Top 20 hit in New Zealand.Her greatest achievement to date, though, has undoubtedly been current single “Think Before I Talk.” A saccharine pop anthem about troubled romance, it entered Denmark’s Top 10, made the Swedish Top 20 and became her first Norwegian No. 1 single. As the track continues to build momentum internationally, Astrid calls its success “a relief.”“Things take time,” she said in an interview with Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “But it would be sad if you put in a lot of work and nothing happened!”For Astrid, that fear seems unfounded. Though not coming as quickly as it did in Norway, her international recognition is growing. In addition to a series of solo singles, which have amassed nearly 20 million collective YouTube views, other artists are seeking out the young talent as well. Astrid S appears on the 2015 Avicii release “Waiting for Love” and provided backing vocals for Katy Perry’s “Hey Hey Hey” (though the Norwegian had no idea she was recording for the pop superstar’s Witness album when pulled into a studio to sing). One of her favorite projects to date, she said, is a 2015 recording with Canadian pop star Shawn Mendes. The international pairing collaborated for “Air,” taken from the Mendes’ full-length debut Handwritten.“To be honest, when I was going to do the song with Shawn Mendes, I hadn’t heard of him before,” admitted Astrid. WATCH: Astrid S “Think Before I Talk”Since recording together, Mendes has scored a string of U.S. Top Ten hits. As his present single “There’s Nothing Holding Me Back” lingers in the Billboard Top 20, Astrid S has only glowing things to say about her young contemporary.“He’s been so successful,” Astrid said, “It’s so well-deserved.”Astrid’s own crossover into the global market is in its early phases. This month she launches a European tour and announced her first performances in New Zealand, where she has seen her greatest foreign radio support. Though she tries not to focus too heavily on success – “So I don’t go crazy,” Astrid said with a laugh – she can’t ignore obvious signs her music is reaching new audiences. “You really notice how you’re growing when you go on tour,” she shared. “To be able to tour around the world, and do bigger venues every year, is really, really cool.”After heading home to Norway closer to the holidays, Astrid will return to the studio in the new year. She predicts a full-length album in 2018. Though she has “maybe two songs already,” the rest of the album is currently up-in-the-air.“It’s hard to think long-term with music, especially making music,” she said, explaining uncertainty about which musical direction she might take. “It is just all about what makes me inspired.”Contributing to demand for its release, the singer suggested, was a 2016 tour with out performer Troye Sivan. The experience “opened so many doors,” she said. In addition to the exposure it offered, Astrid admitted concert dates throughout the U.S. and Europe introduced her to Sivan’s massive LGBTQ fan base. “I’ve never felt more unconditional love than from your community,” Astrid relayed.“It’s just the best compliment ever if someone tells me they listen to my music and that, you know, it makes them forget all their problems for a while and maybe they feel like they belong or they feel understood,” she said.“I’m so thankful to also have fans of my own that are part of the [queer] community.” Astrid concluded. “They really [want] to make me feel good onstage and feel good about myself. I have nothing but love for them.”Follow: Party Foul Radio on TwitterLISTEN: Norwegian pop singer Astrid S & Oscar-Winner Patricia Arquette join Party Foul Radio"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d6330c200000093408538e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At the beginning of this week, I intended to write this column in honor of one of Christianity’s most beloved saints and pacifists: Francis of Assisi, whose feast was October 4.But then the Las Vegas tragedy occurred. So instead of celebrating a peacemaker, I now find myself compelled by yet another mass shooting to lament peacebreakers: automatic and pumped-up semi-automatic weapons.The late Jesuit priest and peace activist Richard McSorley once memorably declared that building weapons of mass destruction is a sin.Their deployment is unquestionably sinful because they kill huge numbers of people in an utterly indiscriminate way. But McSorley’s point was that the making and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction is a sin too, signaling as it does a willingness to kill widely and wildly.It won’t do to say that we need them to make the world a safer place. The sobering fact that these weapons can inflict unimaginable destruction on the entire planet ought to disabuse us of that myth. A world bristling with killing machines isn’t safer.Nor will it do to say that weapons of mass destruction are benign when in the hands of responsible national leaders, or that we oughtn’t to condemn them simply because some psychopath might go rogue. Instruments capable of indiscriminately killing large numbers of people are never benign, no matter who controls or wields them.Their very existence is an affront to God and a scandal to anyone who is a disciple of the Prince of Peace.The carnage this week in Las Vegas is but the latest tragedy that makes it horribly clear that what McSorley said about weapons of mass destruction can and should be said about automatic assault weapons. They too are instruments of indiscriminate and massive death.As the New York Times editorialized a day after the shooting, this nation has endured 521 mass shootings in the last 477 days, with “mass shooting” defined by the FBI as an act of violence that injures and/or kills at least 4 persons. Not all of these tragedies involved assault weapons. But the majority of them did, and well over half of the weapons used were obtained legally.The purchase of new automatic assault weapons — machine guns — has been outlawed since 1986. But there are many thousands of pre-1986 ones still on the market and readily available to collectors with enough cash to buy them.Semi-automatic assault weapons, already horrendous killing machines, are easily convertible to virtually automatic ones by installing perfectly legal and cheaply purchased (starting at around $100) bump stocks. Several of the guns used by the Las Vegas shooter were so modified.Owning one of these instruments of death, given the havoc they’re capable of inflicting, is an affront to God. They’re made to kill widely and wildly, and to own one is to turn a blind eye to that miserable fact or, even worse, to shrug indifferently.It won’t do to say that say that these weapons are necessary for self-protection or hunting, because they’re not. Less lethal guns are perfectly adequate for both purposes.Nor is ownership of them made more acceptable if they’re used for merely “recreational” target shooting. Disintegrating a target with a killing machine is dubious recreation.Finally, the standard NRA blame-the-psycho-shooter-not-the-gun defense just doesn’t work anymore. There’s simply been too much killing for that old trope to carry any weight.It is, of course, perfectly legal to buy pre-1986 automatic weapons and to jerry-rig semi-automatic ones with bump stocks. But given that their existence leads to regular and horrendous carnage, owning them and stoutly defending such ownership smacks of moral complicity. Why would any decent person wish to own instruments that have caused so much loss of innocent life? How could any person of conscience justify possessing them?So I ask everyone, but especially my fellow Christians, to prayerfully consider this: if you own an automatic weapon, don’t sell it. Destroy it. Ditto if you’ve pumped up a semi-automatic with a bump stock. Get rid of the bump stock. And really: think about getting rid of the semi-automatic as well.Cleanse your soul of these instruments of death. Honor the God whose incarnation was heralded with joyful cries of “Peace on earth!”Be, as St. Francis of Assisi said, an instrument of peace by breaking the instruments of death.Fr.

Mark Green (R) announced Thursday that he will run for Congress, after he failed earlier this year to win confirmation as President Donald Trump’s Army secretary.“As a proven conservative fighter, I am ready to earn the trust of the voters and take my values and leadership to the United States Congress,” Green said, as reported by The Tennessean. Green withdrew from consideration as Trump’s Army secretary in early May. He faced significant criticism for a number of remarks he had made disparaging the LGBTQ community, Muslims and others. For example, he said he believed being transgender is a disease and said part of the reason he opposes allowing transgender people to use the restroom corresponding to their gender identity is because he has a mission to “crush evil.”Green jumped into the congressional race when Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R) announced Thursday that she would run for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Bob Corker. The Tennessee state legislator expressed frustration with the lack of action by the GOP-led Congress, saying in a statement, “When Republicans hold majorities in Congress, it’s time to lead, not have more committee hearings and protect special interests. The time for appeasement is over.”The conservative Club for Growth quickly jumped in and said it was backing Green’s candidacy: Green also recently met with Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon, who has been encouraging anti-GOP establishment figures to run for Congress. So far, Green is the only Republican running for Blackburn’s seat. Justin Kanew, a former contestant on the “Amazing Race,” is running on the Democratic side.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

They met on Season 17 of the show, fell in love, got engaged and tied the knot a little over a year later, in January 2014, on national television in front of millions of viewers.The pair ― along with other married couples like Trista and Ryan Sutter, Desiree and Chris Siegfried, Ashley and J.P. Rosenbaum, and Molly and Jason Mesnick ― believe their relationship lasted due to the fact that they were both truly ready to find love. Unfortunately, they don’t think all the recent Bachelors and some of their contestants were at that point during filming, so they’re glad to see 36-year-old Arie Luyendyk Jr., who appeared on “The Bachelorette” with Sean in 2012, be named the dating series’ newest star.“The predicament that the show runs into is maybe this 26- or 27-year-old makes it to the end of [‘The Bachelorette’], the audience falls in love with him, so they want him to be the next Bachelor. But in real life, he might not be ready to settle down, or maybe in that situation he thinks he is. So I do think Arie is a pretty good choice,” Sean told HuffPost during an interview on Build Series. “I definitely know he’s a good buddy of mine and he would like to find a wife and have kids, and move on to the next chapter of his life.” Sean is excited to see a more “quirky, kind of nerdy” guy in the role, since he’ll be a little more endearing, in a way.“Even though a lot of people maybe didn’t watch back then or have forgotten him, I think they’ll be reminded really quickly why everybody liked him the first go-around,” Sean said, as Catherine chimed in, “He’s also very serious and, this sounds bad about Arie, but he’s kind of emotional. In terms of, he’s really passionate about finding a woman. I think he’ll be surprising to a lot of people who might have been on the fence about [the decision] or not happy about it.”A lot has changed since Sean and Catherine were on “The Bachelor.” Social media has become much more prevalent these days, and it appears that almost any former star can instantly become an Instagram influencer within seconds of appearing on the show. “People know, ’OK, if I go on the show and I’m the loudest person there, if I cause the most drama, I’ll get the most attention, I’ll get the most Instagram followers, and then maybe I can promote teeth whitener or something like that,’” Sean explained of current “Bachelor” franchise stars. “So I think [social media] has been detrimental in a sense ― this is probably just me being the old man that I am, saying, ‘Back in our day, things were different!’ But I just got the sense that the crazy ones on my season were crazy because they were literally crazy and they weren’t trying to get an Instagram following. But who knows, that’s just me being cynical, maybe.” But Catherine agreed with her husband, adding that the women who appear on the show in recent seasons seem to be so much more glammed-up than she and her co-stars when they joined the dating series five years ago. ″These girls are upping their game. They are flawless. Like, you don’t have a stylist, you don’t have makeup people, so if that’s what they really look like, I’m so glad I wasn’t on any of these seasons,” she said. “I feel a little bit bad for these girls because they have to keep it up ... forever!” Although it’s clear a lot has changed over the years, Sean and Catherine admit they’re all here for the drama that comes along with “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and even the “sketchy” (as Sean calls it) “Bachelor in Paradise” ― they just want it to be, or feel, genuine.Watch the rest of the couple’s interview on Build Series and hear about their partnership with Bertolli below: "

Las Vegas Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Wednesday night that police had found 10 1-pound canisters and two 20-pound canisters of Tannerite in the car of Stephen Paddock. Paddock opened fire on a country music festival on Sunday, killing at least 59 people and wounding more than 500 others. Police said they also found ammonium nitrate in Paddock’s vehicle.Tannerite is the brand name for an explosive primarily used for target practice. It can be bought at most gun shops or online. “Our KICK-ASS invention is specifically designed to be safe,” the company that makes Tannerite says on its website. “We have spent many years perfecting our product.”Hunters and long-distance shooters put Tannerite on targets, retired FBI agent Harold Copus told HuffPost. The substance helps them know when they’ve hit their mark because it causes a little explosion. “A small amount is used for a target,” Copus said. “But 50 pounds, that’s significant. I would ask why did he have it? He certainly wasn’t going down there pasting targets on those people, so I suspect he had it because he was gonna create a bomb.”Tannerite can cause severe burns and “major blast injury” to people who are close to it when it goes off, according to a 2016 study from the Environmental Protection Agency. Authorities also found an unspecified amount of ammonium nitrate in Paddock’s car. The substance is primarily used in fertilizers, and the U.S. uses millions of tons of it each year. And although the risk of danger is low, the EPA said explosions involving ammonium nitrate can have “severe consequences.” Those consequences were perhaps best seen in 2013, when 15 people were killed in an explosion at a fertilizer plant in Waco, Texas. However, the chemical explosives remained untouched during Sunday night’s shooting.“It remained in the car for some reason,” Lombardo said of the material."
80,POLITICS,California Turns Itself Into A 'Sanctuary State',Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-sanctuary-state_us_59ce7423e4b05f005d341453,A bill signed by Gov. Jerry Brown will limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials.,2017-10-05,"Gov. Jerry Brown earlier said the goal ""is to block and not to collaborate with abuse of federal power.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ce895d1800009d0ac9d947.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a “sanctuary state” bill on Thursday that will limit the extent to which local and state enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration officials. It’s the most significant legislative step in the state’s efforts to resist President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant policies. The California Values Act, otherwise known as Senate Bill 54, blocks local police from “using resources to investigate, interrogate, detain, detect, or arrest persons for immigration enforcement purposes.” The prohibited acts include detaining individuals solely at the request of federal immigration officials, making arrests on immigration warrants and inquiring into someone’s immigration status. While many California cities have already adopted such policies, the new law extends those parameters to all law enforcement in the state, including school police.“These are uncertain times for undocumented Californians and their families, and this bill strikes a balance that will protect public safety, while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day,” Brown said in a signing statement. The bill, authored by state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D), was introduced prior to Trump’s inauguration. It seeks to limit the impact of Trump’s immigration crackdown, specifically his actions targeting so-called sanctuary cities.Chief among those moves was the president’s January executive order that threatened to cut funding for cities that don’t cooperate with immigration officials. While that order was blocked by a federal judge earlier this year, the administration has since taken other actions against sanctuary cities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped up arrests in several cities, and Attorney General Jeff Session announced plans to block federal crime-fighting funds for sanctuary cities. “California’s local law enforcement cannot be commandeered and used by the Trump Administration to tear families apart, undermine our safety, and wreak havoc on our economy,” de León said in a statement on Thursday. “We will not stand idly by as President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions seek to divide this nation by scapegoating honest, hardworking families and casting immigrants as threats to be neutralized.”While Brown has broadly supported efforts to protect his state’s immigrant population, the Democratic governor wavered on SB 54 until the bill was amended to address some of his concerns. The revised legislation, unveiled in September, eased off some of the proposed restrictions on how local police could interact with federal officials, most notably allowing sheriffs to share information with the feds about individuals in custody who have been convicted of one of approximately 800 listed crimes. The Brown-approved measure also lets federal officials interview people in local law enforcement custody. “The goal here is to block and not to collaborate with abuse of federal power,” Brown said in August. “It is a balancing act.”The changes to the bill weren’t enough, however, for the California State Sheriffs’ Association. The powerful law enforcement group continued to lobby against the legislation, arguing that it would put police in the position of defying federal orders to comply with state regulations. “Our overarching concern remains that limiting local law enforcement’s ability to communicate and cooperate with federal law enforcement officers endangers public safety,” the sheriffs association said in a statement following release of the amended legislation. “The bill still goes too far in cutting off communications with the federal government.” The new law is set to go into effect in January. However, it’s likely to face legal challenges from Trump’s administration — Sessions called the bill “unconscionable” in September. De León has said he’s prepared to defend the law in court. When asked about the bill during Thursday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn’t say whether the administration would push back against it. “We are spending every day we can trying to find the best way forward; the president will be laying out his responsible immigration plan over the next week,” she said. “I hope that California will push back on their governor’s ... irresponsible decision moving forward.”The “sanctuary state” bill was just one of nearly a dozen immigration protections Brown signed into law Thursday. The other bills he signed included legislation barring landlords from disclosing information about their tenants’ immigration status, a bill blocking local governments from expanding for-profit immigration detention facilities and another blocking ICE officers from entering schools without following specific guidelines. “This action protects public safety and ensures hard-working people who contribute to our state are respected,” Brown said of signing the package of bills.This story has been updated with statements from Kevin de León, Jerry Brown and Sarah Huckabee Sanders."

The NRA donated over $30 million to Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d68c09140000a6234934b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The National Rifle Association, a major gun rights advocacy group that has spent millions of dollars lobbying against gun control legislation, says bump stocks like the ones used by the Las Vegas shooter this past weekend should be subject to “additional regulations.”Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s CEO and executive vice president, issued a joint statement Thursday with Chris Cox, the executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action, the lobbying arm of the NRA.“In the aftermath of the evil and senseless attack in Las Vegas, the American people are looking for answers as to how future tragedies can be prevented,” LaPierre and Cox said in the statement. “Unfortunately, the first response from some politicians has been to call for more gun control.”While the NRA executives pushed back against “banning guns on the criminal act of a madman,” they said that “devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations” ― a surprising concession from a group that has been hell-bent on torpedoing almost any type of gun control measure.“In an increasingly dangerous world, the NRA remains focused on our mission: strengthening Americans’ Second Amendment freedom to defend themselves, their families and their communities,” the statement concluded.Fully automatic weapons are strictly regulated under federal law, but bump stocks offer gun owners a relatively easy ― and cheap ― way to get around such restrictions.Police discovered a cache of weapons, including 12 firearms outfitted with bump stocks, when they stormed the two hotels rooms in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where 64-year-old Stephen Paddock fired hundreds of rounds into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers on Sunday. Hundreds of people were injured and at least 59 were killed, including Paddock, who died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.The gun range at the NRA’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, doesn’t allow the use of bump stocks, an NRA employee confirmed to HuffPost on Thursday. The NRA did not immediately offer a response to HuffPost’s question about why or when this rule was implemented.Bump stock sales have surged in the wake of Sunday’s mass shooting ― the deadliest in modern U.S. history ― as gun enthusiasts worry lawmakers will move to ban the device.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), an avid proponent of tighter gun control legislation, introduced a bill Thursday that would ban the use and possession of bump stocks.“The only reason to modify a gun is to kill as many people as possible in as short a time as possible,” Feinstein told reporters.While the bill currently is without Republican support, some GOP lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have said they would be willing to consider such legislation.But the NRA, which claims to have 5 million members, has repeatedly helped sink numerous efforts by Congress over the years to pass gun control legislation.The gun rights group noted in its statement Thursday that “the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions.”“The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,” the statement read.What isn’t mentioned in the statement is the fact that the NRA worked to prevent Congress from voting on a 2013 bill, also sponsored by Feinstein, that would have outlawed bump stocks.After stating Thursday that bump stocks should be subject to more regulations, the NRA encouraged Congress to pass a concealed carry reciprocity bill, which would significantly loosen gun restrictions by requiring states to recognize concealed carry gun permits from all other states."

The sweatshirt, sold by a vendor called ArturoBuch, reads, “Anorexia: Like Bulimia, except with self control.” The description says the sweatshirt “runs small” and it retails for $24.75 - $30. Amazon declined to comment to HuffPost when asked about its policies on selling offensive merchandise. Reviews for the sweatshirt are overwhelmingly comprised of 1-star reviews ever since Twitter discovered the item. It even warranted a response from Claire Mysko, the CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association. “Jokes about eating disorders are dangerous and cliché. This hoodie propagates the myth that eating disorders are trivial and mere issues of willpower or self-control,” Mysko said in a statement. “Stereotypes like this result in increased stigma and are barriers that prevent people from seeking help. Anorexia is not a ‘lifestyle choice,’ it is a mental health disorder with socio-biological influences. We ask that Amazon stand with those affected by these deadly illnesses and remove the sweatshirt from their store.” Many people who have experienced eating disorders shared their views about the hoodie: Another Twitter user pointed out that there were other clothing items joking about anorexia for sale on Amazon’s site: Though the hoodie is certainly loathsome, it doesn’t fall under the guidelines of Amazon’s “offensive products” page.Under examples of offensive products, Amazon lists “Products that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views, crime scene photographs, morgue or autopsy photographs, human body parts, products retrieved from a disaster or tragedy site, and videos, sound or other recordings taken without the subject’s permission,” but there is nothing that talks about eating disorders. While some commenters argued that Amazon’s hoodie wasn’t offensive, it’s important to remember that every 62 minutes, at least one person dies as a direct result of an eating disorder, according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (NAANAD). Eating disorders affect people of all ages, genders, races and ethnicities and an estimated 30 million people suffer from an eating disorder in the U.S. If you’re struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237."
83,POLITICS,Republicans Make A Political Calculus On State And Local Tax Deduction,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-calculus-state-and-local-tax_us_59d582f4e4b0380b6c9a2628,"There are winners and losers, and some Republicans just want to make sure their constituents don't lose too much.",2017-10-05,Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) is a Republican in one of the three Democratic states that would be most adversely affected by a complete repeal of the state and local tax deduction.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d583e0200000fb1508529b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans from some blue states want their constituents to believe they’ve extracted major tax reform concessions from GOP leadership on the state and local tax deduction, a write-off that mostly benefits highly taxed areas. What may be closer to the truth is that it’s those Republicans, not party leaders, who are retreating from their demands ― and that could have dire political consequences for passing tax reform, as well as for the makeup of the House after the 2018 elections.The story goes that, facing a possible tax reform mutiny from some Republicans, GOP leaders have backed down from a key revenue-raising feature of their proposal: the elimination of the state and local tax deduction. Leaders may be backing off on completely eliminating the so-called SALT deduction. But according to a member familiar with the discussions, whatever change Republicans come up with won’t change the fact that lawmakers expect to bring in big money by scaling back the SALT deduction, the complete elimination of which the Tax Policy Center says would generate an estimated $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years.When HuffPost asked Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) about the potential changes, Brady said lawmakers were still in discussions, reverting back to vague platitudes about Republicans making sure they lower the tax burden for families from every state.That may be the standard, but Republicans in Congress and the White House have thus far refused to promise everyone’s tax bill is going down, partly because a major offset for the cost of their tax overhaul is eliminating the SALT deduction. Financing your bill’s winners by picking some losers in mostly blue states could be a successful strategy in the Senate ― save with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who seems to be insisting no one’s taxes go up. But in the House, the change could put a number of vulnerable Republicans in a tough position, especially if taxes actually do go up for a significant number of their constituents.The Cook Political Report currently rates 15 GOP-held seats as toss up, lean or likely Republican in California, New York and New Jersey ― the three states most adversely affected by repealing the state and local tax deduction. There are also other individual districts in states with politically vulnerable members that greatly benefit from the deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. For instance, Barbara Comstock’s Virginia district has the sixth highest percentage of filers who benefit from the write-off, with Peter Roskam and Randy Hultgren’s Illinois districts ranking 12th and 14th respectively.The amount of money and sheer number of individuals benefitting from the deduction make it difficult to believe that, even before there’s a bill, even with other tax cuts like doubling the standard exemption, everyone in those districts will be a winner. And there’s little way to spin a constituent’s tax bill going up. Voters will know.But that doesn’t seem to be bothering many of these Republicans.Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), the first member to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential run and still one of the president’s most enthusiastic cheerleaders in Congress, told HuffPost this week that Brady and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had given him “assurances.”“There’s going to be an accommodation made on the state and local taxes,” Collins said, adding that the fix could be any number of things, such as capping how much someone could deduct in state and local taxes or just letting someone deduct either their property taxes or their mortgage interest.There is no agreement, however, on what the clawback actually will be, or how much it will put back in the pockets of those taxpayers. If the responses from some Republicans from high-tax states are any indication, it might not have to be that much.Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) told HuffPost he would have to see the specific math before committing to anything, but that he wasn’t necessarily against a tax reform that kept taxes flat for his constituents.“If it has got the other offsets with the increased standard deduction, and it ends up basically neutral to those middle-income taxpayers, then why wouldn’t we?” LaMalfa asked.“If people don’t like it in California, which they’re voting with their feet now on the economic and regulatory conditions they’re dealing with there, they’ll move in a different direction,” he said.“People choose to live in the states based on different criteria,” LaMalfa added, “so I don’t know how you can completely equitably distribute everything.”LaMalfa’s district (the very northern tip of the state) and political situation (R+11) are obviously different than those of an Orange County Republican like Darrell Issa (R+1), who has far wealthier constituents with more expensive homes and taxes. Rep. Steve Knight, who represents an even district with parts of LA County, said the state and local deduction was “the biggest issue” for him on tax reform.But GOP House leadership’s job isn’t necessarily to win over all 28 Republicans from these three states. The mission is to get the bill passed. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) can lose 22 Republicans and still move tax reform to the Senate.If that means Republicans lose votes from some of their more vulnerable members in high-tax states, there’s room for leadership to hand out those passes without tearing apart a major pay-for in the bill. And not tearing apart the bill is a good idea when the vast majority of Republicans, including conservatives, are onboard without ever having seen a bill.Leadership just has to make a cut to the SALT deduction palatable enough to win over some of the Republicans from these states. And the truth is, within these blue states, the write-off affects districts differently, and there are also different competing political consequences in those districts for opposing Trump’s agenda. In New York particularly, there are a number of Republicans who could make a calculation that it would be worse politically to oppose tax reform than to raise taxes on some constituents.In a nod to Trump’s rhetoric, Rep. Tom Reed, who represents the southwest portion of New York, said he’d be comfortable raising taxes on the richest 1 percent to mitigate the state and local tax deduction. “There’s a compromise position here that I think can work,” he said.Republicans seem to be moving toward keeping the top 39.6 percent income tax bracket for the richest Americans. There is also talk of bringing back the estate tax in some form, though it might be tougher to convince Trump to endorse that idea than fourth bracket. Republicans also have a long list of ways they can fudge their numbers, with unrealistic growth rates that will make tax cuts appear to pay for themselves. In the end, the biggest loser from this tax overhaul might be the national debt.Still, there are some Republicans who could be a problem.Unprompted, Peter King (R-N.Y.), who represents part of Long Island, suggested that fellow New York Republican Collins might take less than other Republicans on the SALT issue.“Collins was too quick,” King said. “To me, there has to be changes. We have to see what they are. I’m not signing off on anything.”King said his standard would be that his constituents come out “at least even,” perhaps with some cuts to their tax bill. “They can’t have the rest of the country get a tax cut and then they don’t,” King said.We already know that even with changes, some states, some districts and some individuals will make out better than others. And we know some members will be harder to get than others. Perhaps the toughest could votes to get could be the five New Jersey Republicans, as Trump doesn’t enjoy the same amount of popularity in New Jersey as in upstate New York, and those districts benefit greatly from the SALT deduction.Last week, after Republicans released their tax reform framework, Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) sounded doubtful about voting for a bill that took away the state and local write-off, saying the provision was very important for his district and his state.“It is a very significant deduction for New Jersey,” Lance said. “Very significant!”"
