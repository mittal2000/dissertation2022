0,POLITICS,"Outside Groups Kick Into High Gear Post-Primary In Georgia, South Carolina","OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/outside-groups-kick-into-high-gear-post-primary-in_us_5947f1c2e4b0961faacbe559,"by Sara Swann On Tuesday, voters in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District will vote in the most expensive House election ever",2017-06-19,The special election in Georgia’s 6th District is already the most expensive House race ever.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59481bf615000021004e7168.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Sara Swann On Tuesday, voters in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District will vote in the most expensive House election ever. A staggering $56.7 million (at least) has been spent on the special election, including $51.9 million on the two candidates left standing after the primary. The race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel is the most expensive congressional race in history, easily overtaking Florida 18’s 2012 election, which cost $29.5 million.The money supporting Ossoff and Handel comes from different sources. Ossoff’s campaign has a massive war chest thanks to his popularity with small donors, whereas Handel has had to rely on the aid of super PACs and other outside groups. Ossoff’s immense success in raising money from individuals, especially small donors, started before the primary. He received about $8.3 million by April 18, and reported raising nearly double that again on his most recent FEC report. Through May 31, he has received about $23.6 million, with almost 65 percent of those funds coming from donations of $200 or less. He raised an additional $400,000 in the first week of June, bringing his total to at least $24 million. Although Handel also saw a significant increase in donations after the primary, her total of $4.5 million through May 31, with 35 percent coming from small donors, is dwarfed by Ossoff’s fundraising. Handel raised an additional $173,000 in the first two weeks of June.Where Handel has Ossoff beat, however, is in outside spending totals. Super PACs have not been shy about showing their support for either candidate, but Handel has been the beneficiary of twice as much outside money as Ossoff. Outside spending boosting her campaign or attacking Ossoff totaled $18.2 million as of June 19, against just under $8 million by groups backing Ossoff or opposing Handel. Including only expenditures since the April 18 primary, groups on Handel’s side spent $12.2 million, versus $7 million for Ossoff.The biggest outside players on Handel’s team were the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely tied to the House GOP, which spent more than $6.5 million, and the National Republican Congressional Committee at about $6.7 million. The top two groups backing Ossoff are the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee with about $5 million in independent expenditures and Planned Parenthood Action Fund at about $820,000.Why are both parties so heavily invested in one special election? Ryan Bakker, an associate professor of political science at the University of Georgia, said it comes down to a reaction to President Trump. The Republicans have held this seat since 1979, so losing this election would be a “really hard hit,” Bakker said. It would also reveal fractures between Republicans who align themselves with Trump and those who don’t, he added. (Handel so far has not made any indications on how she feels about the president.)For Democrats, Georgia’s 6th district is appealing because it is a chance to flip a Republican seat. Recently, the north side of Atlanta (which is part of the district) has seen huge growth in its population of minorities and more liberal young people, Bakker said. This explains why Ossoff, a young (30), charismatic and moderate Democratic candidate, has a shot in a typically red district.“If Ossoff had not come so close to winning the district in the primary, you wouldn’t see this kind of money being spent on the election,” Bakker said. “Democrats know the importance of flipping a historically red district so their thought process is: ‘If they can flip Georgia 6, they can flip anything.’” He added that winning this district would give Democrats momentum for the 2018 elections.In the April 18 primary, in which both Republicans and Democrats competed on the same ballot, Ossoff won the most votes — 48.1 percent — but came up just short of the 50 percent necessary to win the seat without a runoff election. With the Republican vote divided between several candidates, Handel came in second place at 19.8 percent. The winner of the runoff will replace Republican Tom Price, who vacated his seat after being appointed President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services in February.So how have Ossoff and Handel spent all of this money? Ads, ads and more ads.The two candidates together have spent about $25.6 million, according to their combined disbursement totals for the pre-special and pre-runoff FEC filings. Most of this money has been dedicated to TV ads.“Handel has really been on the attack (with the ads), putting Ossoff on the defensive,” Bakker said. Ossoff has made ads attacking Handel as well, although not as many. In one ad, breast cancer survivors criticize Handel for cutting grants to Planned Parenthood (which helps women get referrals for mammograms) while she was at the Susan G. Komen Foundation.The vast majority of outside spending has also been on media, primarily TV ads. The Congressional Leadership Fund alone has produced at least 15 ads attacking Ossoff, according to their YouTube account. The videos criticize Ossoff’s ties to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and call him dishonest.Fewer attack ads have been made about Handel, but the DCCC has produced several, including ones that criticized Handel’s budget cuts and called her a “self-serving politician.”Over in South Carolina’s solidly red 5th congressional district, the race to replace Trump’s budget chief Mick Mulvaney in the House has attracted far fewer dollars. Republican Ralph Norman, a former state representative and real estate developer, faces off against Democrat Archie Parnell, a tax attorney whose resume includes Goldman Sachs.Through May 31, FEC reports showed that Norman’s campaign had raised almost $1.3 million and Parnell’s just over $763,000. A good chunk of this comes from the candidates’ own wallets: The May filings show that Norman loaned his campaign $495,000, or close to 40 percent of his total. Parnell also pitched in almost 40 percent of his total fundraising, by donating $100,000 of his own money and giving a $205,000 loan to his campaign. Some may recognize the 5th district of South Carolina as Frank Underwood’s district in the hit Netflix series House of Cards. Parnell has taken advantage of this connection by mimicking the fictional character in his campaign ads.Spending by super PACs and political nonprofits in both the primaries and general election has totaled just over $2 million, nearly all directed toward Republican candidates. Since Norman eked out a victory over the more moderate Republican Tommy Pope in a primary runoff, outside spending has totaled just $85,000. The biggest spender during the primaries was an organization called CLA Inc. Newly registered with the FEC, it spent nearly $400,000 backing Pope, who also got help from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among other groups. Support for Norman came primarily from the conservative Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund, a super PAC founded by former South Carolina Republican Senator Jim DeMint.Democrats — light spenders in South Carolina’s 5th — view that money as better spent elsewhere, like in neighboring Georgia. Jamie Carson, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said Democrats see Georgia as more winnable. “Certain races become high profile,” Carson said. “If people see a race as competitive, they are more likely to spend money on it.”Reporting intern Kennett Werner contributed to this post."
1,POLITICS,Trump Earned At Least $1.3 Billion In The Last Two And A Half Years,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-earned-at-least-13-billion-in-the-last-two_us_5947f367e4b04d8767077a5d,"by Alex Baumgart The Trump presidency is less than five months old, but has been a quick study at one longstanding D.C. tradition",2017-06-19,"<p>In the last year, Trump has made $37 million from the Mar-A-Lago club, which has served as his second White House. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5947f3f215000047004e70bb.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Alex Baumgart The Trump presidency is less than five months old, but has been a quick study at one longstanding D.C. tradition: the Friday-night dump. Administrations often release promised documents once journalists have left the office for the weekend, hoping that any damaging info would get lost in the news cycle turnover. Today, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics has followed suit and released a 98-page document detailing the president’s financial holdings, income and liabilities from the preceding 16 months.The filing is not required by law, but has traditionally been released by presidents after assuming office. It is our first real insight into how the president has been disentangling himself from his business interests, and shows how the valuation of the Trump brand has changed. So far, Trump has released three personal financial disclosure statements which collectively cover January 1st, 2014 to April 25th, 2017.The newest form lays out the steps Trump took after November’s victory to shift his assets around to avoid conflicts of interest. In the days leading up to and following the election, Trump dissolved 28 of his business entities and transferred his stake in his remaining companies to his children and a revocable trust from which he continues to draw income. Among the companies dissolved were a number of entities which appear to have been managing Trump’s global business ventures in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Trump also seems to have divested from a majority of his stock holdings. Among the stocks that Trump has sold are his shares of Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the controversial Dakota Access pipeline. ETP, whose CEO Kelcy Warren is a Trump donor, is facing new challenges in court to the pipeline, which the Trump administration approved by executive order shortly after taking office. Despite having sold off the majority of his stocks, Trump’s trust continues to hold on to at least $1.4 billion worth of other real estate and business assets. In addition to various checking and savings accounts, Trump has between $100,001 and $250,000 invested in gold, and between $1,000,001 and $5,000,000 in a private equity fund called the MidOcean Credit Opportunity Fund, which invests primarily in bank debt.The form only requires assets held at the end of the reporting period to be disclosed and doesn’t require documentation of any transactions, so we have no way of telling how much income Trump generated by divesting. We do know that Trump reported making at least $597 million during 2016 and the first part of 2017 off the at least $1.4 billion worth of assets that he has retained. For comparison in 2014 and the first part of 2015 Trump made an estimated $429 million off what was then nearly $1.5 billion in assets. Because the law only requires the filer to disclose their income and asset values in ranges, we can’t get a perfectly accurate picture. The top income range is $5,000,000 or more; Trump had nine assets that generated at least that much income. As for Trump’s income for the last year, the standout is the $37 million he made off the Mar-A-Lago Club, which has also served as a second White House. Over a similar 16 month period covered by Trump’s first financial disclosure (January 2014 to April 2015) the club only brought in $15.5 million. That’s a 139 percent increase in income, part of which may have to do with the doubling of membership fees at Mar-A-Lago earlier this year.Another one of Trump’s more controversial business ventures, the Old Post Office Building, earned him $19 million during the reporting period. The building is owned by the federal government, and elected officials were specifically excluded from the lease. After much back and forth with Trump’s lawyers, the General Services Administration decided that Trump’s financial rearrangement was sufficient and allowed him to keep his lease on the building, which has been converted into a hotel.The graph below shows the the breakdown of the monthly income that Trump has listed on his three financial disclosure forms.Since announcing his run for office in June of 2015, Trump has made at least $1.3 billion off his various business ventures and investments.

2,POLITICS,Did Trump Revive Failed Cold War Cuba Policy To Buy Rubio’s Loyalty?,"Miles Mogulescu, ContributorActivist, Writer, Producer, and Entertainment Attorney",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/did-trump-revive-failed-cold-war-cuba-policy-to-buy_us_5947305ae4b024b7e0df4d6c,Donald Trump has made clear that there’s little room in his “America First” foreign policy for pressure on authoritarian,2017-06-19,<p><em>Top Trump Organization executives explore golf course development in Cuba</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5947fe03160000f901116e07.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has made clear that there’s little room in his “America First” foreign policy for pressure on authoritarian foreign governments—whether Russia, Saudi Arabia, or China—to improve their human rights record.The one exception is Cuba where, on Friday, he reimposed failed Cold War sanctions, ostensibly to pressure Cuba to improve human rights.Trump’s Cuba move had been opposed by the Departments of Commerce, Defense, State, Treasury, Agriculture and Homeland Security; by the generally Republican-leaning Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers; and by Human Rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, all of whom believe that Americas 57-year old policy of isolating Cuba has been a failure and is bad for Americans and Cubans.As former Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes wrote, Trump’s new hard line Cuba policies, “will hurt ordinary Cubans, harm the image of the United States, and make it harder for Americans to do business and travel somewhere they want to go.”A CORRUPT DEAL BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUBIO?But as reported by The Miami Herald, Politico, and Mother Jones, one man in particular—Marco Rubio—intensively lobbied Trump behind the scenes to reimpose sanctions.Trump sided with Rubio, who was standing directly behind Trump as he announced his new Cuba policy.Rubio, in turn, defended Trump against Comey in the Senate Intelligence Committee hearings.The headline to a Washington Post article on the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Comey hearings read, “Rubio defends Trump in Comey Questioning”.As Miami Herald journalist Fabiola Santiogo wrote,Rubio seemed more interested in getting Comey to publicly admit that President Trump ‘was not personally under investigation’ than in obtaining any new evidence for the Senate investigation. It was as if Rubio…was acting as Trump’s defense attorney instead of as a member of a bipartisan committee investigating crucial national security issues.Hmm... it’s fair to ask if there was an implicit or explicit deal here? Trump reinstates sanctions on Cuba; Rubio, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee― which is actively investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, and now possible obstruction of justice—goes easy on Trump and hard on Comey and uses his position on the Intelligence Committee to defend Trump.Indeed, it’s fair to ask if such a possible deal between Trump and Rubio itself constituted Obstruction of Justice.Special Prosecutor Mueller and Congressional Committees should require Rubio, Rubio staff members, and others with knowledge of the dealings between Trump and Rubio on Cuba policy to answer whether Trump directly or indirectly asked for Rubio’s loyalty in the Russia investigation, or at least for Rubio to go easy, and whether Rubio directly or indirectly promised any loyalty in exchange for Trump accepting Rubio’s Cuba policy.THE RUSSIA CONNECTIONAdding to the suspicions, Trump’s policy of isolating Cuba from America helps Russia.The loss of revenues from American tourists and business will likely lead Cuba to turn back to Russia as an economic, and even military, patron. Russian has recently forgiven billions of dollars of debt owed by Cuba and become a major supplier of oil to Cuba, replacing Venezuala which has its own economic crisis. There is talk of Russia reopening military bases in Cuba, which could put Russian signal intelligence 90 miles from US shores.As Sen. Patrick Leahy wrote in an op-ed piece last week,One obvious way to mitigate Russian influence in our hemisphere is through enhanced engagement with Cuba…As two retired US military generals wrote in an op-ed in Politico last month, cooperation with Cuba has been a game changer for regional security. Since the thaw in US-Cuba relations, our two governments have signed nine formal bilateral agreements on issues related to matters of national security, including human trafficking, counter-narcotics, and cybersecurity. Why cast aside this opportunity to coordinate on cross border and maritime law enforcement…and instead cede the playing field to Putin?Hmm, again... Trump’s new policy of isolating Cuba helps Russia and Putin. More grounds for questions from Mueller and Congressional Committees.TRUMP LINING HIS OWN POCKETS?Finally, Trump Cuba policies may gain him personal economic advantage over The Trump Organization’s competitors in the hotel industry. Starwood Hotels, which was recently acquired by Marriot, has negotiated deals to manage several hotels in Cuba, some of which are partly owned by Gaviota, a tourism company owned by the Cuban military, which, in socialist Cuba, is widely involved in the Cuban economy.Other major American hotel chains hope to use the Starwood deal as a template for their own expansion into Cuba.These efforts by the American hotel industry to invest in Cuba will likely be slowed or halted by Trump’s new Cuba sanctions.But Trump himself told CNN last year that he would like to open a hotel in Cuba “at the right time.”And The Trump Organization has been exploring investing in Cuba hotels as early as 1998, sometimes in violation of US law.According to Newsweek,A company controlled by Donald Trump…secretly conducted business in Communist Cuba during Fidel Castro’s presidency despite strict American trade bans that made such undertakings illegal, according to interviews with former Trump executives, internal company records and court filings. Documents show that the Trump company spend a minimum of $68,000 for its 1968 foray into Cuba at a time when corporate expenditure of even a penny in the Caribbean country was prohibited without U.S. government approval.In 2012 and 2013, Trump Organization officials again travelled to Cuba—also possibly in violation of US law ― to explore opportunities to open golf courses, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. The Trump official included Trump Organization executive V.P. Larry Glick, environmental consultant for golf Edward Russo, chief legal officer Jason Greenblatt, and Trump golf executive Rob Lieberman. Russo referred questions about the trips to Eric Trump who responded, “[M]any major competitors have sought opportunities in Cuba… [I]t is important for us to understand the dynamics of the markets that our competitors are exploring.”Hmm, hmm, hmm a third time... Trump’s new Cuba sanctions will harm his business competitors like Marriott/Starwood and potentially give the Trump Organization time to catch up before his competitors get too far ahead in establishing American-managed hotels in Cuba.Along with gaining little Marco’s help in the Russia and conflict of interest investigations, and aiding Russian interests in Cuba, are Trump’s new hard-line Cuba policies designed to help his own personal business interests?There’s plenty here for Special Counsel Mueller and Congressional Committees to investigate in connection with Trump’s decision to reimpose Cold War Sanctions on Cuba—potential Obstruction of Justice, foreign policy moves that help Russia, and possible conflicts of interest with Trump’s businesses.Things could start to get even more interesting."
3,POLITICS,Marco Rubio: No Big Deal Trump Doesn't Believe Evidence Of Russian Interference,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-jeff-sessions-trump-russia_us_594685dee4b06bb7d273c57d,"But Trump should also ""be welcoming this investigation,"" the Florida senator said.",2017-06-18,Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his appearance last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594691e01600002200116be1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Sunday defended President Donald Trump and his administration’s apparent lack of concern about Russia’s interference in last year’s election, saying the president “has a right to his opinion.”Numerous U.S. intelligence agencies have confirmed Russian meddling in the American electoral system, and Rubio made his comment on NBC’s “Meet the Press” even as he said he has seen the proof, as part of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s probe.“As far as the general theme of Russia’s interference, look, the president has said he doesn’t believe it. I believe it. Not only do I believe it, I know it. Almost everybody else does. And ultimately, whether he believes it or not, the work’s going to move forward,” Rubio told host Chuck Todd.Incredulous, Todd pressed Rubio for seeming to give the president a pass on the issue.“Senator, think about what you just said. The president said he doesn’t believe it. You believe it, you’ve seen the evidence. How stunning is that to you, that the president of the United States disputes the evidence of 17 intelligence agencies in this country?”“Well, again, ultimately, at the end of the day, he has a right to his opinion on these issues,” said Rubio, one of Trump’s opponents in the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.Multiple investigations are looking into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian officials, including a Department of Justice probe headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the investigations and reports that he is one of the targets of the probes as “a witch hunt.”Rubio took a different tack, saying on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday that the president should “be welcoming this investigation.”He said Trump should “ask that it be thorough and completed expeditiously and be very cooperative with it. That’s what ultimately I anticipate [the administration] will do,” Rubio said. “That’s in the best interest of the president.”Jay Sekulow, one of the personal lawyers Trump has hired, made the rounds of Sunday talk shows insisting that the president wasn’t being investigated, despite a tweet to the contrary from Trump last week. But Sekulow created confusion about the matter in comments on “Fox News Sunday,” causing host Chris Wallace to say, “Okay, well good, we’re in agreement. You don’t know whether he’s under investigation or not.”  Rubio in his “Meet the Press” appearance also defended Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ stunning admission last week that he has never received or asked for a briefing on the Russian interference. Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee last Tuesday, Sessions said that while “it appears” that Russian officials sought to influence the U.S. electoral process, his knowledge of the matter was confined to “what I read in the paper.”Rubio downplayed Sessions’ testimony, chalking it up to the attorney general’s recusal from the investigations. Sessions’ recusal came a day after the Washington Post reported that he failed to disclose meetings he had with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during Trump’s campaign.“Yes, the initial reaction people would have is, ‘Wow ... the attorney general has not even been briefed on Russia’s interference?’” Rubio told Todd. “But then, you realize the reverse,” he continued, “And that is if he had been briefed, then what we would be talking about today was whether that was appropriate, because he was recused from anything having to do with the 2016 election and Russia. So it’s kind of a Catch-22. You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t, in regards to that.”Sessions made similar comments in his testimony last week.“You might have been very critical of me if I, as an active part of [Trump’s 2016] campaign, was seeking intelligence relating to something that might be relevant” to the Russian invesigations, he told committee member Sen. Angus King (I-Maine).King at the time noted that the matter was not just about the Trump campaign.On Sunday, appearing on “Meet the Press,” King pointed to Sessions’ admission as further evidence that Trump and his administration “doesn’t seem interested in” the issue.“I can’t imagine coming into office with this fact of this Russian engagement in our election and not digging into it,” King said. “I believe it’s one of the most serious attacks we’ve had on our country in recent years. And the president doesn’t seem interested in it either.”"

6,WORLD NEWS,London Mayor: Grenfell Tower Fire Caused By Years Of Neglect,Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grenfell-tower-fire-neglect_us_59468fc2e4b0f15cd5bc08b2,Survivors have been furious over the lack of aid and information.,2017-06-18,"The charred remnains of the Grenfell Tower block in Kensington, west London. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594698c115000021004e6ec7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week’s deadly fire in a 24-story apartment building in London’s west was a “preventible accident” caused by years of neglect, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Sunday. The fierce blaze that raged through Grenfell Tower, a public housing tower in London’s well-off Kensington neighborhood, killed more than 50 people and left hundreds homeless. Residents have voiced outraged at Britain’s government and local authorities following Wednesday’s tragedy, both for failing to prevent the fire and for the poor relief effort in its wake.“People are angry, not simply at the poor response in the days afterwards from the council and the government, but at the years of neglect from the council,” Mayor Khan said after a local church service in memory of the victims on Sunday, according to the BBC. “There’s a feeling that the council and government don’t understand their concerns and don’t care,” the mayor added. While local leaders have said the Kensington and Chelsea Council has worked around the clock to respond to the tragedy, survivors have been furious over the lack of aid and information. Residents on Friday stormed Kensington Town Hall, hoping to confront councilors directly. They charged they had received little support or information. There was also widespread anger over the council’s contradictory statements over temporary housing for survivors. Over the weekend, the government sent staff to the council’s office to help deal with the response. Councils from across the capital provided assistance as well. As authorities continued to investigate the cause of the fire over the weekend, the council has faced intense questioning over the multimillion-dollar renovation project carried out in the apartment building last year. While the reconstruction was supposed to have included new fire-prevention feature, the building didn’t have a sprinkler system. Residents had voiced repeated concerns about fire hazards in the building. Attention on Sunday turned to the flammable siding applied to the building during renovations last year. “My understanding is that the cladding that was reported wasn’t in accordance with U.K. building regulations,” British Trade Minster Greg Hands said on Sky News. Finance Minister Philip Hammond told BBC One that the cladding on the building was banned on buildings of that height. “So there are two separate questions,” Hammond said. “One: Are our regulations correct, do they permit the right kind of materials and ban the wrong kind of materials? The second question is: Were they correctly complied with?” Kensington and Chelsea Council has said it would cooperate “in full” with the investigation. Police said on Sunday that the number of victims is expected to rise from the 58 fatalities announced Saturday. “The number of people missing, but as yet unaccounted for, has risen from yesterday’s figure of 58,” London police commander Stuart Cundy said in a statement. Authorities said they would provide more information on Monday. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is under intense pressure after not meeting with the victims of the tragedy in its immediate aftermath, admitted on Saturday that the response to the fire was “not good enough.”May said the response from emergency services, the National Health Service and the community “has been heroic.” But, she added, “The support on the ground for families who needed help or basic information in the initial hours after this appalling disaster was not good enough.”"

The fierce blaze that raged through Grenfell Tower, a public housing tower in London’s well-off Kensington neighborhood, killed more than 50 people and left hundreds homeless. Residents have voiced outraged at Britain’s government and local authorities following Wednesday’s tragedy, both for failing to prevent the fire and for the poor relief effort in its wake.“People are angry, not simply at the poor response in the days afterwards from the council and the government, but at the years of neglect from the council,” Mayor Khan said after a local church service in memory of the victims on Sunday, according to the BBC. “There’s a feeling that the council and government don’t understand their concerns and don’t care,” the mayor added. While local leaders have said the Kensington and Chelsea Council has worked around the clock to respond to the tragedy, survivors have been furious over the lack of aid and information. Residents on Friday stormed Kensington Town Hall, hoping to confront councilors directly. They charged they had received little support or information. There was also widespread anger over the council’s contradictory statements over temporary housing for survivors.

A 2-month-old baby with asthma was among the passengers of another wooden vessel intercepted that day.Together with the Italian Coast Guard, humanitarian organizations like Proactiva, Doctors Without Borders and Save the Children are the only actors now running proactive rescue missions in the Mediterranean. As the number of migrants and refugees attempting to reach Europe reached new highs in the past few months, non-governmental organizations have come under fierce criticism from European politicians and officials, who accuse them of hampering efforts to stem the influx. “The NGOs are almost like a ferry service. It’s almost as if the smugglers were putting people directly on NGO boats,” an anonymous European official told Reuters last month.But new research that the Goldsmiths, University of London, released last week argues that empirical analysis systematically refutes some of the main accusations leveled against humanitarian groups. “[This report] is written to avert a looming catastrophe,” the researchers say. “If NGOs are forced to stop or reduce their operations, many more lives will be lost to the sea.”On October 3, 2013, more than 300 migrants and refugees drowned in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The tragedy prompted Italy to launch Mare Nostrum ― a coast guard search and rescue mission that has been credited with saving tens of thousands of lives.When Mare Nostrum came to an end in 2014, the European border agency Frontex launched a new operation in its place. Rather than focusing on search-and-rescue, however, the main goal of the Frontex operation was border protection. On April 12 and April 15, 2015, more than 1,200 people perished in two shipwrecks off the Italian coast. Many of the victims had been trapped in the vessels’ hull after they capsized.In the absence of a dedicated European search-and-rescue operation and confronted with a growing loss of migrants’ lives at sea, humanitarian organizations launched their own rescue efforts coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard.In 2016, a deal between Turkey and the European Union effectively closed the Balkan route across the Aegean Sea. The Libyan coast, all but lawless amid the security vacuum following the fall of leader Muammar Gaddafi, was fertile ground for smugglers and criminal networks.The large number of boats intercepted on Thursday was no rare occurrence. In the past few months, a staggering number of migrants and refugees attempted the 70-miles crossing from Libya to Italy. More than 65,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in Italy since January 2017, up 18 percent on the same period last year. At least 1,735 people have died trying to reach Europe this year. Many more are believed to have perished while making their way across Sub Saharan Africa to the Libyan coast.Faced with a growing number of arrivals, critics of the humanitarian organizations have argued in recent months that the search-and-rescue missions create a “pull factor” for migrants and refugees.“You are stimulating smuggling,” said Belgium’s Secretary for Migration, Theo Francken, blaming Doctors Without Borders in a heated Twitter exchange in March. “Your rescue operations close to the coast create a pull-factor and thus more deaths,” he added to the agency, also known by its French acronym, MSF.But Goldsmiths’ researchers say that rather than the rescue missions, worsening economic and political conditions across the African continent, including the militant group Boko Haram’s reign of terror in Nigeria and conflict and poverty in the Horn of Africa, have motivated migrants and refugees to attempt the dangerous journey. Those factors pushed migrants to the Libyan coast far before the search-and-rescue missions intensified. In addition, the researchers say, worsening violence in Libya has left many migrants with little choice but to attempt the crossing, whether rescue missions were operating or not.The Goldsmiths report also disputes a second allegation leveled at the aid organizations ― collusion with smugglers. In February, a controversial prosecutor on the Italian island of Sicily launched a fact-finding investigation into ties between the humanitarian groups and Libyan smugglers. Three months later, Carmelo Zuccaro said in court he had found no evidence proving the hypothesis.While far more measured in his analysis, the head of Frontex echoed a related sentiment when telling Reuters in May that rescue efforts should be careful not to encourage smuggling operations. “We have to strike the right balance between saving lives and making sure our actions don’t fuel a criminal business...by encouraging criminals to adapt their modus operandi to the fact that there will be vessels approaching Libya,” Fabrice Leggeri said.NGOs like Doctors Without Borders argue that when faced with people at risk of dying, aid workers cannot hesitate to respond. “Let’s be clear, when you see boats like this in the Mediterranean, you have only two options, you rescue them or you rescue them,” MSF tweeted on June 9.“Humanitarian organizations carrying out search and rescue at sea are saving tens of thousands of people from drowning every year. Humanitarian action is not the cause of this crisis but is a response to it,” MSF told HuffPost in a statement.Frontex spokeswoman Izabella Cooper stressed in an email that the agency had never accused aid organizations of colluding with people smugglers. Frontex-deployed vessels have helped save tens of thousands of lives, she added.The agency said that its analyses had shown that smugglers have been loading far more people into the rickety boats. The quality of the vessels has decreased dramatically in recent years and migrants and refugees were given just enough food and fuel to make it outside Libya’s territorial waters ― far short of what’s needed to reach the Italian coast. “In the past two years, the smugglers in Libya have changed their modus operandi and have become more ruthless,” Cooper told HuffPost in an email. While critics of the aid organizations’ operations point to those worsening conditions to argue that search-and-rescue missions close to the Libyan coast in the long run endanger migrants’ lives, the Goldsmiths’ researchers say that the crossing has become more dangerous because of the worsening violence in Libya. Since the end of 2016, the researchers say, smuggling operations have increasingly been led by militias and that shift contributed to a change in the smugglers’ methods. Additionally, the researchers argue, one of the reasons smugglers’ shifted from using safer wooden vessels to rubber boats was the EU’s own practice of destroying migrant vessels. “We argue that SAR NGOs responded to and were not the cause of these evolving practices that had instead been spurred by other processes and actors predating SAR NGOs intervention,” the researchers write. MSF argues that policies largely focused on anti-smuggling and stemming the influx of migrants and refugees are ineffective and don’t do enough to reduce migrant death at sea.“Although we cannot expect from Frontex to change its mandate, we are shocked to see that EU investment at sea is mainly focused on deterrence and surveillance and that there is no mandate of proactive SAR,” MSF said. Finally, the report argues, migrant deaths in the Mediterranean have been on the rise since early 2016, before aid organizations stepped up their missions in the Mediterranean. Migrant deaths declined after the NGO ships deployed and rose again when the search and rescue missions decreased. “There is thus a striking negative correlation between the decreasing mortality rate and the rising number of SAR NGO vessels, which shows that the latter made the crossing safer,” the researchers wrote.

It said the incident took place on Sunday afternoon near a village called Rasafah.The “flagrant attack was an attempt to undermine the efforts of the army as the only effective force capable with its allies ... in fighting terrorism across its territory,” the Syrian army said.“This comes at a time when the Syrian army and its allies were making clear advances in fighting the Daesh (Islamic State) terrorist group.”Later the U.S. Central Command issued a statement saying the Syrian plane was downed “in collective self-defense of Coalition-partnered forces,” identified as fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) near Tabqah.It said that “pro-Syrian regime forces” had earlier attacked an SDF held town south of Tabqa and wounded a number of fighters and driving them from the town.Coalition aircraft in a show of force stopped the initial advance. When a Syrian army SU-22 jet later dropped bombs near the U.S. backed forces, it was immediately shot by a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet, the statement said.Before it downed the plane, the coalition had “contacted the its Russian counterparts by telephone via an established “de-confliction line” to de-escalate the situation and stop the firing.”The coalition does “not seek to fight the Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces” but would not “hesitate to defend itself or its “partnered forces from any threat,” the statement said.The U.S.-led coalition, which has in recent weeks escalated its aerial bombing campaign in northern Syria and Raqqa province.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich also once represented the district.The high early vote total indicates that the final numbers on Tuesday will likely far surpass those of the April election. Election officials in Georgia hailed the “unprecedented” and “phenomenal” turnout, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It remained unclear, though, which candidate would benefit from a higher turnout.Ossoff led by slightly more than 2 percentage points in the HuffPost Pollster average of recent surveys of the race.Price won re-election November, garnering almost 62 percent of the roughly 311,000 votes cast. Democrats in particular see the race to replace Price as a test of anti-Trump activism and strategy ahead of next year’s midterm elections. While they have made some impressive showings, they have yet to notch a victory in several highly anticipated congressional special elections this year in traditionally GOP territory.In April’s election, Ossoff won about 48 percent of the vote, falling just short of clearing the 50 percent mark he needed to avoid a runoff. Handel, one of 11 Republicans competing in the first round, got about 20 percent.Over the weekend, Ossoff and Handel both campaigned with high-profile political figures in hopes of generating more enthusiasm.

During the ramblings he posted, he also insults longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw and calls NBC News and Kelly “frauds.”Jones’ threat came after earlier last week he published parts of an off-the-record phone call he had with Kelly before the videotaped interview took place. During that conversation, Kelly tells Jones that she was “not looking to portray you as some boogeyman or just any sort of gotcha moment,” adding, “I just want to talk about you.”Jones said on Saturday that he is calling on NBC to release the unedited version of his and Kelly’s interview after watching the channel’s teaser of the upcoming profile. “I’ve already see your promo, a bunch of deception. So that’s why I know that you’re lying. That’s why I released those earlier tapes,” Jones said on Saturday.“You can easily post that [Sunday] night, so people can see what I said,” he added, referring to the unedited version of their interview.Critics ― which include families of the children killed during the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings ― have slammed Kelly and NBC News for giving Jones and his rhetoric a platform.Jones, whose “InfoWars” show has amassed an audience of millions, had previously suggested that the 2012 school massacre was a hoax and claimed the victims’ parents were pretending to mourn as a ruse to promote gun control. He has since conceded that he now believes the shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were slaughtered by a gunman who then killed himself, did occur.Other dangerous conspiracy theories Jones has peddled on his show include a false story known as Pizzagate that claimed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign staff operated a sex trafficking ring out of a pizza restaurant in Washington. The rumors prompted a North Carolina man to bring an assault-style rifle into the restaurant to investigate.After Jones leaked his phone call with Kelly, NBC News told HuffPost that the network still planned to broadcast the interview as scheduled.NBC News did not return HuffPost request for comment on Saturday when asked if the media outlet would be releasing an unedited version of Kelly and Jones’ interview."
16,QUEER VOICES,Six Top Experts Resigned From Donald Trump's HIV/AIDS Advisory Panel,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/experts-resigned-from-donald-trumps-hivaids-advisory-panel_us_59466ee2e4b0f15cd5bbf1fa,"And the big question is, what are the other 15 panel members waiting for?",2017-06-18,"An AIDS ribbon hangs from the North Portico of the White House in recognition of World AIDS Day, November 30, 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5946a2dc15000045004e6ed3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scott Schoettes, Counsel and HIV Project Director at the pioneering LGBTQ legal group Lambda Legal, resigned late last week from the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA), along with five other council members, in protest of Donald Trump’s polices ― or lack of polices ― to combat the HIV epidemic.On Friday, Schoettes lambasted Trump as callous, a president who “simply does not care,” laying out the reasons for the resignations in a piece on Newsweek.com: As advocates for people living with HIV, we have dedicated our lives to combating this disease and no longer feel we can do so effectively within the confines of an advisory body to a president who simply does not care. The Trump Administration has no strategy to address the on-going HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and—most concerning—pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease. PACHA, created in 1995 during the Clinton administration, advises the Secretary of Health & Human Services, who is now Tom Price, the former Georgia GOP congressman with an abominable anti-LGBTQ voting record. In 2013, Price, on a conference call of far-right activists, responded to a question about the “medical health impact” of the “homosexual agenda” by stating that “the consequences of activity that has been seen as outside the norm are real and must be explored completely and in their entirety prior to moving forward with any social legislation that would alter things.”Price is now spearheading Trump’s and the GOP’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with Trumpcare, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated would cause 23 million people to lose health care within ten years. This would harm hundreds of thousands of people with HIV across the country as well as many more HIV-negative gay and bisexual men and transgender women at risk who need insurance for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the drug therapy to prevent HIV infection. And any advances to stem the epidemic could be dramatically halted or reversed.One of the most ominous signs of Price’s and the Trump administration’s lack of concern about HIV is that the website for the Office of AIDS Policy was taken down shortly after Trump took office and has not been replaced ― another reason cited by the six members of PACHA who resigned.Some activists are wondering why only six of the 21 members of the council in fact resigned, given all the evidence of this administration’s willful negligence.“How about the other members of PACHA? Where’s their courage? This should have been a mass protest with ALL members resigning,” wrote prominent, long-time AIDS activist Peter Staley, an early organizer in the groups ACT UP and Treatment Action Group (TAG), which successfully pressured government and drug companies to create life-saving drugs for people with HIV in the ’90s, on his Facebook page. “It’s very obvious this administration is not going to use PACHA or do ANYTHING around HIV/AIDS. Protest is the ONLY response we have at this point.”It’s a very important point. Ronald Reagan eventually created a presidential AIDS commission as a fig leaf, using advocates and experts to make it seem like he was doing something when in fact their recommendations were ignored and precious time was lost while little was done and thousands died. Activists and experts, if they don’t have the ear of the administration and the will from officials for sound HIV policy around treatment and prevention, should not be providing cover, and instead should be embarrassing the Trump administration.This is a critical time in the epidemic, as the epicenter has in many ways shifted from large gay meccas like New York and San Francisco to smaller cities in the conservative Deep South, where HIV continues to disproportionately affect black gay and bisexual men and transgender women (as it does all over the country), and where efforts at treatment and prevention have always terribly lagged. As Linda Villarosa reported  in a piece for the cover of the New York Times Magazine two weeks ago, “America’s Hidden H.I.V. Epidemic,” a stunning 50 percent of black gay and bisexual men will be infected with HIV over their lifetimes: Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using the first comprehensive national estimates of lifetime risk of H.I.V. for several key populations, predicted that if current rates continue, one in two African-American gay and bisexual men will be infected with the virus. That compares with a lifetime risk of one in 99 for all Americans and one in 11 for white gay and bisexual men. To offer more perspective: Swaziland, a tiny African nation, has the world’s highest rate of H.I.V., at 28.8 percent of the population. If gay and bisexual African-American men made up a country, its rate would surpass that of this impoverished African nation — and all other nations.That’s horrifying ― and unacceptable. With an administration that is literally content to allow people to get sick and die, the only response is to make as much noise as possible, as I’ve noted previously, and point to the callous disregard. Protest takes many forms, and resigning from this administration’s panels and councils ― as expert advisors to the EPA did after the Trump administration dismissed half of the members of an important science committee ― sends a powerful message. All of the members of PACHA should follow the brave lead of the six who resigned last week, and speak out loudly about this administration’s brutal policies.

Ranie was born in Congo and was raised by Ibaka’s family, unbeknownst to him until a few years ago.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594626cd210000190033cc34.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For many years now, my girls and I have approached Father’s Day with mixed emotions. My own father died on Christmas Day 2001, my husband who legally adopted my girls died from cancer eight years ago, and their biological father, well, let's just say it's complicated. All of which makes Robin Wright's Father’s Day tribute in The New Yorker, “My Last Conversation With My Father,” a poignant read. Arguably, it is a throwback to an idyllic time when fathers, while not always demonstrably affectionate, showed love through actions and consistency, a time when they consciously grasped the significance of their role — their mission — in actively shaping the social and intellectual development of their children, even if the sons they secretly hoped for turned out to be daughters. Today, Wright’s experience is more rare. And to be sure, that was not my heritage. I was born and raised in Jamaica, as were both my parents. My father's father, however, was a Syrian Jew from Aleppo, whom my father met only once, back in the early ’60s, when he was a grown man in his forties. They met for lunch at Macy's department store in New York City, after a private detective had traced my grandfather's whereabouts to Brooklyn. My father had done well for himself and owned his own hardware business. The only interest he had was to lay eyes on the man who had fathered him. Undoubtedly, my grandfather would have had great difficulty introducing his “illegitimate,” “colored,” first-born son to his Orthodox Jewish family, who likely didn’t know of my father's existence. And while my father seemingly made peace with it, he never discussed it publicly, nor at home. My mother's father, on the other hand, was Cuban. My mother knew him well, although I suspect there were days she often wished she did not. He was a serial philanderer who had promised to marry her mother but didn't and, instead, fathered children indiscriminately, some of whom my mother was still meeting for the first time well into adulthood. When my mother turned 16, my grandfather told her he would no longer support her. For the sake of her dignity, I won't repeat what he actually told her. However, suffice it to say he felt she had the feminine devices she needed for her survival.In my own adult life, it soon became clear that having children even within the bonds of “holy matrimony” had little to do with guaranteeing your children the stability of a committed father. Sometimes, despite our best intentions, divorce is the best option for everyone involved, which can bring its own array of contentious custody and child support issues — even abandonment. Sometimes, too, good fathers die, creating an unfathomable physical void and emotional chasm — for years. For a brief time, my late husband was a positive stabilizing influence and a reminder to my children that relationships could be healthy and loving and supportive. Then, he was gone — a devastating second loss. For the most part, then, even when my mother came to live with me after my father’s death, I have raised my children as a single parent. It’s important to note here the difference between a single parent and a parent who is single — one who is involved in a co-parenting situation with another adult. No, I was it.To say, therefore, that I understand “father issues” would be an understatement. Daddy-hunger drives daughters to look for love, sometimes in the wrong places, and often prematurely, in the arms of preying men who openly admit their preference for girls without fathers at home. Father-absence builds resentment and anger in sons with no role model to respect, which can lead to self-destructive behaviors ranging from gang involvement and substance abuse, to hardcore criminal activity, to behaviors that drive sexism and misogyny, as well as workaholism at the expense of family — generational issues.For many, Father’s Day is a painful reminder at best of the missing element in that phrase.Even so, as I look around, I see there are still fathers who can and should be celebrated — not for being perfect, not by a long shot, but for still being in the fight to maintain their place, even if they are no longer with the mother of their children. And I do not say ""fight"" lightly. Some women don't always make it easy for men to stay in the lives of their children. And no, this is not an indictment — it's just a fact. I recognize too that it's not always the position a woman takes willingly. Many times, it is a judgement call to protect children, who are not always able to process toxic behaviors that are best understood through more adult eyes.I cannot even begin to tell men how important they are in the lives of their children, especially in a culture that seeks to diminish their significance, ridicule them as buffoons, and marginalize them in a misguided attempt at female empowerment. A woman can do it all and be everything to her child, except be a father. No one can better teach a son, for better or worse, what the man he could become looks like. And no one can better teach a daughter, for better or worse, what she should accept or avoid in future relationships with men. In fact, many psychologists believe that the very self-esteem and self-worth of our children are grounded in the relationship forged with their fathers.Therefore, to those that are still in the game, I salute you. I admire and respect you for recognizing that supporting your children requires not just a financial component but a physical presence and an emotional investment. This is what should under-gird the bond — and pride — when you show up at graduation exercises, walk your daughters down the aisle, and become that legitimate go-to person who can be depended upon in dark days.To those authentic ones, I wish you a very Happy Father's Day — a day in which you are honored and feel worthy. And to those who won't, I urge you to find a way to rebuild that bridge to your children. That bridge may hinge on you becoming a better man, but the challenge is yours to take — and benefit from."

It never has. Not anywhere.,2017-06-18,"<p>Weingarten, right, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decision in Topeka, Kansas. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5945b88b15000027004e6e46.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was every supply-side economist’s dream: the promise of achieving economic nirvana by slashing taxes for the wealthy and corporations, and shrinking government. Except it became a nightmare for the people of Kansas, and now the Kansas Legislature has taken a big step toward waking up from it.Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback turned his state into a laboratory for the most extreme form of trickle-down economics, promising that it would usher in an economic boom. It didn’t. It never has. Brownback’s five-year experiment caused state revenue to plummet, the deficit to explode, and painful spending cuts to be made—including cuts decimating public schools. Last week, a once-unlikely alliance stopped Brownback’s attempt to double down on his plan: Democratic and Republican lawmakers, urged on by parents, business people, civic activists and unions of working people.You would think that this revolt by Kansas’ citizens and legislators of both parties would send chills up supply-siders’ spines nationwide. But the essential tenets of Brownback’s plan remain at the center of the tax proposals championed by President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Granted, these free-market tenets are well-established conservative orthodoxy. But, as the Kansas experiment demonstrates, they offer a false promise and lead not to prosperity but to deep austerity.The Kansas economic plan was intended to serve as a model for other anti-government forces. Instead, it presents lots of inconvenient facts. State revenues plunged $700 million in the first year alone, resulting in deep cuts to everything from road repair to state psychiatric hospitals. The state budget deficit climbed to nearly $900 million. And, while economic growth nationally has remained steady at just above 2 percent annually, Kansas’ growth has been anemic, at 0.2 percent.The impact on public education in Kansas has been catastrophic. In just two years, Brownback cut $63 million from public colleges and universities. State funding for public universities is 17 percent less than it was in 2008. Since Brownback took office in 2011, state per-pupil spending has dropped from $4,400 to $3,800. A survey of school districts by the Kansas Center for Economic Growth found that 96 percent of districts say their base state aid per pupil is insufficient. Public schools in Kansas have 19,000 more students than they had in 2009, but 655 fewer teachers. Classrooms are crowded, and many school facilities are in disrepair.With a governor who refused to listen, parents and educators turned to the courts for relief. The Kansas Supreme Court ruled unanimously this spring that state funding for public education is not only inadequate, it is unconstitutional. The court found that black, Hispanic and poor students were especially harmed by the inadequate funding. Last week, the Legislature passed a more robust funding formula, which Brownback was forced to sign.Another Midwest state has taken a different approach, one that invested in its future. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton raised taxes on upper-income individuals and businesses several years ago. Was the move kryptonite to the state’s economy, as Brownback and his fellow tax-cutters would have you believe? To the contrary. Minnesota has the fastest-growing economy in the Midwest, and the state is projecting a $1.65 billion surplus for the next two years. California and New York have chosen similar paths and are growing at twice the rate of Kansas.You know the oft-quoted definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Cliché aside, it makes no sense that both Trump’s and Ryan’s tax plans are modeled on the failed Kansas experiment—or does it? Political ideology often trumps evidence, and playing to the political base can pay off. Legions of observers have noted that Trump, his family and many of his associates would benefit from virtually every element of his tax plan.In the midst of the Brownback economic nightmare, on the 60th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, I visited Topeka, Kansas, the home of the plaintiffs in the Brown case, to help fight the draconian cuts to public education. Topeka is hallowed ground in the effort to ensure every child receives an equal and adequate education. Six decades after that landmark decision, the state bleakly illustrated how radical economic policies could join racial discrimination in depriving children of the public education they need and deserve.Stephen Henderson, the editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, recently wrote that Brownback hoped his experiment slashing taxes and spending would serve as a “model for the utter trivialization of government, its services and those who count on them.” Brownback could not have been more wrong. Trivializing government and eliminating services have real-life consequences, and the people of Kansas have said “enough.” That is the true model for our country."

I am glad I did. I booked my flight back from the East Coast to make it for the one night that I could see the show during its run. There aren't many plays like this. I have been following Chen. He won an Obie for Caught, which had the distinction of running simultaneously in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Chen works, and New York City. That triptych deconstructed stereotypes Americans have of Chinese, and Chinese have of Americans, as well as the dubious interactions of the global art market. It was all about the ease of fraud, including that practiced on an audience gullible enough to accept the worst accusations about China, especially if accompanied by claims of creativity just this side of pretentious. An earlier farce, Mutt, imagined a Presidential candidate being recruited for his race, specifically his mixed race identity. It premiered in the basement of a Berkeley pizza parlor. A mash up of film noir and science fiction, as if Raymond Chandler fell into Flatland, entitled Home Invasion, was put on in somebody’s actual living room. All these pieces have entertained. None have been derivative. Harm opens with two thirty something couples, one Asian male-white female, the other white male-Asian female, at a dinner party. The Asian male has hired the white male, or his buddy has, at a startup search engine firm intent on knocking off Google. The white male and the white female dated while in college, and, crucially, they once went camping. The Asian female beat out her own husband (the aforementioned white male) for a promotion at the non-profit where they reported to a South Asian boss, resulting in the man of the house being downsized out of work.Harm could be considered part of a recent series of cautionary tales about inviting people over for a meal. God of Carnage (a global blockbuster for Yasmina Reza in 2008) and Disgraced (Ayad Akhtar’s Pulitzer Prize winner, the most produced play of 2016), two other recent Broadway hits, demonstrated in detail how dinner parties can descend into hell or at least purgatory. In this instance, a random line of dialogue, which it turns out was the result of a nudge on social media, triggers latent racial resentment in a slow burn. The Asian male, born in China but an immigrant at an early age to America, perceives what nobody else does, that camping is more than setting up a tent in the woods. To him, camping is about who owns those woods — and by extension, his wife. As he explains, it’s not the same, you see, the AMWF combination and its mirror image, because the Asian male has been emasculated in the culture. In a subsequent conversation, the Asian female asserts that gender discrimination is worse than racial discrimination, for her, even if her illicit flirtation may compromise her message.The fun does not stop there though. Much discussion about race nowadays is about unconscious bias. We think we are talking about camping. But really we’re talking about race. Except this script flips the script again — and again. Those who resist the notion that the unconscious is doing anything the conscious isn’t, well, conscious of, insist that they aren’t talking about what they’re being accused of talking about, and they aren’t thinking it either, for that matter.Underneath the camping, there is race. But underneath race, there is domestic conflict twice over. And, at the end, there is an invitation to smooth over all of the tension, of course, by camping. It’s too late by then.The play is about, as many plays end up being about, its own language. It’s about whether people mean what they say and say what they mean, and the consequences that follow, which generally suggest we are all better off avoiding if not the truth then the candid expression of it. We trick one another as much as we deceive ourselves. Otherwise we wouldn’t make it through the day without wishing to leave our spouses.Despite that, the story is not unduly didactic. In running time of under ninety minutes, it has the humor that is needed for the subject matter. The characters are real, if forced to be representatives of an unreconstructed ethnic nationalism. The Asian, indelibly Chinese characters, suffer from this more. They appear as assimilated as could be (she is native born), but they cannot help themselves in advocating for China. They seem to deny the possibility, for themselves, of being Chinese American. The debate about camping escalates comically. It is a racial version of a MacGuffin, a device to drive the plot that need not have real significance, and it functions perfectly for the purpose. The Asian female, for example, is enthusiastic for the outdoors, as if she is trying too hard. She will mature into the “Tiger Mom” of camping, doing it to excess because it is expected. The truth is that in China, if one is to continue the generalizing that the conflict depends on, they are avid hikers. Yet until recently, with the achievement of critical mass as seen throughout national parks, Chinese on these shores did not have the safety of numbers to wander about in the wilderness. Chinese Americans, as distinguished from Chinese foreigners, residents rather than tourists, must be more wary about their surroundings. They are surrounded. That is what is unspoken. You could be shot.The San Francisco Bay Area theatre scene does not lack for risk taking. The SF Playhouse enjoys a high success rate. Its artistic director, Bill English, promotes his stage as an “empathy gym.” In this instance, they have produced another hit.Finally, the venue is worth mention. American Conservatory Theatre, the best established local company, renovated a defunct adult movie house, the Strand, in the mid-Market enterprise zone that City Hall has been promoting. The bright red building stands out. At its top, the punningly named Rueff — honoring the donors — shares an entrepreneurial spirit, hosting experimental work for smaller audiences. The Strand, in particular its Rueff, have become a place of adventure. They deserve patronage for the potential to bring back a neighborhood.Harm had an abrupt end. It was becoming apparent that there was not likely a means out of the recursive loop of recrimination, racial and marital, even through a dream sequence. But when the merry-go-round stopped, I said to my wife, “What? Is that it?” It isn’t that common to care enough about characters in contemporary drama, to wonder what would become of them. To yearn for closure is to praise the writing. That resolution eludes the personalities who are depicted as it does us. Yet in this instance, perhaps what is most compelling is that these four individuals stand in, as in the best art, for all of us."

It was 1960. Back then the job description of a father was: provider of sperm, room, board, driving lessons and unflinching dispensation of hard-won life lessons and character-forming punishment. In their first documented family photo, my mom is 19 (but looks 14) as she holds my newborn sister. Oblivious to the camera, Mom’s entire body curves over her newborn, seemingly ready to climb inside her baby’s mouth if need be. Dad is 21 and stares into camera as if searching for the escape hatch to release him from this doting family scene. Since it was 1960, cameras were not also phones/calculators/music players and credit cards, the next family photo is of Dad watching his daughter. Dad grins broadly at camera, hands on hips as my eight month old sister furtively gnaws on a power line.These were not unusual family photos for America before the 1980s. Mothers were depicted pregnant or parenting and fathers photographed working, sporting, carousing or simply being men while in the background, their offspring were courting electrocution, drinking untended beer cans or pulling the heads off unsuspecting kittens.This is not an attack on my father. My father was the dad he knew how to be, the father he was raised to be, which was not much of a dad, but a whole lot of man. After fathering three daughters, which he had zero idea of what to do with, and varied careers he also had zero idea what to do with, my dad sacrificed the meager security of dead-end jobs and normal family life to pursue his dream. And to everyone’s surprise, including his own, Dad succeeded. He became who he passionately determined to become. He left us to fulfill his destiny. And while he’d occasionally visit, he never truly came back. Neighborhood dads dutifully escorted us to Father Daughter dances. High school and college graduations were commemorated by grandparents, aunts, uncles and Mom. Each Christmas, after Mom had decorated the house, tree, bought, wrapped, hid and then placed under the tree all the gifts she knew we wanted, Dad would swoop in as the conquering hero- trumping Mom’s months of effort. One Christmas Dad gave us each monogrammed briefcases. We were still in elementary school, and briefcases weren’t at the top of our Christmas wish lists but since the gifts were from him, we gushed over the hand-tooled leather as if it was John Travolta’s eponymous record album. When people would praise us, his daughters, Dad always said, “I had nothing to do with it. Their mother did it all.” Which was true but sad. And completely acceptable at that time. A modern American father wouldn’t be caught dead saying that about his children. These days, dads strive to be as essential to the nurturing and moral compass shaping of their children as mothers. Back then, dads turned basement playrooms into damp, dark bars. These days men wrap their babies to their dad-bods, simulating the intimate connection of pregnancy. Back then, dads teased their kids for crying, bullied their kids into being tough, and were the ceaseless reminder that if wishes were horses, even beggars would ride. Before our dad knew it, we were all grown up and all that was left was to do was pay for college. Meanwhile Mom continued to mom, control or smooth out every moment of our adult lives. Then, in the 1980s Dad and his second wife adopted two newborns. It was adorable to listen to him gush about feedings, bedtime readings and fret about ER visits. Was it that our culture had changed or our dad had changed? And when Dad became a grandfather, soon after losing his loving mother, he poured his more open and wounded heart into our children- while still teasing and mocking us, because that’s what dads did.Then Mom abruptly died. The loss of her was global, flattening her three biological daughters, our families, her four stepchildren and their families and many students, bookclub-mates, friends, relatives and everyone she ever met. After 79 years of kicking Earth’s ass, Dad has managed to surprise even himself by outliving every hard-living, hard-charging and hard-drinking male relative. Hence, when a mom-sized hole ripped open our lives, Dad, fully aware of his own precarious position in uncharted territory, strove to bridge the gap. Two years ago, Mom and her husband flew out for my sister’s oldest son’s high school graduation. That was the last time my sister saw our mom alive. So, this year, defying everyone’s low expectations, with bad knees, fading eyes, crippled back, feet and hands, Dad flew three thousand miles to celebrate the high school graduation of my sister’s younger son. For four furiously fast days Dad reveled at his grandsons’ accomplishments, their fashions and wild mops of blond hair, watched Grace play at the seashore, fretting over waves crashing four feet away from her. For the first time in forever, we didn’t argue politics while gulping buckets of wine required to make dinner with Dad feel less obligatory. Dad admonished our fast driving, admired our husbands for putting up with our quirks, laughed at our jokes and while still a rabid, unapologetic interrupter, allowed us to finish more sentences than at any other moment in our communal recorded history as family. Basically, Dad became our mom. And now, the day before Father’s Day, I regret not even just sending him a Father’s Day card. So here it is. Happy Father’s Day to a brave, fierce father- all the braver for your ability to embrace change. You didn’t harden into a crouton of an old man- a crusty conservative endlessly arm-wrestling our beliefs (instilled by our ever-loving liberal mother). Thank you for recognizing our need and attempting to mom your three heartbroken middle aged daughters. As you face the final chapters of your life, thank you for unabashedly celebrating us for who and what we are- your large, complicated, adoring family, which you had everything to do with. "

Eric SC Manning (center) and Michael Arad (right) said Saturday the design process was in its beginning stages.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5946d2551600002100116c1c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The architect who designed the 9/11 Memorial in New York City has been tapped to create a monument honoring the victims of the 2015 massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.Church officials announced Saturday that Michael Arad, an Israeli-American and partner at the Manhattan-based Handel Architects firm, had been selected to design the project.“I feel very privileged to be here,” Arad said during the announcement. “But I also feel the weight of this responsibility and pray that I will find the means to convey the beauty that I’ve seen here in Charleston.”Arad, chosen out of more than 5,000 applicants in 2004 to design the 9/11 Memorial in New York, said he planned to meet with survivors of the shooting, as well as victims’ families and congregation members, to help inform his design.On June 17, 2015, nine churchgoers were shot and killed by avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof during a Bible study at the historic black church. The victims were Susie Jackson, the Rev. Daniel Simmons, Ethel Lance, Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders, the Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, the Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, Myra Thompson and the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the church’s pastor.The Rev. Eric Manning, the church’s current pastor, said he hoped Arad’s design would “evoke the weight of the tragedy” while inspiring positive change in the world.The memorial will be located on church grounds and will serve to honor both the memory of the victims and the community’s resiliency. “Michael Arad’s design for the September 11 Memorial expresses both the devastating loss of life, while also expressing peace, comfort and hope,” Manning said in a statement. “His ability to symbolize these conflicting feelings to create a very moving memorial was a compelling qualification for the task of the Emanuel AME Memorial.”Plans for a monument began one month after the massacre when local real estate development firm The Beach Company partnered with the church to create a memorial fund. It’s unclear when the project is expected to be complete.“The victims of the Emanuel AME Church shooting will not be forgotten,” John Darby, CEO of The Beach Company, said in a statement. “Their families’ and the church’s response to this tragic event has already materially changed the conversation about racism. They put faith and love above hatred, and the message inspired people across the globe.”Roof, 23, is facing the death penalty for his conviction last December on various federal charges, including hate crimes resulting in death. In March, he pleaded guilty to several state charges, including nine counts of murder, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole."

An inquest jury recommended that seven employees of the jail be criminally charged.Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California called Clarke’s appointment “a disgrace.”(Reporting by Eric M.

The workers made her think of her grandfather, an Italian immigrant who, after making it through Ellis Island in the 1920s, got his first job digging the streets of this city. He earned 10 cents a day and had to bring his own shovel. People regularly spat at him and sneered at his broken English. “He’d tell me, ‘I didn’t mind that, because I knew that someday in the future, you were going to have a better life,’” she recalled.  His sacrifice has been weighing on Marcario lately. She isn’t a parent herself, but she thinks of her young cousins, nieces and nephews. She wants them to inherit a planet with a stable climate and normal sea levels ― a country that still has some pristine wilderness left. Her job ― running a privately held company with roughly $800 million in annual revenue and stores in 16 states plus D.C. ― provides her a much bigger platform to influence their lives than anyone in her family had two generations ago. It’s also why she’s decided to take on the president of the United States to stop him from rolling back decades of public land protections.  “We have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,” Marcario, 52, told HuffPost last month. “I don’t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now.” Ventura, California-based Patagonia has taken on a number of national conservation efforts since environmentalist and rock climber Yvon Chouinard founded it in 1973. In 1988, the firm launched a campaign to restore the natural splendor of Yosemite Valley, which was being destroyed by cars and lodges. The company took on a more consumer-centric approach, launching an ad campaign in 2011 urging customers not to buy its jackets in an attempt to address rampant waste in the fashion industry.  The company was relatively quiet for the first two years after Marcario took the top spot in 2014. But she grew dismayed as environmental and climate issues took a backseat in the 2016 election, despite the stark difference between the two top candidates’ views. She worried the vicious mudslinging of the election would turn off voters.Instead of turning away from political discord, as many corporate giants have, Marcario ran toward it. In September, the company announced plans to spend $1 million and launch a get-out-the-vote tour of 17 states. On Election Day, the retailer completely closed down its operations in 30 stores to make sure employees and shoppers made it to the polls.Still, Donald Trump’s November victory caught Marcario by surprise. Trump had campaigned on bombastic promises to revive the coal industry, a top source of planet-warming emissions, and vowed to transform the U.S. into a major fossil fuel exporter. Then he named the CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. as his secretary of state and picked an oil and gas ally to head the Environmental Protection Agency. He nominated Ryan Zinke, a freshman congressman from Montana who questioned the science behind global warming, to head the Department of the Interior, which controls national parks and 500 million acres of land ― or 20 percent of the U.S. landmass.  And Trump made clear that he plans to roll back the environmental rules issued under Obama ― which he has said constrain businesses and stymie job growth. In a show of postelection defiance, Patagonia decided to donate all $10 million of its Black Friday sales to environmental causes. In a Nov. 28 blog post, the company nodded to the president-elect’s dismissal of climate science and promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, though it stopped short of calling Trump out by name. But Marcario still thought public lands were safe. While Trump, born and raised in New York City, never seemed to care about outdoor excursions that didn’t include 18 holes, his eldest son, Donald Jr., is a big-game hunter who grew up camping in the forests of his mother’s native Czech Republic. During the campaign, Trump signaled plans to buck the Republican Party platform calling for federals lands to be turned over to state control, where they were more likely to be exploited for resource development or sold off. “I want to keep the lands great,” Trump told Field & Stream magazine in January 2016.That tone changed shortly after the election. One of Obama’s final actions was to set aside 1.35 million acres in southeastern Utah to create Bears Ears National Monument, named by the various Native American tribes whose sacred lands it included. The designation riled the state’s Republican leaders, who condemned the designation as a federal land grab and urged the incoming Trump administration to undo it, and mining interests that were looking to tap uranium and mineral deposits in the region.Patagonia went on the offensive against Utah’s Republican governor and Washington delegation. In January, the company threatened to pull out of Salt Lake City’s biannual Outdoor Retailer Show, a trade show that brings 45,000 visitors spending more than $40 million each year. Marcario pledged to fight the state’s leadership “with everything that we have.” A month later, she pulled out of the show and put intense pressure on its organizers to quit hosting the event in Utah’s capital until state lawmakers halted their assault on Bears Ears. In April, Trump directed Zinke to not only re-examine the Bears Ears designation but to to review all national monument designations going back 21 years, calling them an “egregious abuse of federal power.”Patagonia threatened to sue the Trump administration a day later, vowing to “take every step necessary, including legal action, to defend our most treasured public landscapes from coast to coast.”“A president does not have the authority to rescind a National Monument,” Marcario said in a terse statement that day. “An attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input.” Reversing Obama’s Bears Ears designation would be an unprecedented assault on a presidential prerogative created in the 1906 Antiquities Act. Nearly every president has wielded the act to preserve tribal lands and natural wonders. Only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush declined to use the law, according to The Wilderness Society. But no White House has ever rescinded a monument, and a 2016 analysis from the Congressional Research Service suggests that presidents can only adjust, not outright abolish, a prior designation. Zinke completed his review this month, and on Monday submitted an interim report that recommends shrinking the boundaries of Bears Ears. There is some precedent for that: Woodrow Wilson halved Mount Olympic National Monument, which Roosevelt had designated in 1909. The monument was later restored to its full size when Franklin Roosevelt signed a congressional act redesignating the monument as Olympic National Park in 1938, providing it the expanded protections granted under national park status. Patagonia says it will make good on the threat to sue the administration if they move to alter Bears Ears.  The company has suggested it will take a novel approach to a lawsuit ― arguing that a reversal of those protections would hurt their business, which is structured to make environmental philanthropy a core function. The retailer is registered as a benefit corporation, or B corp, meaning the company has committed to adhering to rigid environmental and charitable standards, submitting detailed annual progress reports, and giving 1 percent of its pre-tax profits to green causes each year. Patagonia donated $800,000 to groups that advocated for Bears Ears to be established as part of that charitable giving. It also sent employees on retreats to the monument and tested products there. In May, the company released a virtual reality film touring Bears Ears.  “We have such a close connection to the area,” Hilary Dessouky, Patagonia’s general counsel, told HuffPost by phone this week. “That’s part of our argument, that we are directly connected to the area though the work that we’ve done.”“We have a real economic interest in the preservation of America’s public lands,” she added.Mark Squillace, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said Patagonia’s claim could hold up in court. “Patagonia probably does have significant business interests that could be affected,” Squillace, who worked under Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt during the last year of Bill Clinton’s presidency, told HuffPost by phone. “The test for standing is not too draconian, so I think most courts would let Patagonia in.”Anticipated lawsuits from environmental groups and tribes ― whose legal standing to sue would be even stronger ― could also bolster Patagonia’s case.Trump could attempt to reduce the monument through an executive order, but he could also appeal to Congress to vote to change Bears Ears’ status, which Zinke has suggested they may do.That would face tough opposition, however. “I don’t believe Trump has the legal authority to rescind or shrink the monument,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who has a national monument in his own state under consideration, said on Monday. “If the administration moves forward with that plan, if he puts this plan before Congress, I will fight him every step of the way.”Patagonia said it would also consider its legal options if Congress acts, but would likely have a tougher time with that. At the very least, the company said it’s already considering putting its efforts behind pro-environment candidates in the 2018 election. Marcario said she had no interest in directly funding individual candidates, but Patagonia employees have given a total of $56,547 to the Democratic Party over the last 27 years, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. (Republicans, by contrast, received just one $500 donation in 1990.) Marcario is ready for a long fight over something that could become her legacy at the company. Patagonia’s first CEO, Kris Tompkins, spent 12 years at the helm and donated more than 340,000 acres of land in Argentina’s northeastern Iberá wetlands to establish what will become the country’s largest nature preserve. Tompkins and her late husband, billionaire retail mogul Douglas Tompkins, also bought up huge swaths of wilderness in Argentina and Chile in hopes of preserving it.“She’s a pretty hard act to follow,” Marcario said with a laugh.Patagonia hasn’t been without its faults. Two years before Marcario took over, internal audits found forced labor and brutal conditions at Taiwanese mills that produced the raw materials for its apparel. Patagonia applied aggressive new standards for monitoring its suppliers in response, but it’s always difficult to monitor every supplier at all times. Marcario said she also wants to make changes at the corporate level to further their ideals ― by converting the firm’s food division, Patagonia Provisions, to purely organic ingredients and investing the employee retirement plans entirely in sustainable, eco-friendly funds and businesses.But for now, she’s focused on running a major company and keeping Trump from downsizing a national monument in southeastern Utah, a mammoth task unto itself. Progress requires effort, but it takes time, too. She learned that resolve from grandfather and from her childhood summers spent fishing the waters surrounding Staten Island with homemade rods her uncles made. She’s given to quoting Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous line about the long, justice-bent arc of the moral universe. After wrapping up the interview, Marcario grabbed her Patagonia backpack and prepared to catch her ride outside. She walked a few steps, then turned around. “Look, I grew up as a gay woman in the ‘80s, watching my friends die of AIDS and Jerry Falwell on TV saying they deserved it,” she said, referring to the far-right evangelical preacher. She paused for a moment, then smiled. “Look how far we’ve come.” "

The company has suggested it will take a novel approach to a lawsuit ― arguing that a reversal of those protections would hurt their business, which is structured to make environmental philanthropy a core function. The retailer is registered as a benefit corporation, or B corp, meaning the company has committed to adhering to rigid environmental and charitable standards, submitting detailed annual progress reports, and giving 1 percent of its pre-tax profits to green causes each year. Patagonia donated $800,000 to groups that advocated for Bears Ears to be established as part of that charitable giving. It also sent employees on retreats to the monument and tested products there. In May, the company released a virtual reality film touring Bears Ears.  “We have such a close connection to the area,” Hilary Dessouky, Patagonia’s general counsel, told HuffPost by phone this week. “That’s part of our argument, that we are directly connected to the area though the work that we’ve done.”“We have a real economic interest in the preservation of America’s public lands,” she added.Mark Squillace, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said Patagonia’s claim could hold up in court. “Patagonia probably does have significant business interests that could be affected,” Squillace, who worked under Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt during the last year of Bill Clinton’s presidency, told HuffPost by phone. “The test for standing is not too draconian, so I think most courts would let Patagonia in.”Anticipated lawsuits from environmental groups and tribes ― whose legal standing to sue would be even stronger ― could also bolster Patagonia’s case.Trump could attempt to reduce the monument through an executive order, but he could also appeal to Congress to vote to change Bears Ears’ status, which Zinke has suggested they may do.That would face tough opposition, however. “I don’t believe Trump has the legal authority to rescind or shrink the monument,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who has a national monument in his own state under consideration, said on Monday. “If the administration moves forward with that plan, if he puts this plan before Congress, I will fight him every step of the way.”Patagonia said it would also consider its legal options if Congress acts, but would likely have a tougher time with that. At the very least, the company said it’s already considering putting its efforts behind pro-environment candidates in the 2018 election. Marcario said she had no interest in directly funding individual candidates, but Patagonia employees have given a total of $56,547 to the Democratic Party over the last 27 years, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. (Republicans, by contrast, received just one $500 donation in 1990.) Marcario is ready for a long fight over something that could become her legacy at the company. Patagonia’s first CEO, Kris Tompkins, spent 12 years at the helm and donated more than 340,000 acres of land in Argentina’s northeastern Iberá wetlands to establish what will become the country’s largest nature preserve. Tompkins and her late husband, billionaire retail mogul Douglas Tompkins, also bought up huge swaths of wilderness in Argentina and Chile in hopes of preserving it.“She’s a pretty hard act to follow,” Marcario said with a laugh.Patagonia hasn’t been without its faults. Two years before Marcario took over, internal audits found forced labor and brutal conditions at Taiwanese mills that produced the raw materials for its apparel. Patagonia applied aggressive new standards for monitoring its suppliers in response, but it’s always difficult to monitor every supplier at all times. Marcario said she also wants to make changes at the corporate level to further their ideals ― by converting the firm’s food division, Patagonia Provisions, to purely organic ingredients and investing the employee retirement plans entirely in sustainable, eco-friendly funds and businesses.But for now, she’s focused on running a major company and keeping Trump from downsizing a national monument in southeastern Utah, a mammoth task unto itself. Progress requires effort, but it takes time, too. She learned that resolve from grandfather and from her childhood summers spent fishing the waters surrounding Staten Island with homemade rods her uncles made. She’s given to quoting Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous line about the long, justice-bent arc of the moral universe. After wrapping up the interview, Marcario grabbed her Patagonia backpack and prepared to catch her ride outside. She walked a few steps, then turned around. “Look, I grew up as a gay woman in the ‘80s, watching my friends die of AIDS and Jerry Falwell on TV saying they deserved it,” she said, referring to the far-right evangelical preacher.

28,POLITICS,Patagonia's CEO Is Ready To Lead The Corporate Resistance To Donald Trump,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patagonia-public-lands_us_59440a8ee4b01eab7a2d51e0,"The private, California-based outdoor retailer is preparing to sue the White House to protect public lands.",2017-06-18,President Donald Trump speaks at the Interior Department before signing an executive order reviewing previous national monument designations made under the Antiquities Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59440eb52100002a0033c95c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― On a cloudy May morning, Rose Marcario, the chief executive of outdoor retailer Patagonia, stared out a second-story window of a Manhattan restaurant, watching construction workers jackhammer the street below. The workers made her think of her grandfather, an Italian immigrant who, after making it through Ellis Island in the 1920s, got his first job digging the streets of this city. He earned 10 cents a day and had to bring his own shovel. People regularly spat at him and sneered at his broken English. “He’d tell me, ‘I didn’t mind that, because I knew that someday in the future, you were going to have a better life,’” she recalled.  His sacrifice has been weighing on Marcario lately. She isn’t a parent herself, but she thinks of her young cousins, nieces and nephews. She wants them to inherit a planet with a stable climate and normal sea levels ― a country that still has some pristine wilderness left. Her job ― running a privately held company with roughly $800 million in annual revenue and stores in 16 states plus D.C. ― provides her a much bigger platform to influence their lives than anyone in her family had two generations ago. It’s also why she’s decided to take on the president of the United States to stop him from rolling back decades of public land protections.  “We have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,” Marcario, 52, told HuffPost last month. “I don’t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now.” Ventura, California-based Patagonia has taken on a number of national conservation efforts since environmentalist and rock climber Yvon Chouinard founded it in 1973. In 1988, the firm launched a campaign to restore the natural splendor of Yosemite Valley, which was being destroyed by cars and lodges. The company took on a more consumer-centric approach, launching an ad campaign in 2011 urging customers not to buy its jackets in an attempt to address rampant waste in the fashion industry.  The company was relatively quiet for the first two years after Marcario took the top spot in 2014. But she grew dismayed as environmental and climate issues took a backseat in the 2016 election, despite the stark difference between the two top candidates’ views. She worried the vicious mudslinging of the election would turn off voters.Instead of turning away from political discord, as many corporate giants have, Marcario ran toward it. In September, the company announced plans to spend $1 million and launch a get-out-the-vote tour of 17 states. On Election Day, the retailer completely closed down its operations in 30 stores to make sure employees and shoppers made it to the polls.Still, Donald Trump’s November victory caught Marcario by surprise. Trump had campaigned on bombastic promises to revive the coal industry, a top source of planet-warming emissions, and vowed to transform the U.S. into a major fossil fuel exporter. Then he named the CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. as his secretary of state and picked an oil and gas ally to head the Environmental Protection Agency. He nominated Ryan Zinke, a freshman congressman from Montana who questioned the science behind global warming, to head the Department of the Interior, which controls national parks and 500 million acres of land ― or 20 percent of the U.S. landmass.  And Trump made clear that he plans to roll back the environmental rules issued under Obama ― which he has said constrain businesses and stymie job growth. In a show of postelection defiance, Patagonia decided to donate all $10 million of its Black Friday sales to environmental causes. In a Nov. 28 blog post, the company nodded to the president-elect’s dismissal of climate science and promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, though it stopped short of calling Trump out by name. But Marcario still thought public lands were safe. While Trump, born and raised in New York City, never seemed to care about outdoor excursions that didn’t include 18 holes, his eldest son, Donald Jr., is a big-game hunter who grew up camping in the forests of his mother’s native Czech Republic. During the campaign, Trump signaled plans to buck the Republican Party platform calling for federals lands to be turned over to state control, where they were more likely to be exploited for resource development or sold off. “I want to keep the lands great,” Trump told Field & Stream magazine in January 2016.That tone changed shortly after the election. One of Obama’s final actions was to set aside 1.35 million acres in southeastern Utah to create Bears Ears National Monument, named by the various Native American tribes whose sacred lands it included. The designation riled the state’s Republican leaders, who condemned the designation as a federal land grab and urged the incoming Trump administration to undo it, and mining interests that were looking to tap uranium and mineral deposits in the region.Patagonia went on the offensive against Utah’s Republican governor and Washington delegation. In January, the company threatened to pull out of Salt Lake City’s biannual Outdoor Retailer Show, a trade show that brings 45,000 visitors spending more than $40 million each year. Marcario pledged to fight the state’s leadership “with everything that we have.” A month later, she pulled out of the show and put intense pressure on its organizers to quit hosting the event in Utah’s capital until state lawmakers halted their assault on Bears Ears. In April, Trump directed Zinke to not only re-examine the Bears Ears designation but to to review all national monument designations going back 21 years, calling them an “egregious abuse of federal power.”Patagonia threatened to sue the Trump administration a day later, vowing to “take every step necessary, including legal action, to defend our most treasured public landscapes from coast to coast.”“A president does not have the authority to rescind a National Monument,” Marcario said in a terse statement that day. “An attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input.” Reversing Obama’s Bears Ears designation would be an unprecedented assault on a presidential prerogative created in the 1906 Antiquities Act. Nearly every president has wielded the act to preserve tribal lands and natural wonders. Only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush declined to use the law, according to The Wilderness Society. But no White House has ever rescinded a monument, and a 2016 analysis from the Congressional Research Service suggests that presidents can only adjust, not outright abolish, a prior designation. Zinke completed his review this month, and on Monday submitted an interim report that recommends shrinking the boundaries of Bears Ears. There is some precedent for that: Woodrow Wilson halved Mount Olympic National Monument, which Roosevelt had designated in 1909. The monument was later restored to its full size when Franklin Roosevelt signed a congressional act redesignating the monument as Olympic National Park in 1938, providing it the expanded protections granted under national park status. Patagonia says it will make good on the threat to sue the administration if they move to alter Bears Ears.  The company has suggested it will take a novel approach to a lawsuit ― arguing that a reversal of those protections would hurt their business, which is structured to make environmental philanthropy a core function.

From Mississippi to Maine, South Florida to Phoenix, and the way to the White House, portrayals of America’s diverse, urban centers as lawless cesspools in need of forceful order have gained traction. Leaders of all statures have appropriated law and order ― often, in unison with law enforcement officials ― to establish their public persona and convey a political objective. To this end, it bears questioning why it is we never consider police shootings political. Police today serve under the authority of a president who promised an unfettered expansion of their powers. An officer today can reasonably operate under the assumption that the highest office in the land has lent them blind loyalty. And yet, when deaths and alleged misconduct occur, we are implored to believe they are thoughtless errors rather than a natural result of newfound power and privilege within the well-connected police lobby. On July 6 of last year, St. Paul, Minnesota, police officer Jeronimo Yanez riddled Philando Castile’s body with bullets during a traffic stop as Castile’s girlfriend and her daughter watched at his side. Castile, a registered gun owner who reportedly notified Yanez of the gun in his pocket, was mistaken for a robbery suspect due to his “wide-set nose.” Yanez shot Castile and alleged Castile made him fear for his life.We learned late Friday afternoon of Yanez’s acquittal on charges of second-degree manslaughter, as well as two counts of reckless discharge of a firearm, meaning neither Philando Castile nor his family will receive justice. He will instead join an ever-growing list of Black bodies wrested from the earth by the state without any assignment of guilt on the perpetrator. The violence inflicted upon him was a reflection of the nation’s fear about a perceived, inherent criminality within Black people. On a macro level, the juxtaposition of Yanez’s acquittal against effusive rejections of political violence we witnessed in response to the Alexandria shooting provides a clear and disturbing reality:Countrywide, the way we categorize matters we deem “political” is tainted by bias and provides undue cover for oppressive institutions. In a nation such as ours, where professed aversion to politics and its products is a pastime, we are not inclined to believe those we empower with dominion over human life act with the same malice, petulance, and biases we do. It is our preference to imagine it is we ― the mere mortals ― who busy ourselves with politics as our law enforcement officials float pristinely above, shielding us from danger. But this is clearly a political decision; as much as lending the privilege of infallibility to any other government agency would be. If all IRS employees were suddenly granted indomitable power over American citizens, and granted far-reaching, extrajudicial authority, our allowance of that policy would stand as a political statement. It would be a declaration of how we wish to envision our future. The same applies to our law enforcement agencies.When, as we’ve witnessed, a raft of highly publicized police shootings involving black and brown people occur without consequence, that too is a declaration of our future aims―that too is political―and it suggests black and brown people are nonessential to the future of our nation. When we elect leaders who propagate racist falsehoods in order to suggest a rise in black deviance, our tolerance of this is an indictment of our politics.When these elected leaders empower others whose motivations are to regress advancement toward equal justice, this is an act of violence. And when we collectively allow law enforcement officials to act upon these motivations, their work becomes less about law, more about order, and a wholly political act. Our national delusion regarding the violent nature of our politics is twofold.For one, it is peddled, in part, by our kiddish self-imagination and esteem. We classify our public discourse among the renowned, regal sort. In Washington D.C. and capitals across the country, our governmental structures are a picturesque homage to a revered time.

April 4, 2011, University of New Hampshire in Durham, New Hampshire.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59456a0715000028004e6e02.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sexual violence in our nation’s college and university campus communities is a significant challenge. This is no myth or hoax. Numerous scientific studies going back at least thirty years have documented that between one-in-five and one-in-four women will be victimized over their time in college. There has long been a framework under federal law, Title IX which prohibits gender discrimination in access to educational opportunities, to address sexual harassment and violence, but it is, and has been broken. We owe our students better, we owe them a safe learning environment, and we owe it to taxpayers who support education to ensure that investment isn’t diminished by the negative impact of sexual violence.The Obama administration inherited this broken system, due in large part simply to systemic neglect by administrations and Congresses of both Republicans and Democrats. Under the leadership of Vice President Joe Biden, the Obama Administration in 2011 made addressing Title IX’s sexual violence requirements a priority tackling extensive problems both in higher education and federal enforcement that had been identified in an investigative series by the Center for Public Integrity and NPR in 2009 and 2010.They began making significant progress including instituting “universal guidance” in the form of a Dear Colleague Letter, and addressing not just cases presented by individual sexual assault survivors but investigating how these institutions handled every case. This was important because as the investigative reporting had revealed colleges and universities often had problems with their entire process affecting far more than just one case. Unfortunately, by 2014 this had led to a whole new problem. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), the unit tasked with Title IX enforcement, was overwhelmed with far more case work than they could possibly resolve in any reasonable period of time given the personnel they had. There was never any real plan to correct this as cases continued to mount-up.According to the Chronicle of Higher Education’s Title IX Tracker, since enforcement was stepped-up in 2011 “the government has conducted 399 investigations of colleges for possibly mishandling reports of sexual violence.” Of those “62 cases have been resolved and 337 remain open.” The average case duration is 1.7 years, not the 180 days recommended by OCR, and many cases are open over 3 years with some up to 6 years. Often the students who initiated or were involved in any investigation have left campus by then receiving no justice.The Trump Administration then inherited this problem. “In OCR, processing times have skyrocketed in recent years and the case backlog has exploded,” the U.S. Department of Education (ED) said in a statement. “Justice delayed is justice denied, and justice for many complainants has been denied for too long.” This is a sentiment echoed by many Title IX complainants, but how this is corrected is at least as important as recognizing the problem. The Obama Administration failed to do either effectively acting like the driver of a car obliviously about to drive off a cliff hoping for a hand to pluck them out of the sky before they crashed into the ground below, and it does not seem like the Trump Administration will be aspiring to get to the root of the problem either.As recently reported by ProPublica and The New York Times, OCR, under the leadership of Candice E. Jackson, the acting head of the office, is planning to address this backlog by scaling back the scope of their reviews. “There is no longer an artificial requirement to collect several years of data when many complaints can be adequately addressed much more efficiently and quickly,” they said in the official statement. In simpler terms this means OCR won’t be looking at broken systems and how to fix them, only the injustices reported by a single complainant. While this may expedite justice for individual complainants, it will fall back to a system that continued to allow systemic flaws to deny justice. We have come too far to allow this to happen, and meeting both needs must not be considered mutually exclusive.Ironically Catherine Lhamon, who headed OCR in the final years of the Obama Administration in which the back-log was allowed to accumulate under her watch, now heads the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and has announced they will launch “a two-year investigation of federal civil rights enforcement” including a focus on ED. We don’t have two-years to wait for an investigation, especially one headed by the official who was on watch while much of the underlying problem was created. We need solutions, and we need them now not in two-years.A bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators, headed by Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Dean Heller (R-NV) stepped forward with part of the solution last year bolstering a request from the Obama Administration. They sought to appropriate “at least $137.7 million” for OCR in Fiscal Year 2017 “to be used in part for the investigation and enforcement of Title IX.” This did not happen and OCR funding was kept level at $107 million. The Trump Administration’s proposed budget, however, would slightly reduce overall funding to under this amount, and would cut the personnel budget by $4 million from $68 million to $56 million.More money alone is not the solution, but it is an important part of it. If our country is going to take this obligation seriously we need to make the commitment to actually do so. More strategic enforcement by OCR should also be an essential part of the solution. The bi-partisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act (CASA), which is pending in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, as well as the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence in the House are both critical pieces of the solution as well. Combatting sexual violence has never been, and is not a partisan issue. The unity of the legislators working on these issues proves that, and I am hopeful they will work to bring about the needed solutions sooner rather than later."

This is no myth or hoax. Numerous scientific studies going back at least thirty years have documented that between one-in-five and one-in-four women will be victimized over their time in college. There has long been a framework under federal law, Title IX which prohibits gender discrimination in access to educational opportunities, to address sexual harassment and violence, but it is, and has been broken. We owe our students better, we owe them a safe learning environment, and we owe it to taxpayers who support education to ensure that investment isn’t diminished by the negative impact of sexual violence.The Obama administration inherited this broken system, due in large part simply to systemic neglect by administrations and Congresses of both Republicans and Democrats. Under the leadership of Vice President Joe Biden, the Obama Administration in 2011 made addressing Title IX’s sexual violence requirements a priority tackling extensive problems both in higher education and federal enforcement that had been identified in an investigative series by the Center for Public Integrity and NPR in 2009 and 2010.They began making significant progress including instituting “universal guidance” in the form of a Dear Colleague Letter, and addressing not just cases presented by individual sexual assault survivors but investigating how these institutions handled every case.

33,QUEER VOICES,The Temple Of Fitness,"Claire Rudy Foster, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-temple-of-fitness_us_5944b5a9e4b024b7e0df4c40,My military family raised me to be ready for anything. Working out with my dad prepared me to encounter my true self.,2017-06-17,"<p>My father (standing, with saber) at his retirement ceremony.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5944bafc15000028004e6d2c.jpg?ops=crop_0_44_540_676%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Some people had church — their fathers were pastors. My father was an officer in the Navy, so we had the gym. Physical readiness is required for anyone in the military. There are fitness tests, whether you’re pushing papers or slinging an M-16 at a checkpoint overseas. A sailor’s physical condition matters whether they’re in a combat zone or not. I still remember my father telling me, one night at dinner, that if they ran out of people at the front, eventually it would be his turn. That’s why we’re ready.If you grew up in a military family, you understand being ready.We were ready all the time, for everything. We were always 10 minutes early. We packed the day before air travel, and left with plenty of time to spare for security and tickets. I have no memories that include my parents forgetting to stow some needed piece of equipment, like a picnic knife or bottle opener. Always prepared.My father taught me that readiness begins in the body. How will you defend yourself if you’re not strong? He left the house at 4 a.m. every morning with a travel mug of black coffee, heading to the gym at the Pentagon. This was after a hip injury ended his running. The injury meant he was tied to the gym’s machines, stationary bikes, and pool. It also meant that finally, I could keep up with him.⁂One of my earliest memories: I am in first grade. It is the balmy part of spring in Waldorf, Maryland. My father, impossibly tall, is putting on his grey running shoes. He is a marathoner. He has run over 100 races. He asks if I want to come with him. It’s an easy one today, he says. Just a mile or so.Thrilled, I stand in front of the closet in the bedroom I share with my sister. I agonize over what to wear, change clothes a few times, and finally pick a bright magenta and teal sweatsuit. My sneakers are battered, but I put them on anyway. I imagine myself in a photo, posed next to my dad. We have never done anything like this before. I think: He will be so proud of me. We will go running together all the time.Instead, he’s waiting on the sidewalk with his hands on his hips, wondering what took so long. “That’s what you’re wearing?”He shrugs, and sets off in an easy lope that, as an adult, I recognize as the slowest possible stride you can maintain without just reverting to walking in long steps. I pad alongside him, puppyish. The block where I practice riding my bike — it still has training wheels, much to my shame — is longer than I thought, and in a few minutes I realize that the sweatsuit was a terrible idea. I’m humid and my face feels sticky. I have never run like this, without joy or playfulness, at a steady pace. My father, the metronome, ticks on ahead and I fall behind him.He circles back. “If you can’t keep up, you need to go home,” he says.I don’t remember if I had an answer. He picked up speed at the corner and disappeared, never once looking back. I walked home crying, tore off the sweatsuit, and threw it on the floor. I refused to wear it again, even only the top or the bottoms, separately. Even when all my other clothes were dirty. Finally, I outgrew it. My mother packed it in a plastic bag and donated it to the VA.⁂But after the hip injury, he couldn’t run away from me. Starting in high school, my father started taking me to the gym with him when he went on the weekends. He took me there on Take Your Child To Work Day, too. The Pentagon, as you might imagine, had an extremely nice, top-of-the-line facility in one of the buildings on its compound. It had just been remodeled.The Pentagon’s gym used to be a simple, Soviet-style weight training room with a couple of treadmills, showers, and changing areas. The renovation transformed it into a glossy, futuristic training facility, like something from a sci-fi movie about athletes in space. A track, suspended over the main gym area, looped around the inside of the building. There were saunas and pressurized rooms, a rock climbing wall, and clean, new equipment that smelled of vinyl. I may be imagining these details, but it is more likely that I am not.The Pentagon gym had a shallow pool which was not part of the renovation. Its water tasted like bleach and salt, and was dimly lit by greenish lamps at the end of each lane. My goggles fogged up. There was nothing to see, so it didn’t matter. I did laps for an hour, too chicken to try a flip turn.This was when I was still young and new to my body. I had a few years to go before femaleness caught up to me. My period hadn’t started yet; my breasts were latent, not even in the bud stage. I was 5’10” already and very thin. Lean. In those days, it wasn’t uncommon for strangers to ask me, “Are you a boy or a girl?”Both. Neither. Do I have to choose? I couldn’t ever give a straight answer, because I didn’t have one. The words I’m a girl stuck in my throat. I wasn’t a girl. And, at that point in my life, I didn’t have to be one. I could still be a child. I was comfortable with my otherness. All I cared about was becoming faster, stronger. I read fitness magazines and learned how to build muscles, how to use interval training to improve my sprints, and the importance of fasted cardio. ⁂This was the era of female bodybuilding, the Miss Olympia competition, and American Gladiators. My dad gave me a poster of these formidable looking women, and I tacked it on my wall. They didn’t look human—their outfits were reminiscent of the comic book goddesses I loved, Wonder Woman and the Insect Queen. Their bleached teeth glittered. They wore bikinis and their breasts were eaten up by their pectorals. It was impossible to imagine them crying, or being afraid to walk to their car alone at night. It was never my aim to wear the suit of thick muscles these women did. But I envied their strength, and the freedom it gave them. They were more powerful than a man, even a very strong one. They had nothing to be afraid of.My dad described these women as iron babes. I got a book about swimming and worked at perfecting my form. Even wearing a women’s swimsuit, I was called “sir.”⁂The swimming book suggested working on my cardiovascular endurance, so I ran in my neighborhood before school, 3 to 5 miles every day. I loved the way my feet hammered the sidewalk, making me feel like I was forged from iron. In PE, I did push-ups the regular way, never on my knees. I thought about the way my body could move through the water. The nearby community center had an Olympic-sized pool. I got my first job there, as a lifeguard. I worked out in the community center gym before my shift and swam laps after it, when the pool was closed. I could swim from one end to the other underwater, holding my breath. I fantasized about joining a swim team. In my fantasy, my parents sat on the cold aluminum bleachers, their applause swallowed up by the water in my ears. In reality, sports were not a possibility for me, because the practices and matches conflicted with our family’s schedule. I trained on my own. I found new ways to challenge myself.For lifeguard drills, we practiced rescuing cinder blocks wrapped in duct tape from the deep end. It was supposed to simulate the dead weight of a drowned 350-pound person. Once we’d dragged the block to the surface, we had to tread water for a minute or more, hoisting the prop overhead. Head and neck out of the water. Arms straight. I held the record for this. I would stare at the clock’s long red minute hand, not caring that my arms and legs were burning. Pain is weakness leaving the body. I thought that, then. I still believed discipline was the pathway to love. The girls around me were starting to soften, wear bras. They’d stroke each others’ legs to admire their hairlessness, how close and smooth the shave was. They talked about boys. How many bases he got to. Who was a slut. I stayed separate from this. When I ran, or moved my body, I knew that what I looked like didn’t matter. I was a verb — not a noun, like them.A modeling agent scouted me based on my height, but it didn’t go anywhere. I did not know how to pose like a girl. And I had those shoulders. I was long but not willowy. I was starting to look like my dad. To me, queer was shorthand for the wilderness outside the dominant genders. Weird was another word for it. I was queer because I didn’t belong in my culture’s narrowly defined heterosexual roles. I didn’t want to be straight, and straight people didn’t want me on their team. I couldn’t even pretend convincingly. In dresses or makeup, I looked more boyish than ever. My body was made not for decoration but for performance. But I wasn’t a guy, either. I didn’t covet masculinity or the horrible, strangling privilege that came with it. Boy, or girl? I didn’t belong in either locker room.Trans is not short for transformation or even transition. Trans indicates the distance we travel from one point of gender expression to another, through the unmarked territory between male and female and all the other colors and shapes our identities take. I found that the further I got from the binary, the happier I was. I liked myself when I was other. Outside gender, I could be free. At school, they called me a dyke and a faggot because I kissed girls and dated girls and I would fight you if you got in my face. I played intramural football and basketball with a dozen guys my age, mostly black, all accepting of me. I went to my senior prom in a tuxedo; my date was a beautiful girl whose name I don’t remember. I buzzed my hair off. I attempted to kill myself twice. I kept running, lifting. Working. I stayed in the water as much as possible. I felt like there was a shadow in me, the true shape of myself. It kept surfacing even though I tried to push it down, back down into the depths.⁂Then, right after my high school graduation, my father was transferred to the Naval hospital in San Diego. The gym there was even nicer. I got a job in the civilian Human Resources office. My dad and I carpooled in the morning — two travel mugs of coffee, slipping out the door like lanky ghosts. Those morning commutes are some of my favorite memories of my father. I don’t remember if we bothered trying to talk to each other or if we just listened to NPR. In the gym, we went through our separate routines and said have a good day to each other on our way to the showers. I was almost 18. My breasts had arrived and men looked at me differently. I took less pleasure in exercising where I could be seen. If I ran in the morning, around our neighborhood, I risked being yelled at. Chased. Grabbed. The gym was static, but it was well lit and safe. At the hospital, someone who saw us together asked if I was my dad’s girlfriend. Whenever I went somewhere alone, strange men commented on my body. They told me what they’d like to do with my body. They told me what I was good for. I looked feminine enough, I guess. I felt like I was piloting a sex toy — this beautiful, rubbery body with my brain inside of it. I walked and talked from deep inside myself, not understanding why nobody saw the weird, androgynous creature inside my shell. ⁂Later, I learned about gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia, which are beautiful words that describe the horrible feeling of not being at home in your own body. Or your own body not being, in some way, a right extension of your personhood. That is different from wishing you were taller, or less fat, or had a defined waist and less cellulite. Everyone, to some degree, wishes they could alter their appearance. That is not the problem I have. My body dysmorphia makes that desire to transform myself an imperative — if you don’t change this, now, you will die. My body dysmorphia means that this woman-body I live in feels like an itchy costume. There are days when it is difficult to leave the house or even look in the mirror. I do not wish to be seen. I don’t like my corporeality. It is painful to feel other people’s eyes on me. At the same time, my gender dysphoria means that I feel pain because my body does not match the way I see myself. I do not want to be masculine, or live in a male body. Nor do I identify as female — I have a woman’s body, but I am not a woman. In a perfect world, I don’t have to choose boy or girl. I am neither: I’m an athlete. A body in motion. Short of surgery and hormonal treatment, I will always look feminine. The tools at my disposal — exercise, diet, special clothes, a good barber — only take me so far. I have a soft face, full lips, delicate hands, and an hourglass figure. My body hair is light. Erasing these things would take me back in time, to the brief period of prepubescence when I was physically myself. There is no such thing as perfect androgyny, and as I’ve aged, I’ve found ways to modify and bind and dress myself to dampen the sense of wrongness I feel in the body I’ve been given.Many people do this. Their reasons are sometimes the same as mine.I practice gratitude for my health, and I try to accept the way I look, the way I might be grateful for the gift of an ugly winter coat as the weather is turning cold. It doesn’t suit me, but the alternative? To freeze.I found ways to be more comfortable in this body of mine. I negotiate with my body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria on a daily basis. Getting to a place of acceptance usually necessitates being less comfortable first. But what’s discomfort? After all, haven’t I spent the last two decades trying to build the body I wanted to live in? How many pull-ups have I done? How many squats? How many days without carbohydrates? In the last 20 years, I’ve run a distance greater than or equal to the Earth’s equator. If this was a fairy tale, I would have earned my wish long ago. And yet. I am 33 and still myself. If anything, every year I look less like the self I imagined I could become. Time is pulling me away from the bright, untouched body I used to call home.I’m losing my androgyny. But I still get called “sir.”⁂My father retired from the Navy in 2006, shortly after I graduated from college. There is a photo of us somewhere, sharing a cigar on the campus lawn. My diploma, in its dummy folder, lies in the grass. My father and I wear matching expressions of dissatisfaction. That year, he stopped working out. I haven’t been to the gym with him since. When I ask what he’s doing for fitness, he shrugs. He walks a lot, he says. He might get a weight set. He does push-ups when he remembers. He tells me he’s getting fat.There is no way he’s getting fat, I say. And he’s not. What he means is, I don’t need to be ready. When we meet up in Portland, he compliments my fitness. My strength is apparent, and I have new definition in my abdominal and back muscles. I’m trim now, built more like a boxer than someone who runs. “You should get back in the pool,” he said to me once. “You were a great swimmer. You had a movie star stroke.” Of all the things I was ready for — that was not one of them. I was not prepared for him to praise any little thing about me. I didn’t expect to have a father who noticed. But isn’t that the first part of love? Because once they’ve noticed, maybe they’ll start to see you — the you that is sleek, strong, and beautiful. Whole and perfect. Your true self and its name. The self that you built to be a container for all that love. "

Fisher, 60, had fatty buildup in the walls of her arteries and had taken multiple drugs before her death, the statement said. Officials were unable to conclusively determine the exact cause of her death, according to The Associated Press. The manner of death would be listed as “undetermined,” the coroner’s office said.The coroner’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for further details.Sleep apnea is a disorder in which breathing pauses for up to several minutes during sleep, according to the National Institutes of Health. Untreated, it can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity and diabetes. Fisher had a history of drug addiction and a heart condition.Fisher was stricken by a cardiac medical emergency during a flight from London to Los Angeles in December. The actress was hospitalized after landing and died less than a week later, on Dec. 27. Her mother, the actress Debbie Reynolds, died from a stroke the following day.Fisher rose to fame at age 20 after playing the original Princess Leia in the “Star Wars” film, “A New Hope.” She kept the role as the series continued in the early ‘80s. She most recently appeared in the franchise as Gen. Leia Organa in “The Force Awakens,” released in 2015.She was vocal about her history with bipolar disorder and drug addiction, which she detailed in a memoir and one-woman stage show, both titled, Wishful Drinking. Todd Fisher, Carrie Fisher’s brother, confirmed his mother’s death to Variety and told the magazine: “She wanted to be with Carrie.”"

But the women appear to be remaining hopeful that their accusations will one day lead to consequences for Cosby. At the trial, Constand was seen as a proxy for the 60 women who have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct by the comedian. Unlike others, Constand’s case was not precluded by statutes of limitations. A former employee of Cosby’s alma mater, she alleges that he drugged and sexually assaulted her at his home in 2004.In a statement issued jointly with her lawyers on Saturday, Constand thanked prosecutors and police who worked on her case. “We could not begin to name the many people who have worked so diligently in pursuit of justice, not only for Andrea but for all victims of sexual assault,” the statement read. It continued, “We are confident that these proceedings have given a voice to the many victims who felt powerless and silenced.”While prosecutors fought to call 13 other accusers to testify against Cosby, only one, Kelly Johnson, was permitted to do so. Still, several other accusers attended the trial. At its conclusion ― after 52 hours of deliberation left a jury of 12 in a deadlock ― they reacted with both sadness and continued determination. “A woman’s worth was on trial these past two weeks. Society has failed [Andrea Constand] and has failed us,” Cosby accuser Victoria Valentino said, per the Philadelphia Inquirer. “We’re devastated, but the work goes on.”Linda Kirkpatrick, another accuser, said that Cosby underestimated the dozens of women who have spoken out against him. “He didn’t know we are seeds … uncovering the rape culture in this country,” Kirkpatrick said.Jewel Allison, yet another accuser, stated outside the courthouse, as church bells tolled, “I think God is watching all of us,” NBC News reported.Allison doesn’t think the mistrial is the win for Cosby that his spokesperson has declared it to be. “He walked out but the bars were all around him,” she said. “He’s mobile, but the jail goes with him wherever he goes.”Valentino, Kirkpatrick and Allison all accuse Cosby of drugging and raping them. Their stories are joined by numerous others that, together, “paint a picture of a serial and methodical sexual predator who used his celebrity to exploit women,” HuffPost’s Emma Grey writes.Gloria Allred, a feminist lawyer who counts dozens of Cosby’s accusers among her clients, issued a warning to the comedian.“It’s too early to celebrate, Mr. Cosby,” Allred said at a press conference after the mistrial announcement. “Round two might be just around the corner. And this time, justice may prevail.”On behalf of Andrea Constand and ourselves, we would like to thank the dedicated individuals of the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office in particular Kevin Steele, Kristen Feden and Stewart Ryan and the many police officers and detectives who worked on this case, in particular Rich Schaffer, Jim Reape and Mike Shade. We wish to thank the Honorable Risa Vetri Ferman, who authorized the prosecution. We could not begin to name the many people who have worked so diligently in pursuit of justice, not only for Andrea but for all victims of sexual assault."

And now the Rhode Island teacher of the year’s bold stand for LGBTQ rights has gotten global attention after the image went viral on Facebook.Giannopoulos, who teaches 11th and 12th graders at Beacon Charter High School for the Arts in Woonsocket, visited the White House with other teacher of the year winners in April. He received the photo of his moment with Trump this week and immediately posted it to Facebook.Trump has previously pledged to protect LGBTQ citizens, but members of the community have expressed concern that his administration is rolling back their civil rights in areas such as education.Giannopoulos said he wore the pin “to represent my gratitude for the LGBTQ community that has taught me to be proud, bold, and empowered by my identity — even when circumstances make that difficult.” He brought the fan that day to “celebrate the joy and freedom of gender nonconformity.” “When I met the president as Rhode Island’s state teacher of the year, I did not know what to expect,” he wrote in the Facebook post. “After a lengthy security process, we were welcomed into the Roosevelt Room where we each met Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Shortly thereafter, we walked into the Oval Office. The man seated at the desk read prepared remarks from a sheet of paper and made some comments about CEOs and which states he ‘loved,’ based on electoral votes that he had secured. He did not rise from his seat to present the national teacher of the year with her much-deserved award, nor did he allow her to speak.”He wanted to speak to the president, but none of the teachers got the chance.The teacher had wanted to tell Trump that “queer lives matter and anti-LGBTQ policies have a body count.” He also wanted to tell the president how the LGBTQ community is hurt by “politicians callously attacking our right to love or merely exist,” Giannopoulos added.But he revealed to NPR that Trump was happy for him to pose with the fan for the official photo. “Absolutely go for it,” he recalled the president saying. Trump said that he looked “very stylish” with his fan as the teachers gathered around the president, Giannopoulos told Yahoo.Giannopoulos said when he thinks of the day he met the president, he “will not remember the person seated at the desk.” He’ll remember the students he has taught and the other teachers with him that day, Giannopoulos added ―including one who presented Trump with letters from her refugee student, “pleading with him to hear their voices.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article suggested incorrectly that Trump was unaware the teacher wanted to pose with the fan."
38,HEALTHY LIVING,Six Toxic Beliefs That Will Ruin Your Career,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/six-toxic-beliefs-that-will-ruin-your-career_us_59413a6de4b04c03fa261709,These ideas can place a huge blockade between you and your career ambitions.,2017-06-17,<p>Dr. Travis Bradberry reveals the six beliefs that invariably hold people back and provides bullet-proof strategies to ensure you don't succumb to them.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59413a8216000026001161e8.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is nothing wrong with making a mistake. It's what you say to yourself after you mess up that matters. Your self-talk (the thoughts you have about your feelings) can either magnify the negativity or help you turn that misstep into something productive.Negative self-talk is unrealistic, unnecessary, and self-defeating. It sends you into a downward emotional spiral that is difficult to pull out of.All self-talk is driven by important beliefs that you hold about yourself. It plays an understated but powerful role in success because it can both spur you forward to achieve your goals and hold you back.As Henry Ford said, “He who believes he can and he who believes he cannot are both correct.”TalentSmart has tested the emotional intelligence (EQ) of more than a million people and found that 90% of top performers are high in EQ. These successful, high EQ individuals possess an important skill—the ability to recognize and control negative self-talk so that it doesn't prevent them from reaching their full potential. This is something many of them learned in emotional intelligence training.These successful people earn an average of $28,000 more annually than their low EQ peers, get promoted more often, and receive higher marks on performance evaluations. The link between EQ and earnings is so direct that every point increase in EQ adds $1,300 to an annual salary.When it comes to self-talk, we've discovered six common, yet toxic, beliefs that hold people back more than any others. Be mindful of your tendencies to succumb to these beliefs, so that they don't derail your career:Toxic Belief #1: Perfection = SuccessHuman beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you're always left with a nagging sense of failure, and end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish, instead of enjoying what you were able to achieve.Toxic Belief #2: My Destiny is PredeterminedFar too many people succumb to the highly irrational idea that they are destined to succeed or fail. Make no mistake about it, your destiny is in your own hands, and blaming multiple successes or failures on forces beyond your control is nothing more than a cop out. Sometimes life will deal you difficult cards to play, and others times you'll be holding aces. Your willingness to give your all in playing any hand you're holding determines your ultimate success or failure in life.Toxic Belief #3: I “Always” or “Never” Do ThatThere isn't anything in life that you always or never do. You may do something a lot or not do something enough, but framing your behavior in terms of “always” or “never” is a form of self-pity. It makes you believe that you have no control of yourself and will never change. Don't succumb to it.Toxic Belief #4: I Succeed When Others Approve of MeRegardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain⎯you're never as good or bad as they say you are. It's impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, but you can take people's opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what people think about you, your self-worth comes only from within.Toxic Belief #5: My Past = My FutureRepeated failures can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you'll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, these failures result from taking risks and trying to achieve something that isn't easy. Just remember that success lies in your ability to rise in the face of failure. Anything worth achieving is going to require you to take some risks, and you can't allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed.Toxic Belief #6: My Emotions = RealityIf you've read Emotional Intelligence 2.0, you know how to take an objective look at your feelings and separate fact from fiction. If not, you might want to read it. Otherwise, your emotions will continue to skew your sense of reality, making you vulnerable to the negative self-talk that can hold you back from achieving your full potential."

Its population has plummeted by more than 97 percent in less than a century. Fewer than 25,000 breeding pairs are estimated to remain on Earth, and experts say the endangered bird could be extinct in just 10 years.But the penguins’ demise is not inevitable, says the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, an organization that has undertaken efforts to pull the species back from the brink. The penguin, under threat from climate change, overfishing and other human actions, just needs a helping hand.Thanks to the generosity of thousands on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter this month, it seems many of the warm weather penguins, found mostly in South Africa and Namibia, are soon going to get just that ― in the form of thousands of penguin homes. AZA launched a Kickstarter campaign in May to raise funds for their “Invest in the Nest” project, an initiative aimed at creating and installing artificial nests for African penguins in the wild. The campaign’s last day is Friday, but it’s already fully funded — with more than $188,000 donated thus far by more than 2,000 people.Among the pledge rewards on offer: penguin T-shirts and totes, as well as “original penguin paintings” created by African penguins themselves.A lack of proper nesting space has posed a major threat to African penguin populations. As AZA explained on the Kickstarter campaign page, African penguins used to build their nests in thick layers of guano, or bird excrement, but guano was over-harvested by humans over many decades, leaving the penguins “without a safe place to make their homes.”Rob Vernon, senior vice president of communications for AZA, described seeing the penguins on South Africa’s Robben Island nesting under “discarded rubbish and inside abandoned buildings” because of a lack of guano. “African penguins instinctively look for nesting sites that are under cover to protect the chicks from predators like gulls and from hot sun and heavy rain,” he told HuffPost in an email Thursday.“Improving chick survival is an important first step in making a difference to the long term survival of the species,” Vernon added. “Nest failure is one of the reasons the population has continued to decline.” To address this need, scientists have been developing artificial nests in which the penguins can lay their eggs and raise their families. Some nests have already been introduced to African penguin colonies, but according to Vernon, the ones used so far haven’t been the most ideal. “The old-style nests overheated and were abandoned or caused chick mortality,” he said. “Some scientists think they caused more harm than good.” Experts at AZA have thus been working to develop an improved version ― something they believe they’ve now achieved. “The new artificial nests ... are designed to provide appropriate internal temperature and humidity conditions [that] will give the breeding penguins a much better chance to keep their chicks alive through the first 30 days when the chicks remain inside the nests for protection,” Vernon said. “If the chicks can survive that critical period, their chances of fledging [leaving the nest after acquiring their feathers] are greatly improved.”The artificial nests, which cost about $100 each to make, are molded by hand and created from a material similar to hardened ceramic. Vernon said the nests will be undergoing further testing before being introduced in the wild on a large scale.But thanks to Kickstarter, he said, thousands of penguins will soon have a safe place to call home.“Because the project is fully funded and then some, we anticipate building and installing over 2,000 artificial nests over the next year for African penguins in colonies in South Africa and Namibia,” Vernon said. “That means homes for 2,000 penguin families that otherwise wouldn’t have happened.”Watch the video below to learn more about the Kickstarter campaign, or visit the campaign page here.

40,POLITICS,Saudi Arabia Gains An Unlikely GOP Critic,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-gains-an-unlikely-gop-critic_us_59440009e4b06bb7d272b262,Sen. Todd Young of Indiana is a rare mainstream GOP voice in the growing chorus criticizing the U.S.-supported Saudi campaign in Yemen.,2017-06-16,"More than 2 million children are acutely malnourished in Yemen, according to the United Nations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594420bb1600002100116912.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Indiana is one of a handful of states with bipartisan representation in the U.S. Senate. Earlier this week, one of its senators voted for the first portion of President Donald Trump’s much-publicized arms deal with Saudi Arabia.It wasn’t the Republican.Freshman lawmaker Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) has tried to use his influence so far in the Senate, including his role on the foreign relations committee, to urge the Saudis to be less brutal in their bloody U.S.-backed fight against pro-Iran rebels in Yemen ― all the while respecting their decades-long partnership with Washington and condemning Iranian adventurism. In doing so, he’s modeled a new kind of humanitarian advocacy on the GOP side of the aisle, signaling that compassionate conservative internationalism can survive in the age of Trump. He’s also boosting the rising wave of mainstream bipartisan skepticism toward Saudi Arabia associated with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and others.On Tuesday, Young became one of only four Republicans to vote against Trump’s plan to sell the Saudis more than $500 million worth of precision-guided munitions to be used in Yemen. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chair of the foreign relations committee, blasted opponents of the sale, saying it was a case of “cutting your nose off to spite your face”; top Republicans argued that the precision-guided weapons would actually help the Saudis do less harm. (Democratic Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and four other conservative Democrats also broke with their party leaders to vote in favor of the sale. Opposition to the deal reached a striking level: Nearly half the Senate voted against it.)Two of the other GOP votes against the sale came from familiar critics of U.S. foreign policy: Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah). The third was from Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who also voted to block a sale to the Saudis last fall. Young’s decision, activists told HuffPost, was the most notable. It’s difficult to write off the former Marine’s critique of the Saudi-led war as the product of an isolationist bent or ties to a blue-leaning state, and he’s no outlier in the GOP ― he’s a former House member with a conservative record. One activist working on whipping votes against the deal told HuffPost that Young’s move was expected to attract far greater GOP opposition, particularly if the vote had been delayed slightly longer. The activist spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations over the vote with Hill staffers.That hope wasn’t borne out, not least because the vote was seen as a pivotal early congressional judgment on the new Republican administration’s foreign policy. But in a HuffPost interview, Young suggested the matter is far from settled. He remains concerned by the controversial war and wants lawmakers to weigh in on it again, he said.”When I campaigned for the United States Senate, one of the things that I told Hoosiers is, it is essential that Congress doesn’t defer and delegate our foreign policy responsibilities to the next president, whoever that president is,” the senator said. “I meant it. I still mean it.”Young, along with Murphy and Paul, is pushing a measure to place humanitarian conditions on future arms sales to the Saudis. The proposal will likely gain attention later in the year as Trump decides on and notifies Congress about the various elements of his still largely theoretical arms agreement with the kingdom.Young says he has already identified the arguments that work with Republicans considering the issue.“This is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Roughly 20 million Yemenis are suffering from a lack of food, are near starvation, or require immediate medical attention. ... That fact alone is really compelling, but when I share with a number of others the national security implications of this humanitarian situation, that really I think caught their interest,” he said. “If you end up starving people through limiting food shipments, if you prevent them from getting access to essential medical supplies, then vulnerable people are more likely to align with extremist elements like the Iranians.”A rapidly escalating cholera outbreak is the latest of Yemen’s many woes. Young and other observers believe the Saudi-led coalition could take immediate steps to reduce the suffering.In messages since early this year, the senator has urged Saudi Arabia to explain its rationale for actions like delaying food shipments and preventing the delivery of U.S.-supplied cranes to an essential port, he told HuffPost.“I never received any sort of strong answers from the Saudis. In fact, oftentimes they outright ignored my concerns,” Young said. Their chief partner in the coalition, the United Arab Emirates, and the Trump administration have been far more receptive, he added, but progress seems stalled because of Riyadh.“I would anticipate moving forward, we’re going to have a more constructive dialogue, because I do value the partnership we have with the Saudis,” Young said.The Tuesday vote was just the latest volley in the campaign to change the Saudis’ internationally criticized, U.S.-supported behavior. Activists now see Young as a reliable ally. “Senator Young has been a tireless advocate for alleviating Yemen’s humanitarian suffering because he understands the national security implications in allowing this situation to worsen and fester ... he voted this week to send the message that US support is not unconditional,” Kate Kizer of the nonprofit Yemen Peace Project told HuffPost in a Friday message. Advocates believe the level of on-the-record opposition will help war-weary U.S. officials demand that the Saudis focus less on military actions and more on negotiations.In Yemen and other nations facing mass hunger ― notably Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan ― such diplomatic agreements that help people in need should be a U.S. goal, Young said. He struck a very different tone from a GOP president who has suggested the U.S. should be less generous abroad, use might as much as possible and see radical extremism as a consequence of Muslim identity, not of deprivation.With Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member of the foreign relations committee, Young has co-sponsored a resolution urging the State Department to begin what he calls a “diplomatic surge” to address four famines prioritized by the United Nations and international aid groups. Getting that passed soon is his next focus ― which means Yemen, and the U.S.-Saudi relationship, remains on his radar.“We should do whatever we can in each of these four instances to try and get the aid to those who need it and therefore stabilize countries that could become unstable … and harbor terrorist threats,” Young told HuffPost. “Yemen is the lowest-hanging fruit, if you will ― the best opportunity to get some things done.” "

There are currently about 8,400 U.S. troops officially stationed in Afghanistan and an additional 2,000 not included in official tallies.The AP reports the decision could be announced as soon as next week, and the new troops would mostly be assigned to train Afghan forces.The Pentagon refuted the AP report in a statement to Reuters late Thursday, saying “no decisions have been made” regarding troop numbers.“We are not winning in Afghanistan right now,” Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee this week. “And we will correct this as soon as possible.”In his testimony, Mattis also said the Taliban were “surging” in the country, according to Reuters.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, lashed out at the defense secretary earlier this week over the White House’s handling of the now 15-year war in the country, declaring there were “problems within this administration.”“All I can tell you is that, unless we get a strategy from you, you’re going to get a strategy from us,” McCain told Mattis during the hearing, according to media accounts. “We want a strategy. I don’t think that’s a hell of a lot to ask.”Following a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, McCain later said the situation was “finally moving forward,” The Hill reported.Earlier this year, Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told Congress he needed a “few thousand” additional troops to overcome what he described as a “stalemate.” The New York Times notes the president rarely discussed the issue during the campaign and said, despite any increase in deployment, which “would cost billions of dollars, ... there is no guarantee of a clear win.”At the height of the conflict in Afghanistan in 2011, the U.S. had 100,000 troops in the country. President Barack Obama said he would pull all remaining troops from the field in 2014, but then announced a policy reversal a year later that left the current troop numbers in the country to this point.“While America’s combat mission in Afghanistan may be over, our commitment to Afghanistan and its people endures,” Obama said in 2015. “I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as safe haven for terrorists to attack our nation again.”The Times this month said six American soldiers have been killed in the country this year, five of whom may have been killed by their own side."
42,POLITICS,Coal Market Set To Collapse Worldwide By 2040 As Solar And Wind Dominate,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coal-power_us_59441b0ae4b01eab7a2d6f48,But the shift may not happen quickly enough to avert the worst effects of climate change.,2017-06-16,A chart from Bloomberg New Energy Finance's report shows fossil fuels declining as solar and wind soar. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59441bed15000021004e6c07.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Coal-fired power is on pace to collapse in the United States and Europe over the next two decades, and will peak worldwide in nine years, according to a long-term forecast released on Thursday. Solar and wind energy, meanwhile, will dominate over the next 23 years, comprising nearly three-quarters of the expected $10.2 trillion in new electricity investments. “This year’s report suggests that the greening of the world’s electricity system is unstoppable, thanks to rapidly falling costs for solar and wind power, and a growing role for batteries, including those in electric vehicles, in balancing supply and demand,” Seb Henbest, lead author of Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s 2017 New Energy Outlook report, said in a statement. As a result, carbon pollution from the power sector will reach its apex in 2026. By 2040, emissions are forecast to be 4 percent below 2016 levels. That prediction depends on a few things:The cost of installing wind turbines needs to fall. That seems likely. With offshore wind, which is booming in Europe, but only just starting in the Northeastern U.S., the analysis predicts prices will plummet 71 percent by 2040. Onshore wind costs, which have already dropped 30 percent over the past eight years, are expected to decline by an additional 47 percent on the same timeline as its seaborne sister sector.Batteries need to improve and become widespread. The market for lithium-ion batteries, like the ones that power Tesla’s electric vehicles, could be worth at least $239 billion by 2040, which would allow utility-scale renewable projects to compete with natural gas made cheap by the drilling process known as fracking. But utilities are just one part of the equation. Homeowners need to adopt batteries, too, which would serve a function similar to a household furnace. That market is on track to make up 57 percent of storage worldwide by 2040.China and India need to keep going green. The two rapidly developing Asian giants are on pace to make up a combined 39 percent of all energy investment over the next 23 years ― about $4 trillion. Of that, just under one-third will go to wind and solar each, and an additional 18 percent is likely to go to nuclear energy. A mere 10 percent is predicted to go to coal and gas.Even as President Donald Trump takes steps to increase coal use, the market isn’t likely to rebound in the U.S. Coal-fired power is expected to fall by 51 percent over the next two decades. In its place, gas-fired electricity will increase 22 percent, and renewables by a massive 169 percent. These are mostly hopeful predictions. They are based on assumptions about prices that are subject to change wildly in the coming decades. Like a long-term weather report, it’s impossible to take the energy forecast as certain. “You have to make assumptions about how technology progress in the coal sector is going to develop,” Steve Cicala, an economist at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, told HuffPost by phone. “Coal plants are getting more efficient over time, making it cheaper to burn coal.” Global warming ― driven by the influx of planet-warming emissions from burning fossil fuels, industrial farming and deforestation ― is accelerating at a rapid pace. The planet is currently on track to warm well past 3.6 degrees above pre-industrial levels ― the cap set by the now-embattled Paris climate agreement. Beyond that point, the catastrophic effects of rising sea levels, unstable climate and widespread drought could ravage human civilization, scientists predict. Waiting nearly a decade for emissions to decline from new electricity projects only makes the worst-case scenario more likely. “Any delay puts us in a more dire situation,” Deborah Bathke, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska’s National Drought Mitigation Center, told HuffPost. “The longer we delay action, the more likely we are to be at the higher end of where those scenarios are telling us we could be in the future.” "

After rescinding this guidance, Trump administration agencies sent a letter saying the issue should be decided at the local level.The Trump administration guidance calls on OCR investigators to look into situations in which schools failed to protect transgender students who face sex discrimination, harassment or different treatment based on sex stereotyping. It specifically mentions instances of harassment in which transgender students are called the wrong pronoun or name.However, groups that advocate for transgender students fear that the OCR is trying to shirk responsibility for protecting students against bathroom discrimination. Only one part of the instructions specifically mentions student bathrooms, in an example explaining that investigators should not dismiss an entire complaint because specific allegations have been rejected. Specifically, the instructions say that investigators should not reject gender harassment allegations in a complaint, even if they have dismissed allegations involving “denial of access to restrooms based on gender identity.”“They are hinting that they are not enforcing the law,” said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.While Keisling said her organization is still trying to figure out the exact legal ramifications of this memo, she “would not be surprised if this turns out for the worst.”A statement from the Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network expresses similar concern. “GLSEN calls on OCR to specify whether they will defend trans students’ access to safe and appropriate school facilities – regardless of where the student lives or what local protections may or may not exist. Forcing trans students to use restrooms that do not align with their gender identity puts those students at risk of harassment and violence,” GLSEN Executive Director Eliza Byard stated. Across the country, there have been a handful of high-profile lawsuits over whether or not students can use school bathrooms that are consistent with their gender identities. Groups that advocate for LGBTQ students met with Department of Education officials Friday morning in an off-the-record meeting. The Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment.Read the full guidance below:This is a developing story and will be updated."

My friends poked gentle fun at me: the Mountain State suffers a bad rap for poor health, and for the last six years in a row West Virginia came in dead last in a national self-reported survey of well-being. The state is also ravaged by an opioid addiction epidemic, far outpacing any other in overdose deaths. In 2015, for example, one West Virginian was dying of drugs every 12 hours, a staggering number for such a small state.So why did I move? Because West Virginia is a bright opportunity for me and many others to create meaningful change in health, including impacting the opioid epidemic. We can and will start something here that will echo across the country.My belief is that the same issues leading to the opioid epidemic are what drives the tremendous cost and disease burden of our country at large. The opioid epidemic is merely a symptom of a much larger crisis, one we as Americans must learn to solve: the crisis of isolation, despair and hopelessness.To begin to understand it, it helps to know a little bit about Dunbar’s Number. Robin Dunbar, an anthropologist, observed that the maximum number of people you can know well is 150. From an evolutionary standpoint, this makes perfect sense. Communities that are big enough to support their members yet small enough to be able to share food and other vital resources traditionally numbered anywhere from 100 to 200 members. And communities are crucial to our wellbeing: irrespective of genus, the most psychologically damaging experience any young creature, human or animal, can have is being separated from the group and abandoned to fend for itself. And yet, increasingly, more and more of us are, in a way, abandoned and afraid. Large and sheltering communities, the kind Dunbar imagined, have become a rarity, as the structures that once supported them—religious institutions, civic institutions, strong families—were weakened by a host of economic and sociological conditions. Social media and other technologies compound the problem by giving us an inflated sense of social connection, suggesting that we aren’t really isolated with so many friends or followers online. Moreover, much of the messaging we receive makes us feel vulnerable, envious or afraid, further impacting our sense of wellbeing. But the real ties that keep us safe, the ties of family and community and society, are increasingly looser and looser, which is why more and more Americans turn to drugs and other forms of escape. Isolation and despair, not opioids, is our true epidemic.There’s much science to support this assertion. Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who won the Nobel prize for economics, found that white middle-aged people that are 50 to 55 years old and have a high school education or less are suffering a death rate that rivals the peak of the AIDS epidemic. In contrast, almost every other socioeconomic group experienced enhanced life-spans over the same time period. They are dying of overdose, suicide and chronic liver disease, all hallmarks of addiction. Recently, these findings have been augmented to show that the underlying reason for this issue is despair and hopelessness. Thus, it appears that how we see the world and our perception of our community status is critical for our health and our resilience to drugs and to disease. Which, truly, is an insight that should bring us much hope. A famous New Yorker article written by Atul Gawande, The Hot Spotters, (Jan. 24, 2011) recounted the story of Dr. Jeffrey Brenner, an emergency room physician in Camden, N.J. He studied his hospital’s emergency room visits and was surprised to find that a very few patients were responsible for a majority of the hospital admissions. One patient had 324 hospital admissions. He was a morbidly obese man with substance abuse problems, and a lot of associated medical issues. It didn’t take a brilliant physician to see what was going on: at well over 500 pounds, the man had trouble moving around, and every time he fell, his first call was for an ambulance. The medical attention also provided him with some welcome social interaction, as he had no friends and was largely abandoned by his family. His primary problems, it turned out, were hopelessness and isolation. Determined to change all that, Dr. Brenner stepped in and did what physicians, sadly, infrequently have the time or the training to do these days—he listened to the patient. Slowly gaining the man’s trust, Dr. Brenner connected him with medical and social services, but most importantly cared about this man. Through this relationship of trust and connection, this man lost weight, exercised, overcame his addiction, and, most importantly, reconnected with his loved ones. The hospital visits stopped soon thereafter. Dr. Brenner was merely living out the old adage that argued that to care for a patient, you first must care about a patient. The answer to our opioid epidemic, then, is the same as the answer to our increasing health care spending and reduced health and lifespan of our population. It’s a very human and perceptional one. It is predicated on realizing that the problem is connected to our hard-wiring as humans to each other and to our survival. We need strong connections to others. We need a strong purpose. We need a mindset of gratitude. We need to realize that abundance and prosperity is in mindset, not in bank account. We need communities of love and safety. Building them will involve not only scientists and law enforcement officials and policy makers but every single one of us. That’s what I moved to West Virginia to help realize, and that’s what each of us must do in the places we call home."

My father brought me to Children’s Hospital in Boston",2017-06-16,<p><strong> Heroin was like the peak of an orgasm that lasted for hours.</strong> </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5943f6b11600002500116871.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was a breech birth ― feet first, my head got stuck in the birth canal. My father brought me to Children’s Hospital in Boston. The doctors diagnosed me with Cerebral Palsy. They told him that the loss of oxygen to my brain had destroyed a portion of the frontal lobe.But my father was a tough Irish Catholic, old-school warrior. He refused to listen to them. No son of his was going to be a cripple. He found a doctor that told him how he could take the place of my injured brain.Every day, he laid me on the floor and exercised my legs. The muscles in my right leg were all shrunken and twisted. His job was to straighten them. Back and forth, up and down, he stretched them until the heels of my feet evenly matched.My mother told me the sound of me screaming was so unbearable that the neighbors called the police. She said he couldn’t look at me. She told me how his tears made wet stains on my little T-shirt.For my 13th birthday, he threw me a party and allowed me to open every present but a large box neatly trimmed in wrapping paper. When everybody left, he marched me into the basement to open the box.A pair of boxing gloves.We put them on, and he beat me unmercifully. Each time I tried to get up, he’d knock me down. I begged him to stop. Instead, he picked a target on my face, never once missing the bull’s eye. When I collapsed, he cradled me and said, “I’d cut off my right arm if that would make you whole.”My father believed that beating me that day was all about getting me ready for the real world. He told me I was a man at 13 years old and how things for me, “a cripple,” would be extra tough.But listen, he wasn’t a monster. That same year, I was not picked for Little League Baseball. At tryouts, everybody laughed. My right leg awkwardly slanted inward when I ran. My father heard their snickers. On the ride home, he held my hand, and we cried together.Two weeks later, my father started the Shedd Park Minor League. He raised money, bought uniforms, enlisted coaches, acquired permits, and every kid played.In high school, I became a football star. One Saturday afternoon, I intercepted a pass and headed for the end zone. At the five-yard line, I looked around to see if anybody was chasing me, nobody... well, except my father running full speed along the sidelines.My father died in my arms. That night, I shot my first bag of heroin. I took heroin just once, and after that first shot, heroin took me any place it wanted to. I destroyed everything in my path. I robbed family, friends, anyone, no exceptions. Nothing I said was the truth.Heroin was like the peak of an orgasm that lasted for hours. The euphoria allowed me to escape the movie playing inside my brain. My father dying inches from my face, reliving it over and over, his last tear cutting a line down his cheek. His blood-red eyes and a freakish blend of purple-blue over his gray-white skin.I beat heroin addiction. I did it cold-turkey, no methadone, no suboxone. Pure hell. Just sheer will and determination, something my dad had beat into me. A fire in my soul that was a carefully blended concoction of hate and love.In a strange twist or irony, it was my father’s sense of failure that saved me. He could never allow his son to be labeled “a cripple.” All those kids laughing at me as I ran to first base or ran with a football was my father’s guilt that he had somehow failed me.I failed my children. I failed to provide them a safe childhood absent of drugs, alcohol, and madness. I am guilty for their lack of success as they became adults. That sense of failure empowers me as a national activist in the battle to end the current heroin epidemic.Tragically, failure compels many fathers.Tim Grover, a successful businessman with companies in 14 states, received word that his daughter Megan had died from an accidental overdose of heroin on December 30, 2014. She was just 26 and had been waiting for a bed in a treatment center.Grover pulled his car over to the side of the road and wept uncontrollably. He had failed to protect Megan. On January 6, 2015, the day after Megan’s funeral, Tim Grover closed on a property with plans to open up an opioid treatment facility for women. Megan’s House opened its doors eight months later.Tim Grover’s sense of failure has empowered him to become one of the top activists in Massachusetts. His mission is simple; he will not fail another young woman in desperate need of heroin recovery.Ironically, at the age of 35, a neurosurgeon in San Jose, California, told me I didn’t have cerebral palsy. He explained how the doctor’s forceps at birth had damaged the frontal lobe of my brain.My father never knew the truth. However, one thing is clear: my father gave me the power to overcome heroin addiction.So this Father’s Day, just like every Father’s Day, I’ll open my eyes, look to the sky and whisper, “I love you, Daddy.”Ritchie Farrell is the author of I AM A HEROIN ADDICT.Follow Ritchie Farrell on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ritchiefarrell1Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

But thus far, Trump’s protectionist talk has been more bark than bite ― and now big businesses with a key stake in the status quo are fighting to keep it that way. Most recently, leading Asian and European carmakers, most of whom have large U.S. workforces, released a video advertisement touting their contributions to the U.S. economy that makes the case for keeping international trade barriers low.The minute-long ad by the Association of Global Automakers, a trade group that represents foreign car companies, shows footage of workers producing cars at facilities for several of the manufacturers ― Toyota, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, Volkswagon, Subaru and Nissan ― as a narrator extols the accomplishments of the auto manufacturers. What’s more, it explicitly emulates the famous “Morning in America” television spot from former Republican President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 re-election campaign. “It’s morning again ― for auto manufacturing in America,” the narrator begins, with the music from Reagan’s original ad in the background.The conceit of the ad is that “international” carmakers, as the Association of Global Automakers calls its member companies with headquarters in non-American locales, are now as integral a part of the American landscape as the suburban families in Reagan’s ad. The ad debuted during NBC’s “Meet the Press” earlier this month. The AGA declined to say how large of an ad buy it was making other than by noting it is the largest purchase in the trade group’s history. To accompany the ad, the trade group erected a website, HereForAmerica.com, which features more of the data demonstrating the importance of foreign automakers in the United States economy. Foreign carmakers now produce 47 percent of the cars made in the United States ― up from 1 percent in 1979, according to the AGA’s analysis of its members’ data available on the new site. As a result, those German, Swedish, Japanese and South Korean companies with U.S. production plants directly employ 130,000 workers, the trade association states. Any trade policies that result in more limited market access for foreign carmakers either directly or as a result of foreign retaliation for U.S. actions, the ad implies, will ultimately hurt Americans most.“Thanks to trade and open markets, our auto industry is stronger, prouder and better than ever before,” the video concludes as auto workers of diverse backgrounds raise the American flag up the pole at the foreign carmakers’ U.S. plants. “Why would we ever want to return to a time of less competition and less choice for consumers?”Notwithstanding foreign carmakers’ employment of American workers, their critics lament that they have largely fought off unionization efforts and deliberately located most of their facilities in the American South, where laws and political culture are more hostile to union formation. Unionized auto manufacturing jobs at American carmakers in the Midwest typically offer higher pay and safer working conditions than their non-union counterparts in the South. When asked about this critique, John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers, said, “International auto manufacturers have invested billions in the United States to create high-paying, high-tech jobs all across the country.”In other respects, foreign carmakers are promoting a trade agenda that is similar to that of their American competitors: protecting access to international labor and supply chains in Mexico and Canada enabled by the North American Free Trade Agreement. “NAFTA has been an absolute success story for the U.S. auto industry. There’s just no question about that,” Bozzella said.What is less clear is whether carmakers, domestic and foreign alike, support NAFTA for reasons that American workers would consider positive. Thanks to the 1994 accord, U.S.-based carmakers have easier access to Canadian and Mexican consumer markets, and parts suppliers elsewhere in North America.But in practice, it has also increased the offshoring of manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where labor costs and regulations are dramatically lower. Mexico exported $75 billion worth of vehicles to the U.S. in 2016, compared with $21 billion in vehicles the U.S. exported to Mexico, according to the office of the United States Trade Representative.Of course, experts disagree about the net employment effects of this bilateral trade, let alone its benefits for consumers. Some 17 percent of the value of Mexican automotive exports to the U.S. comes from components, chemicals and services that originated in the United States, according to an estimate by the economic think tank Bruegel.The type of NAFTA reform that Bozzella said the AGA supports involves “modernization and revitalization,” suggesting it would back changes to the agreement removing remaining barriers to trade, particularly in areas of the economy that did not yet exist when NAFTA was brokered. Representatives of two major industries that benefit from NAFTA ― corn growers and oil producers ― hammered home a similar message at a May 31 event on NAFTA reform featuring Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C.“It works very well for us right now. You can always strengthen an agreement,” said Chip Bowling, chairman of the National Corn Growers Association in remarks before Ross spoke.Ross did his best to reassure big business interests like Bowling’s ― that fear NAFTA reforms that could restrict access to foreign goods or markets ― that the Trump administration is prioritizing changes that are more likely to help them.Bringing NAFTA up to speed with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have created intellectual property protections and removed barriers to digital trade, would take precedence, Ross said. Mexico and Canada already agreed to the TPP, a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade agreement that Trump campaigned against and formally withdrew the U.S. from shortly after taking office.“There were a number of concessions to NAFTA countries made in connection with the TPP. And so we would view those as a starting point for discussion,” he said.That is likely a relief to pro-NAFTA elements of big business, but it is alarming to progressive trade skeptics who had hoped that trade reforms aimed at saving American jobs would be an area of common interest with the Trump administration. Job-saving reforms would entail making it harder to offshore production to Mexico, rather than extending its open trade channels to other sectors of the economy.Leading liberal experts like Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, are already concerned that the Trump administration is content to merely turbo-charge NAFTA under the guise of “repairing” it, all while hoping that voters eager for change of any kind won’t know the difference.“They’d take the pieces of TPP that Mexico, the U.S. and Canada had agreed to and enact them bit by bit through the NAFTA renegotiation,” Wallach warned in April."

Ron English, Jenna Morello, Lauren YS, Stickymonger and Kimyon333 are among the artists contributing to the project, which collapses the space between renegade, guerrilla artwork and corporate design. “What I find so entertaining is this contradiction of terms on all levels,” creative producer Robert Marcucci said in a statement. “And the fact that it is nestled in this very corporate structure gives it the attention I think it deserves ― a proper look at a contemporary art movement born out of a extremely stressed fabric of modern society, that is evolving more and more each day, blending various styles of art and sending a message out to larger audiences.”Marcucci explained that the recruited artists had free rein to create whatever they so pleased in the space of the open 69th floor, though they were encouraged to seek inspiration from New York City, as well as the memory of 9/11 and ideas of rebirth, strength and patriotism. The project, dubbed an “art world in the sky,” captures the strange juxtaposition of corporate wealth and street energy that is unique to New York City. See some of the work below.

Trump Presidential Twitter Library.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5943de141600002200116820.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Trevor Noah addressed a crowd while standing inside a recreation of the Oval Office with a Russian flag flanking him and an open golden toilet directly behind him.“Welcome to what I hope will become a place we live to remember for a very long time,” Noah said into a microphone. “The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library.”Thursday night, “The Daily Show” finally debuted their pop-up library that’s dedicated to Donald Trump’s tweets. In many ways, it’s like a typical presidential library, with immersive exhibits and placards adding context to historical artifacts. In other ways, it is not.“You can sit on a gold shitter!” “Daily Show” correspondent Jordan Klepper explained to HuffPost at the event.One could only guess at whether this library would be hilarious, a disaster, or a hilarious disaster earlier this year when “The Daily Show” announced their plan. But it turned out to be arguably the most impressive satire of the current administration to date.Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, Seth Meyers and John Oliver are going to have to really consider their next move if they want the elusive Trump mockery crown. Noah and “The Daily Show” crew have vanquished, destroyed, eviscerated, ethered and slammed — insert other destructive verbs here — the president with this ridiculous library.This Trump Twitter library is right around the corner from Trump Tower in Manhattan, but somehow neither Klepper nor fellow correspondent Hasan Minhaj have ever been inside the latter.“How would an American version of Jafar live? That’s probably the inside of Trump Tower, in my mind,” Minhaj guessed to HuffPost about what the president’s former residence is like. Despite never stepping foot in Trump Tower, “The Daily Show” crew certainly hopes the president stops by their pop-up over the weekend. The library didn’t appear to have any books, but has plenty of artworks, interactive activities and small Easter eggs to discover. A large television screen features a live update of Trump’s Twitter. If he tweets during the time the library is open this weekend, a “bing bing bong bong, bing bing, bong bong” alarm, as Noah described, will go off.The stated goal of the library ― besides jokes ― is to put the president’s tweets into a historical context. “I think over time, they will lose context,” said Noah during his speech in front of the golden toilet. “And people will assume that they’re misinterpreting them. They will say, ‘Surely, that was not what the president wrote back in that day, maybe language has changed.’ They will then find ways to distill them and turn them into coherent language, which is partly why we are holding this beautiful Twitter library experience ― because we do not wish for that to take place.”Noah continued, saying the president was at his “best when experienced in his purest form.”“That’s what this library is about,” he continued. “We are living in history, people.

He said he was a “street fighter” who used “certain harsh terms.”He did not mention the terms, but he has called President Barack Obama a “subhuman mongrel” and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a “worthless bitch,” among other things. But he said he plans to watch himself now. “At the tender age of 69, my wife has convinced me that I just can’t use those harsh terms. I cannot, and I will not,” he said, adding: “And I encourage even my friends/enemies on the left in the Democrat and liberal world that we have got to be civil to each other, that the whole world is watching America, where you have the God-given right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and we have got to be more respectful to the other side.” His comments came one day after an attacker opened fire on Republicans practicing for a baseball game. Six people were injured ― including two members of Congress ― and the gunman was killed in the attack in Alexandria, Virginia. Nugent said that people really are angry and that it’s “crazy” that “people on the left don’t want secure borders.” But he said he wanted civil discourse over this and other issues.“I’m going to take a deep breath, and I’m going to back it down, and if it gets fiery, if it gets hateful, I’m going away,” he said. “I’m not going to engage in that kind of hateful rhetoric anymore.”Nugent said he wouldn’t make excuses for his “wild-ass comments” made while on stage but blamed it on the “adrenaline and intensity” when performing. He said he would be “feisty” and “passionate,” but added, “I will avoid anything that can be interpreted as condoning or referencing violence.”Nugent also claimed he’s never referenced violence, but Williams wouldn’t let that one slide.“Well, come on, Ted,” she chided. “I think some people might have taken it that way for sure. Yeah.”  During a 2007 performance, Nugent held up what appeared to be two machine guns and said that Obama could “suck on my machine gun” and that Clinton could “ride one of these into the sunset.” He also drew the attention of the Secret Service in 2012 when he said he would be “dead or in jail by this time next year” if Obama got reelected. However, Nugent is now promising to turn down the volume on his rhetoric and called on others to do the same.“Here’s the battle cry for America: zero violence.”Listen to the full interview here: Earlier this year, Nugent joined former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Kid Rock on a visit to the White House, where they posed for a photo under Hillary Clinton’s portrait. Many found the image disrespectful, but it could have been worse: Nugent told The New York Times someone in the group suggested they pose with the middle finger extended.“I politely declined,” he was quoted as saying. “Let the juxtaposition speak for itself.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Nugent made his comments to ABC radio. In fact, he made his comments to 77 WABC radio, which is not owned by ABC."
52,POLITICS,Trump Will Add Cuba To List Of Obama Achievements He’s Taking Apart,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cuba-travel-trade-obama_us_59431899e4b06bb7d27218c4,A Miami speech is set for Friday to announce changes to the relaxation of tourism and trade rules.,2017-06-16,President Donald Trump is planning to partially reverse his predecessor's easing of travel and trade restrictions on Cuba.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594319c81600002200116728.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― To the list of things former President Barack Obama did that President Donald Trump is undoing, go ahead and add Cuba.Two and a half years ago, Obama, with great fanfare, announced an easing of the decades-long travel and trade restrictions on the island nation’s authoritarian regime, arguing that the policies had not worked and were only punishing ordinary Cubans.At a speech Friday afternoon in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood, Trump is expected to reverse at least some of Obama’s changes, despite public opinion nationally and even among Cuban-Americans that shows support for more ties with Cuba, not fewer.“I’ve never seen a coalition this broad and it have no influence,” said Marguerite Rose Jiménez, who helped craft the Obama policy at his Department of Commerce and is now with the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group. “This is not a move that’s supported by a majority of the Cuban-American community.”But it is supported by the veterans of the failed 1961 CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro. The group endorsed Trump last fall, becoming one of the few Latino organizations to support the Republican nominee.“The president was honored and humbled,” said a senior administration official who, along with two other officials, explained the coming policy Thursday on the condition that their names would not be used. The official said that Trump promised the group he would restore tougher restrictions and that his actions fulfill that promise.Specifically, the changes to be announced Friday would eliminate a provision that Americans have used to visit Cuba on their own. They would also make it illegal for Americans to do business with entities controlled by the Cuban military or intelligence services. This would prohibit individuals from staying at state-owned hotels and would ban U.S. businesses from trading with state-controlled enterprises.“That would be our guiding principle,” said a second administration official, who added that the policy would be lifted if Cuban President Raúl Castro institutes reforms including free elections and the release of political prisoners.Trump’s new policy will not prevent U.S. travelers from bringing back Cuban rum and cigars or stop airlines and cruise ships from offering routine service. It would also not restore the immigration advantage Cuban refugees have had for decades if they managed to reach dry land in the United States ― the “wet foot, dry foot” policy.Nor will Trump’s policy restrict visits by Cuban-Americans to their relatives or reverse the reopening of formal diplomatic ties, the second official said. “You can’t put the genie back in the bottle 100 percent,” the official said.The crackdown on travel will end what had become an easy way for Americans to visit Cuba: Declare an individual “people-to-people” educational exchange. A third administration official said group trips will still be permitted for cultural visits and charitable efforts but that the crackdown would make sure visitors are actually fostering closer ties with the Cuban people “and not just drinking daiquiris on the beach.”Supporters of Obama’s changes, while grateful Trump does not plan to reverse everything Obama did, nevertheless criticized the policy as a step in the wrong direction. Jiménez said that the way the Cuban economy is structured, with so many enterprises tied to the military, blocking trade with entities connected to the Cuban military would basically block trade, period.“That’s a backdoor way of effectively stifling all commerce,” she said.Toward the end of his campaign last year, Trump promised to help the people of Cuba stand up to their government and to make a “good deal” with Castro to replace the bad one he said Obama had made.Little Havana is home to much of the one constituency that continues to favor a hard line toward Cuba: the older generation of refugees who left in the 1960s and ’70s following Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution overthrowing the U.S.-backed dictator.That generation’s children and grandchildren are much more inclined to support Obama’s moves to increase tourism and trade opportunities with the island as a way of building a society that will bring democratic and human rights reforms.A national poll of Cuban-Americans at the time Obama’s policies were announced in December 2014 showed 47 percent to 39 percent support for easing sanctions. Four months later, support had grown to 56 percent to 35 percent.One prominent Cuban dissident, though, argued that, while he had initially supported Obama’s new policy, he has concluded that it is not working.“Reality has proved otherwise,” wrote José Daniel Ferrer García, general coordinator of the Cuban Patriotic Union, in an open letter to Trump. “Castro’s tyranny has been benefiting from the good will of the US government without giving up a bit in their repressive attitude.”Arrayed against Ferrer and Little Havana’s community of hard-line emigres are a host of human rights and pro-engagement groups. The U.S. business community has also long supported ending the sanctions because of the opportunities presented by a new commercial market so close to Miami.“All the business entities have made their views known to the administration,” said Pedro Freyre, a Miami lawyer who has worked with a number of clients with interests in Cuba, including a handful of cruise lines.Polling also shows overwhelming support in the general public for easing the restrictions. In a recent Morning Consult poll conducted for Engage Cuba, 65 percent of voters nationally support the Obama policy, while only 18 percent oppose it.Engage Cuba’s Madeleine Russak acknowledged an enthusiasm gap in those numbers, however. Those who support the more relaxed rules don’t feel that strongly about it, while the pro-embargo side is passionate, she said.Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who like many Republicans from rural states supports lifting restrictions that make it harder to export agricultural products to Cuba, said Trump has not been well-served by listening to a small group of pro-embargo lawmakers.“We’re on the wrong side of history when it comes to this,” Emmer said.Trump, like many Republicans, promised his supporters to undo much of what Obama was able to accomplish over two terms. Trump is pushing legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature achievement. He is working to scrap Obama’s Clean Power Plan to restrict carbon emissions, trying to undo workplace rules, repeal banking regulations and is withdrawing the United States from a near-unanimous international agreement to combat climate change."

But that’s what happened recently when Connecticut,2017-06-16,<p>CT State Senator Edwin Gomes speaking at a coalition event.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5944352e15000026004e6c58.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You seldom see legislators tear up as they argue for a piece of legislation. But that’s what happened recently when Connecticut state senators made the case for a paid family and medical leave bill, leading with stories from their own lives. Sen. Catherine Osten talked about the agony of having been a single mother working two jobs without the time she needed to help her child heal after sexual molestation. Sen. Gary Winfield described what it meant that he was able to help his mother when she was dying. Others talked about caring for a grandparent or an ailing sibling. They seemed surprised and moved by the power of their colleagues’ remarks. Sen. Edwin Gomes noted that providing care is “the most valuable thing [people] can do for their families because that’s what keeps families together.” We need to be sure that any paid leave plan does not exclude all the loved ones these legislators described. A broken hip, heart attack, cancer – life happens to those we love and to ourselves. As Sen. Winfield put it, ""It’s a story about all of us.”Caring for a loved one or a personal illness, in fact, makes up more than three-quarters of the leaves people take under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) —the law that guarantees unpaid leave. As a nation, we need to value all kinds of care and all kinds of families. The FMLA itself has a narrow definition of family as only your own parents, your married spouse and your children; we need one that recognizes our nation’s wide diversity of families. The plan must be comprehensive in order to cover everyone who will pay into the program. It should take into account the growing numbers of seniors who require care, the needs of military families, and the boost to family stability, health and economic security when people are able to get adequate treatment for their own health. We also need a progressive wage replacement system, like the ones several states are now developing, to ensure the lowest-paid receive all or most of their pay so leave is a realistic option.Those in the trenches fighting for paid leave are heartened to see growing acknowledgment of the need for such a program, including among conservatives. Recently a diverse group of experts at the American Enterprise Institute and Brookings concluded that paid family and medical leave is “an issue whose time has come.” Like the coalitions in our network, the AEI-Brookings Paid Family Leave Working Group calls for leave that is gender-neutral and job protected and relies on a sustainable funding source. The Working Group sees the value of a social insurance program that pools small contributions, rejecting tax credits or existing state unemployment insurance funds as unreliable and inequitable sources of funding. Unfortunately, the plan they agreed to is limited only to parents of new children. As such, it excludes all the care situations described above. The narrow focus would also likely increase discrimination against women. Even though fathers are included, the ACLU has pointed out that employers will assume women are more likely to take parental leave and that could influence hiring and promotion. That’s why Congress made sure the FMLA was not only gender-neutral but included time for self-care. The ACLU notes Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s forceful argument in Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland: including self-care was intended “to blunt the force of stereotypes of women as primary caregivers by increasing the odds that men and women will invoke the . . . leave provisions in near-equal numbers.”While their report focuses on paid parental leave, the AEI-Brookings Paid Family Leave Working Group explicitly points to the need for paid time to care for a serious personal or family member’s illness and intends to research ways to include such leaves in a final plan. The majority of the group agrees that the minimal number of weeks of leave should be 12 rather than 8.We are confident that we can win bipartisan support for a program that meets our Triple A rating – accessible, affordable and adequate. We look forward to working with the AEI Brookings Working Group on the ways to get there. Because, as Connecticut State Senator Osten put it, “Our hearts are torn apart when we can’t be there for our families.”"

The blaze, at Grenfell Tower in the western part of the city, killed at least 17 people.May made a private visit to the scene on Thursday, but did not meet or speak with victims. The prime minister’s closed-off visit drew the ire of media and some residents of the apartment block, who accused her of not giving proper attention to the tragedy.May has ordered an investigation into the fire, the precise cause of which is unknown. Opposition Labor Party officials, victims and media have accused her government of ignoring longstanding issues around safety in public housing. May’s underwhelming response to the Grenfell Tower disaster is the latest in a series of public relations errors, which have given her political opponents an opening to argue that they are better able to connect with British citizens.Hours after May visited the area around Grenfell Tower, opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn made a similar trip with an emphasis on meeting with victims of the fire. Corbyn spoke to a woman helping with the search for a missing 12-year-old girl, met with emergency responders and pledged to community leaders that “the truth” about what led to the fire “must come out.”Labour Party officials also harshly criticized the government for failing to take appropriate measures to ensure safe conditions in public housing, following a series of similar fires at other apartment blocks in recent years. The party’s shadow housing minister said that the government must answer serious questions in the aftermath of Wednesday’s inferno.The incident follows May’s failed election gamble earlier this month, in which she attempted to shore up support for her ruling Conservative Party but ultimately lost more than a dozen seats in Parliament. The election result cast a pall over May’s leadership, and has left the Conservatives mired in talks to form a coalition government with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party.Much of the blame for the Conservatives’ poor performance has fallen on May, who critics say ran an ineffective campaign and failed to engage with voters. Opponents ripped into May for skipping a debate, and accused her of ignoring the public’s needs.A YouGov poll released Thursday shows that May’s favorability has plummeted since the vote. The survey, conducted June 11 and 12, puts her favorability almost on par with Corbyn’s before the election campaign. At the time, Corbyn was struggling with internal divisions in the Labour Party, and critics had accused him of failing to rally supporters to vote to remain in the European Union during the 2016 Brexit referendum.Now, however, Corbyn has seen his leadership position strengthened by electoral gains, and has been credited with turning out the country’s youth vote for Labour. As questions over Conservatives’ treatment of inequality and housing needs grow in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, Labour officials are seizing on some of May’s missteps as a way of gaining support."

The fire quickly engulfed the building, trapping residents on upper floors and burning out of control for a full day. Dozens of people were injured in the fire, and hundreds were displaced.The disaster has brought renewed focus on the state of public housing in Britain, as residents claim their warnings about unsafe conditions at the tower were ignored. Prominent politicians, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, are calling for answers. “We have to get to the bottom of this,” Corbyn said during a visit to the neighborhood. “The truth has got to come out, and it will.”Onlookers have contrasted Corbyn’s highly visible outreach following the fire, which included speaking at length with residents, with Prime Minister Theresa May’s private visit to the area. British media criticized May for failing to meet with victims, and Labour Party members have demanded that the government send a minister to answer questions on housing issues and the fire in Parliament.May vowed on Thursday that there would be an investigation into the fire, after London Mayor Sadiq Khan issued a statement calling for a full, independent inquiry.“The full scale of the tragedy is becoming clear and there are pressing questions, which demand urgent answers,” Khan said in his statement.Scotland Yard confirmed on Thursday that it had launched a criminal investigation into the incident.The precise cause of the Grenfell Tower fire is unclear, but similar incidents have occurred in other apartment blocks, including a 2009 blaze that killed six people, three of them children. The 2009 fire led to the block’s local London council pleading guilty to charges related to lack of safety at the apartment.There is already an ongoing debate in the United Kingdom over inequality and lack of resources in housing, which this week’s fire has put at the forefront of British politics. That Grenfell Tower is situated in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which contains some of the nation’s wealthiest neighborhoods, further highlights the divide."

Get cover!’” Williams said.Williams also took cover in the dugout, and described how Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) used his belt to create a tourniquet to stem Barth’s bleeding, with the help of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).Williams recalled that lawmakers and staffers also made an extra effort to protect the 10-year-old son of Rep.

Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) expressed “regret” for suggesting that Democratic rhetoric about President Donald Trump had inspired a gunman to target Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice on Wednesday morning.James Hodgkinson, the suspect who allegedly opened fire at the baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with a record of violent behavior.Reacting to the shooting shortly after it occurred on Wednesday morning in an interview on Buffalo, New York’s WBEN radio, Collins identified the “finger-pointing, just the tone and the angst, and the anger directed at Donald Trump, his supporters” as a contributing factor in the rampage.“I can only hope that the Democrats do tone down the rhetoric,” Collins added.Later in the day, however, Collins released a statement calling on all sides, rather than just Democrats, to use more careful language.“It’s time for all of us, including myself, to tone down our rhetoric and recognize that we are all of one country and all proud Americans,” he said.On Thursday, Collins went further, admitting it had been a mistake to pin the blame on Democrats in the first place.“I do regret certainly what I said at 8:05 in the morning. I’ve been careful to clarify it moving forward,” Collins said on MSNBC.Collins also suggested that he views lawful gun ownership as part of the solution to preventing future violent incidents, because people with the guns could ward off attackers. “I do believe that a law-abiding citizen that is armed, that’s out in public, will keep himself, his staff and, in some cases, the public safe. I’m a strong believer in the NRA,” Collins said. “I do have a carry permit. And I have become certainly lax. We sometimes take our security for granted.”Democrats have universally condemned the violent attack on the congressional baseball practice. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats, took to the floor of the Senate to express his revulsion that the shooter, Hodgkinson, was a supporter of his who had volunteered on his presidential campaign.“I am sickened by this despicable act, and let me be as clear as I can be: Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,” the Vermont senator said.The annual congressional baseball game is slated to continue as planned at 7:05 pm on Thursday."

The former state representative and real estate developer is running to fill a seat vacated by Mick Mulvaney, who’s now the director of the president’s Office of Management and Budget. James Hodgkinson, a liberal enthusiast of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with a history of violent behavior, opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday morning. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and five others were wounded before U.S. Capitol Police, with assistance from Alexandria Police, were able to stop the shooter.Scalise is in critical condition Thursday following emergency surgery. Hodgkinson died from wounds sustained during the shootout with police.Gun rights advocates have long argued the solution to gun violence is for more civilians to have guns so they can defend themselves against potential assailants. (In fact, evidence that armed civilians save lives in “active shooter” scenarios is greatly exaggerated.)Several sitting Republican members of Congress also responded to Wednesday’s shooting by proposing increased gun possession. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) promised to start carrying his gun at public events.It is not clear exactly how that would work when members of Congress are not in their home districts. The U.S. Capitol Police forbids possession of firearms on the Capitol premises. And Washington, D.C., has strict rules regulating permits for concealed guns. However, in Virginia, where the shooting took place, citizens can openly carry weapons without a permit, or obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon.Norman, 63, squares off against Democrat Archie Parnell, a 66-year-old tax attorney, in a special election on Tuesday. Norman is highly favored to win in the Republican-leaning district, but Parnell released a poll at the end of May showing he had narrowed Norman’s lead to 10 percentage points from a 16-point interval in March.Parnell supports closing gaps in the country’s background check system, including the “default to proceed” loophole waiving the need for a background check if the FBI does not complete it within three days of the request. The loophole enabled Dylann Roof, who perpetrated the June 2015 massacre at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, to obtain a weapon despite his criminal record.“Ralph Norman should be ashamed of himself and he should publicly apologize to the victims and their families for trying to use this tragedy to score cheap points,” Parnell said in a statement responding to Norman’s comments."
62,ENTERTAINMENT,'Walking Dead' Showrunner Says It's Been Tough Since Shocking Death Reveal,Bill Bradley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walking-dead-death-reveal-showrunner-scott-gimple_us_5a2ec44ee4b0ce3b3444874e,Scott Gimple sets the record straight on that big midseason finale scene.,2017-12-11,"Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes on ""The Walking Dead.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2edf8a1600004700c4f47c.jpeg?cache=KabLHUJ9vo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you think your day has been tough, tell that to Scott Gimple.The “Walking Dead” showrunner is used to dealing with all kinds of reactions to shocking moments on the show, but the latest jaw-dropper ― which happened during the midseason finale, “How It’s Gotta Be” ― has proved especially difficult.In the final moments of Sunday’s episode, Carl (Chandler Riggs) revealed a zombie bite on his side. In the world of “The Walking Dead,” that’s basically a death warrant.Fans were crushed over the fate of the young man who grew up on the show, but perhaps not as much as Riggs himself. Following the show, The Hollywood Reporter released an interview in which he called the news of his character’s death “devastating” for him and his family. He explained that he’d just bought a house in Senoia, Georgia, near where the AMC series is filmed. William Riggs, Chandler’s father, also posted an emotional message on Facebook after the episode, saying how hard it was to watch his son get “fired” and adding that he didn’t trust Gimple or AMC. He later deleted the message.Before HuffPost jumped on the phone with Gimple, AMC emailed to say there would be “no comment” from the showrunner on Riggs’ father’s Facebook message. However, during our conversation, Gimple did describe how hard it’s been for him since Carl’s impending death was revealed.“I’m just thinking about Chandler, and the cast and crew and all the people put together, but it’s tough,” he said. “I knew it would be tough for the people who have been following the story for so long, and it’s the kind of turns the story takes that are so painful.”Gimple stressed how important the next episode, ostensibly Carl’s last appearance as a living person, will be. “The next episode is really critical to the whole story of it, to Carl’s story, and to how Carl’s story affects everyone else,” he said. “This is just the start of that. I really hope people see that as well. It’s amazing work by Chandler and [Andrew Lincoln], Danai Gurira, and everyone else. And there is, I hope, some meaning to be drawn from it.”Gimple chatted more about how the show decided upon Carl’s death, whether Riggs’ future college plans really had anything to do with the plot twist, and where “The Walking Dead” is headed now. What were the conversations [in the writing room] like when you decided this is how the story would break?It was all just story. When we’re planning the story, there’s all these different iterations that are played out into the future. ... The map of the show is all these 14 paths. This was one of those 14 paths. Can you say what some of those other paths were?I really can’t get into that. The “why” of it is played out on screen ... but there’s stuff in this that affects things years from now.At what point did you know it had to be Carl?I definitely don’t want to pin that one down either, but I will say the possibility of that fork of the map had been there. We talk about all those different iterations.There were rumors that Chandler’s character would be written off after his college announcement in 2016. Did that have anything to do with it?No, I mean that would’ve been outside the story, unless we were approached or something like that. But, no, it’s always just about the story.What was the conversation like when you told him?Two or three years ago, I figured out that I should never get into the private conversations that we have about this stuff. It’s so personal. I wouldn’t want to talk about what happened behind the scenes like that. It’s very much about what happened on screen.Anything to say to all those Carl fans out there? Carl is one of the most important characters on the series, and this turn in his story is going to indelibly affect everything moving forward.So why Carl and not someone like Morgan?I think it’ll be apparent as to how this affects the story in seismic ways, at least what this story entails. There’s a million different ways it could go, but people will see the way it goes.You said on “Talking Dead” that this will play out the way bites play out on the show. But there’s a theory that Carl could’ve been bit by a Whisperer [a human in a zombie disguise]. What are your thoughts on that?What I said last night on “Talking Dead” is true. This bite will play out as we’ve seen bites play out on the show. That’s a very cool, imaginative, intense theory, but this bite plays out as we’ve seen it play out.What are you proudest of after the episode?It was a very difficult episode to do emotionally and to execute. It was a very ambitious episode. All the writers, the productions staff, the [executive producers]. David Leslie Johnson and Angela Kang, who wrote the script. And Michael E. Satrazemis, who did such an amazing job directing it. I’m just proud how everyone came together. I’m so proud of Chandler and the performance that he gave, but people haven’t seen anything yet. Both in our next episode, but just in Chandler’s work moving forward. He’s a remarkably talented young man, just came out with some new music that people should check out, and he’s diving into projects immediately.But he’s not dead on the show. There’s an incredible episode coming up, and I do hope it contextualizes all of this. I do hope people check it out because it really is some of the finest acting work we’ve had on the series, and it’s all Chandler.What’s the challenge moving forward without one of the most important characters on the show? The challenge, certainly we had to think about this, is to tell the stories from the [comic books]. They’re going to be in very different ways now. We’ve always done it. There’s this butterfly effect that happens with characters that are on the show that weren’t in the book, or rather aren’t currently in the books, that were in the book, and vice versa. Then there’s characters that weren’t a part of the book like Daryl, and there’s this butterfly effect that affects everything, and it changes the “who” sometimes and the “how” sometimes, but we really want to get to the moments from the book that had me giving [creator Robert Kirkman] money every month. And I still do sometimes. I love the stories from the book. When I started on the show, I wanted to tell them exactly like the book, and Robert was very open to do it loosely and change things because he had told those stories and told them so well. I still want to tell those stories with great fidelity but with changes to surprise the fans and potentially enhance the story in some ways, just by virtue of knowing years ahead things that we could do. It’s a challenge, but it’s a challenge we’ve met before. We have a great group of people to do it, and we’ve already thought a lot about it."

It’s a need to feel that there is good out there,"" the actor says of watching his Golden Globe-nominated show.",2017-12-11,"From left: Sterling K. Brown as Randall, Susan Kelechi Watson as Beth, Milo Ventimiglia as Jack, Mandy Moore as Rebecca, Justin Hartley as Kevin, Chrissy Metz as Kate, Chris Sullivan as Toby in ""This Is Us."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2eb3b6190000492c035acf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Hollywood Foreign Press Association recognized “This Is Us” in three major Golden Globe Award categories on Monday: Stars Sterling K. Brown and Chrissy Metz received nominations for Best Actor in a Drama and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, and the show has a shot at being named Best Drama Series.This isn’t just a celebratory moment for NBC; it’s big for network television in general. “This Is Us” could become the first network drama to be honored as Best Drama Series since “Grey’s Anatomy” won the Golden Globe in 2007. The other shows in the category this year are premium-cable and streaming standouts like “The Crown,” “Game of Thrones,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Stranger Things.” And compared to the other series nominated for best drama, “This Is Us” makes a particularly strong case for the power of feel-good TV. The show manages to rake in between 10 million to 13 million weekly viewers as it follows the Pearson family, all the while addressing race, gender, age, body positivity and addiction.“I appreciate the conversations that the show starts,” Milo Ventimiglia, one of the show’s stars, told HuffPost earlier this month while promoting a partnership with The Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Awards.“I appreciate the humanity that it gives all of us to understand that, oftentimes, if we just put our best foot forward, if we try to listen, if we try to understand and be compassionate of the differences that we have as people, the gap isn’t so wide,” he said. We’ve seen Ventimiglia’s character, Jack, struggle with alcohol abuse. Kate (Metz) has dealt with guilt over a miscarriage, and Randall (Brown) has confronted his anxiety. We’ve seen Kevin (Justin Hartley) face the pressures of fame and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) grapple with the complex issue of raising a black son in America. All of these storylines reflect on specific aspects of the real world we live in, but are wrapped up in a sheen of heartwarming family dynamics.“I’m grateful that people tune in to feel something,” Ventimiglia said. “It isn’t just entertainment. It’s a need to feel that there is good out there and that through the pain or struggle or anything, you can overcome and you can bond together with your closest of kin or friends and move forward in life.” “It’s interesting,” he added. “People say, ‘God, your show makes me cry.’ But I say, ‘Yeah, but you don’t feel bad, do you?’”Ventimiglia said the show simultaneously gives viewers the opportunity to escape the noise of their own lives and offers the drama of high-stakes stories. And “This Is Us” favors a nuanced approach to talking about serious issues, rather than presenting in-your-face commentary. Ventimiglia, a longtime actor who has starred in “Gilmore Girls” and “Heroes,” said he could relate on some level to the experiences of his character’s son, Kevin. In one episode, viewers watch as Kevin’s high school celebrates him as a notable alumnus with Hollywood success. But the fanfare only exacerbates his substance abuse, and the mid-season finale ends with a DUI incident involving Kevin’s niece, Tess (Eris Baker).Although Ventimiglia has never been in that kind of predicament, he’s aware of how the limelight can affect someone’s personal and professional life.“I’m in those shoes at times too, where people applaud you and herald you and you could probably get away with the worst behavior ― yet they’ll still hold you up high. It’s kind of a terrifying prospect,” Ventimiglia said. “I think that if you embrace those bad things in life, then you’re going to turn into the bad examples some of us have seen quite recently. But if you keep on the good path and just be a good person in a position of influence, well, then you’re going to represent a better way to be and a better human being and hopefully that’s what we can inspire: goodness and kindness toward everyone.” Another poignant storyline this season has centered on the relationship between Jack and Randall. Despite their physical differences, Jack relates, in some ways, more to his adopted son than his own biological children.“If we as people are constantly going to be stuck on our differences, how are we ever going to understand that we’re all sharing this planet together? Life is already hard enough. Why would we want to make it more difficult by calling out a difference as opposed to embracing it?” Ventimiglia asked. “How I was raised was to see beyond race and gender and anything else, and see the human being behind the person that’s standing in front of you.” The California native credits his parents for giving him a solid support system in his own life and allowing him to grow into who he is today. “My mom and dad were just … they’re the greatest people,” he said. “They’re kind and they armed my sisters and I with everything that we would need for a successful life. And they let us exist, they let us live our lives. So that was always a good thing to know, that I have a foundation to have a good life.” No doubt Ventimiglia is leading a pretty good life these days. The success of “This Is Us” even earned him an Emmy nomination (which co-star Brown went on to win). Ventimiglia doesn’t take any of this for granted, and he said he hopes the show accomplishes more than winning awards. “The level of conversation and what it represents to bring people together, not only as an actor but just as a human being, I’m deeply grateful for.” “This Is Us” returns Jan. 2 at 9 p.m. on NBC. The Golden Globes air Jan. 7 at 8 p.m. on NBC."

Her response: “Hell no!”She told the magazine the unwanted sexual advances were endless.“It seemed like everybody wanted to get in my panties. It was constant defending and battling.

An improvised, low-tech pipe bomb device was affixed to his chest with Velcro and zip ties. The explosion, which occurred around 7:20 a.m. in the subway near Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, immediately plunged the commuter hub into chaos.Five people have been treated at two Mount Sinai hospitals for minor injuries related to the incident, the hospital said in a statement to HuffPost. They had all been released by about 5 p.m. local time. Police identified the suspect as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, who they said is a U.S. resident from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong. According to investigators, Ullah, who had no criminal record, triggered the bomb intentionally and mentioned the self-described Islamic State after his arrest. He last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, authorities said.Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press the suspect used matches, a lightbulb and a nine-volt battery to ignite a pipe stuffed with explosive material, but the blast wasn’t powerful enough to create harmful shrapnel. The man was injured himself, and had burns on his hands and abdomen, as well as lacerations, authorities said. He was being treated at Bellevue Hospital. The bomber reportedly told investigators he was inspired by terror attacks on Christmas markets in Europe, and chose the location in Manhattan due to its holiday-themed posters, The New York Times reported. He also said the bombing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria and other locations.Officials were preparing to charge Ullah in federal court in Manhattan, and the incident is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Times reported.Ullah lived with his father, mother and brother in an area of Brooklyn that has a large Bangladeshi community, his neighbors told the AP.Alan Butrico, who owns the house next door to Ullah and a locksmith business two doors down, said: “It’s very weird … You never know who your neighbors are.”The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver’s license from 2012 to 2015, after which it expired.Police Commissioner James O’Neill called the explosion a “terror-related incident” during a mid-morning news conference. He declined to elaborate on Ullah’s statement, but called on citizens to come forward with information about the event and other concerning behavior.“We are New Yorkers. We don’t live in fear,” O’Neill said at a briefing. “If you see something doesn’t look right, you have an obligation to come forward, call 911, flag down a cop, and give us a chance to investigate it.”New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) described the explosive as a “low-tech device” and said the plot was isolated to one individual.“This is one of my nightmares: a terror attack in the subway system. Luckily, the damage was minimal, but this was one in a growing pattern that we’re seeing develop,” Cuomo said on Spectrum News NY1 later Monday afternoon. “The good news is that we were on top of it. We have the greatest law enforcement force on the planet, in my opinion, and the reality was not as bad as the fear.”Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at an earlier press conference alongside Cuomo, stressed that terrorists “yearn to attack New York City.”“All we know of is one individual who, thank God, was unsuccessful in his aims,” he said.President Donald Trump said in a statement that the attempted attack proved the relevance of his executive order restricting the entry of travelers from eight countries into the United States. He also said the attempt showed the need for restrictions to so-called chain migration, which allows people to sponsor visas of family members besides spouses and unmarried minor children. “First and foremost, as I have been saying since I first announced my candidacy for President, America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows for too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,” the president said. The area where the explosion occurred is one of New York City’s busiest tourist and commuter zones. The Times Square-42nd Street/Port Authority station serves a dozen subway lines and a variety of local and regional bus lines.The blast immediately sent the key transit hub into chaos. The A, C and E subway lines were evacuated, Sgt. Brendan Ryan told HuffPost, and the busy Port Authority bus terminal was cleared and temporarily shut down. Other trains bypassed Times Square and Port Authority stations.Rosemary Usoh, 40, told HuffPost she was on the third floor of the bus terminal around 7:15 a.m. when at least a dozen police officers with automatic weapons shouted for people to evacuate the building immediately.“They yelled at us to get out, that there was an explosion,” Usoh said. “I was nervous. There were a lot of people running.”Alicja Wlodkowski, 51, told The New York Times that she was in a restaurant inside the bus terminal building when the explosion occurred.“A woman fell, and nobody even stopped to help her because it was so crazy,” Wlodkowski said. “Then it all slowed down. I was standing and watching and scared.” Video shows emergency crews responding to the Port Authority bus terminal on 42nd Street. The Port Authority said the subway entrance outside the building on Eighth Avenue was closed “due to police activity.” The bus terminal building was evacuated and shut down for several hours. It reopened later in the morning, but the Port Authority warned bus commuters to “contact their carrier for the most current information.”Police closed surrounding streets.This story has been updated with new details on the suspect and comments from Cuomo and Trump."

It will take a minute, so please stick with me.Back in 1992 when Bill Clinton was running for president, his staff searched for a theme that would grab the attention of the American people. The options were boiled down to three. The first was “Change versus more of the same.” The second was “Don’t Forget Health Care.”Clinton’s strategist, James Carville, hung the third option on the wall as a constant reminder for the campaign staff. It said simply, “The economy, stupid.” In one form or another, that phrase has been part of every presidential campaign since.A political commitment to a healthy economy is a no-brainer, of course. But the commitment gets real at the personal level. It means jobs — decent jobs that provide fair wages, upward mobility and financial security. If we had a steady-state economy, people wouldn’t worry so much. But our economy is about as far as it can be from steady-state. It is disrupted more than ever before, and more rapidly than ever before, by new technologies and factors we do not control, from the weather to oil prices.Job security today is not likely to come from working for the same company or using the same skill set for 30 or 40 years. Security requires agility – the ability to see which industries are blooming and which are fading. It requires that we accept the need for lifelong education and retraining.“By 2050, the idea of a ‘job for life’, but even the idea of ‘a profession for life’ might seem antediluvian,” notes a recent article in the journal Nature. “It is particularly important to identify as early as possible the potential winners and losers from new technologies.” Where the author goes wrong is his timing. The idea of a job for life already is obsolete.Government must be forward-looking, too. The people we elect to shape our tax system and government budgets must invest our money well. The tax code influences the economy by rewarding some activities and penalizing others. The yearly federal budget process decides how the government allocates the trillions of dollars it collects from us each year ($3 trillion last year, about 47 percent from individual income taxes, 34 percent from payroll taxes, 9 percent from corporations and the rest from a variety of other taxes).To keep up with change these days, Congress must be as agile as individual workers. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Congress used to have an Office of Technology Assessment to keep abreast of scientific and technical issues, but the office was shut down in 1995. Today, our elected leaders seem more comfortable standing still.“Our politics and our institutions are locked in past models that are increasing unfit for purpose,” writes Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford. “Over the next 20 years, up to half of US jobs, one-third of jobs in the United Kingdom and the European Union and two-thirds of jobs in China and Mexico may be replaced by computers and robotics.”Another area of rapid change is the energy sector, where a technology revolution already is underway. The global and national economies are both moving to low- and no-carbon energy resources, particularly renewable energy where fuel is free, supplies never run out and there is no air pollution.Coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, can no longer generate electricity as inexpensively as solar and wind power. Natural gas, often considered a “transition fuel” as the economy shifts to clean energy, has its own environmental drawbacks including polluted wastewater and leaks of methane, one of the most potent gases responsible for climate change.The days are numbered, too, for vehicles fueled by oil products. General Motors plans to produce only electric vehicles in the not-too-distant future. Forbes, among others, says we are headed to a future in which 65% to 75% of all the vehicles sold in the United States will be electric. An oil-industry consultant, David Yager, reports “the current discussion about the future of oil is how soon it will be before petroleum becomes a sunset industry. If it isn’t already.”In its 2017 Energy Outlook, British Petroleum observes:The global energy landscape is changing...More than ever, our industry needs to adapt to meet those changing energy needs…Rapid improvements in the competitiveness of renewable energy mean that increases in renewables, together with nuclear and hydro energy, provide around half of the increase in global energy out to 2035.The American people support this revolution. As President Trump prepared to take office, 75 percent of his supporters said they wanted the country to accelerate the deployment and use of clean energy – solar, wind, and energy efficiency.What has all this to do with tax reform? President Trump has chosen to move the nation backward rather than forward. His plan is to make the United States the world’s leading producer of coal, oil and natural gas. The two tax bills Congress is consolidating right now support this idea. Analyses of the individual House and Senate tax bills indicate that congressional tax reform will be, as the Los Angeles Times puts it, “clearly allied with the Trump administration’s goal to shift American energy development back to black fuels and reverse Obama-era programs to encourage cleaner technologies to generate electricity and move people and goods.”In regard to jobs, the tax loopholes and subsidies the House and Senate tax bills would retain for fossil fuels go against the energy economy’s tide. We know from the U.S. Department of Energy that the energy efficiency sector alone employs 2.2 million Americans, while 1.1 million Americans work in the traditional coal, oil and gas industries. Nearly 260,000 Americans work on alternative fuel vehicles, 374,000 people work in solar energy and more than 100,000 people work in the wind industry.Ironically, most of these jobs are showing up in Trump Country. In Oklahoma, Nebraska and Alaska, for example, solar jobs grew 100 percent between 2015 and 2016, according to the Solar Foundation. Of the 10 states where solar jobs grew fastest, eight voted for Trump in the presidential election. This tide will not ebb. Employment projections issued in October by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that solar and wind energy jobs will grow twice as fast as employment in any other occupation over the next 10 years.Keeping America and its workers stuck in the old energy economy is a terrible use of the tax code and tax dollars. The best public investments would help our workers and our economy make the smoothest possible transition to clean energy. President Trump’s desire to lead the world in energy has merit, but we should lead in renewable energy technologies, not fossil fuels. That’s where global markets are moving today and where we in the United States would find the greatest opportunity for jobs that make our economy and our lives more secure."

Since its rediscovery, the beetle is only known to survive in two separate but small populations in Miami’s pine rocklands. The pine rocklands are unique to southern Florida and the Bahamas.A loss of habitat and pesticides is also blamed for the endangering of the Florida bonneted bat, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.The threatened gopher tortoise and its burrows are also protected under state law. The turtles must be relocated by a permit holder before their land can be developed, according to the commission.“Outside of Everglades National Park, pine rocklands habitat in our region is down to only one percent of its former extent — but what little remains still provides habitat for many species now federally listed as endangered or threatened with extinction,” Matthew Schwartz, executive director of South Florida Wildlands Association, said in a statement. “This project and its impact on extremely rare habitat require far more evaluation than they have received so far from the Service.”Fish and Wildlife Service officials signed off on the Coral Reef Commons project after Cummings agreed to create a “habitat conservation plan.” That plan, according to the Herald, would protect 51 acres of the 138-acre land as four separate onsite preserves. The developer also agreed to protect roughly 51 acres offsite.Cummings, who purchased the property from the University of Miami for $22 million, has argued that developing the land would give the plants and animals a better chance at survival since it is currently overgrown and choked by invasive plants."
