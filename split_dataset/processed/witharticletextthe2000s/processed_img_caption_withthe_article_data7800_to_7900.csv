Even priests can be scared. It’s a difficult life.”For those who believe in demonic possession and that priests have the power to expel the evil spirits, Taraborelli is considered one of the prominent successors to Father Gabriele Amorth, who died last month at age 91. Amorth was said to have performed more than 160,000 exorcisms. Taraborelli, 79, sees up to 30 people a day in a windowless room near the Vatican, the BBC reported. His most vivid case, a married woman being wooed by a Satanist, sounds like it came right out of a movie.“When I told the devil: ‘In the name of Jesus, I order you to go away’, she started to vomit little metal pins, five at a time,” he said. “Aside from pins she would also vomit hair braids, little stones, pieces of wood. It sounds like something from another world right? Instead, it’s something from this world.”In Argentina, a non-accredited exorcism school offers an “exorcist assistant” diploma. But that may be of little help to Taraborelli.“Exorcists need to be certified to eliminate the practice of exorcism by untrained novices,” Taraborelli told the Daily Beast previously. “Otherwise it can be very dangerous for the person who believes he is under the devil’s possession.”"

Some 300,000 more were injured and approximately 1.5 million residents were internally displaced.Haiti’s recovery from the quake has been a slow and painstaking process, plagued by the worst Cholera outbreak in recent history. Tens of thousands of Haitians were still homeless or living in dilapidated shelters years later when disaster struck again.Hurricane Matthew ripped through the country’s southwest with wind speeds reaching 145 mph in early October. The storm left a deadly trail of “complete destruction,” Haitian Interior Minister François Anick Joseph said days after it hit. Experts fear the latest disaster could worsen the ongoing cholera epidemic.Watch a 360° video below from RYOT of the hurricane aftermath in Haiti:The hurricane caused severe damage to crops and destroyed boats used for fishing in some of the worst-affected areas, leaving many people unable to support themselves with “nothing left to survive on,” according to Marc Soniel Noel, the deputy mayor of Chantal in southern Haiti.The United Nations announced that a “massive response” to the crisis is required with at least 1.4 million Haitians currently in need of help, but multiple humanitarian groups have said that badly damaged infrastructure and blocked roads have made it difficult to reach survivors. Agencies like the World Food Programme and American Red Cross are working to distribute food and medical supplies, as doctors remain largely inaccessible.“Many people I have met are surviving by eating fruit from fallen trees,” said Carlos Veloso, a WFP representative in Haiti. “We are using trucks and helicopters to transport [food supplies] as quickly as possible to save lives.”To learn how you can help, click here.

3,THE WORLDPOST,Islamic State Using Human Shields As Coalition Advances On Mosul,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/islamic-state-using-human-shields-mosul_us_58064714e4b0dd54ce3548d7,Islamic State may use tens of thousands of residents to hold onto their last city stronghold in Iraq.,2016-10-18,"Peshmerga forces advance in the east of Mosul to attack Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq, October 18, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580648aa1b0000df1cef7cf0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Residents of Mosul said Islamic State was using civilians as human shields as Iraqi and Kurdish forces captured outlying villages in their advance on the jihadists’ stronghold.The leader of Islamic State was reported to be among thousands of hardline militants still in the city, suggesting the group would go to great lengths to repel the coalition.With attacking forces still between 20 and 50 km (12-30 miles) away, residents reached by telephone said more than 100 families had started moving from southern and eastern suburbs most exposed to the offensive to more central parts of the city.Islamic State militants were preventing people fleeing Mosul, they said, and one said they directed some toward buildings they had recently used themselves.“It’s quite clear Daesh (Islamic State) has started to use civilians as human shields by allowing families to stay in buildings likely to be targeted by air strikes,” said Abu Mahir, who lives near the city’s university.Like other residents contacted in the city, he refused to give his full name, but Abdul Rahman Waggaa, a member of the exiled Provincial Council of Nineveh of which Mosul is the capital, corroborated his account to Reuters.Around 1.5 million people still live in Mosul and the International Organization for Migration said Islamic State may use tens of thousands of residents as human shields to hold onto their last city stronghold in Iraq.The IOM said there was a likelihood of chemical attacks by the jihadists, who had used such weapons previously against Iraqi Kurdish forces.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said safe routes had been secured for civilians who wanted to leave Mosul. Syria meanwhile accused the U.S.-led coalition of planning to allow Islamic State militants to flee across the border into Syria.The fall of Mosul would signal the defeat of the ultra-hardline Sunni jihadists in Iraq but could also lead to land grabs and sectarian bloodletting between groups which fought one another after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein.For U.S. President Barack Obama, the campaign is a calculated risk. He is hoping to bolster his legacy by seizing back as much territory as he can from Islamic State before he leaves office in January.“DISORIENTED”The Iraqi army and Peshmerga forces from autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan began moving towards the city at dawn on Monday under air cover from a U.S.-led coalition set up after Islamic State swept into Iraq from Syria in 2014.Hoshiyar Zebari, a senior Kurdish official, said initial operations succeeded due to close cooperation between the Iraqi government and Kurdish peshmerga fighters, allowing them to clear Islamic State from 9 or 10 villages east of Mosul.“Daesh is disoriented they don’t know whether to expect attacks from the east or west or north,” he told Reuters.On Tuesday the attacking forces entered another phase, Zebari said. “It won’t be a spectacular attack on Mosul itself. It will be very cautious. It is a high-risk operation for everybody.”Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and explosives expert Fawzi Ali Nouimeh were both in the city, according to what Zebari described as “solid” intelligence reports.A total of 20 villages were taken from the militants east, south and southeast of Mosul by early Tuesday, according to statements from the two forces, fighting alongside one another for the first time.Islamic State said on Monday its fighters had targeted the attacking forces with 10 suicide bombs and that their foes had surrounded five villages but not taken them. None of the reports could be independently verified.RESIDENTS KEPT IN CITYAbadi announced the offensive on Monday around two years after Iraq’s second-largest city fell to the militants, who exploited the civil war that broke out in Syria in 2011 to seize territory there.The operation had been planned since July with U.S. and other coalition forces and Western and Iraqi officials, mindful of the civil war that followed Saddam’s fall, say plans for administering the mainly Sunni city and accommodating those who flee the fighting are in place.The United Nations has said up to a million people could flee the city and that it expected the first big wave in five or six days, indicating fighting would reach the city then.But some residents said Islamic State was making sure people did not leave. One, who gave his name as Anwar, said he fled the Sumer district near Mosul airport, fearing ground forces and aerial bombing.“I told Daesh fighters at a checkpoint ‘I’m going to stay at my sister’s house’,” he said. “A Daesh fighter made calls through his radio to make sure I was not lying and only after the voice on the other side said ‘Let him go’, did I let myself breathe.”Fighting is expected to take weeks, if not months, as 30,000 government forces, Sunni tribal fighters and Kurdish Peshmerga first encircle the city then attempt to oust between 4,000 and 8,000 Islamic State militants.More than 5,000 U.S. soldiers are also deployed in support missions, as are troops from France, Britain, Canada and other Western nations.The Iraqi army is attacking Mosul on the southern and southeastern fronts, while the Peshmerga carried out their operation to the east and are also deployed north and northwest.The Kurdish forces said they secured “a significant stretch” of the 80 km (50 mile) road between Erbil, their capital, and Mosul, about an hour’s drive to the west.Coalition warplanes attacked 17 Islamic State positions in support of the Peshmerga operation in the heavily mined area, the Kurdish statement said, adding that at least four car bombs were destroyed.There was no indication of the number of military or civilian casualties in the Iraqi or Kurdish statements.France said it would co-host a multilateral meeting with Iraq on Oct. 20 to discuss how to stabilize Mosul and its surroundings once Islamic State has been defeated.Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the militants were likely to retreat to their Syrian bastion Raqqa, so it was vital to consider how to retake that city too.“We can’t let Islamic State reconstitute itself or strengthen to create an even more dangerous hub,” he said.(Additional reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh in ERBIL, Ahmed Rasheed and Stephen Kalin in BAGHDAD, Stephanie Nebehay in GENEVA, Warren Strobel, Yara Bayoumy and Jonathan Landay in WASHINGTON; writing by Philippa Fletcher and Giles Elgood, editing by Peter Millership)"

Previously, immature skin-derived eggs had to be implanted into a living mouse in order to mature fully ― a more unwieldy process.To achieve their feat, researchers at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, took cells from the tails of female mice and turned them into stem cells ― undifferentiated, embryonic-like cells that can become any cell type in the body ― by treating them with a mixture of proteins and growth factors, The Wall Street Journal reported. Then they cultured the cells alongside mouse ovarian cells to produce the mature egg cells.To test whether eggs produced in this manner could yield offspring, the researchers fertilized them with mouse sperm and then implanted them in the uteruses of other mice. Only 1 percent of the cells led to live births, according to Scientific American. But the stem cell biologist who led the team of researchers, Dr. Katsuhiko Hayashi, said the resulting animals were healthy and fertile and lived a normal lifespan.The same basic process might ultimately be used to restore fertility to women rendered infertile by early menopause or chemotherapy treatments.

And absent a breakthrough that “accelerates the technology,” he told The Huffington Post in an email, it might take 10 to 20 years to create human eggs using the process.Dr. Diana Laird, a developmental biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that clinical use of the technique ― if it ever comes ― would take some time.“I wouldn’t want patients who have infertility to think this can be done in humans next year” or any other time in the near future, she told Science News.Even if the technical challenges are overcome, the technique raises big ethical questions. For one thing, it might be used to make so-called “designer babies” whose high intelligence or other beneficial traits might give them unfair advantages over other babies.And using the technology to create a child in any “unusual way” ― including its use by male couples ― would necessitate new regulatory oversight, Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University, told HuffPost.Then there’s the matter of cost.“This will be very expensive,” Caplan said. “Will this only be available for the rich?

9,POLITICS,"The Media Feel So Bad For Poor, Poor Paul Ryan, Who Hasn't Enabled Trump At All",Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-trump-victim_us_58063417e4b0dd54ce352946,The press just loves giving the House speaker a big ol' pass!,2016-10-18,He's only the speaker of the House. Don't blame him.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Center for Public Integrity came out with a blockbuster report on Monday describing how journalists are way, way too poor to influence elections with their money. A ragtag group of television reviewers and restaurant critics have combined to add almost $400,000 to the campaign coffers of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (with Clinton winning the lion’s share of this largesse), as Dave Levinthal and Michael Beckel detail. In a billion-dollar election, that puts “journalists” somewhere near “accounting error” in terms of their contributions.But that doesn’t mean journalists aren’t good political donors ― you just have to account for the stuff they give away for free. And one big beneficiary of such in-kind offerings has been beleaguered House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).In case you’ve not been keeping up with the latest in Ryaniana, the Wisconsin representative and former vice presidential nominee has found himself in another round of back-and-forth sparring with his party’s nominee. Ryan desperately wants the presidential race to be something he no longer needs to think about, because his party’s standard-bearer is an odious lunatic and because the speaker has been attempting to run a parallel Republican campaign from the safety of his office. Trump, however, won’t let him go and has even worked Ryan into his larger mythology of a “rigged” election, painting him as one more party to a “sinister deal.”The straight story here, of course, is that Paul Ryan brought all of this upon himself. By offering Trump his endorsement ― a move that he’d have cause to regret within hours ― he invited the vampire into his home. And throughout his dance of death with the candidate, Ryan has desperately tried to make it work. As recently as Oct. 7, he was planning to appear on the stump with Trump, only to rescind the invitation when it became clear that Trump’s “grab her by the pussy” comment wasn’t going to be quickly swept away by the news cycle.In other words, Ryan has made poor choices and taken ill-advised actions. Fortunately for him, he’s receiving his traditional round of fluffing from the media, who are depicting him as a noble sufferer ― unfairly victimized by Trump but ultimately responsible for nothing ― and who are giving him immense credit for finding a way to exist in the liminal space between not quite endorsing Trump and not quite rescinding that endorsement either. Take, for example, Jennifer Steinhauer’s New York Times piece from over the weekend, “For Paul Ryan, a Long, Labored Path Leading Away From Donald Trump.” Which sounds like Ryan had, you know, broken with Trump. That’s not the case! But the larger argument being made is that Ryan has ended up a casualty to cruel fate:He didn’t see it coming.Huh, what now? He didn’t see Trump coming? From as far back as ‘Mexicans are sending rapists’? And we’re to believe that in May, Trump’s ascension still caught him unawares? By May, the only non-Trump nomination options that were left were the desperate ones ― the aborted Cruz-Kasich team-up plan or a massive procedural fight at the very convention over which Ryan was obligated to preside.The Times piece goes on to describe Ryan as having been plunged into a “singular abyss,” as if something other than his passivity put him there. Ryan absorbs the “unsparing ... disparagement” from Trump and makes his tepid objections known through spokespersons. He supposedly came to learn the hard way that Trump doesn’t “deal in good faith” when Trump falsely claimed to have earned Ryan’s endorsement before it was actually offered (making Ryan one of the last people to realize that Trump doesn’t “deal in good faith”). After that, Ryan chose to take Trump’s selection of running mate Mike Pence as a “bright spot” that surely represented a change in tone.Overall, Ryan kept up a campaign of pretending Trump didn’t exist, until such time as that became untenable: the release of the 2005 video in which the real estate mogul lewdly promoted sexual assault as a perk of fame. As punishment, Trump was disinvited from a Wisconsin rally, but that’s as far as Ryan was willing to push things. Per Steinhauer:Mr. Ryan agonized over his options. Ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep Republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “I think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who has renounced Mr. Trump. “His job is to help House Republicans. Period.”Several of Chaffetz’s colleagues briefly followed his lead, only to re-endorse Trump after a few hours of courage. If only they had someone setting an example to follow!But Ryan has clearly decided to ride this one out by ignoring Trump and putting on a happy face, all the while never indicating which of his charges are doing right by their party and country: the ones who have broken with Trump, the ones who have attached themselves to Trump, or the ones trying to have it both ways. “Just please vote the straight GOP ticket, anyway” is Ryan’s only position.And it’s all so sad, because ― as Steinhauer ruefully reports ― after all the dust has settled, his own party may not let him stay on as speaker:If Mr. Trump is defeated on Nov. 8 — as Mr. Ryan has all but conceded — but Republicans maintain their House majority, it will fall largely to Mr. Ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together.It’s hard to imagine that Ryan would have any trouble convincing his fellow House colleagues to keep him on, what with all this authoritative command he is showing.At this point, the only thing that’s keeping Ryan from being seen as a feckless, failed invertebrate is the media’s determined campaign to paint him as the tragic figure in all of this. Tuesday morning’s Politico Playbook, for example, literally describes Ryan as Trump’s “fall guy,” bullied by the nominee’s sneering remarks. As Playbook puts it:THIS IS STUNNING. Trump is essentially accusing the speaker of the House of sabotaging his campaign to benefit his own political future. (We think it’s an absurd argument.)It is an absurd argument, but only because the Trump campaign is the one thing Ryan isn’t sabotaging for the sake of his political future. Yet Playbook maintains that Ryan has somehow become fortune’s unwitting fool in this whole escapade, ignoring the fact that he’s been one of Trump’s principal enablers:STEP BACK: There’s been a lot of chatter over the last few days about whether Ryan did the right thing by speaking out against Trump. Why is he always the scold, people have asked? His handling of Trump will be dissected plenty over the next few months. Ryan has an incredibly complicated job and has to balance the needs of 245 other Republicans, many of whom wanted cover to break with Trump. But there’s no question he’s now bearing the brunt of the decision. We’re not going to play the can-he-win-the-speakership-again game. There are far too many variables at play, like a) how much Trump loses by and b) what the margin is in the House. But Trump and his allies are signaling a long fight against Ryan. Put it all together, and you come up with a pretty simple question: Why would Ryan want to become speaker again?Why should anyone care if Ryan becomes speaker again? How is that a going concern? He had his chance to put down his marker and opted to refrain from doing so, preferring to pretend that this is all some bad dream from which he’ll shake himself when the morning comes.Ryan has been the sort of statesman who offers up his strongest statements while timidly backing out the door, leaving everyone left in the room wondering if he was even there in the first place. And then he’s off to shelter behind closed doors, making another video about tax cuts as a solo act of Speaker of the House cosplay.It’s a real curiosity: In a town where fanciful notions of “leadership” are venerated even when doing so flies in the face of reason, Paul Ryan has emerged as the one figure of real status who has been given a pass from all of that. Typically, you’d expect the media to light him on fire for both his non-endorsement endorsement and his subsequent non-unendorsement unendorsing of Trump.But no. He gets credited by The New York Times with making a break he hasn’t made. He earns the concern of Politico over whether he’ll keep a job that he’s been avoiding doing. He’s been a flailing, indecisive mess and a big reason why his party ― and the country― has been gravely imperiled by Trump. But it seems like the press is going to allow Ryan to go down as this election cycle’s St. Sebastian. And sure, Ryan’s fantastic abs have been shot up with metaphorical arrows, but he’s not earned a martyrdom. That’s the media’s donation. ~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

10,POLITICS,Some Of Justice Scalia's Biggest Fans Declare Donald Trump 'Uniquely Unsuited' To Be President,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/originalists-against-trump-antonin-scalia_us_58051baee4b0162c043d734d,They don't trust him to uphold the Constitution at all.,2016-10-18,Originalists Against Trump share the late Justice Antonin Scalia's view on how to read the Constitution.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58051eec170000c316acc7a3.jpeg?cache=mPpY3kokFQ&ops=crop_63_86_2937_1800%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of notable scholars and lawyers who subscribe to “originalism,” the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s preferred method of interpreting the Constitution, are denouncing Donald Trump. They don’t want him anywhere near the White House or playing any role in shaping the Supreme Court.Originalists Against Trump seeks to dispel the notion that voting for the GOP nominee is somehow supportive of constitutional values, as the founding fathers envisioned them.“Our Constitution vests in a single person the executive power of the United States. In light of his character, judgment, and temperament, we would not vest that power in Donald Trump,” the group wrote in an open letter.Republican leaders, including self-described constitutionalists such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have been adamant that they want the next president to fill the vacancy created by Scalia’s death earlier this year. But in the process, they are turning a blind eye to their presidential nominee’s apparent constitutional illiteracy and his seeming incapacity to understand entry-level concepts about the rule of law.Originalists Against Trump thinks that’s a terrible mistake.“Trump’s long record of statements and conduct, in his campaign and in his business career, have shown him indifferent or hostile to the Constitution’s basic features — including a government of limited powers, an independent judiciary, religious liberty, freedom of speech, and due process of law,” the group wrote.Although Trump has promised to nominate the next justice from an announced list of potential Supreme Court nominees, Originalists Against Trump just doesn’t trust him to do so.“More importantly, we do not trust him to respect constitutional limits in the rest of his conduct in office, of which judicial nominations are only one part,” the lawyers and academics wrote.Nor do they share the fear among many Trump supporters that Hillary Clinton poses a bigger threat to the Constitution. “Originalism has faced setbacks before; it has recovered. Whoever wins in November, it will do so again,” they wrote.Among the collective’s more recognizable names are New York University law professor Richard Epstein, retired Temple law professor David Post and Washington Post columnist George Will. The open letter includes an email address for any self-avowed originalist who might want to sign it, too. As for what originalism is ― especially as Scalia viewed it ― this quote from the late justice sums it up well:“The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living but dead ― or as I prefer to call it, enduring. It means today not what current society, much less the court, thinks it ought to mean, but what it meant when it was adopted.”Does that mean Scalia might be appalled at Republican senators’ unprecedented blockade of Merrick Garland ― the individual nominated by the sitting president to replace him, as the Constitution lays out? Maybe, especially if you consider what he wrote in 2004 about how the loss of one member hamstrings the Supreme Court.In one of his more memorable opinions, Scalia explained why he would not recuse himself from a case: When the Supreme Court is forced to operate with only eight justices, he wrote, that “rais[es] the possibility that, by reason of a tie vote, it will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.” And he could not “in good conscience” let that happen.

They just don’t trust its presidential nominee.A new GW Battleground poll, released Monday morning, asked half of the likely voters surveyed whether they trusted the Republican Party or the Democratic Party more to handle a slate of issues. The GOP led on most of the issues and lagged only modestly on the rest.The other half of those surveyed were asked whether they trusted Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton more on the same issues. They preferred Clinton on every single metric.Trump, in other words, seems to have taken the GOP’s advantage on issues like taxes and foreign policy and turned it into a striking deficit, while driving Republicans’ weakness on health care and the middle class even deeper.Here’s a side-by-side comparison of Trump’s performance against Clinton and the GOP’s performance against the Democratic Party:These findings ― which mirror the results of past Battleground polls ― offer both good and bad news for the GOP.On one hand, they underscore exactly how bad Trump is as a candidate. Several election forecasts based on “fundamentals” ― factors like the length of the incumbent party’s tenure in office and the state of the economy ― suggested that a generic Republican candidate would have either even odds or the advantage in this year’s race. But at the moment, Trump has just a 7 percent chance of winning, according to The Huffington Post’s forecast.On the other hand, the latest Battleground results suggest Trump’s weakness isn’t necessarily dragging down the party’s image ― a positive sign for the GOP’s chances in down-ballot races. The Republican Party’s numbers on the issues questions have remained largely stable over the course of the year, even as Trump’s have dropped. Pollster Ed Goeas, the Republican half of the bipartisan team who conducted the survey, chose to take the glass-half-full route.“Republican candidates across the country will be able to run with the advantage in the minds of voters on the key kitchen table issues and on one of the signature issues of the Clinton campaign, foreign affairs,” Goeas wrote Monday in a press release. “With or without the active assistance of Trump, Republican candidates will be able to run as their own independent entities, whose electoral fortunes will not be tied to the sinking presidential candidate of their party.”The GW Battleground poll was conducted by a Republican firm, The Tarrance Group, and a Democratic firm, Lake Research Partners. It surveyed 1,000 likely voters between Oct. 8 and Oct. 13, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

12,POLITICS,State Department Official Pressured FBI To Unclassify Some Clinton Emails: FBI Documents,"Jonathan Allen, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/state-department-official-pressured-fbi-to-unclassify-some-clinton-emails_us_5804ed1ae4b0162c043d0fea,By Jonathan Allen NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior official at the U.S. State Department tried to push the Federal Bureau of,2016-10-17,"U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a fundraiser in Seattle, Washington, U.S., October 14, 2016. (REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5804ede91a00008f205b9eef.jpeg?cache=TYAIFdPbca&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jonathan AllenNEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior official at the U.S. State Department tried to push the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2015 into dropping its insistence that an email from Hillary Clinton’s private server contained classified information, according to summaries of interviews with FBI officials released by the FBI on Monday.According to the records, an FBI official, whose name is redacted, told investigators that PatrickKennedy, the State Department’s most senior manager, repeatedly “pressured” the FBI to declassify information in one of Clinton’s emails. The information in that particular email originated from the FBI, which meant that the FBI had the last word on whether it remained classified.The official said the State Department’s office of legal counsel called him to question the FBI’s ruling that the information was classified, but the FBI stood by its decision.Soon after, one of the official’s colleagues at the FBI received a call from Kennedy in whichKennedy “asked his assistance in altering the email’s classification in exchange for a ‘quid pro quo.’”The FBI official said he also joined at least two discussions in which Kennedy “continued to pressure” the FBI about the email. The official said Kennedy appeared to be trying to protect Clinton by minimizing the appearance of classified government secrets in emails from the private server that Clinton used while she was secretary of state. The government forbids people from sending classified information via unsecured channels.In a separate interview, another unnamed FBI official said Kennedy told him in a phone call that the FBI’s insistence that the emails were classified “caused problems” for Kennedy. According to the interview summary, the official said he told Kennedy he would look into the email, which he had not yet seen, if the State Department would consider allowing more FBI agents to be posted in Iraq in exchange.The State Department and the FBI both confirmed that the conversation about both the email’s classification and that an increase in FBI slots in Iraq took place, but both said they were was no “quid pro quo.”Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has faced steady criticism from Republicans over her use of the unauthorized server for her work as the country’s most senior diplomat from 2009 to 2013.After a year-long FBI investigation into the server, FBI Director James Comey said in July he found that while laws governing classified information may have been broken no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges. He said, however, that Clinton and her staff had been “extremely careless” in handling classified information.The FBI released 100 pages of interview summaries on Monday, the fourth release of documents from its investigation.State Department spokesman Mark Toner said there was “no quid pro quo,” and told reporters that it was the FBI official who raised the possibility with Kennedy of the State Department allowing more agents in Iraq during the conversation about the email.“After the conversation took place about the upgrading classification, at the end of that, there was a kind of, ‘Oh, by the way, hey, we’re looking at how we want more slots” in Iraq, Toner said, calling it a “clear pivot” in the topic of conversation.The FBI also confirmed both topics were raised in the same conversation. “Although there was never a quid pro quo, these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review,” the FBI said in its statement, which did not say what the outcome of the review was.Other officials have made similar complaints of unusual pressure not to mark information as classified in Clinton’s emails last year. According to earlier documents the FBI released last month, at least one official at the State Department told investigators that there was pressure by senior department officials to mislead the public about the presence of classified information in Clinton’s emails ahead of their public release.A summary released on Monday showed another official in the office of the State Department’s inspector general making similar allegations.The State Department has said these allegations are also false. About 30,000 emails Clinton that returned to the department after she left were released to the public in 2015 and 2016.The State Department said the email Kennedy discussed with the FBI was related to the attack in 2012 on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans.Ultimately, the FBI told Kennedy that declassification was not possible, according to the interview summaries, and the State Department posted it online last year marked as classified, with heavy redactions.Clinton’s Republican rival for the White House, Donald Trump, has accused her of jeopardizing national security while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.Trump responded to the allegations against Kennedy with a single-word message on Twitter, saying, “Unbelievable.”Trump has said Clinton “would be in jail” if he becomes president because of her mishandling of classified information.Several Republican lawmakers called on President Barack Obama to investigate Kennedy and remove him from the department. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee’s chairman, said the president, a Democrat, was trying to “shield” Clinton.“The more documents that come out, the more we learn Hillary Clinton cannot be trusted with a job that is supposed to begin each day with a classified intelligence briefing,” Priebus said in his statement.Clinton has apologized for using the server, which she kept in the basement of her New York home, saying it was a mistake. In 2015 and earlier this year, she repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information via her server, but since the release of the FBI report in July she has said she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the department.Robby Mook, her campaign manager, told reporters on Monday it was “very well known that there were disputes” over classification.“It’s not uncommon for officials within a department to fight over classification,” he said.(Additional reporting by Julia Edwards, Emily Stephenson, Arshad Mohammed and Luciana Lopez; Writing by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Frances Kerry and Leslie Adler)"

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-arizona-trump_us_5804ff46e4b06e0475960c13,"With Clinton's presidential race prospects getting stronger, the campaign is looking for a Democratic Congress.",2016-10-17,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign will be sending millions of dollars to help House and Senate candidates, campaign manager Robby Mook announced Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580500f81a00008f205b9f59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With polling showing strong odds of Hillary Clinton winning the presidential election, her campaign says it is shifting millions of dollars to down-ballot races to improve her chances of having a more friendly Congress to work with.Campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Monday that $2 million will be spent in Arizona, $1 million in Indiana and Missouri, and $6 million will go to the existing battleground states of Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire.The re-allocations include $2.5 million each in transfers to the Democratic Party’s House and Senate campaign arms.Mook said the “lion’s share” of the campaign’s spending will continue to be those seven states that have been the focus for many months. If Clinton were to win most of those states, she would cross the 270 electoral vote mark and win the presidency regardless of what happens in traditionally Republican states.“That will continue to be our primary mission,” Mook said.Clinton does not appear to be within striking distance in either Missouri or Indiana, but both states have competitive Senate races where the Democratic candidate has a strong chance of winning. Democrats need to pick up five seats to regain control of that chamber.Recent polls in Arizona, though, show Clinton essentially tied there. The last time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state was 1996, when her husband Bill Clinton won re-election.“We do see opportunity in Arizona,” Mook said. “We think that’s an uphill climb.”The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had already sent dozens of field staff to the state in August and recently started sending surrogates for campaign events.Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, is to visit the Arizona State University campus in Tempe on Wednesday, and first lady Michelle Obama is to campaign in Phoenix on Thursday.Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine dropped by the Arizona Democratic Party headquarters there two weeks ago after a fundraiser, surprising volunteers who happened to be there making phone calls. “We’re not used to it here in Arizona, being a battleground state,” said communications director Enrique Gutierrez. “It’s definitely exciting our base.”Mook on Monday also criticized GOP nominee Donald Trump and his allies for trying to delegitimize the Nov. 8 election by claiming ― without any evidence ― that it will be tainted by voter fraud.“This is part of the Trump campaign’s scorched earth policy,” Mook said. “They are losing and trying to make excuses.”He also criticized Republican Party leaders for going along with Trump rather than standing up to him ― despite its own 2013 report calling for the party to broaden its appeal by reaching out to minority voters. “Donald Trump chose to drive the party even further in a different direction,” Mook said. “The GOP has a lot of soul-searching to do.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Here he is speaking at the RNC in July.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580502b51a00008f205b9f5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is just too perfect: A tech billionaire who’s publicly said that giving women the vote was bad for democracy is giving $1.25 million to Donald Trump, who would likely win the U.S. election if women didn’t have the right to vote.Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that Paypal and Palantir co-founder and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel was giving Trump the big donation, confirming his support of the candidate just as his campaign faces a meltdown over sexual assault allegations.Most tech billionaires have either denounced Donald Trump or stayed mum on the election. A self-proclaimed libertarian worth about $2.7 billion, Thiel’s gone another way. He spoke up for Trump at the Republican National Convention this summer. (He also recently funded the lawsuit that helped bankrupt Gawker, which he harbored a grudge against after the site wrote about his sexual orientation.) There’s even a rumor that Trump promised him a Supreme Court seat.It’s an interesting time to double down on support for Trump, who’s facing a barrage of accusations of sexual assault after The Washington Post published a 2005 video of him bragging he could get away with sexually assaulting women because he’s a celebrity.Women are running fast from the candidate and likely will be a major factor behind his defeat, as Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com noted last week. Silver’s analysis prompted a lot of thoughtful reflection on Twitter inspired the hashtag #repealthe19th, as in get rid of the 19th Amendment ― the one that gives women the right to vote.It’s an amendment that’s given Thiel some agita over the years. Back in 2009, on Cato Unbound, a blog affiliated with a libertarian think tank, Thiel wrote that giving the vote to women really messed up our country: Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.He later clarified his blog post and explained that he does not want to take away women’s right to vote, per se, but that he just despaired of voting as a practice to improve things in the country. Here’s how he put it:It would be absurd to suggest that women’s votes will be taken away or that this would solve the political problems that vex us. While I don’t think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better.Thiel has plenty of other unconventional views: He does not believe death is inevitable, thinks humans would do well to colonize outer space or the sea (via something he calls sea-steading) and once professed the notion that multiculturalism dumbs down American institutions.I guess one test of Thiel’s theory about women will happen on Nov. 8.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) released a joint statement warning of the threat of Trump “refusing to accept the results of a fair election.” “When a major party’s nominee riles up his supporters and repeats the lie that the election is ‘rigged,’ the failure of Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell to affirm the fairness of our democratic process and condemn Donald Trump’s comments is complicity,” they wrote, referring to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Both men have endorsed Trump, although they’ve declined to talk about it in the past week, after the presidential nominee faced intense backlash from within the party over audio of him bragging about using his celebrity to sexually assault women and in the aftermath, allegations from a dozen women that he did just that. Ryan said last week that he would no longer defend Trump and his office has commented on statements from Trump that the election could be rigged, despite Reid and Pelosi implying the contrary.“Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement on Saturday. McConnell has been totally silent on Trump’s comments on a rigged election over the past several days. A spokesman for McConnell said Saturday that he would not be putting out a statement, and said the same on Monday. Typically, the losing candidate in an election concedes to the winner. But Trump has been planting seeds for months that indicate that he may not go so easily if Hillary Clinton wins, by inflating the threat of voter fraud and, in the process, seeking to undermine the faith of millions of Americans in the electoral process. Multiple studies have shown that actual instances of voter fraud are very rare, although nearly half of Americans think it happens very often or somewhat often, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released last month.Trump’s comments appear to be having an effect: Thirty-seven percent of Trump supporters say they will reject the election’s legitimacy if he doesn’t win, while 23 percent of Clinton supporters say the same. The issue is racially charged ― laws to crack down on voter fraud disproportionately affect minorities ― and Trump has told mostly white crowds to watch the polling places in “certain areas” on Election Day, implying vote rigging will happen in predominantly black and Hispanic areas.Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), has gotten on the “rigged election” bandwagon as well. On Monday, he warned of voter fraud and asked supporters to “respectfully” watch local polling places. He also said the media was conspiring against the Trump-Pence ticket in favor of Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.“I have no doubt the national media is trying to rig this election with their biased coverage in Hillary Clinton’s favor,” Pence said at a rally in Ohio.Reid and Pelosi noted that there are issues that affect Election Day, such as long lines and broken voting machines, plus “the unprecedented factor of a hostile foreign government seeking to influence the outcome,” referring to allegations that the Russia is to blame for email hacking at the Democratic National Convention, as well as targeting individuals in the Clinton campaign. But Reid and Pelosi said that the overall issue of faith in the democratic process “is bigger than any of us and bigger than this election.”“This is about each of us doing our part to ensure the continued functioning of our democracy,” they said. “At some point, the good of the country must outweigh the instinct for political self-preservation.”Sam Stein contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

She apologized to the congregation for the political nature of her words about racism and black men dying at the hands of police.“We continue to feel the hate,” said the mother of two boys, adding later, “It’s a hard thing to swallow.”The funeral program said Scott had a fresh outlook on life after being badly hurt but surviving a motorcycle accident last November.In an interview aired on CBS this week, Rakeyia Scott said she believed the medication her husband took for his injuries had caused him to be confused by police officers’ demands.An independent autopsy released by the family on Wednesday showed Scott had gunshot wounds in his back, abdomen and wrist.His funeral service was initially planned for last week but was postponed as Hurricane Matthew bore down on the region.“I think the hurricane was Uncle Keith being humorous,” said his niece Kaona Mercer, 26, a paralegal in Columbia. “He wasn’t ready for us to bury him yet. He was a free-spirited, loving man.”(Reporting by Harriet McLeod; Additional reporting and writing by Colleen Jenkins; Editing by Bernard Orr)"

What ensued was a deeply personal conversation about the spiritual influences that have guided Clinton throughout her life.The interview, republished by The Washington Post on Monday, serves as an important reminder of the candidate’s religious foundations ― especially given recent claims that Clinton has waged a “war on religious Americans.”“I’ve tried to lead an integrated life and so the spiritual, the emotional, the psychological, and physical, and all of that ― I’m not there, I don’t want to mislead you. But I’m trying very hard to have that be the primary purpose of my life,” Clinton told journalist Martha Sherrill. The two discussed Clinton’s religious upbringing and particularly the important youth pastor who helped her hone her inner spiritual landscape.“The church I grew up in was very child-oriented, very supportive of kids in their early years as they tried to find their way through faith, not in a dogmatic way, but in a real open way in which anything could be discussed,” Clinton said. “No question was out of bounds. And I think that gave me a grounding in my faith that has sustained me.”Clinton ― and many of her family members past and present ― is Methodist and inherited her faith from her father. As a teenager, Clinton received guidance from her youth minister, Don Jones, who helped her see religion as a vehicle for social change.“He gave a sense of social mission and personal commitment to faith that I found very unifying,” she said.Even after Jones left the Illinois community where Clinton and her family worshipped, the two stayed in contact for decades to come. When Jones died in 2009, Clinton commented that the former youth minister had “helped guide me on a spiritual and political journey of over 40 years.”Sherrill noted that Jones had once described Clinton as someone who would be embarrassed to find herself in a leadership position.“I think that’s an interesting thing for him to say,” Clinton responded. “I don’t have any personal desire to be in any particular position. That has never been my goal. I have a burning desire to do what I can to try to make the world around me, kind of going out in concentric circles maybe, better for everybody.”Despite Clinton’s frequent discussion of her Methodist faith, the candidate has struggled to gain the support of Protestant Americans. An October survey by Public Religion Research Institute found that white mainline Protestant voters are equally split between Clinton and Donald Trump. Nearly two-thirds of white evangelicals favor Trump.When critics accuse Clinton of being anti-religion, they fail to acknowledge the fact that religion is fundamental to who she is.“The spiritual part of my life is a very important element to me in defining who I am and what I care about,” Clinton told The Washington Post in 1993. “It’s a real benchmark, I mean, when I disappoint myself because of the way that I have treated somebody, or behaved, it’s against a backdrop of believing that, you know, there’s some effort I should make to try to be better than that, and it’s something very personal with me.”For the full interview, head over to The Washington Post."

The IACP includes 23,000 police officials from across the United States, The Washington Post reports.“We must forge a path that allows us to move beyond our history and identify common solutions to better protect our communities,” Cunningham said. “For our part, the first step in this process is for law enforcement and the IACP to acknowledge and apologize for the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in society’s historical mistreatment of communities of color.”“There have been times when law enforcement officers, because of the laws enacted by federal, state and local governments, have been the face of oppression for far too many of our fellow citizens,” he continued. “In the past, the laws adopted by our society have required police officers to perform many unpalatable tasks, such as ensuring legalized discrimination or even denying the basic rights of citizenship to many of our fellow Americans.” Cunningham has a point. The relationship between law enforcement and communities of color has long been strained ― especially for African-Americans. Modern-day police forces grew out of slave patrols (at least in the South). During the height of the Jim Crow era, police officers were tasked with maintaining state-sanctioned racial oppression. “While this is no longer the case, this dark side of our shared history has created a multigenerational ― almost inherited ― mistrust between many communities of color and their law enforcement agencies,” Cunningham said. But racial discrimination in policing didn’t end with Jim Crow. Police officers are still required to enforce racially discriminatory laws ― such as SB 1070, an immigration law in Arizona that requires police to check the immigration status of anyone they think is in the country illegally. Or New York’s “stop and frisk” policy, which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in New York in 2013 for violating the Fourth Amendment rights of black and Latino New Yorkers. Commenters on social media reacted to Cunningham’s remarks by pointing this out:As movements like Black Lives Matter note, people of color ― especially African-Americans ― are disproportionately killed, harassed and stopped by the police for mundane reasons. Because of this, trust toward the police is far lower in communities of color.Cunningham is certainly aware of this: He pointed to the high-profile police shootings of unarmed black people that have “tragically undermined the trust that the public must and should have in their police departments.” “Many officers who do not share this common heritage often struggle to comprehend the reasons behind this historic mistrust,” Cunningham said. “As a result, they are often unable to bridge this gap and connect with some segments of their communities.” You can read Cunningham’s full remarks below:I would like to take a moment to address a significant and fundamental issue confronting our profession, particularly within the United States. Clearly, this is a challenging time for policing. Events over the past several years have caused many to question the actions of our officers and has tragically undermined the trust that the public must and should have in their police departments. At times such as this, it is our role as leaders to assess the situation and take the steps necessary to move forward."

But as Hoornstra noted, there’s a fairly likely explanation: The Mexican-American first baseman probably isn’t fond of the derogatory comments Donald Trump has made about Mexicans during his presidential campaign.Gonzalez has taken vocal political stands on immigration issues in the past. In 2010, he was among the players who spoke out forcefully against Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration law, and he briefly threatened to boycott the 2011 MLB All-Star Game in Phoenix.“It’s immoral,” Gonzalez said of the Arizona law in 2010. “They’re violating human rights. In a way, it goes against what this country was built on. This is discrimination. Are they going to pass out a picture saying, ‘You should look like this and you’re fine, but if you don’t, do people have the right to question you?’ That’s profiling.”The Dodgers aren’t staying at the Trump International during their NLCS matchup with the Cubs, the team told the Press-Telegram, because of logistical problems. Gonzalez, meanwhile, is hardly only American who has avoided Trump’s hotels and other businesses because of the positions the Republican presidential nominee has staked out during the campaign.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Kushner, who owns the New York Observer, contacted LionTree founder and chief executive Aryeh Bourkoff within the past couple months, according to the paper. Trump denied last month that he’s had any talks about starting a media company, whether alongside disgraced former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who has recently advised him, or other conservative media figures. Ailes reportedly has a non-compete clause that could prevent him from launching a Fox News competitor. But a source close to Trump told HuffPost the Republican nominee assumes Ailes would be involved in a post-election media venture, presuming that a compensation package large enough would entice him in. “Trump is saying, ‘I’m not going to give up trying to be president, but just in case it doesn’t happen, I want to have a voice for me and my people ... we will not lose the voice we’ve built,’” the source said. The Republican nominee often refers to “the stunningly large numbers of persons who voted for me in the primary,” according to the source.Vanity Fair reported in June on Trump’s media plans and noted that Kushner said at a dinner party how “the people here don’t understand what I’m seeing” and that “you go to these arenas and people go crazy for him.” The New York Times added in August that Trump and Kushner had “quietly explored becoming involved with a media holding, either by investing in one or by taking one over.”But even if Kushner contacted Bourkoff, Politico’s Mike Allen reported Monday that the LionTree executive has no interest in working with TrumpKushner, the scion of a New Jersey real estate family who married Trump’s daughter Ivanka in 2009, has been one of Trump’s closest advisers. One Trump source recently told The New Yorker that Kushner ― who keeps a low profile and rarely gives interviews ― has been Trump’s “real campaign manager.”A Kushner representative didn’t respond to a request for comment on Monday. In addition to Kushner and Ailes,Trump could presumably also turn to Steve Bannon, who left the conservative nationalist news site Breitbart in August to head up Trump’s campaign. Bannon has previously said he’d return to Breitbart after the election. It’s unprecedented for a major party nominee to be considering how to profit off his support before an election’s over. And conversations about a post-election media startup reportedly began long before Trump’s poll numbers dropped. While speculation has centered around the idea of “Trump TV,” launching an entirely new cable television channel would be very difficult and costly. The Al Jazeera Media Network spent $500 million to buy Current TV as a way to gain distribution into 60 million homes for a future U.S.-based channel. The Qatar-owned media company, which built a large-scale television operation based in New York, lost another half a billion dollars before shutting down after two years of failing to attract an audience. Trump could go the subscription-based digital TV route ― though another conservative media star, Sarah Palin, failed to make such a venture work.The source close to Trump suggested he’d likely seek well-financed partners who already have the advertising and cable distribution in place, rather than trying to start from scratch. “They’ve always partnered with somebody who had money and know how,” the source said. “They wouldn’t say, ‘Let’s go start a media empire.’ They’d say, ‘Let’s see who already has access to cable.’”This story has been updated to include comments from a source close to Donald Trump and a tweet from Mike Allen."

The news outlet reported that three former staffers of the reality show claimed that Trump ― who was the host of show at the time ― had repeatedly called Lil Jon an “Uncle Tom” after the rapper put on a Uncle Sam costume to help promote a product his team was pitching. “Look, he’s Uncle Tom!” one staffer reportedly said Trump yelled during the show at least twice.The Daily Beast reported that the same staffer explained to them how Trump was “tone-deaf to the racially charged history of the term, which is used to deride a black man deemed to be subservient to white people.” Lil Jon’s statement confirmed the name-calling and that he had to explain to Trump why the term was so offensive. “When this ‘Uncle Tom’ incident happened on ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ in the boardroom several of my cast mates and I addressed Mr. Trump immediately when we heard the comment,” the rapper wrote. “I can’t say if he knew what he was actually saying or not but he did stop using that term once we explained it’s offensiveness.”Lil Jon starred on the “All-Star” version of the show during season 13 alongside other black celebrities like Dennis Rodman and Omarosa Manigault, both of whom are avid supporters of Trump’s run for president. In fact, Manigault is now Trump’s director of African American outreach, which has turned into a campaign effort that is as dismal as the descriptions Trump has painted of black Americans.Lil Jon says not to count him among Trump’s small bunch of black supporters. “I also want to be clear that I don’t agree with many of the statements Mr. Trump has said during his current run for president,” he said. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Correction: An earlier version of this story reported incorrectly that Trump continued to use the slur after its meaning had been explained."

Two fearless souls are being sought to spend the night inside Dracula’s castle this Oct. 31.“Dracula” author Bram Stoker’s great-grandnephew Dacre Stoker is throwing open the doors to Bran Castle in Transylvania, Romania, for the lucky winners of an Airbnb contest.Playing the role of “Dracula” character Jonathan Harker, he’ll greet them as they arrive by horse-drawn carriage to the castle ― where the 15th-century prince Vlad the Impaler, who inspired Stoker’s 1897 gothic horror story, once stayed.He’ll then treat the duo to a candlelit dinner, before leading them to the crypt for their night’s sleep inside velvet-trimmed coffins. “I want to make it both realistic and show the legend in the wonderful country that birthed the whole thing,” Dacre Stoker told The Associated Press.While the stay will undoubtedly be a dream (or nightmare) come true for fans of the Irish writer’s terrifying novel, guests must still abide by certain house rules. Garlic or garlic-scented items are forbidden, as is silver jewelry and making any “cross” signs during the stay. They must also “close all curtains before sunrise” and avoid taking mirror selfies. “The count is not a fan.”To have a chance of becoming the first people to stay overnight at the castle since 1948, entrants have to state what they’d say to Count Dracula if they ended up coming “face-to-fang” with him.“Show us your vampiric wit,” Airbnb urges on its website. The entry window closes on Oct. 26. See more pictures of the castle here:"
30,THE WORLDPOST,Survivors Of Rape And Forced Marriage Seek Justice In Cambodia's Khmer Rouge Trials,"Nina Teggarty, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-legacy-of-the-khmer-rouge-on-trial_us_58014ffde4b0162c043c2405,"In Cambodia, the U.N.-backed Khmer Rouge tribunal hears from survivors of forced marriage, but critics say the court should",2016-10-17,"In January, witness Math Sor spoke to the Khmer Rouge tribunal about the treatment of Cham people by the regime. The current trial is hearing from survivors of forced marriage to decide if the regime’s top leaders committed crimes against humanity.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58015042170000bc16acc173.jpeg?cache=FhNBeznrch&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Cambodia, the U.N.-backed Khmer Rouge tribunal hears from survivors of forced marriage, but critics say the court should also cover other acts of gender-based violence.“I just couldn’t understand why falling in love was a crime,” says Youk Chhang, executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an organization that records atrocities that took place under the Khmer Rouge. From 1975–79, Pol Pot’s brutal regime devastated Cambodia, and an estimated 1.7 million people died from starvation or disease, or were executed.The Khmer Rouge, known as the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), controlled every part of people’s lives, even love and sexuality. Chhang was only 15 when he witnessed the Khmer Rouge killing a couple because “they fell in love without permission.” To make sure Cambodians married the “right” people, namely those who were loyal to the party, the CPK forced men and women to marry each other.Survivors of forced marriage are currently giving testimony in Case 002/02, the latest trial to take place at the Khmer Rouge tribunal in Phnom Penh, otherwise known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of Cambodia (ECCC). Evidence of forced marriage will be used to determine if senior leaders of the regime committed crimes against humanity.The Khmer Rouge used forced marriage to exact ultimate control over relationships, as couples were expected to procreate and produce the next generation of party adherents. No one knows how many people were forcibly married by “Angkar” (the communist party), but mass wedding ceremonies, some consisting of more than 100 couples, took place across Cambodia.Survivors appearing before the court have described how the regime pressured them to marry. “I refused [to marry] several times, but finally the sector committee said I was a stubborn person,” Sa Lay Hieng said in court. Scared of being killed, Hieng was coerced into marrying a man she did not like. Another witness, who was granted anonymity, said she was made to marry a Khmer Rouge officer in a collective ceremony; when she refused his advances on their wedding night, her new spouse complained to his commander, who then raped her. “I had to bite my lip and shed my tears, but I didn’t dare to make any noise, because I was afraid I would be killed,” she said. She was eventually led back to her husband.The final testimonies relating to forced marriage will be heard in the coming weeks. But some experts argue that other heinous sexual crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge era, such as rape outside of forced marriage, have been overlooked by the court.In a study by the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization, an NGO that provides counseling to victims appearing before the court, a third of female interviewees witnessed rape outside forced marriage. This finding is echoed by the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has collected a “significant number of documents” detailing at least 156 cases of rape by Khmer Rouge comrades in cooperatives and detention centers. “The women who were raped were accused of having served in the CIA, KGB or other enemies of Angkar, and taken to be smashed [killed],” said Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center.Farina So, an expert in gender-based violence perpetrated by the Communist Party of Kampuchea, says that “hundreds and hundreds” of rapes occurred, adding that cadres “used it as a tool to victimize women, to silence them.” In the course of her research, So has interviewed numerous survivors of sexual assault; one of these women, Tang Kim, was considered “an enemy of Angkar” and in 1976 was rounded up – along with eight other women – and readied for execution in Kampong Chhnang province, central Cambodia. While Kim awaited her fate, she could hear the other women being raped and then murdered – “I was terrified to see people being killed off and buried one by one” – recalls Kim in a film made by the Cambodian Documentation Center. She continues, “I saw a Khmer Rouge soldier slashing a woman’s abdomen; they cut it open and took out the fetus.” After being gang-raped by the soldiers, Kim managed to escape and went into hiding.According to So, Kim tried to submit her civil party application to the Khmer Rouge tribunal, but it was rejected because prosecutors are addressing only sexual abuse within forced marriage. It was, says So, a decision that “really disappointed” Kim and other rape survivors, many of whom have spent decades summoning up the courage to speak about their ordeal.When Women & Girls Hub approached the Khmer Rouge tribunal to ask why the current trial is focusing exclusively on forced marriage, the court’s spokesperson, Lars Olsen, said co-investigating judges had concluded that rape outside forced marriage was not an official policy of the Khmer Rouge. He pointed to this statement from the tribunal: “Those who were accused of ‘immoral’ behavior, including rape, were often re-educated or killed [so] it cannot be considered that rape was one of the crimes used by CPK leaders to implement the common purpose.”The survivors and their lawyers, who campaigned for years to have forced marriage added to the list of crimes prosecuted in court, are waiting for the expected judgment in late 2017.This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

Far from it. And throughout history, no matter the bullshit thrown their way, women have somehow mustered up the power to fight back and push forward. Sometimes, this even happens topless. A series of badass watercolors by artist Nadine Faraj celebrates the many women who have bared all to challenge the patriarchy and rebel against everyone who thinks women should sit quietly and look pretty while men determine the destinies of their bodies and minds. In her series “Naked Revolt,” Faraj depicts activist women from around the world who have used their bodies as feminist weapons.From the BlackOUT Collective in San Francisco to the Ukrainian group FEMEN based in France, from Muslim feminists in the Middle East to students in Canada and South Africa, Faraj’s subjects are real-life activists who crusade for the right of women to possess and express their own bodies without being endangered, demeaned, or accused of narcissism or promiscuity.One painting depicts Tunisian filmmaker Nadia El Fani, who, in 2013, posted an image of herself on Facebook with a statement on her chest: “My body belongs to me and is not the source of anyone’s honour.” The photo was taken in support of Amina (Tyler) Sbouï, a Tunisian women’s rights activist and former member of FEMEN who was detained as a result of her protests.The caption of El Fani’s photograph sums up the importance of the series: “If a person performs a subversive act, then that act becomes political and it must be analyzed as such! When someone self-immolates in public, we get the message ... It is time to stop considering women’s nudity as exhibitionism, especially when they use their bodies for self-expression!”Faraj uses what her gallery describes as a “wet technique,” which allows paints to seep and ooze into the paper. The resulting portraits seem to reject descriptions like “pretty” or “sexy,” instead embodying an untamed energy that mimics their inner fire.“I consider that my figures resist objectification by being so distorted,” Faraj explained in an interview with ArtFile Magazine. “The grotesque blurring and blemishes that appear imbue them with a fearsome power ― some really are frightening. They aren’t attractive like traditional nudes who are ready to seduce. They show their wild side as a display of their unpredictability. They’re a little dangerous.”If you are feeling like these past few weeks have been a dark, depressing hole of misogynist garbage and rotting male fragility, may these playful and powerful watercolors of topless heroes give you life.

New arrivals in Kismayo tell Ashley Hamer they feel let down and afraid.KISMAYO, SOMALIA – On the outskirts of this commercial port town in Somalia’s southernmost, border state of Jubaland, makeshift displacement camps are swelling with vulnerable families.They are part of a wave of Somali refugees returning from neighboring Kenya under a U.N.-facilitated voluntary repatriation program, which many aid agencies say does not give refugees a genuine choice.Many returnees are dismayed by what they find upon return to Somalia. Outside Kismayo, some 16,000 newly arrived refugees are currently camped in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in meager shelters that they built themselves, with little access to medical care and no schools.In 2013, the Kenyan government, United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Somali federal government reached a collaborative agreement on “voluntary repatriation.” UNHCR is tasked with transporting the refugees back to Somalia; most by truck, some by air.Between December 2014 and the end of September 2016, 30,731 Somali refugees from Dadaab went through the repatriation process. Most of them – 24,630 refugees – returned to Somalia in 2016, amid mounting pressure from the Kenyan government.Kenya announced in May it would permanently close Dadaab refugee camp – home to more than 320,000 Somalis spanning several generations – and send all Somali refugees home by the end of 2016. Health care services in the camp had already been reduced since 2014, and food rations cut by a third.Some returnees who arrived in Kismayo this year said they chose repatriation because they could no longer feed their families in Dadaab. Others said they feared being forced to leave Kenya without any support at all if they didn’t; the UNHCR’s repatriation package provides cash allowances of around $2,400 per family of six over a period of six months after their arrival. It is unclear if and what type of support will be available after this period.Some refugees left spontaneously with the sanctioned waves of returnees and did not register their departure with UNHCR, rendering them ineligible for the repatriation aid package, according to staff at the Kismayo reception center.The majority of the returnees are women, children, the elderly and the disabled – “the most vulnerable sectors of society,” according to The American Refugee Committee, an aid group providing some health care and child protection in the camps.Yet there is very limited health care for the returnees living in the camps, and medical care in Kismayo town is expensive. The camps have few decent running water sources or latrines, leaving thousands of people at risk of disease.Families arriving in Kismayo discover a fragile town with little infrastructure that cannot provide basic food and shelter, let alone facilitate their resettlement in Somalia.Amid such precarious circumstances, many returnees expressed great concern over how they can possibly restart their lives.“In Somalia, there’s no water, no schools … despite the promises they made, the U.N. backtracked from them. The house you see there I built myself,” says 44-year-old Hubi Abdullahi Aden, a mother who managed to raise and educate seven children in Dadaab. She, like many others who have returned to Kismayo, fears an impending onset of violence.In the months before September, UNHCR and its partners were transporting up to 400 people a day across the border into Somalia. In September, Jubaland state authorities suspended the returns process, saying local services were overwhelmed, and the repatriation process amounted to the “dumping of human beings in an undignified way.”Local Jubaland authorities say the camps outside Kismayo are spontaneous settlements, and the returnees are essentially “squatting” on land that was not officially set aside for them.There is a large reception center in Kismayo that was built in 2014 and is equipped to accommodate up to 500 people per day. Returnees can stay at the reception centre for 48 hours after their arrival, but it is not clear how they are expected to organize their land and shelter after this time, and thousands are soon stranded in the displacement camps.Meanwhile, the Kismayo area is already sheltering some 40,000 people displaced internally by conflict, and the services available are barely adequate to support a vulnerable host population.Further, despite some significant gains in stability, Somalia is essentially a war zone. Fighting is ongoing between al-Shabab militants and the Western-backed African Union and Somali national forces.Kismayo was only liberated from al-Shabab in 2012. A fragile peace is maintained by local security forces, but outside the town’s premises, much of Jubaland state remains an inaccessible battleground with dangers of violence spilling over to other parts of the country.Contrary to the terms they accepted when signing the repatriation agreement, the federal government of Somalia cannot always access semi-autonomous Jubaland to support and resettle the returnees due to instability, says Jubaland State’s justice minister Adam Ibrahim Aw Hirsi.“On one hand we are conducting national elections, on another we are fighting al- Shabab and [on] a third hand we are dealing with returning refugees and the IDPs [internally displaced people] that were already here, and our own communities,” Hirsi says. “We don’t have the financial and human capacity to deal with all of this.”Meanwhile, a central condition of the repatriation package is that the returnees give up their refugee status in Kenya.

It is unclear if and what type of support will be available after this period.Some refugees left spontaneously with the sanctioned waves of returnees and did not register their departure with UNHCR, rendering them ineligible for the repatriation aid package, according to staff at the Kismayo reception center.The majority of the returnees are women, children, the elderly and the disabled – “the most vulnerable sectors of society,” according to The American Refugee Committee, an aid group providing some health care and child protection in the camps.Yet there is very limited health care for the returnees living in the camps, and medical care in Kismayo town is expensive. The camps have few decent running water sources or latrines, leaving thousands of people at risk of disease.Families arriving in Kismayo discover a fragile town with little infrastructure that cannot provide basic food and shelter, let alone facilitate their resettlement in Somalia.Amid such precarious circumstances, many returnees expressed great concern over how they can possibly restart their lives.“In Somalia, there’s no water, no schools … despite the promises they made, the U.N. backtracked from them. The house you see there I built myself,” says 44-year-old Hubi Abdullahi Aden, a mother who managed to raise and educate seven children in Dadaab. She, like many others who have returned to Kismayo, fears an impending onset of violence.In the months before September, UNHCR and its partners were transporting up to 400 people a day across the border into Somalia. In September, Jubaland state authorities suspended the returns process, saying local services were overwhelmed, and the repatriation process amounted to the “dumping of human beings in an undignified way.”Local Jubaland authorities say the camps outside Kismayo are spontaneous settlements, and the returnees are essentially “squatting” on land that was not officially set aside for them.There is a large reception center in Kismayo that was built in 2014 and is equipped to accommodate up to 500 people per day. Returnees can stay at the reception centre for 48 hours after their arrival, but it is not clear how they are expected to organize their land and shelter after this time, and thousands are soon stranded in the displacement camps.Meanwhile, the Kismayo area is already sheltering some 40,000 people displaced internally by conflict, and the services available are barely adequate to support a vulnerable host population.Further, despite some significant gains in stability, Somalia is essentially a war zone. Fighting is ongoing between al-Shabab militants and the Western-backed African Union and Somali national forces.Kismayo was only liberated from al-Shabab in 2012. A fragile peace is maintained by local security forces, but outside the town’s premises, much of Jubaland state remains an inaccessible battleground with dangers of violence spilling over to other parts of the country.Contrary to the terms they accepted when signing the repatriation agreement, the federal government of Somalia cannot always access semi-autonomous Jubaland to support and resettle the returnees due to instability, says Jubaland State’s justice minister Adam Ibrahim Aw Hirsi.“On one hand we are conducting national elections, on another we are fighting al- Shabab and [on] a third hand we are dealing with returning refugees and the IDPs [internally displaced people] that were already here, and our own communities,” Hirsi says. “We don’t have the financial and human capacity to deal with all of this.”Meanwhile, a central condition of the repatriation package is that the returnees give up their refugee status in Kenya. If violence worsens in Somalia, they will be left with few options.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

An Oregon church is apologizing for banning overweight and obese people from its worship team.Guidelines from the New Creation Church, a non-denominational Christian organization in the Portland suburb of Hillsboro, banned members with “excessive weight” from the team.“Weight is something that many people have to deal with,” the guidelines said, according to The Christian Times. “Make sure that you are taking care of your temple, exercising and eating properly.”The church later apologized, writing on its website: “There has been some media circulating about our Worship Team Guidelines. Forgive us if we offended anyone. That certainly was not our intention. These guidelines have never been used to discriminate against anyone and have never been enforced.”New Creation Church Pastor Rebecca Sundholm told the Oregonian she was “dumbfounded” by the controversy as the guidelines were written years ago and had not been enforced. “What’s funny is this has nothing to do with anybody else but our church,” she was quoted as saying. “If anybody looked at our worship team, they would see they aren’t all skinny.”It’s not yet clear if the guidelines have been updated, as they were removed from the church’s website after going viral late last month. However, they were still online in a number of places, including here.The guidelines also offered some very detailed expectations for both appearance and personal hygiene. For example, chewing gum was forbidden, but members of the worship team were urged to use breath mints. They were expected to use “effective deodorant” but not “excessive colognes or perfumes.” There were also rules forbidding visible tattoos, excessive piercings, tight shirts, sneakers and shoes with white soles. “You must be in 100% agreement for you to flow with our team and in order for the anointing to flow through you,” the guidelines stated. Sundholm told the Oregonian that the requirements were taken out of context.“We have standards just like anybody would have standards in a business,” she said. "

John McCain (R-Ariz.) appears to be changing his tune ― and may be signaling that more unprecedented obstruction is on the horizon if Hillary Clinton wins the White House.“I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up. I promise you,” McCain said Monday, according to CNN.The senator made the comments during a Pennsylvania radio interview in which he threw support behind his colleague Pat Toomey, who is struggling in the polls and may be key to Republicans retaining control of the Senate.“This is the strongest argument I can make” for Pat Toomey’s re-election, McCain said, and that is “so we can make sure there is not three places on the United States Supreme Court that will change this country for decades.”Three justices will be in their 80s during the next administration, making the prospect of retirement and more vacancies likely.The Arizona senator didn’t specify if Senate unification against any Supreme Court nomination by a President Clinton means not holding confirmation hearings or taking a vote on them at all ― as they have done to Obama’s choice, Merrick Garland, already the longest-waiting nominee in history ― or if it means voting them down no matter who the nominees are.He also didn’t note whether other senators are in on this new strategy. But last week, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah indicated he might be ready to reject any name Clinton puts forward, under a theory that Democratic nominees to the high court don’t vote “independently” from party interests.As with many other things this campaign season, none of this may matter. Later on Monday, McCain, through a spokeswoman, reversed course on his earlier remarks about future Clinton nominees and noted he’d “vote for or against that individual based on their qualification,” according to Talking Points Memo.The comments come amid a push by the Clinton campaign to spend aggressively in McCain’s home state, where Clinton is inching up on Trump in the polls, as well as plans for first lady Michelle Obama to visit Arizona on Thursday and do what she does best.As for where Clinton and Trump stand on the Supreme Court, both candidates will likely be asked about it again at the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, where Fox News’ Chris Wallace is expected to dedicate 15 minutes to the subject.Ahead of the debate, Clinton has already offered a vision of what her nominees might look like, while Trump has drawn up a not-so-short shortlist of potential candidates that was strong enough to get constitutionalist Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to bow to the Republican nominee.McCain walked back his comments Monday afternoon, and this article has been updated to reflect that."

The actor reportedly kicked the 25-year-old rapper out of his hotel room on Saturday night after she made some gruesome threats toward Crowe and his guests, according to TMZ. Multiple witnesses shared their accounts of the night with the website, and at least four of these individuals reportedly provided statements during the investigation.TMZ notes that Crowe had invited around 10 guests to his hotel room for a low-key evening with dinner and music. Among those guests was rapper RZA, who brought Banks as his plus one. Things reportedly turned sour when Banks began laughing at Crowe’s music choices ― we take it he wasn’t playing “212” on repeat ― before calling him and a few others “boring white men.”One female guest reportedly tried to step in, but witnesses told the site that the rapper went on to threaten Crowe and his guests. Banks reportedly said, “You would love it if I broke my glass, stabbed you guys in the throat, and blood would squirt everywhere like some real Tarantino s**t.” Guests described Banks’ behavior as “erratic,” according to TMZ. The outlet reports Crowe stayed pretty calm throughout the ordeal, but when the rapper reached for a glass and cocked it back, the Oscar-winning actor is said to have wrapped Banks in a tight “bear hug” and carried her out of his room. Security guards were then alerted about the situation and removed Banks from the hotel grounds. The “Liquorice” rapper’s version of the events are drastically different. Banks reportedly accused Crowe of assaulting her, spitting on her and calling her the n-word. She apparently detailed the experience on Facebook and deleted it, but not before screenshots were taken. In the update, she reportedly wrote, “Last night was one of the hardest nights of sleep I had in a long time.” Banks did leave up one telling Facebook post, however.It’s unclear at this point who’s side of the hotel altercation is accurate. The Huffington Post has reached out to representatives for both Crowe and Banks and will update this post accordingly. "

During the 2014-2015 school year, 83.2 percent of students graduated in four years, up nearly a percentage point from the previous year, when 82.3 percent of students got a diploma. The nation’s high school graduation rate has risen steadily since 2010-2011, when states started using a consistent, four-year adjusted standard to measure high school completion. During that first year, only 79 percent of high schoolers graduated. Graduation rates during 2014-2015 grew for every reported student subgroup, including American Indian/Alaskan Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, blacks, whites, low-income students, students with disabilities and English language learners, according to the White House. However, achievement gaps persisted. Asian/Pacific Islander students had the highest graduation rates, at 90.2 percent, followed by white students, at 87.6 percent. On the other end of the spectrum, American Indian/Alaska Native students had a graduation rate of 71.6 percent. Students with disabilities and English language learners graduated at rates of 64.6 percent and and 65.1 percent, respectively.Since 2010-2011, English language learners have made the most progress of any student subgroup, improving their graduation rates 8.1 percentage points. Black students have also made substantial progress during that time, with graduation rates improving 7.6 points.President Barack Obama is expected to discuss the gains Monday while speaking at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, a magnet school in Washington, D.C.

Michelle Obama said it best with “the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls”. If in 2016, US Presidential candidate Donald Trump can refer to his predatory sexual remarks of women as “Locker Room” talk and Nigerian President Buhari can refer to his wife as “belonging to my kitchen, living room and other rooms” then the pursuit of equal social, political, economic and personal rights for women remains an uphill struggle. Prominent men and women in politics have a responsibility to ensure that their words do not have a degenerating assumed or presumed impact on progress. From executive board rooms and businesses to homes, such remarks can have the particularly disturbing effect of perpetuating the disrespect women have endured for centuries and send the wrong message to the corporate and business world as well as the younger generation. Undoubtedly, both Trump and Buhari regret these remarks in light of the backlash from the media and public. While their remarks are by no means indicative of the majority view of men who are offended by their statements, it is my opinion that these remarks suggest an underlying prevalent thinking that is still present in our male dominated world. It represents unconscious prejudice towards women.There must be a strong and unrelenting message from society that women will no longer be consigned to inferior positions whether at home, in the workplace or any other capacity. The modern woman is the first born of a mobile generation of independent, ambitious and able leaders. We are homemakers, highly driven career professionals, business owners and much more. Women have been doing this for centuries and should be respected and recognised for it. The fight is not over for the recognition of women as indispensable leaders in the society and this condition of unconscious prejudice has no place in our society today. It is regressive not progressive, disrespectful not respectful and divisive not inclusive. Feminist men should rise up and be outspoken on this issue - don’t just speak, practice what you preach. Demonstrate at home and work that equal rights for all gender is critical for the exponential growth of society.Society must not be complacent in nipping unconscious prejudice in the bud whether in public or the privacy of our homes. Unconscious prejudice in the minds of men or women is a subtle beast permeating progress like a drifting mist in the calm before the break out of a storm.Let’s advance forward with one voice."

But even if Trump did so, the surrogate added, it would be fair game, because looks are “germane to the discussion” about sexual assault.After eight women came forward last week to accuse Trump of sexual assault or harassment (bringing the total number of his alleged victims to 12), the nominee has repeatedly denigrated his accusers by implying they are not attractive.On Thursday, he attacked the appearance of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter who wrote that Trump tried to assault her while she was writing a profile of him in 2005.“Take a look. You take a look. Look at her,” Trump said at a rally in Florida. “I don’t think so. I don’t think so.”To clarify, Trump surrogate and conservative commentator A.J. Delgado told MSNBC on Sunday that the GOP nominee was not referring to Stoynoff’s looks.“I don’t think he was commenting on her looks. They took his remark from the rally,” she said. “I was with him that day where he said, ‘Look at her.’ I use the phrase, ‘Look at Hillary Clinton,’ when I’m referring to the person or the story.”Delgado then argued that, even if the real estate mogul and former reality TV star were actually referring to Stoynoff’s looks, it would be acceptable, because “when you have somebody claiming that you sexually assaulted them, you have brought looks into the equation.”“Mr. Trump isn’t referring to anybody’s looks. To the degree that he does perhaps, I don’t think he was referring to her looks. If he did, when you have somebody claiming that you sexually assaulted them, you have brought looks into the equation,” Delgado said.“If somebody said, ‘A.J. was attracted to me and touched me in an inappropriate manner,’ it’s relevant to the discussion whether that person is the type of person that I would normally be attracted to,” Delgado continued. “He hasn’t mentioned looks. If he did, it would be germane to the discussion. I wouldn’t find that offensive.”Trump has repeatedly attacked the women who have come forward with allegations. In addition to Stoynoff, Trump mocked multiple other women at a rally on Friday, and even pantomimed groping them.“Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you,” he said of one accuser.Of another, he said, “When you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said, ‘I don’t think so.’”And Trump again referred to Stoynoff, saying: “She’s a liar. Check out her Facebook page. You’ll understand.”The GOP presidential nominee has a long history of objectifying women and negatively commenting on their looks. In 1996, he fat-shamed Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, calling her “Miss Piggy” and bringing a camera crew to a gym where she was exercising.In an infamous feud with Rosie O’Donnell, which started in 2006, he called the actress and talk show host “a slob” and “a very unattractive person” with “a fat, ugly face.” And earlier this year, he mocked GOP primary rival Carly Fiorina, telling supporters: “Look at that face!

There were more than 40 protesters involved an hour before the game began, Blue said, with the number expected to grow by kickoff.The groups, which gathered in a parking lot near the stadium before the game, carried signs that read “Black Lives Matter” and “Protest is Patriotic,” and others that bore the faces of famous athletes who have protested during sporting events. The groups marched from the lot to the stadium, where they planned to kneel during the anthem as it played inside. Buffalo News reporter Nick Veronica posted a video of the march on Twitter:The 49ers-Bills game took on political significance this week when San Francisco coach Chip Kelly announced that Kaepernick would start in place of the struggling Blaine Gabbert. Bills head coach Rex Ryan is a supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has spoken out against Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement during the campaign. Ryan introduced Trump at a Buffalo campaign rally in April.Some Buffalo fans pushed back against Kaepernick’s protests before the game, with T-shirts and signs telling him to “shut up and stand up.” Some fans booed and chanted “U-S-A” before the game began, according to reports.Blue said the protests received a mixed response from fans before the game.“We expect there to be naysayers, we expect there to be people against us,” Blue said. “We’ve also seen lots of people that say they love what we’re doing.”The protesters are also challenging Ryan’s support of Trump, who has faced a spate of sexual assault allegations in the last week.“Rex endorses him, and continues to do so, even after Trump has talked about sexually assaulting women. We want people to know that’s not what Buffalo stands for at all,” Blue said.“Some of the fans don’t really care, and that’s a problem,” she continued. “They should care about who’s representing them.”"

Naturally, they killed it. As RiRi left the stage, McCartney couldn’t help but joke about her age, considering the festival’s main demographic ― it was dubbed “Oldchella” due to its lineup of classic rock acts such as McCartney, Neil Young, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Roger Waters and Bob Dylan. “We finally found someone under the age of 50,” he said. Last week, McCartney was joined onstage by Young. Those two also gave the crowd a repeat of that performance this weekend, playing Beatles hits “A Day in the Life” and “Why Don’t We Do It in the Road?” as well as John Lennon’s “Give Peace a Chance.” "

Mike Crapo is one of several Republican lawmakers facing backlash for his decision to abandon Trump.,2016-10-16,Republicans are tying themselves in knots trying to decide whether to support Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5803ca931b0000e218ef764f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maybe Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) should have taken part in the town hall debate for undecided voters last week.The Republican senator, who’s seeking re-election to a fourth term, originally endorsed Donald Trump for president, despite the firebrand’s long history of offensive statements and dubious record as a conservative. In May, Crapo said, “Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee and I will support his nomination.”Then, after a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video in which Trump bragged about sexual assault surfaced last week, Crapo seemed to rescind his endorsement. Trump’s “disrespectful, profane and demeaning” comments, Crapo declared, should make him ineligible for the highest office in the land. But now Crapo appears to be experiencing a recent political phenomenon that might be called unendorser’s remorse.Like other vulnerable Republicans who abandoned their nominee a month out from the election, Crapo is taking some serious heat back home from GOP voters and party officials. Idaho County Republicans went so far as to say they wouldn’t be putting up lawn signs for Crapo anymore. So in a televised debate on Friday night with his opponent, Democrat Jerry Sturgill, Crapo seemed to walk back his unendorsement of the Republican standard-bearer.Asked how he plans to vote on Nov. 8, Crapo suggested that casting a ballot for Trump was still a possibility, according to the Spokesman-Review. “I haven’t decided yet,” the senator said. He went on to say that he would certainly not vote for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. (There are eight choices on Idaho’s presidential ballot, according to Ballotpedia.)“Frankly, I believe the country is conflicted over this, because we have choices that are frankly disappointing to the country,” Crapo said. “And I’m facing that kind of decision myself.”So you can put a sitting U.S. senator in that small sliver of Americans who, after more than a year of presidential campaigning, still needs to hear more about the candidates before making a decision. Crapo isn’t the only Republican squirming over his defection from the Trump train. Several lawmakers who called for Trump to step down from the ticket after hearing the ”Access Hollywood” tape later said they would still vote for him. Some of them tried to argue that they had never really rescinded their endorsements.Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) all signaled that they believed Trump should step aside after his hot-mic remarks became public. But in the days that followed, they all confirmed that they would still support a Republican ticket with Trump as the headliner. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Correction: This post originally excluded some of the choices on Idaho’s presidential ballot.

Delegates at the talks would likely ratify the decision on Monday, the statement said.UNC president Vital Kamerhe is widely expected to become prime minister as part of the power-sharing government ushered in under the talks.Kabila, who came to power in 2001 when his father was assassinated, says he will respect the constitution but has yet to rule out attempting to change the country’s laws to enable him to run for a fresh term.The presidents of neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic changed their constitutions last year to allow themselves to stand for a third term, and Kabila’s opponents say they fear he will do the same.Hundreds of people have also died since last year in neighboring Burundi after its president Pierre Nkurunziza pursued and won a third term in office that his opponents say is unconstitutional.The head of the U.N. mission in Congo warned last week that the political impasse poses an “extreme risk” to stability.

The gathering seeks to add substance to the group that grew out of an acronym devised by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O’Neill back in 2003 that projected a long-term boom and global power shift in their favor.With Russia, Brazil and South Africa on the economic skids and China slowing, the initial euphoria has faded, yet Kamath said the BRICS had much to gain by deepening their cooperation.“The fact is that these countries, collectively, have for the last few years contributed to more than 50 percent of incremental economic wealth that has been generated globally,” said Kamath. “I don’t see that changing.”The NDB, headquartered in Shanghai, will expand its staff to 300 over the next three years but run a tight operation that seeks to take quick decisions and transfer experience across all fiveBRICS member states.It has already approved loans totaling $900 million to green projects in each member state. It has also started a renminbi-denominated borrowing program, issuing a 3 billion yuan ($450 million) bond.Kamath, 68, said there was plenty of room for new lenders like the NDB and the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), in addition to established institutions like the World Bank.“Infrastructure alone has needs globally of $1-1.5 trillion a year – all the multilateral banks put together can do maybe 15 percent of this,” said Kamath, who ran India’s ICICI Bank Ltd  from 1996 until 2009.“The phrase I would like to use is cooperate and work together, rather than compete. I don’t see competition as a key challenge in this context.”"

During the star’s performance at the Tidal X: 1015 concert in Brooklyn on Saturday night, Beyoncé’s earring apparently caught on her braid and got ripped out, leaving her ear bleeding on stage. Of course, she continued to perform as if nothing had happened.Bey noticed her bleeding earlobe while she was singing her song “Haunted.”In response, a few members of the Beyhive reportedly started cutting their ears in solidarity with Bey, sharing photos and messages with the hashtags #CutForBeyonce and #BleedForBeyonce on social media.Some of the images on social media are pretty graphic ― don’t say we didn’t warn you ― though it’s tough to say whether or not they’re real. (We hope they aren’t.) Some people sharing the hashtags may also just be trolls with too much time on their hands. Either way, the whole message is concerning, and if anyone is planning on cutting their ear for Beyoncé, please don’t.Of course, plenty of folks have spoken out about the so-called movement, calling it “stupid” and “outrageous.” One Twitter user also noted that self-harm is a serious issue that should not be turned into a joke. Self-harm or the desire to self-harm is not uncommon, especially among teens and young adults, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. While one common method is cutting yourself with a knife, it can also include burning yourself, pulling out hair, or another instance in which you hurt yourself on purpose. If this is what’s happening, get help.As Yahoo pointed out, the #CutForBeyonce and #BleedForBeyonce hashtags have existed for a few years, with the former first appearing in 2014 and the latter in 2013, after Bey didn’t win an award she was nominated for. A similar hashtag ― #CuttingForBieber ― popped up online in 2013 when Beliebers apparently started cutting themselves to encourage Justin Bieber to stop smoking weed. The whole thing turned out to be a disturbing hoax that stemmed from an even more disturbing 4chan joke set up to trick young fans into harming themselves.This needs to stop. As Beyoncé herself said, “don’t hurt yourself.” "

But if you don’t care about facts — if you deny them when they’re played for you on video — there’s nothing to constrain you from saying anything.As Josh Barro tweeted recently, “Trump’s people lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and they don’t even respect us enough to lie well.” How did we get here? We’ve always had dishonesty in politics, but how did we get to this point of utter shamelessness?KellyAnne Conway, Jason Miller, Rudy Giuliani, Newt Gingrich, and the rest all appear to be rational people. They have to know that they will carry the stink of this campaign for the rest of their lives. Whether Trump loses or (incredibly) wins, their reputations are destroyed.Ah. That’s it. Reputations don’t matter any more.We’ve replaced them with “brands.”And nothing destroys a brand, as long as it keeps selling.Newt Gingrich, for example, didn’t need the Trump campaign’s help to destroy his reputation. He long since did that himself. And yet he still gets booked all over cable TV, still gets paid to speak, still runs profitable scams.His brand still sells.When reputation mattered, it was a brake on perfidy. The fear of public shaming would cause even the most mendacious public figures to modulate their behavior.Now, shame is a monetizable commodity: just ask any celebrity who’s traveled the well-worn circuit of fame — humiliation — more fame.You can’t threaten a Trumpist with shame, because they’re wearing the reputational equivalent of suicide vests. Just like terrorists believe they’ll live on in paradise, Conway, Gingrich, and the rest believe — with reason — they’ll live on in media.We sophisticated moderns may be rediscovering, through its absence, the value of the archaic concept of honor. To the signers of the Declaration of Independence, honor was “sacred.” To us, it seems quaint.But what if we brought it back? Not exactly the old version, which was often tied to assumptions about class, gender, race, and censorship that we’ve rightly left behind, but one rooted in a basic reverence for democracy?Journalists often say of KellyAnne Conway that, despite the flagrant dishonesty, she’s “a professional,” or a “good person.” I understand the desire to preserve standards of civil discourse. But Conway and her colleagues are exploiting those standards, and in so doing they’re undermining democracy.They’re behaving dishonorably. Even in — or especially in — the most democratic society, there should be a cost for that."

Nearly 63% of men at one university who self-reported acts qualifying as rape or attempted rape admitted to committing repeat rapes.The statistics continue but these are the top three that are imperative to share.

Having to fight, and work relentlessly, to keep her kit from being destroyed Nguyen created a nonprofit called Rise.

64,ENTERTAINMENT,Why Are People So Excited About SNL's Toothless Trump?,"Michael Darer, ContributorStudent, Wesleyan University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-are-people-so-excited-about-snls-toothless-trump_us_5803da70e4b0985f6d157320,Effective satire of Donald Trump needs to be satire of America.,2016-10-16,"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE -- Alec Baldwin as Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump during the 'Debate Cold Open' sketch on October 1, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5804ca541b0000df1cef782b.jpeg?cache=h3arOuo6Bm&ops=crop_337_354_2109_1400%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to “Saturday Night Live” ― NBC’s flagship sketch comedy and variety show, which began airing in October of 1975 ― it seems as though audiences speak in hyperbole or not at all. If “SNL” enters the conversation on a Sunday morning, it will either be to assure readers and internet perusers that the show has unveiled some sort of devastating piece of political satire, or that once again the program is a 90-minute tire fire that its parent network should have extinguished right after Chevy Chase signed an eight picture contract with cocaine. There’s rarely an in between. Modern-day “SNL” is either an essential and vital part of the comic landscape or a disappointing shadow waiting to be euthanized.Luckily for Lorne Michaels and company, the tenor of discussion in the past few weeks has tended more towards the former than the latter. With the debut of Alec Baldwin’s Donald Trump impersonation (replacing Darrell Hammond), NBC’s old faithful has found its way back into Facebook newsfeeds and the hearts of bloggers looking to find the latest television clip to “eviscerate” conservative politicians.And indeed there have been aspects of its most recent season that are unequivocally deserving of praise. Kate McKinnon’s Clinton impression has become increasingly surreal and unhinged, the establishment Democrat as one of the robots of HBO’s “Westworld” (sans prestige pretension and sexual assault exploitation). Last night, in the program’s send-up of the second presidential debate McKinnon continued to dial up the wackiness and affected normalcy that defines her Clinton, narrating her movements towards an undecided voter just under her breath, lest she forget how to appear relatable.Still McKinnon has not been the focal point of the recent outpouring of praise (though her impeccable work has not gone unrecognized). Rather, it is Baldwin’s Trump ― vulgar, bloviating, spray painted to the nines ― that seems to have drawn the most attention. Certainly, he is a welcome evolution from Hammond’s own Trump, who read more like an egotistical imbecile than a misogynist xenophobe with fascist aspirations. That Baldwin’s portrayal has started to address the fundamental monstrousness of its target seems enough to qualify it for praise as effective satire. That just this morning Trump called it a “hit job” on Twitter, calling for its cancellation and implicating it in his imagined media conspiracy, will no doubt lend the impression even more credibility among audiences.I would argue that this praise is wholly undeserved and, in fact, symptomatic of our continued failure to reckon with the rise and implications of Donald Trump, viable presidential candidate. I don’t mean this as an insult to Baldwin. His portrayal of the Republican nominee is very much in line with the character of “SNL.” It’s, in many ways, a natural successor to Tina Fey’s puzzlingly-praised Sarah Palin impression that pushed “SNL” back into mainstream discussion in 2008. Still, Baldwin’s Trump is frustratingly toothless: a jumble of exaggerated tics and mannerisms assembled as a delivery device for nearly verbatim quotes from Trump himself, along with the gleeful acknowledgment of the candidate’s grotesquerie, leveled so artlessly at the camera that Baldwin might as well simply walk out on stage; face his audience; proclaim, “I am Donald Trump, multiple sex offender and racist pustule. You’re fired;” and march back off. Baldwin’s Trump never reads as anything more than a caricature that dependably addresses the aspects of the Donald we know we must condemn, feeding them through the sort of mockery that might be temporarily satisfying, but is ultimately impotent. It’s Trump’s dog-whistling as played on a kazoo.Take, for instance, last week’s cold-open, in which “SNL” addressed the horrific Access Hollywood tape that had exploded onto the scene just over 24 hours previously, along with Trump’s ugly non-apology. Baldwin’s vocal and physical impersonation is serviceable, mouth somehow simultaneously pursed and slack whenever he is not talking. “I’d like to formally apple-a-gize,” he explains to a befuddled CNN reporter, played by Cecily Strong.“Are you trying to say ‘apologize?’ she inquires. “No,” Baldwin elaborates. “I would never do that.”The joke here is clearly that Trump’s apology was not really an apology, but what comes from taking this shot? The skit continues with Trump making a number of sexual remarks, but Strong’s reporter (or the script off which she’s working) never takes the opportunity to differentiate between sexually explicit and rape-related. The sketch ends with a shot of the Clinton campaign throwing a victory bash instead of preparing for the debate, continuing with the running joke that Donald Trump is more or less handing Clinton a November win.Last Sunday, when this bit started making its rounds, nearly every publication that posted it did so alongside glowing praise. What they were referring to, I could not tell you. Because at no point does Baldwin’s Trump or the sketch around him ever try to address what is so inherently insane and troubling about the Friday tape: 1) that it showed a presidential candidate admitting to sexual assault and 2) that the backlash was comparatively minimal, with only a few Republicans withdrawing support for their candidate. Sure, “SNL” wants to acknowledge that Trump is a pervert but the portrayal feels in line with the cartoonish (and gross) archetype of a parking lot flasher: gross and disturbed, but ultimately laughable and isolated in his grossness. Obviously, this is not the case (with either Trump or the fictional flasher). Both are legitimately dangerous, and both are fundamentally condoned, even if we do not acknowledge it.Perhaps “SNL” is simply not capable of adequately addressing how uniquely dark our current Trump situation is. Where the program wants to portray him as some backwards caveman, running around honking breasts and grab-assing, while spouting some mockable misinformation, the actual Donald Trump has assaulted and traumatized multiple women, has encouraged his supporters to harass people of color to prevent them from voting, is currently sowing the seeds for violent civil unrest if he should lose, and has his anti-democratic leanings regularly defended on national television while a large swath of America nods along.If Baldwin’s Trump is darker than Hammond’s it is only slightly. It is more or less the same character with some more disturbing subject matter mixed into the text. The attitude, however, is the same: Trump is a buffoon. We should look down on him. We know better. Look at this moron. This was, of course, the same approach SNL took to Sarah Palin, whose questionable grasp of geography was apparently in more need of scrutiny than her racist and xenophobic policy suggestions, or the vehemence with which a huge chunk of America championed her. Now, she’s busy saying that men who don’t speak like Trump (i.e. brag about rape) are “limp-wristed” (i.e. queer), essentially reinforcing to the thousands of men and women who still listen to her that sexual assault is an inherent component of acceptable masculinity, and that men who denounce that sort of behavior should be met with the sort of shaming and violence that encourages young boys to enable abusers and stay silent in the face of misogynist violence.But she can see Russia from her house!Ultimately, calling someone like Trump or Palin unintelligent is a weak weak attack, and one that will do nothing to limit their appeal. Rather, it only reinforces their image as a victim of an elitist establishment that probably thinks all average Americans are dumb as well. Furthermore, it misses the point completely. It’s less that people like Trump or Palin don’t know the essentials of history or geography or environmental science, but that they don’t need to. By creating a rhetoric predicated around the idea that facts and figures are a way for the top tier to obscure fundamental truths about this nation and the world, they have put themselves in a position where those facts and figures are beside the point. It’s not too hard for Donald Trump to understand the nuances of foreign affairs. It’s that he’s made it so he doesn’t have to. Facts are not an intellectual challenge for him so much as they are a logistical inconvenience. He doesn’t need to pronounce “China” correctly.Furthermore, in addition to making white middle class liberals feel smarter than Donald Trump, the sort of satire “SNL” is employing is also designed to make us feel more moral than Trump and (most importantly) blameless in his ascendency. Not in the dumb sense that we’ve neglected the white working class and that’s the only reason they’re racist, but in that, most of the men who will laugh at those jokes on “SNL” have been Billy Bush. Most of us, myself included, have at some point failed to interrogate ourselves in a way that potentially normalizes the views that, in their extremes, we are so quick to condemn.Everyone who endorsed Trump and who will vote for him deserves a great deal of blame. There’s no escaping that. But if you are a white man in America, there is a good chance that you have, knowingly or unknowingly, acted in a way that has reinforced the historical currents of racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and homophobia on which Trump is feeding and riding. Choosing to vote for Clinton will not erase that.Effective satire of Donald Trump needs to be satire of America: a takedown of a long history of conditional freedoms and wanton violence through which racial and gendered strata were established and are continually maintained.Perhaps the best (though far from perfect) example of this comes in the form of the “Trump vs. Bernie” comedy series, that imagines a number of debates between the Donald (Anthony Atamanuik) and the beloved Senator Sanders (James Adomian).A few eagle-eyed writers have already noted that Baldwin has pilfered a number of his mannerisms from Atamanuik’s Trump (the mispronunciation of “China” probably the most immediately apparent), but I think that criticism misses the point, since it seems to suggest that the power of Atamanuik’s impression comes from those mannerisms. It doesn’t. In fact, in comparison to Baldwin, Atamanuik doesn’t look all that much like Trump. Ultimately, though, this is unimportant. Because his Trump relies on a gleeful sadism rather than any buffoonish antics, constantly looking at his audience and announcing that they themselves love what he is doing. They’re getting in on it.If Baldwin’s Trump is the dumb ‘80s bully, completely unaware of how horrible he is, Atamanuik’s is more of a calculating sadist, who knows exactly how much he can get away with, and how much others will turn the other cheek, and even play along. At the end of his nearly 45-minute special with Adomian, Atamanuik’s Trump asks if he can read the audience a poem. It includes such lines as: “let the nukes fly/bursting/prostate-choked pearls of shit/spilling from my gnarled acorn.” For a joke that ends on Trump’s penis that’s really not what you take away from it.I doubt “SNL” has any plans to adjust their Trump, even as his speeches become more deranged, and his rants more reminiscent of rhetoric history has already shown us leads to action. Ultimately, that’s not really the sort of satire “SNL” is known for, and Baldwin does a nice enough job with the mannerisms that they will most likely get by on what they’re already peddling. Still, it’s disappointing to see―even as we become more and more aware of the depths of Trump’s madness―that we are still comfortable assailing him with the same sort of comedy, hoping that calling him a clown is enough.Though I hesitate to belabor the always popular Trump-Hitler comparison, the writers of “SNL” might do well to sit down and watch a classic ― Charlie Chaplin’s “The Great Dictator” (1940) ― which is a reminder that making something look ridiculous is not the same as revealing its terrifying absurdity. There’s much more than a mouth that looks like a butthole to make fun of in Donald Trump ― though, of course, that might involve making the audience a little too uncomfortable.Here’s a thought: Why not make a joke about how many of those vehemently condemning Trump as monstrous fail to recognize that Trump’s behavior ― his rape brags and racism, abusive mind games and encouragement of violence ― is only new and novel and uniquely horrifying to the small sector of the population that hasn’t lived alongside it all their lives? Or one about how once we defeat Trump, another will step up to say the exact same things, and the longer we wait to acknowledge that this doesn’t end with Trump, the longer and denser that queue of successors will be?Or the mouth-as-asshole thing.I guess we can just stick with that."

It’s scary,” the woman calls out during the heated scene.“It’s because he’s black,” she adds, in a lower voice. The Minnesota NAACP identified the woman as Janet Rowles.The city, responding to the video in a statement Friday, confirmed that one of two surrounding sidewalks were closed because of construction but said that the video only captured a portion of the incident.The statement said that the man had been walking in the roadway shortly before the recording started. When the officer turned on his lights and an audible signal, the pedestrian, who was wearing headphones, turned and acknowledged the officer but repeatedly ignored his order to move out of the road, the statement said.The city said the officer responded by driving ahead and stopping his car, as a means to “block him from continuing in the southbound land of traffic.”“The man continued to defy the officer’s directives and was belligerent,” the statement read.The man tested positive for alcohol and was cited for disorderly conduct and failure to obey a traffic signal. He was released 45 minutes later, city officials said.Minnesota’s NAACP, in its own statement Saturday, called the officer’s behavior “dehumanizing and degrading.”“Watching that video and seeing a black man being manhandled and emasculated by Edina Police was not only painful and humiliating, it was a vivid reminder that blacks are still too-often seen as second class citizens in the State of Minnesota and in this nation,” stated Nekima Levy-Pounds, a civil rights attorney and president of the Minneapolis NAACP. “It is sad to say, but that man in the video could easily have been the next Philando Castile or Jamar Clark, two unarmed black men who were killed by police within the last year.”Rowles, the woman who filmed the scene, also spoke out against the man’s treatment, which she called “overzealous.”“There was absolutely no reason for the officer to stop him from walking. I easily passed him in my vehicle because he was hugging the right side next to the construction, literally walking on the white line that marks the shoulder,” she said in the NAACP’s release. “I have no interest in vilifying the police, but obviously I got out of my car in the first place because I perceive the pedestrian might not get treated fairly because of his ethnicity.”In addition to asking for an apology, the NAACP has asked that an outside investigation be conducted into the incident and that the officer be suspended without pay.The police department could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday; nor could the man whom the NAACP identified as the person arrested."
68,POLITICS,The NAACP Takes A Major Stand Against The Growth Of Charter Schools,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/naacp-charter-schools_us_5803992ee4b06e0475955b8a,The nation's oldest civil rights group is taking a critical look at the state of education.,2016-10-16,"Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of the NAACP, speaks at the NAACP convention in July 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5803b073170000c316acc422.jpeg?cache=okSssgW9RG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The NAACP board of directors voted Saturday to confirm a resolution that recommends an end to the expansion of charter schools, which currently educate about 6 percent of the nation’s public school students. The controversial move has angered charter school activists and faced criticism from the editorial boards at The New York Times and The Washington Post.Charter schools are publicly funded but privately operated. Minnesota passed a law creating the first legislated charter school in 1991, and since that time, the number of charter schools has ballooned to about 7,000 all over the country, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. In recent years, these schools have faced criticism for their sometimes harsh discipline practices, lack of oversight and accountability and for siphoning resources away from traditional public schools. At the same time, studies have shown that students ― especially disadvantaged students ― who are educated in charter schools make slightly larger gains in reading than their peers, although results vary widely depending on the school and state.In late July, delegates at the NAACP national convention voted on a resolution that calls for a moratorium on the growth of charter schools. On Saturday, the NAACP board ratified this resolution. “The NAACP’s resolution is not inspired by ideological opposition to charter schools but by our historical support of public schools ― as well as today’s data and the present experience of NAACP branches in nearly every school district in the nation,” Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement. “Our NAACP members, who as citizen advocates, not professional lobbyists, are those who attend school board meetings, engage with state legislatures and support both parents and teachers.”In its entirety, the resolution calls for a freeze on the expansion of these schools until charter schools are subject to the same accountability as traditional public schools and develop a funding system that does not hurt other schools. It also calls for charter schools to end harsh discipline practices that push out students and segregate high-performing children “from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet as obvious.”The resolution suggests that instead of giving students access to charter schools through school choice, policymakers should focus on enhancing the quality of traditional public schools, despite their many shortcomings. Indeed, it is the nation’s black and brown children that often bear the brunt of underperforming schools ― whether they be charter or public. “While we have reservations about charter schools, we recognize that many children attend traditional public schools that are inadequately and inequitably equipped to prepare them for the innovative and competitive environment they will face as adults,” says a statement from the NAACP. “Underfunded and under-supported, these traditional public schools have much work to do to transform curriculum, prepare teachers, and give students the resources they need to have thriving careers in a technologically advanced society that is changing every year. There is no time to wait. Our children immediately deserve the best education we can provide.”While the vote received immediate support from teachers unions and some public school groups, education reform organizations have been pushing back against the resolution for months. In September, a group of black leaders sent a letter to the NAACP board members criticizing the proposal. According to the letter, this vote is of particular importance to black children, who are overrepresented in charter schools.“The proposed resolution cites a variety of cherry-picked and debunked claims about charter schools,” says the letter. “In reality, charter schools generally receive less per-pupil funding than traditional district public schools and often receive little or no funding to purchase buildings or maintain classrooms. Despite these hurdles, charter schools are helping students achieve at higher levels than traditional district schools.”On Saturday, a statement from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools President and CEO Nina Rees called the policy “misguided.” Still, Rees said she is encouraged that “the NAACP is clear that they are not opposed to charter schools.”“Across the country, charter public schools are working for hundreds of thousands of Black families. Today’s decision doesn’t just ignore the fact that charter schools are working for so many students and families ... It also ignores the thousands of families and Black leaders who have stepped forward over the last two months urging the NAACP to reconsider their decision,” Rees said in the statement.The president of the nation’s largest teachers union, however, praised the vote. Teachers unions have long been critical of charter schools. “The chorus of those of us who have been sounding the alarm on the many long-standing structural and governance problems that have plagued charters in recent years is growing. The time is right to pause and reassess,” said a statement from Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association. “We strongly support more inclusive and otherwise positive alternatives to charter schools. We should invest in proven strategies — strategies such as smaller class sizes, parental involvement, magnet and community schools — that we know help to improve the success of all of our students.” On Twitter, education and civil rights leaders sounded off:"

They have forced civilians to stay in harm’s way during previous battles to defend territory.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he hoped the United States and its allies would do their best to avoid civilian casualties in an attack on Mosul.Reflecting the authorities’ concerns over a mass exodus that would complicate the offensive, the leaflets told residents “to stay at home and not to believe rumors spread by Daesh” to cause panic, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic acronym.With a pre-war population of around 2 million, Mosul is around 4-5 times the size of any other city recaptured so far from the militants, who swept through northern Iraq in 2014 and also hold a swathe of Syria.The U.N. last week said it was bracing for the world’s biggest and most complex humanitarian effort in the battle for the city, which could make up to 1 million people homeless and see civilians used as human shields or even gassed.“Keep calm and tell your children that it is only a game or thunder before the rain,” a leaflet said. “Women should not scream or shout, to preserve the children’s spirit.”“If you see an army unit, stay at least 25 meters away and avoid any sudden movements,” another said.Iraq earlier this month launched a radio station to help Mosul residents stay safe during the offensive.The radio is broadcasting from Qayyara, a town 60 kilometers (about 40 miles) south of Mosul, where the army is massing forces ahead of the offensive.Qayyara has also an airfield that will be used as a hub by the U.S.-led coalition to support the offensive in which Kurdish Peshmerga and Sunni tribal fighters are expected to take part.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has not yet made it clear whether Iranian-backed Shi’ite paramilitary units will participate in the offensive on the mainly Sunni city.Local Sunni politicians and regional Sunni-majority states including Turkey and Saudi Arabia have cautioned that letting Shi’ite militias take part in assault could lead to sectarian bloodletting."

I will be the most outspoken voice in the Senate. Nothing could have more impact than to send me to the Senate!” Duke says in the letter, adding that he would work to preserve “our heritage” if elected.The white nationalist even used some of Trump’s own rhetoric to accuse the media of distorting his record.“The media has raked me over the coals, targeted me, lied endlessly about me, but I have never given up. I’m still standing, still fighting, and I remain unbroken,” the letter said. Duke closed the missive by urging supporters to donate to his campaign, offering to throw in an autographed hat with the words “I’m for Duke & Trump!” emblazoned on the front for any contribution of $50 or more.Attempts to reach Duke’s campaign on Sunday were unsuccessful. The voicemail box corresponding to the phone number at his office in Mandeville, Louisiana, was full. A request for comment to Trump’s campaign was not immediately returned.After this story was published on Sunday, a second person told HuffPost he, too, had received the letter at his residence in Florida.Dr. Jamie Amir, who was born in London to a Pakistani father and a Maltese mother, said he was distraught upon receiving the letter, which was addressed to his 6-year-old daughter.“My wife and I were horrified to receive this letter addressed to our innocent sweet daughter from this prolific racist, especially since we don’t even live in his state, we live in Florida! Certainly David Duke needs to work on his targeting,” Amir wrote in an email.Although he has lived in the U.S. since 2003, Amir said he decided to get his U.S. citizenship this year in order to vote in the election. He added that he was proud to belong to “a very culturally diverse family,” a photo of which he shared, that he said represented “the complete antithesis of David Duke’s message.”It wouldn’t be the first time Duke had associated himself with the GOP nominee. In August, Trump’s campaign disavowed a robocall from Duke in which he urged Louisiana residents to “vote for Donald Trump for president and vote for me, David Duke, for the U.S. Senate.” The former KKK leader has encouraged his radio show listeners to volunteer for Trump’s campaign. And his own campaign website is filled with positive mentions of the real estate mogul.Trump has disavowed Duke’s support, but that hasn’t stopped white supremacists from flocking to Trump’s campaign. Over the weekend, a Trump supporter left a sign emblazoned with a swastika in the press area following a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida.Read Duke’s two-page letter below: This story has been updated with information from Jamie Amir.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

It cited witnesses at a designated black bear check station that allegedly saw the bear’s body and also heard the hunter bragging about taking down the popular animal.“The hunter who has wanted him dead for nearly 3 years had the satisfaction of putting an arrow through him, bragging at the station,” read the Facebook post, which sparked anger and sadness among some of the page’s 22,000 fans.In a statement, the state’s Division of Fish and Wildlife confirmed that a black bear was brought into the station earlier this week, but said they have been unable to confirm whether it was Pedals since the bear was never tagged.“There are pictures of a bear with injured limbs that was brought into the station,” Bob Considine, a spokesman for the Division of Fish and Wildlife, described the animal to NorthJersey.com.Lisa Rose-Rublack, who created the bear’s Facebook page, had raised more than $22,000 to move the bear to a sanctuary in upstate New York. Her fundraiser followed concerns that the disabled bear wouldn’t be able to survive winter.Incredibly, Pedals was filmed walking around a neighborhood in Oakridge, New Jersey, in June.Despite the funds raised, the bear’s relocation was never approved by the state’s Department of Wildlife, Rose-Rublack told The New York Daily News.“We raised all the money, we had a place for him to go,” she said. The money they collected will instead be used to “do some good in his memory.”A second Facebook post on Saturday went on to say that the writer doesn’t know the name of the hunter and that there is “no credible proof of who did it.”It asked that the public refrain from accusing specific individuals and making threats.“As awful as it is that someone killed Pedals as NJDFW has stated he was fair game, no laws were broken. We tried to get him protection to no avail. Please I beg you to stop all of this, you do not have any proof of who killed him,” the post read.The state’s black bear hunting season ended on Saturday.

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-native-americans-arizona_us_5802f2dfe4b06e0475954a71,"If the presidential race in Arizona is close, Native Americans could throw it to Clinton.",2016-10-16,"KTNN host Dee Yazzie and Arizona Senate candidate Jamescita Mae Peshlakai at the opening of the Navajo Nation early voting site in Fort Defiance, Arizona.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5802f8cb170000c316acc38c.jpeg?ops=crop_17_752_4015_2272%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"FORT DEFIANCE, Ariz. ― Living among the red-rock gullies and the desert scrub in this corner of the country are a people who could soon exact their revenge on Donald Trump.Because while the Republican presidential nominee appears to have forgotten about Native Americans of late, with his focus on Muslims and Mexicans, Arizona’s hundreds of thousands of Native Americans have not forgotten about him.“I heard it for a long time, how he talks about Indians,” said Dennis Tsinnijinnie, 69 and among the first to cast his ballot on the sunny but brisk opening morning of Arizona’s early vote period last week.Tsinnijinnie was talking about Trump’s behavior from decades ago, when he accused some Native Americans of faking their ethnicities to win casino licenses. When he disparaged tribes for receiving federal money for roads. When he mocked their sovereignty. And, more recently, when he insulted Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with the epithet “Pocahontas.”“Not so good to talk about it that way, I think,” Tsinnijinnie said.Although Republicans have comfortably won Arizona in every presidential election since 2000, polling this autumn suggests a much tighter race ― one in which a big turnout by Native Americans could flip the state’s 11 electoral votes into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s column.“We have a saying in Navajo that you may not have a lady for a leader,” said Judy Allen, 69, who drove a full hour from her home to vote on the first day possible. “However, today is a new day. The world has changed.”Beyond Trump’s remarks over the years about them specifically, Native Americans say they are also disturbed by his general rhetoric during this campaign.Teresa Etsitty, 61, drove 35 miles with her husband to cast her ballot for one simple reason: “Trump,” she said. “If he wins, looks like he could blow the whole thing up.”“He shuns anybody who’s below him. The Hispanics. The blacks. Native Americans,” added Allen. “I don’t know if I can say this, but he’s crazy.”Jamescita Mae Peshlakai, the Democratic candidate for state senate for northeastern Arizona, said she even finds Trump’s slogan offensive. “Make America great again?” she asks. “There was an even greater America before 1492.” On a cubicle wall in the Coconino County elections office in downtown Flagstaff is a map showing all the polling places overseen by County Recorder Patty Hansen. Among them is the precinct at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.There, 129 registered voters of the Havasupai nation have their ballots and voting machine helicoptered in prior to Election Day. The three poll workers who staff the voting site, though, can’t use the chopper. “They hike down the Monday before,” Hansen said. “They hike out the Wednesday after.”Another polling place north of the canyon can only be accessed by a road that comes down from Utah, Hansen added.Geography is just one of the challenges in accommodating Native American voters. Language is another. Many of the older tribe members speak and read little or no English, Hansen said, making a mail-in ballot impractical. “If you need language assistance, you can’t mail an interpreter,” she said.And because the Native American languages themselves are oral, not written, translating some of the ballot wording can itself be an adventure. One of Arizona’s initiatives in November, for example, would legalize marijuana for recreational use. There is no Navajo word for marijuana, Hansen said, so it’s translated as “The smoke that makes you crazy.”Hansen’s Coconino County, of course, is just one of Arizona’s fifteen counties, which in all are home to some 300,000 Native Americans ― making it the state with the second-largest native population in the country, after Oklahoma.That number is not even 5 percent of the state’s 6.8 million people, and a fraction of the 2 million Latinos ― the vast majority of Mexican heritage. But the Clinton campaign and the state Democrats have nevertheless focused on registering and turning out as many of the 200,000 voting-age Native Americans in Arizona as possible. They know that over 90 percent have voted Democratic in past elections, with the potential for that percentage going even higher with Trump at the top of the ticket.“Even though Arizona is red? We in the heart of Indian country are always blue,” Peshlakai said.Nailing down precise numbers, though, is not easy. Arizona does not track ethnicity on its voter registration forms. Many Native Americans work in cities and towns off the reservations, but keep a permanent address on one. And addresses on reservations don’t necessarily have street numbers. In fact, registration forms allow voters to locate their homes by drawing a map of nearby landmarks ― an intersection, say, or even a large boulder.Previous analyses show that Native American turnout has lagged behind other groups’ in past elections. In 2008, for example, a study by the liberal group Demos found that while the overall turnout rate as compared to the voting-age population was 64 percent, among Native Americans, it was only 48 percent.Yet while small relative to the entirety of Arizona’s population, the Native American vote can have a decisive impact, as it did during the 2014 congressional elections. That vote coincided with a tribal election, and Native American turnout was not much lower than it was in 2012. That higher-than-expected vote total helped Ann Kirkpatrick retain her House seat that November by a 5-point margin, one of the few bright spots for Democrats nationally that election.“That’s definitely something we want to duplicate this election cycle,” said Enrique Gutierrez, communications director for the Arizona Democratic Party.The state party’s attempt to make that happen kicked into a higher gear last week, with an “early voting rally” a few miles from the Navajo Nation’s tribal capital at Window Rock.Volunteers grilled hot dogs while the radio station KTNN ― “The Voice of the Navajo Nation” ― broadcast all day from the Apache County offices at Fort Defiance, reminding listeners that voting had begun and encouraging them to cast their ballots.At a double-wide trailer with blue vinyl siding that serves as the elections office, a stream of voters did just that on the first day of voting.Allen, who has lived all of her 69 years in the remote community of Wheatfields about 40 miles to the north, said she votes in every election, but thinks that more of her neighbors are interested in voting in this election. “People say: I’m going to register to vote because I don’t want that crazy guy,” she said.She said she also worries that Trump’s apparent obsession with wealth makes it impossible for him to empathize with those who do not have it. “He’s too great for everything. He refers to himself as the star. And he’s above everybody else,” she said. “He’s a millionaire. He doesn’t know the needs of real people.”Her own home, for example, has no running water. She has to periodically drive to her sister’s house a half hour away to fetch some for cooking and cleaning. There is no landline phone service, and her cell phone can’t pick up a signal. She spends the winters with her son in Gallup, across the state line in New Mexico. “Because,” she said, “I can’t chop wood.”“We’re just thankful for what little we can get. That’s the way, I think, God made us,” she said. “I’m not complaining about it. I just wish my cell phone would work better.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

75,POLITICS,Nation's Largest Seniors Group Is Using Conservative Scare Tactics On Social Security,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-conservative-social-security_us_57fbe10be4b068ecb5e0d0f3,AARP is promoting alarmism about the program and giving awards to Republican lawmakers who want to cut it.,2016-10-16,"AARP activists attend a campaign event in Madison, Wisconsin, during the Republican primary on March 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fbe7581b0000e218ef5f61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Television viewers across the country have been treated to some scary advertisements about the future of Social Security.“Our next president needs to take action on Social Security, or future generations could lose up to $10,000 a year,” the narrator intones, as ominous music plays in the background.Viewers might be surprised to learn that the ad is from the AARP, the country’s largest seniors group and a longtime defender of social programs for older Americans. It’s part of the nonpartisan group’s election-focused “Take A Stand” campaign, launched last November to pressure candidates to spell out their plans for shoring up Social Security’s finances. The “Take A Stand” initiative rankled progressive retirement security advocates virtually from the moment it started, because it focused on getting politicians to propose any detailed plan ― and didn’t distinguish between reform proposals that would cut benefits and those that would not. The new television ad has only heightened liberal concerns. Critics of AARP’s approach say that the influential seniors group, which has 37 million members across the country and incredible influence in Washington, is making Social Security’s financial challenges seem much more dire than they really are. In doing so, the group is playing right into the crisis framing favored by conservatives, who want benefit cuts to seem inevitable.“AARP is aggravating a political situation that allows the right, and even Democrats on the center-right in Washington, to portray Social Security as a problem rather than as a vital resource for working people,” said Eric Laursen, author of The People’s Pension: The Struggle To Defend Social Security Since Reagan. Although there is a heated fight over approaches to reforming Social Security, no one disputes that there is a funding gap in the program that will eventually become a problem. Social Security will not have enough money to pay out its full promised benefits by 2034, mainly due to the retirement of the large Baby Boomer generation, which has already begun. If the president and Congress fail to reform the program before then ― either by increasing its revenue through tax increases, reducing its benefits or some combination of the two ― an automatic 21-percent cut would go into effect for all beneficiaries.But context is key. While the funding gap is a problem, it is hardly the crisis many budget hawks ― and AARP’s new ad ― have implied. A few small measures to increase revenue, like lifting or eliminating the cap on taxable earnings, would make it possible to extend Social Security’s solvency for decades without cutting any benefits. (Americans right now only pay Social Security taxes on the first $118,500 they earn.) Comprehensive immigration reform, which would increase the size of the tax-paying workforce, and policies that reduce income inequality, like raising the minimum wage, would also boost Social Security’s finances.Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a group fighting for an expansion of benefits rather than cuts, said the AARP has been “more effective at pushing the crisis framing” than the conservative groups that have hyped Social Security’s solvency issues precisely because of AARP’s credibility among seniors.As the 2016 election nears, Lawson and other progressives fear that the combination of AARP’s alarmist rhetoric and its implied blessing for plans that would cut Social Security jeopardizes the success that progressive activists have had in shaping the debate about the program. AARP did not respond to repeated requests for comment on its campaign or the criticisms of its approach.It’s not even clear why AARP would want to stake out such a vague position on reform. Social Security is an immensely popular program. A Pew poll from last year found that two-thirds of Americans support keeping benefits at their current level. In fact, opposition to cuts was the only major position that unites supporters of all presidential candidates, Democrat and Republican, according to another Pew survey released in March.And support for Social Security is likely to rise as more Baby Boomers begin collecting benefits. Over 40 million retired workers currently draw from the fund, and that number is set to grow to about 64 million when all of the Boomers retire, according to an estimate by the National Academy for Social Insurance.As Lawson put it, “more Americans believe in the Loch Ness monster than want to cut Social Security.”That popularity is exactly why fiscal conservatives seeking to cut the program for ideological reasons have resorted to hyping up its financial challenges. It is apparently easier to develop support for cutting promised benefits if people are not sure they will get those benefits anyway.AARP’s television ad borrows from that conservative framing. The 30-second spot airing on cable news channels shows younger and middle-aged workers ― a cook, a firefighter, a football coach ― doing their jobs and suggests that candidates for public office are not doing theirs in failing to tackle Social Security’s shortfall. It concludes with a warning that Americans could suffer a $10,000 benefit cut if the next president fails to act.It’s not just the ad that has critics concerned about AARP’s positioning on Social Security. Just this summer, the group bestowed several of its “Champion of the 50+” awards on Republican lawmakers who have either explicitly supported benefit cuts or expressed openness to them. GOP recipients included Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Rep. Todd Young (R-Ind.), all of whom are locked in tight Senate races, as well as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has proposed privatizing Social Security. (The organization has given awards to several Democratic lawmakers as well, including Massachusetts’ Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is a leading proponent of expanding Social Security.)The Twitter account of AARP’s advocacy arm also praised a controversial question about Social Security’s solvency in the vice presidential debate earlier this month.“In 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you’ll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut?” moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News asked Democratic nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.)“It was such a good question!” effused AARP Advocates. But many observers criticized the question precisely because it invoked a frightening hypothetical that remains distant and extremely unlikely, without offering any additional context.AARP is “saying that Social Security is in this dire situation, that something needs to be done immediately,” Social Security Works’ Lawson said.“It is an absolute falsehood,” he continued. “The only reason to lead with something like that is to scare people so they accept something worse than they should.”Indeed, time is on progressives’ side when it comes to reforming Social Security. Leading proponents of benefit cuts, like Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, would like to see action on Social Security sooner than later, because the closer we get to the date of the shortfall, the more likely the funding gap would need to be filled with tax hikes. “A tax increase – particularly on high earners – can be phased in almost immediately while sudden benefit reductions are seen [as] disruptive to households planning for retirement,” Biggs wrote in June.“[AARP is] not coming out and specifically siding with the right, but they give it a certain amount of intellectual legitimacy,” said Laursen, the author of The People’s Pension. “They are tacitly endorsing the idea that a lot of the ideas progressives naturally oppose are worth talking about, and trying to create an atmosphere where if one does not want to talk about some changes to Social Security, one can be accused of standing in the doorway and preventing the solution to a problem.”Progressive activists who have pushed back against this Social Security alarmism in recent years find this especially disconcerting. At the beginning of Barack Obama’s presidency, fiscal conservatives took advantage of public anxiety and confusion over rising budget deficits to create political momentum for cutting Social Security. On more than one occasion, Obama came close to approving a deal with congressional Republicans that would have reduced the program’s annual cost-of-living adjustment. But organized labor and groups like Social Security Works gradually changed the policy conversation, insisting that the real crisis was the retirement income deficit, which is now $7.7 trillion, according to a calculation from Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. By 2013, advocates had flipped the script and support was growing for an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits, to be paid for by making wealthier Americans contribute at a higher level. The private retirement accounts that have replaced traditional pensions don’t provide adequate retirement income, the activists argued, so today’s workers will need Social Security even more than previous generations. Stagnant wages are making it harder for families to save, they also noted.That argument is winning. Nearly all congressional Democrats are on record supporting expansion, as are President Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Though Clinton has yet to roll out a detailed plan for how she would pay for it, she has indicated she supports lifting the cap on taxable earnings and finding other ways to make wealthy Americans pay more into the program. Meanwhile, GOP nominee Donald Trump claims he would at least protect the program from cuts.In spite of the evolution of the debate, AARP’s “Take A Stand” campaign suggests it still views the program exclusively through the lens of financial solvency.If AARP were concerned about retirement security overall, surely its ads would focus more on the adequacy of Social Security benefits and not just the program’s solvency. A more constructive campaign from the seniors group, said Laursen, would ask politicians to both address Social Security’s solvency and its increasingly vital role as a source of retirement income.“There is a lot of evidence it needs to be conserved and expanded to serve the needs of the 21st century workforce, [which will be] retiring without the pensions of past generations,” he said. “How do you balance those two objectives: to make it solvent and ensure it must do the job it is supposed to do?”Laursen speculates that AARP’s unwillingness to weigh in on the merits of particular Social Security reform plans likely stems from a desire to avoid being seen as partisan, which could alienate some members.Taking a Democratic-leaning stand created problems for AARP in the recent past; the group lost some 300,000 members when it threw its weight behind the Affordable Care Act in 2009.Now AARP also has some longtime Republican operatives running the campaign. John Hishta, who as AARP’s senior vice president for campaigns runs “Take A Stand,” has a background in Republican politics. He served as executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2001 to 2002 and as chief of staff to former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis (R) before that. And the group has hired veteran GOP pollster and message guru Frank Luntz to conduct focus groups for “Take A Stand.”But AARP has also responded to liberal pressure this election season. In August, after a progressive research outfit exposed the group’s involvement with the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, AARP announced that it would let its ALEC membership expire at the end of the year.AARP told HuffPost in February that the organization wanted to wait until after the election to publicize its view of specific Social Security provisions. It has not hesitated to differentiate between different Social Security proposals before past elections, however. In 2012, AARP published a voters’ guide comparing presidential and congressional candidates’ views on Social Security and Medicare alongside AARP’s “principles” for the programs.AARP has touted data on the views of its current members to promote “Take A Stand.” Sixty-seven percent of the 23,000 members surveyed by AARP said the future of Social Security is their top election concern.Frederick Lynch, author of the book One Nation Under AARP: The Fight Over Medicare, Social Security, and America’s Future and a professor at Claremont McKenna College, speculated that the group’s focus on Social Security’s solvency is an attempt to appeal to younger Americans, whom it views as its future members. “AARP may be responding to data they must have about X-er and Millennials’ deep doubts about the future of entitlements,” Lynch said.But even if younger voters lack confidence in the future of Social Security, they clearly don’t support scaling it back in order to secure it. The Pew poll from last year found that 61 percent of millennials oppose cutting benefits.As Social Security Works’ Lawson argues, the public wants politicians “to take the right stand, not a stand.”“We know what that is and so does AARP,” he said. “They know what their members want, and saying anything else is ridiculous.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Foster III/Charlotte Observer/TNS via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb830671f00000002253d61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What could possibly be the silver lining of the presidential bid of a candidate whose comments and actions are degrading, undemocratic, bigoted and just plain cruel? How could there be an upside to a campaign that makes one wonder whether it's safe for children to watch the evening news or even presidential debates? Frankly, Donald Trump's candidacy is so offensive, so frightening and so unprecedented in the United States that it compels us to a much-needed collective focus on decency and civic engagement -- a renewal of civitas. In my lifetime, I have seen plenty of elections in which the candidates attacked each other. But I have never seen a candidate for president undermine the bedrock principles of our constitutional democracy. Donald Trump has incited his supporters to use violence against peaceful protesters. He has called for a ban on members of an entire religion from entering the United States. He has disparaged African-Americans, Mexicans and the disabled. He has said he would jail his political opponent and led his supporters in chants of ""Lock her up."" When his campaign has faltered, he has raised the unfounded specter that the election could be rigged against him. This election is not just about politics and policies, but about human decency.Trump has denigrated women, boasted about repeatedly sexually assaulting women, and hurled vicious verbal attacks against women who report they were assaulted by him. First lady Michelle Obama spoke for many Americans when she gave a speech last week reminding voters that this election is not just about politics and policies, but about human decency.If the election were held today, polls suggest Hillary Clinton would prevail. But regardless of the outcome, our country has a Nov. 9 problem. Trump has tapped into a populist anger that animates America and has used it to stoke hatred and divide the country. He has seized on the economic challenges confronting Americans, and instead of bringing the country together around solutions, he is sowing division. America is changing demographically and economically. Deindustrialization, globalization, the technological revolution and the diminishment of the labor movement have left Americans feeling powerless. The loss of good jobs and good pensions, wage stagnation, and escalating child care and college costs have left people angry and anxious, and they are desperately looking for someone who can bring change. Trump says he is their champion, but his plans would be devastating for the very people he claims he will help. People need to know the facts. The chief economist of Moody's Analytics, who has advised prominent Republicans, concluded that Trump's economic proposals would cost 3.5 million Americans their jobs and lead to a long recession. (The same economist estimated that Hillary Clinton's economic plan would create 10.4 million well-paying jobs.) Trump's proposals regarding taxes, child care and the economy advantage the wealthy over low- and middle-income Americans. And he would decimate America's public schools by voucherizing them.The toxic rhetoric of the Trump campaign has filtered down to affect many children and schools. A middle school teacher in Dearborn, Mich., reports that Muslim students have stopped wearing anything that could identify them by their faith. A children's therapist in New Mexico says her daughters came home from school asking if it's ok for boys to grab them or try to kiss them, because boys at school are saying ""Donald Trump does it."" A survey conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center found steep increases in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant comments, and an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color--what many have called the ""Trump Effect.""Once the election is over, we will need a collective effort to bind the wounds and address the divisions caused by this polarizing campaign. This will require a national effort, and our public schools can play a central role. Public education has been a bulwark for democracy, respect and diversity -- what the American Federation of Teachers calls ""democracy in education, education for democracy.""

How could there be an upside to a campaign that makes one wonder whether it's safe for children to watch the evening news or even presidential debates? Frankly, Donald Trump's candidacy is so offensive, so frightening and so unprecedented in the United States that it compels us to a much-needed collective focus on decency and civic engagement -- a renewal of civitas. In my lifetime, I have seen plenty of elections in which the candidates attacked each other. But I have never seen a candidate for president undermine the bedrock principles of our constitutional democracy. Donald Trump has incited his supporters to use violence against peaceful protesters. He has called for a ban on members of an entire religion from entering the United States. He has disparaged African-Americans, Mexicans and the disabled. He has said he would jail his political opponent and led his supporters in chants of ""Lock her up."" When his campaign has faltered, he has raised the unfounded specter that the election could be rigged against him. This election is not just about politics and policies, but about human decency.Trump has denigrated women, boasted about repeatedly sexually assaulting women, and hurled vicious verbal attacks against women who report they were assaulted by him. First lady Michelle Obama spoke for many Americans when she gave a speech last week reminding voters that this election is not just about politics and policies, but about human decency.If the election were held today, polls suggest Hillary Clinton would prevail. But regardless of the outcome, our country has a Nov. 9 problem. Trump has tapped into a populist anger that animates America and has used it to stoke hatred and divide the country. He has seized on the economic challenges confronting Americans, and instead of bringing the country together around solutions, he is sowing division. America is changing demographically and economically. Deindustrialization, globalization, the technological revolution and the diminishment of the labor movement have left Americans feeling powerless. The loss of good jobs and good pensions, wage stagnation, and escalating child care and college costs have left people angry and anxious, and they are desperately looking for someone who can bring change. Trump says he is their champion, but his plans would be devastating for the very people he claims he will help. People need to know the facts. The chief economist of Moody's Analytics, who has advised prominent Republicans, concluded that Trump's economic proposals would cost 3.5 million Americans their jobs and lead to a long recession. (The same economist estimated that Hillary Clinton's economic plan would create 10.4 million well-paying jobs.) Trump's proposals regarding taxes, child care and the economy advantage the wealthy over low- and middle-income Americans. And he would decimate America's public schools by voucherizing them.The toxic rhetoric of the Trump campaign has filtered down to affect many children and schools. A middle school teacher in Dearborn, Mich., reports that Muslim students have stopped wearing anything that could identify them by their faith. A children's therapist in New Mexico says her daughters came home from school asking if it's ok for boys to grab them or try to kiss them, because boys at school are saying ""Donald Trump does it."" A survey conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center found steep increases in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant comments, and an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color--what many have called the ""Trump Effect.""Once the election is over, we will need a collective effort to bind the wounds and address the divisions caused by this polarizing campaign. This will require a national effort, and our public schools can play a central role. Public education has been a bulwark for democracy, respect and diversity -- what the American Federation of Teachers calls ""democracy in education, education for democracy."" Our educators and students will be the first responders in this fight for our democracy, and we will need to give them the time and latitude to fulfill their vital civic function.Children of all different races, religions, cultures and economic means attend public schools. Young people understand that words and actions have consequences, and that bigotry and bullying are unacceptable.

78,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Campaign Is Imploding. Most Republicans Are Still With Him.,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-support-donald-trump_us_580217f8e4b06e047595136a,"He's a disaster, but he's their disaster.",2016-10-15,"Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump waves to supporters at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, U.S., October 14, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5802453f1a00008f205b9ad3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s troubled campaign has seen an incredible exodus in support over the past week. After footage released last week showed him bragging about groping women, more than a dozen members of Congress withdrew their endorsements. Others, who’d previously stayed neutral in the race, called for the Republican presidential nominee to drop out.But despite the wave of high-profile defections, the bulk of the GOP is sticking with Trump ― a man who, besides being accused of sexual assault, has publicly trashed the party, disparaged its members, broken with many of its most cherished political planks and shattered its attempts to win over minorities and women. As of Thursday, TIME magazine found that 72 percent of Republican officeholders were still supporting Trump to some extent.Even some of the Republicans who condemned Trump last week have since walked back their positions ― making the contorted argument that, even if they wish their party’s nominee would make an unprecedented late exit from the race, they still think he’s worthy of their public support.“Like most Nebraskans, I am fully committed to defeating Hillary Clinton,” Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) told a state radio station just days after calling for Trump to step down in favor of his vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence. “I support the Republican ticket and I plan to vote for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence on Nov. 8.”For downballot Republican candidates, trying to set themselves at just the right amount of remove from their unpopular nominee is a tricky proposition. In 10 of the 14 Senate races that HuffPost Pollster has enough data to model, the GOP candidate is currently outpolling Trump by 4 or more points. Being tied too closely to Trump offers few advantages, and lends itself well to Democratic attack ads. But taking a public stand against the brash businessman also carries risks, such as mobilizing his most outspoken backers.“Support him and you could ostracize swing voters. Resist him and you signal to Republicans that they should stay home,” The Huffington Post’s Matt Fuller wrote Monday, describing the bind many candidates find themselves in. “Plus, there’s a whole segment of Trump supporters who are truly excited about the brash businessman. Stand up to him and you risk GOP voters skipping over your name.”While Trump is lagging badly in the polls and even seeing his image slide among Republicans, the party’s voters are still mostly sticking with him. About 78 percent of Republicans say in an average of head-to-head polling that they support Trump over Clinton.Just under four in 10 of Trump’s supporters are true believers, according to the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. Others are willing to swallow any doubts in the name of partisanship ― as HuffPost’s Natalie Jackson noted Monday, party identification remains by far the strongest predictor of how voters will act in election. And many simply still see him as a more palatable alternative to Clinton, who many of the GOP vehemently dislike.In a HuffPost/YouGov survey taken last week, 58 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters agreed that “[t]he worst member of the Republican Party is still better than the best member of the Democratic Party.” Nearly three quarters said that Trump, whatever they thought of him, would make a better president than Clinton, with 55 percent saying that he would be “much better.” That’s enough motivation for many of his remaining supporters to rationalize away some of his behavior. In a survey taken just after last Friday’s video leak, 60 percent of Republican voters said that Trump respected women ― unchanged from the days before the video but 12 points higher than in April, when he wasn’t yet the party’s standard-bearer.Trump was never the GOP’s ideal candidate. He clinched the nomination with the eighth-lowest delegate percentage in Republican history, and with by far the fewest primary endorsements of any major-party nominee in at least 36 years.But even when replacing Trump at the top of the ticket was still a theoretical, if far-fetched, possibility, it garnered less than majority support. And now, with less than a month until the election, most Republicans, both lawmakers and voters, seem to be willing to go down with his ship.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

He also complained about branches of government and media of being corrupt.Clarke’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.His complaints of corruption follow Trump’s claims that the presidential election is rigged against him, as his polling sinks.“The whole thing is one big fix. One big ugly lie. It’s one big fix,” Trump said at a North Carolina rally on Friday.The FBI, which has jurisdiction over matters of voter intimidation, declined to comment to The Huffington Post on whether it was looking into the sheriff’s comments.UPDATE: In a Monday blog post titled, “Dear Media, only liberals can call for a political revolution?”, Clarke doubled down on his rhetoric while accusing “Big Media” of misreading his “pitchforks and torches” comment as a literal incitement to violence.“First of all if you came here expecting me to walk that statement back or ask for a do-over, you are going to be disappointed. I am not your typical conservative. I stand and fight for what I believe in and I play smash-mouth politics. Big Media is not used to that from many conservatives,” wrote Clarke.“When I tweeted the above image, I meant it. I wasn’t speaking in code,” continued Clarke. “It’s time to run those corrupt politicians out of Washington DC and back to whatever crevices they crawled from.

But now someone has stepped forward to corroborate an accuser's account.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580259741a000067145b9aee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Canadian journalist and professor is backing up People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff’s claim that Donald Trump aggressively forced himself on her during a 2005 interview.The professor, Paul McLaughlin, said Stoynoff, a former student of his, called him after the incident and they discussed how to deal with it.“She didn’t know what to do, she was very conflicted, she was angry, she was really confused about how to deal with this,” McLaughlin told CBC News. After consulting with McLaughlin, Stoynoff decided that coming forward about Trump’s inappropriate advances would just be too risky after their conversation, according to McLaughlin.“It was going to be a he said, she said,” McLaughlin told CBC News. “And we were talking about one of the most influential people in North America at the time. He was just flying high with ‘The Apprentice,’ he was aggressive, he was litigious.”McLaughlin tweeted about their discussion as well.On Thursday, Trump denied coming on to Stoynoff in part by asking why she chose not to make the alleged encounter the subject of her story. (He also insinuated that Stoynoff’s looks were not appealing enough for him to act in such a way.)But in Stoynoff’s story, which came out Wednesday evening, the writer says she remained silent because she feared that a “famous, powerful, wealthy man could and would discredit and destroy” her. McLaughlin’s remarks confirm that she felt this way.New evidence undercutting Trump’s rebuttal of another assault claim also emerged Saturday. Jessica Leeds said that Trump began groping and kissing her without permission while sitting first class on a Braniff flight from Dallas, Texas, to New York City in 1979. Trump claimed he could not have done so because of the armrest between them.But entertainment news site TMZ discovered that the Braniff airplanes used for that flight had removable armrests between first-class seats.A growing number of women have accused the Republican nominee of unwanted kissing and groping accusations this week after he vehemently denied assaulting women in Sunday night’s debate with Hillary Clinton. CNN’s Anderson Cooper, a co-moderator of the debate, had asked Trump whether the real estate mogul ever did the things he boasted about on a 2005 hot mic conversation with Billy Bush, who was then host of “Access Hollywood.” In a video of that conversation that leaked just over a week ago, Trump claims that his fame allows him to do “anything” he wants to women, including “grab them by the pussy.”As of Saturday afternoon, 13 women have accused Trump of sexual assault, a Huffington Post count shows, the vast majority of them in the past few days.Trump has provided no credible evidence to exonerate himself, focusing instead on insulting his accusers. The only witness Trump’s campaign produced to try and refute a woman’s claims against the real estate businessman has himself admitted to recruiting underage boys for illicit sex parties with Conservative Party officials in the United Kingdom.Trump’s flailing response to the mounting scandal over his treatment of women appears to have hurt his standing in the polls. Clinton now leads Trump by about 8 percentage points nationwide, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average. Perhaps in anticipation of his forthcoming defeat, Trump has begun claiming that the election is rigged.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

He promises the total will exceed $100 million before all is over.However, not only is Trump not self-funding his campaign, but he only contributed $2 million to his own campaign in September, according to a press release sent out on Saturday. The press release further stated that the Trump campaign, including its fundraising committees connected to the Republican National Committee, pulled in $100 million in September. He would have to give $44 million in the remaining weeks to reach this total of $100 million.Trump’s September haul is about 50 percent less than the $154 million the campaign of Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton announced she had raised for her campaign and fundraising committees linked to the party. It is also wildly lower than the $174 million Mitt Romney raised as the GOP presidential candidate in September 2012.Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs banker now serving as Trump’s finance director, nonetheless touted the haul in a statement. “These numbers show that Donald Trump continues to have incredible broad based support from across America,” he said. “We want to thank our many volunteers and contributors that are clearly committed to electing Donald J. Trump as President in November.”Trump is currently relying on small donations from his core of supporters. The vast majority of former Romney donors have failed to give to his campaign, as have those who gave to his Republican primary rivals. He has received contributions from more than 2.6 million individuals, which is a record for a Republican candidate.The low fundraising totals Trump posted for September put him a precarious position in relation to Clinton. He entered the final month of the campaign with $75 million cash on hand while she had $150 million. His campaign has spent far less on advertising than previous candidates, while Clinton has buried him with tens of thousands of ads in key swing states. Trump’s campaign never invested money in building a ground game to get voters to the polls while she has hired thousands of staffers, invested in significant data infrastructure and targeted advertising to mobilize the Obama coalition.And there are questions about where Trump is spending the money. He has spent lavishly on his own properties, including flying practically solo on his very own 757. Much of his expenses have gone toward digital fundraising advertisements. This means that he is spending big sums to rake in his small contributions.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Ohio is a must-win state for Trump, and feuding with the state’s party chairman ― while having relatively little on-the-ground infrastructure ― is not how any campaign would prefer to spend the runup to Election Day.In response to the letter, Borges said, “I speak and meet with Bob Paduchik and Trump team members regularly. Interestingly, none of Bob’s concerns were voiced until he shared them publicly today.”Borges blamed the spat on the “bruised ego of a staffer,” referring to Paduchik.It’s unclear exactly what led to the infighting that has now spilled into public view. Henry Gomez of the Cleveland Plain Dealer thinks that “what really seems to have rankled the Trump team is Borges’ public deliberations over Trump. He began the week unsure if he would vote for Trump.”The rift continues Trump’s discord with the Ohio GOP. Gov. John Kasich (R), a former primary opponent of Trump’s who has refused to endorse him, is close to Borges, and has said he’s “very unlikely” to vote for the nominee.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Trump would mock the sound of Matlin’s voice and treat her as if she were intellectually disabled.Matlin is deaf and uses American Sign Language to communicate.Matlin responded to the report on Friday, tweeting a statement that the word “retarded” is abhorrent to her, and that discrimination is a serious issue for millions of people in the U.S. who are deaf or hard of hearing. She promised she would use her voice to make herself heard in the election.As many as three in 1,000 children are born with detectable hearing loss in at least one ear, and about 15 percent of American adults, or 37.5 million people, report some level of hearing loss. This means that Trump just disparaged a huge group of voters ― people with hearing loss, and those who know and love them.Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, president of the national advocacy group RespectAbility, decried Trump’s personal attack on Matlin, whom she called “a national icon.” Mizrahi said Trump’s comments reinforce the notion that people with disabilities are somehow “less than,” and perpetuate a stigma that keeps people with disabilities from the job market.“It’s time for people to see people with disabilities for the ABILITIES they have,” Mizrahi said in a statement emailed to HuffPost. “Name calling brings us back to the dark ages and there is no place for it in 2016.”Trump’s use of the word “retarded” to demean others is nothing new for him. Nor is his mockery of people with physical disabilities. During a speech in November, he imitated the limited arm movements of New York Times journalist Serge Kovaleski, who has arthrogryposis, a condition that restricts the way he moves his limbs. Trump’s mockery of Matlin cuts to the core of a common stigma against deaf people: Because their voice can sound tonally different from the voices of hearing people, they are perceived as unintelligent. This misperception keeps some people with deafness from speaking out loud altogether, as it is difficult for them to regulate the sounds they make. This, in turn, can be misinterpreted by hearing people as an intellectual disability. But more broadly, Trump’s biggest offense isn’t that he mistook one disability for another. It’s that he used ableist language to demean someone, Twitter user Pamela_Heard pointed out. Stigma against people who are deaf can result in social exclusion, put people at a higher risk of depression, keep people from seeking help when they start to notice they have hearing loss, and illegally withhold opportunities at school and work. One simple way to be more inclusive of people who are deaf, and people with disabilities in general, is to remember that words have power, and that they can be deployed as weapons to dehumanize others and to limit their abilities and opportunities, notes the Association of University Centers on Disabilities. “’Retard’ and ‘retarded’ are derogatory and dehumanizing terms ― on par with the N-word used to describe African Americans, and various hateful terms used to describe members of the Jewish, gay and lesbian, and other minority communities,” the AUCD website says. “In addition, words and labels can cause others to think that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are not able to achieve the things that others can achieve.”Here’s hoping Trump can learn something from the outrage caused by his remarks to Matlin, and change the way he speaks about people with disabilities — regardless of whether he wins the presidency.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Russia has also denied any involvement in the DNC email hacks.The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also alleges that the Russian government is responsible for a more recent hack of campaign chairman John Podesta’s e-mails.Top House Democrats called on the FBI on Friday to investigate the presidential campaign of GOP nominee Donald Trump for possible involvement in the breach."

The tent was set up in a crowded market in the city’s northern al-Shaab district.Gunmen believed to belong to Islamic State, a Sunni group, earlier in the day staged two attacks north of Baghdad, one targeting a police check-point and the other the house of a Sunni militia chief who supports the government, police sources said.Eight policemen were killed and 11 others wounded in the first attack which took place Mutaibija, south of the city of the city of Tikrit, while the militants had three dead in their ranks.In the second, the wife and three children of Numan al-Mujamaie, the leader of the Ishaqi Mobilization militia, were killed when gunmen stormed his house in the town of Ishaq in his absence.The assailants fled, chased by security forces, and later killed themselves by detonating explosive belts, police said.Islamic State has intensified bomb attacks in government-held areas this year as it loses territory to U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces and Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias.The group claimed a truck bombing in July that killed at least 324 people in the Karrada shopping area of Baghdad - the deadliest single attack in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003."
