At the time, though, Andy — as the journalist had identified himself — must’ve seemed harmless enough, if overly persistent. He promised he was “a very trustworthy person,” and while his questions were prying, he was gentle in asking them. And Andy was frank about what he was looking for: information about a well-known actress who’d had an affair with Avellan’s ex-husband, director Robert Rodriguez.“I’ve been writing about a lady called Rose McGowan, who I expect is someone you’re not very friendly with,” he told Avellan. “Right?”“Uhhhh,” replied Avellan, herself a film producer with dozens of credits to her name, including “Sin City” and “The Faculty.” It was a moment of hesitation, soon overcome.In the interview, a transcript of which was obtained by HuffPost, Andy coaxed Avellan into speaking at length — about her former husband, about McGowan, about what she’d heard had happened that night in 1997 between McGowan and Weinstein at the Sundance Film Festival. Today, roughly a year after the phone call, we know Andy was actually working on behalf of Weinstein, whether he knew it or not, and that his interview with Avellan would wind up in the hands of the movie mogul, part of Weinstein’s campaign to undermine his eventual accusers. The transcript is a case study in how Weinstein used a corrupted sort of journalism in waging that campaign, until the real thing finally brought him down.Earlier this month, Ronan Farrow published an exhaustive account in The New Yorker of Weinstein’s “army of spies,” which he deployed in his ultimately unsuccessful attempt to suppress stories about his decades-long history of alleged sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein hired private security agencies — including one called Black Cube, run by former Israeli intelligence officers, and another called PSOPS, in Los Angeles — to keep tabs on actresses and journalists. He also enlisted journalists in his campaign to investigate and discredit not just accusers but other journalists.As Farrow first reported, one of Weinstein’s foot soldiers was Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media Inc. (AMI), which publishes tabloids including the National Enquirer, where Howard also serves as editor-in-chief. Howard’s spy work on behalf of Weinstein apparently centered on McGowan. In October 2016, the actress, whose roles have included the TV show “Charmed” and the feature film “Scream,” fired off a series of tweets that we now know were about Weinstein. Using the hashtag #WhyWomenDontReport, she said not only that she had been raped but that a studio boss had done it. Why hadn’t she reported her rape? “Because,” she tweeted, “my ex sold our movie to my rapist for distribution.”Later that fall, Andy interviewed Avellan on behalf of Coleman-Rayner, a Los Angeles-based news and photo agency that works on stories for various tabloids.Soon after, the interview ended up in Howard’s hands. “I have something AMAZING,” Howard gushed in an email to Weinstein dated Dec. 7 and obtained by HuffPost. (Ronan Farrow also published excerpts from the email exchange.) “My guy spoke with Elizabeth Avellan — she is a good talker!” He went on to describe unflattering things Avellan had said about McGowan during her conversation with Andy.“This is the killer,” Weinstein replied. “Especially if my fingerprints r not on this.”“They are not,” Howard assured him.In separate, contradictory statements to HuffPost, a spokesperson for Weinstein and a spokesperson for AMI denied the two were in cahoots. According to the Weinstein spokesperson, the movie mogul wasn’t trying to discredit an accuser; he had merely proposed a story idea for Howard to pursue.“Last fall, Mr. Weinstein gave Mr. Howard a news tip that Mr. Howard agreed might make a good story,” the spokesperson explained in an email to HuffPost. “Mr. Howard pursued the tip and followed up with Mr. Weinstein as a courtesy but declined to publish any story. Any suggestion that there was a payment for any information is false.”The AMI spokesperson had a different story: There was no news tip. The company claimed that because it had a partnership with the Weinstein Company to develop various television projects, Howard wanted to investigate McGowan’s accusations to protect AMI’s interests.“Mr. Weinstein insisted that women were making false accusations against him, and gave Mr. Howard a list of contacts whom, he claimed, would undermine the women’s claims,” the spokesperson said. “Mr. Howard felt he had an obligation to protect AMI’s interests by seeking out — but not publishing — information about those women, and he assigned a freelancer to interview Ms. Avellan in Texas, where she lived.”The spokesperson agreed with Weinstein’s representative that no money had changed hands. The spokesperson also took care to note that AMI had denied one key Weinstein request: “AMI never published any of the information he received despite Mr. Weinstein’s constant requests to Mr. Howard.”As for Andy, we couldn’t confirm his identity, and Coleman-Rayner refused to allow HuffPost to speak to anyone at the company about the Avellan interview. “There will be no comment from Coleman-Rayner,” explained the person who answered the phone when we called. “You need to go back to AMI. There’s nothing to say. There will be no comment. Period.”Whatever his arrangement with Howard and, by proxy, with Weinstein, Andy discharged his duty well. In the transcript, Andy can be seen easing Avellan out of her initial reluctance in part by showing himself to be simpatico with her on the subject of McGowan. (The quotes below are taken directly from the transcript.)Andy: Yes exactly. I mean she’s been making a lot of statements against Hollywood, Hollywood system, actors, directors, producers, and people that she’s sort of worked with in the past. She’s somebody who has quite a colorful past herself, I’ve found out. And I just wondered if I could ask you a little bit about what your sort of view of her is as a person. I know this is quite a tough question to spring on you. I didn’t mean to be so blasé. Obviously this isn’t the sort of thing that, you know, people …Avellan would later tell Farrow that Andy had simply worn her down. He “kept calling and calling and calling” until she finally decided to pick up. “I was afraid people might start calling my kids,” she said.As the interview continued, Avellan grew suspicious. The reporter began to hedge on how he’d come to pursue his story.E: What publication are you working for? What is this article about – is it an article?And a moment later:A: I can understand that though, it’s true, because if you say around anybody who’s been around Hollywood in the ’90s, they always know her.Avellan proceeded to pass along bits of gossip that she’d heard about McGowan and Weinstein, and then about McGowan’s relationships with men. The reporter nudged her into spilling even more.A: But she is ― this is the sort of crux of what I’m sort of trying to figure out.

3,POLITICS,Anita Hill: Joe Biden's Apology Is 'Not Enough',Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anita-hill-joe-biden-apology_us_5a15a8c4e4b09650540ec7b6,"""He said, 'I am sorry if she felt she didn’t get a fair hearing.' That’s sort of an 'I’m sorry if you were offended.'""",2017-11-22,"Biden at a Nov. 13 event in New York, where he was asked about his handling of Anita Hill's testimony.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15b92b140000891d50ee30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Anita Hill said former Vice President Joe Biden’s recent apology for his handling of her 1991 Senate testimony against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is “not enough” to make up for his failure at the time “to show leadership on this issue on behalf of women’s equality.”“He said, ‘I am sorry if she felt she didn’t get a fair hearing.’ That’s sort of an ‘I’m sorry if you were offended,’” Hill said in a wide-ranging Washington Post interview published Wednesday in which she also compared her time in the spotlight with unfairness that remains for women facing workplace sexual harassment.Biden, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing considering Thomas’ Supreme Court nomination, was asked on Nov. 13 about his widely criticized handling of Hill’s testimony that Thomas had sexually harassed her when they worked together. Hill’s testimony led to attacks on her credibility. Thomas, meanwhile, was narrowly confirmed to the high court.“Let’s get something straight here: I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas,” Biden said. He added: “I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through.”“The only issue in the Anita Hill case was whether or not there could be information submitted in a record without a name attached to it, anonymously accusing someone of something,” he continued, referring to criticisms that other women were not permitted to testify against Thomas. Neither Biden nor Thomas would comment on Hill’s remarks reported in The Washington Post.Hill said Biden’s apology omits “his role in what happened.”“He also doesn’t understand that it wasn’t just that I felt it was not fair,” Hill said. “It was that women were looking to the Senate Judiciary Committee and his leadership to really open the way to have these kinds of hearings. They should have been using best practices to show leadership on this issue on behalf of women’s equality. And they did just the opposite.”Hill also said that she does not feel Biden has taken “responsibility for” victimization she experienced as a result of the hearing.Washington Post reporter Libby Casey: So he says, “Anita Hill was victimized. There’s no question in my mind,” but I think the takeaway from a lot of women’s groups and members of Congress was that the victimization may have been twofold. Many people think that the victimization continued when you had to undergo this hearing.Hill drew parallels between the Senate hearing and how women who have reported workplace sexual harassment still are forced into “a process where you know they’re not going to be treated fairly.”Corporate human resources departments and other internal ways of reporting sexual misconduct often have the effect of protecting the employer, not the complainants, she pointed out.“You cannot just bring people forward into a process where you know they’re not going to be treated fairly. That’s not being heard,” Hill said. “That’s something that we are struggling with right now. Women are coming in to make a complaint, and the process is unfair and employers are saying, ‘Well, we have a process.’ Well, that’s not enough.”The newspaper interview brought together Hill and five Democratic women lawmakers who at the time protested the Senate hearing, calling it “a trial” against Hill.“I found for me that is the memory I had that I will never forget, sitting there and looking at the faces of the men questioning. They were just blank faces I found,” Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said in the interview.“We were just stunned at our ‘liberals’ that were on the Judiciary Committee,” former Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) said, making air quotes.Hill’s testimony, more than 25 years ago, helped to raise awareness about sexual harassment of women in the workplace.But Hill, who has been outspoken about the recent wave of powerful men facing allegations of serial sexual misconduct, said it’s clear that larger, systemic issues still exist.“Things have evolved. I’ve heard from thousands of women and some of them tell me very good stories about what has changed. But there needs to be more than just process on the books,” Hill said. “Women are still experiencing this problem. It’s still a teachable moment where we can learn from what happened in 1991. Just having somebody come forward is not enough. You’ve got to be able to come into a system that respects and values our experiences and our work and our integrity. And we’re not there yet.”Read the full Washington Post interview here."

She remembers driving home that day shocked at what had just happened and terrified about being able to afford health care.“I was really, really worried,” said Briskman, 50, a single mom of two. “I’ve been on Obamacare before. I’ve been vulnerable in that department.”Luckily, one of her friends set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for her while she looked for a new job. As Briskman’s story began to spread, so did the number of people outraged that government contractor Akima LLC canned her over the Trump incident, particularly since it happened when she was riding her bicycle and not at work. The donations started to roll in ― and haven’t stopped.More than 5,500 people had given almost exactly $124,000 to Briskman as of Wednesday evening. Donations of $10 or $20 have come from people all over the U.S. and, for some reason, from lots of people in Germany. Even celebrities have kicked in some money. Rosie O’Donnell ― a longtime Trump target ― gave her $1,000.Briskman said she’s been stunned by the response and has been trying to thank every person who has given her money; so far, she’s sent messages to about 4,000 people. She said she’s been moved by the number of people trying to help her when they concede they don’t have much to give.“Some people are like, ‘I don’t have any money, but I want you to have a cup of coffee.’ Or they’ll say, ‘I’m broke, I’m working two jobs, but damn it, have a beer on me,’” she said, choking up. “I’m filled with gratitude. I can’t even say enough thanks.”Briskman said she’s “definitely” feeling better financially and is looking for a new job in marketing. She said she’s heard from several prospective employers since she was identified as the woman in the photo flipping the bird at Trump, including MoveOn.org, a Virginia congressman, an Arizona assistant attorney general and two bicycle organizations.In the meantime, Briskman said she’s trying to pay back some of the generosity she’s benefited from. She recently came across a GoFundMe campaign for an elderly woman in Kentucky who needs dialysis treatments but can’t afford transportation to the clinic. Briskman said she chipped in what she could and is trying to get others to help.“When you see this, it’s going to break your heart,” she said, directing HuffPost to a local news story about the woman, Susan Moore. “I need to do something to honor everything people have done for me. How can you not?”"

David died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long. Thank you for the abundance and support you have shown him these many years.”Cassidy was 67.Cassidy had recently been taken to a hospital in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area, as first reported by TMZ. It was reported Saturday that Cassidy had undergone organ failure. Cassidy’s career in entertainment spanned 50 years and included stints performing in successful shows in Las Vegas and touring the world singing his hit songs.He rose to fame while starring in “The Partridge Family,” a popular musical sitcom about a family of touring musicians that premiered in 1970. Cassidy played the role of Keith Partridge, the family’s eldest brother and the band’s lead singer. Shirley Jones, Cassidy’s real-life stepmother, played Keith’s mother, Shirley Partridge.The role, along with Cassidy’s voice and his shaggy hair, launched him into the spotlight as a teen heartthrob, with a fan club reportedly bigger than those of Elvis Presley and the Beatles at the time, according to CNN.Cassidy gained so much attention during that time that the media began talking about “Cassidymania,” according to NBC News. “The Partridge Family” ended after four seasons, but Cassidy continued on with his solo musical career, performing his own songs and songs from the show.The pop star faced many difficulties, including a struggle with alcohol abuse. He was arrested multiple times for driving while intoxicated and was in and out of rehabilitation facilities. In 2015, he filed for bankruptcy after Sue Cassidy, his wife of 23 years, filed for divorce.This February, Cassidy announced that he had been diagnosed with dementia and would retire from touring at the end of the year.“I want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I’ve been without any distractions,” Cassidy told People magazine at the time. “I want to love. I want to enjoy life.”After Cassidy was hospitalized Saturday, his half-brother thanked the singer’s fans on Facebook.“Thank you for all your love and good wishes for David,” Shaun Cassidy wrote. “It means the world to all of us.”Cassidy leaves behind his daughter, actress Katie Cassidy, 30, and his son, Beau Cassidy, 26."
8,POLITICS,"Public Defenders Fight Back Against Budget Cuts, Growing Caseloads","Stateline, ContributorStateline provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in s...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/public-defenders-fight-back-against-budget-cuts-growing_us_5a1440d3e4b08b00ba67341f,Public defenders say the funding problem they’ve been shouting about for years is at a crisis point.,2017-11-21,"<p>A court-appointed “lawyer of the day” explains a legal implication to a person charged with a crime in Portland, Maine. Increasingly, public defense advocates are suing states for more funding for legal representation for poor defendants.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1440f41800001a00f6d521.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Teresa WiltzPublic defenders have complained for decades they’ve got too many cases and not enough money — or time — to do their clients justice.Now, more public defense advocates are suing states for more funding. Overwhelmed public defenders also are increasingly trying other tactics: refusing to take on new cases, raising money through crowdfunding, even trying to assign a case to a sitting governor.“It’s been a huge national failure,” said William Leahy, New York’s chief public defender, of the whole public defense system, which provides legal representation for poor people charged with more serious crimes, a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.With declining budgets and crushing caseloads, juggling clients has become a Sisyphean task, public defenders say. In New Orleans, for example, 60 public defenders manage roughly 20,000 cases a year. And overburdened public defenders, they argue, can’t mount a vigorous defense for their clients.As poor defendants languish in jails awaiting representation that’s months or years away, even some conservatives wonder whether it’s time to change the system.“If the government can bring charges against you and you’re unable to have someone represent and defend you, that’s the route to totalitarianism. You’re stripped of your rights,” said Pat Nolan, director of the Center for Criminal Justice Reform at the American Conservative Union Foundation, the advocacy group that hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.Crushing CaseloadsThe Sixth Amendment guarantees anyone facing criminal charges the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury and legal counsel. And with its 1963 decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled anyone charged with a serious crime had a “fundamental” right to counsel, no matter their ability to pay — but left the matter of funding up to the states.Today, public defense is typically paid for with a patchwork of state and county funding, with the exception of federal public defenders. The U.S. Department of Justice also provides limited grants for state public defense, many of which go to training.And across the country, public defenders have been pushing back. Last week, public defenders across Massachusetts demonstrated against low pay (average base salary is $47,500 a year) and their lack of collective bargaining power as state employees.In October, public defenders in Kansas City, Missouri, staged a courtroom protest to decry their staggering caseloads — most handle 80 to 100 cases a week. And in the wake of proposed budget cuts, Amy Campanelli, the Cook County, Illinois, public defender, threatened to stop taking on new cases.There has been action in the courts, as well. Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit against the state of Nevada for allegedly neglecting the constitutional rights of poor defendants in rural counties. In those counties, private contractors who aren’t required to have experience or training in criminal defense are hired by the county to defend the poor, the suit alleges.In recent months, the ACLU also has sued both the state of Missouri and Grays Harbor County in Washington state over systemic problems with their public defender programs. And a case is pending in the Idaho Supreme Court over deficiencies in the state’s indigent defense system.Sometimes, the public defenders themselves are the ones getting sued. In February, the Southern Poverty Law Center sued Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, along with the state Public Defender Board and the state’s chief public defender over what the organization calls the state’s “broken” system of indigent defense.And in September, the Missouri Supreme Court disciplined two public defenders, one for taking on too many cases and the other for not asking permission before refusing to take on any more cases. “It’s coming at us from both sides,” said Michael Barrett, director of the Missouri State Public Defender System. “The courts are frustrating our efforts to limit our caseloads and at the same time, they’re censuring us.”Public defenders are so underfunded and understaffed, Barrett said, that often they’re forced to tell clients, “‘We’re going to work hard on your case, but it’s going to be a while before I can get to you.’ That tells defendants they have a choice to make. If they want their constitutional defense, they have to sit in jail for a few months.”Or, he said, as happens more often than not, defendants can take a plea even if they’re not guilty, just so they can get out of jail and get on with their lives, often not fully understanding the consequences. “Then they can’t get jobs or housing,” Barrett said.So what’s the solution?Many legal experts on both sides of the aisle agree that what’s needed is a complete overhaul of the system. Some, such as Marc Levin, the vice president of criminal justice at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, suggest reducing the number of offenses that carry the potential of jail time.That way, fewer cases would require the right to counsel provided by the government — and limited indigent defense resources could be spread over a smaller number of cases, Levin said.Other options: Enact legislation allowing the federal government to bring actions against states and localities that fail to provide poor defendants with adequate representation, said Norman Reimer, executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a professional organization based in Washington, D.C. Or, rather than charging nonviolent offenders with a crime, assign them to a social worker and funnel them into counseling and drug treatment programs. Or increase the use of restorative justice projects, which use mediation between victims and defendants to come up with an agreed-upon solution and restitution, Levin said.Ultimately, Levin said, he hopes that the shortcomings in the current system will inspire lawmakers to come up with a solution that requires a smaller government footprint — and that protects public safety and the constitutional rights of defendants.Court BattlesFor now, advocates continue to sue to force change.In court, the battle over indigent representation usually takes one of two tactics, said Stephen Hanlon, general counsel for the National Association for Public Defense: Either public defenders or civil rights advocates sue states over funding, or they end up in court for refusing to take on any more cases. Sometimes it works: New York’s county-funded public defender system was found to be “severely dysfunctional” in a statewide study in 2006, and a civil liberties group later sued, arguing the system violated the constitutional rights of poor defendants.The state settled, and this year’s budget, signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, establishes standards for public defender services and requires the state to refund counties for the costs of meeting those standards.Next year, New York will begin funding a statewide public defense system, to be fully phased in by 2023 at a projected annual cost of $250 million.Meanwhile, some public defenders are working to raise awareness of the problems they face, though the results have been mixed.In 2016, Missouri’s Barrett drew attention to his office’s massive workload when he leaned on a provision in state law that allows him to appoint any member of the state bar to a case, assigning then-governor Jay Nixon. (A judge later ruled that Barrett didn’t have the authority to appoint Nixon.)And last year, Derwyn Bunton, who runs the public defenders’ office in New Orleans, said his office would no longer accept the most serious felonies; he said he didn’t have the staff to handle the workload. (Cases are then put on a waitlist and a judge decides which pro bono attorney to assign them to, which means that defendants can wait weeks before meeting with an attorney.)Until recently, the city had the highest incarceration rate in the country. And the vast majority of its defendants — 85 percent — rely on public defenders.New Orleans’ public defenders’ office is funded by a combination of city and state money along with income from court and traffic fees and fines, which means it can’t rely on a set amount each month and, as a result, almost always operates at a deficit.The year before, when his office was faced with a $1 million shortfall, Bunton took the unusual step of setting up a crowdfunding page. The campaign raised nearly $100,000, enough to help the office avoid furloughs.“I try to avoid drama,” Bunton said. “There’s not a lot of extreme things that we do. But we try to stand on principle,” which is why his office continues to refuse cases officials feel they can’t handle.“Rich justice and poor justice,” he said, “should look the same.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"
9,POLITICS,The Maniac Neo-Nazis Keeping Charles Manson's Race War Alive,Luke O'Brien and Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alt-right-charles-manson-atomwaffen_us_5a146921e4b03dec824892e6,How Atomwaffen wants to make Helter Skelter real.,2017-11-21,Charles Manson pictured at California Medical Facility in August 1980.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1479af150000e6278594c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Charles Manson is dead now, and we are the richer for it. Manson was a thief, a pimp and a murderous cult leader bent on race war. He was true scum. No wonder some alt-righters are pouring out drinks for him.“A great revolutionary,” said one commenter of Manson on the IronMarch neo-Nazi internet forum.″The world really does feel a little emptier,” said another.One bereaved bigot simply posted a Celine Dion lyric: “Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on ...”“Hero.” “Champion.” “Warrior of Truth.” Such were the tributes used Monday to describe a demented butcher.If you’re wondering who might rhapsodize a psychotic racist in this manner, the answer is other psychotic racists, many of whom belong to Atomwaffen Division, a particularly bloodthirsty and anti-American branch of the so-called alt-right that has made worshipping Manson a part of their cultish devotion to violent insurrection.Even within the alt-right — a loose association of white supremacists and fascists — the Atomwaffen Division is considered extreme. The group, whose name translates to “Atomic Weapons Division,” puts out ISIS-style propaganda videos on YouTube that feature members clad in skull masks and camouflage outfits, sometimes on training exercises in the woods, often holding guns and the organization’s distinctive yellow-and-black nuclear-themed flags. In one video, members burn a copy of the U.S. Constitution on a grill.Atomwaffen is best known for a double homicide in Tampa this May, in which Devon Arthurs, a member of the group who had converted to a violent, fundamentalist version of Islam, shot and killed two of his roommates, who were also Atomwaffen members. A fourth roommate, Brandon Russell, was arrested later for having bomb-making equipment and radioactive material. Russell, too, was part of Atomwaffen. He had a framed photo of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in his bedroom.Apocalyptic lunacy has always been part of far-right politics, and a vigorous strain of it runs through today’s alt-right white supremacist movement. It should come as no surprise, then, that Manson, whose once-upon-a-time status as a longhair could never obscure the swastika carved into his forehead, might serve as a new vessel of madness for today’s violent racists. In many ways, he was a forebear of groups like Atomwaffen and a bug-eyed prototype for the modern race warrior.Manson’s deranged political teachings were a mish-mash of Scientology, occultism and Nazism, all bundled into an original end-of-days tale. Stay with me, he told his followers, and you’ll be saved from the coming race war. “Manson was motivated by an apocalyptic belief in the imminent end of the world through a race war in which the White population was doomed to defeat,” Jeffrey Kaplan wrote in Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right. “The victorious Black population would in time realize that the White man is genetically more fit to govern, and would seek in vain for White survivors of the racial Holocaust to assume the reins of power. The Manson family, having survived the apocalypse by hiding in a timeless cave at the center of the world, would then emerge to take power.”This worldview led Manson and his followers into an especially desolate part of Death Valley called Barker Ranch in 1969, where Time magazine described them as “holed up in run-down cabins” leading an “indolent, almost savage existence, singing Manson’s songs, dancing, swimming in a small pool, stealing cars for cash and picking through garbage for food.” Here they would dodge the apocalypse.By the early 1980s, of course, Manson had failed to dodge his own downfall. He wasn’t in a timeless cave at the center of the world. He was in a cell in San Quentin, serving a life sentence for the gruesome murders of seven people. Manson had led his followers, known as The Family, in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six other people in a two-night killing spree in Los Angeles.It was in prison that Manson started a correspondence with a longtime American neo-Nazi named James Mason, who would come to view “Charlie” as a prophet of hate. Mason was the type of man who considered Auschwitz a “damned nice place,” and his wingnut journey would take him from the heart of organized white supremacy to years of inept obscurity and, ultimately, back to a faint relevance in the Trump era thanks to the alt-right and Atomwaffen.A fascist since he was 13, when he joined the youth movement of George Lincoln Rockwell’s American Nazi Party, Mason had radicalized himself while watching black people take to the streets during the civil rights era. As a young adult, he set up Nazi booths at county fairs in southern Ohio, where he’d grown up.“We should shoot for bringing down the system,” he would later say. “Destroy the system.”Mason eventually left the American Nazi Party and joined a splinter group called the National Socialist Liberation Front. Some NSLF members were fans of Manson, which prompted Mason to begin researching the cult leader. In 1980, Mason reached out to the incarcerated Manson. The two began communicating regularly by mail and phone.“What I discovered was a revelation equal to the revelation I received when I first found Adolf Hitler,” Mason would later explain.Through “Charlie,” Mason came to understand that Hitler’s death had brought about the end of Western civilization. Every government in the world was now part of an anti-white global conspiracy run by “super capitalists” and “super communists.” Nothing about Western culture or its institutions could be salvaged. It would all have to be blown to smithereens.“It’s just like a human organism that has ingested a fatal dose of poison,” Mason would explain. “[If] you fall asleep with it and try to ride it out, you’re going to die, but if you become suddenly, violently ill and expel that poison ― even though the experience may be rather unpleasant ― you at least have a chance to live. Manson called that Helter Skelter.”So inspired by “Charlie” was Mason that he took the murderous cult leader’s advice and renamed his neo-Nazi organization Universal Order. Mason began writing a newsletter called “Siege” to promote Manson’s views as a continuation of Hitler’s philosophy. In 1992, Mason would collect these writings into a book that neo-Nazi skinhead leader Tom Metzger called “435 pages of hot revolutionary style white propaganda.”For Mason and other white supremacists, Manson was almost a divine being, an atavistic incarnation of hate. The cult leader fit neatly into a strain of fascist magical realism called “Esoteric Hitlerism” that became popular after World War II when the Greek writer Savitri Devi proposed that Hitler was the ninth avatar of Vishnu and racist dupes somehow bought into it.This type of crazy remains en vogue among the alt-right today, with notable exponents such as Andrew “weev” Auernheimer, a neo-Nazi hacker and the webmaster for The Daily Stormer, whose charismatic ravings make him the closest thing to a contemporary Manson in the movement. (Auernheimer has ties to Atomwaffen and after the Arthurs murders issued an overloud declamation about how he knew the shooter and the victims but had previously banned Arthurs from a Daily Stormer forum.)But the effects of Manson on today’s white supremacist movement ― in no small part thanks to Mason’s efforts ― go beyond evil juju. Consider white separatism in the modern context. Organized racists in America these days like to call themselves “white nationalists.” This of course is partly a public relations gambit — “white nationalist” is maybe more palatable than “neo-Nazi” or “white supremacist” — but it’s also an accurate description of what they want. Groups across the racist political spectrum want a White Nation, an ethno-state, somewhere in America for just the White Race. The three-piece-suit-wearing figurehead of the alt-right, Richard Spencer, is very open about this. So is veteran skinhead Jeff Schoep, the leader of the National Socialist Movement. As is KKK-enthusiast Brad Griffin, aka Hunter Wallace, a leader of the League of the South. In 2000, Mason wrote Manson to thank him for this brand of white separatism. In a two-page history of the Universal Order he penned for Kaplan’s The Encyclopedia of White Power, Mason wrote: Although few would realize or admit it, the gradual move away from “White Supremacy” toward White Separatism, from any hopes of recovering the U.S. government, toward establishing new, independent regions, is precisely what animated the creation of the Manson enclaves in the Death Valley during the 1960s. At issue is bare survival as a species as the world system begins to crumble and die. Mason’s adulation of Manson made him somewhat of an outlier in the American neo-Nazi scene of the 1980s. And Manson veneration remains a prickly subject for current white nationalists. On Stormfront, another neo-Nazi forum, the commentary Monday about Manson’s passing mostly had a “Good riddance and thank God he’s dead” tenor. The Manson Family killed white people, after all. And Manson’s degeneracy reflects poorly on white supremacy. But degeneracy has never prevented neo-Nazis from attracting supporters. For years, Mason’s “Charlie”-inspired insights were sought after by other prominent racists, including Metzger, who interviewed Mason for over an hour in 1993 for his “Race and Reason” show. When talk turned to violence, as it often does with far-right extremists, Mason clucked disapprovingly about a 1984 mass shooting in which a survivalist gunman took out his rage at “international bankers” by massacring 21 people in a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, California. “It wouldn’t be such a bad thing if they would pick their targets a little more carefully,” he said.Mason faded into relative obscurity for the rest of the ’90s and early aughts, when he was in and out of prison on weapons charges and for an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old girl, of whom he had taken nude photographs.But in 2017, the year his hero “Charlie” would pass into the astral plane, Mason has found new relevance, and a fawning group of disciples in Atomwaffen. Earlier this year Atomwaffen republished Mason’s book “Siege” online, and announced the launch of a new Universal Order website.“JAMES MASON IS BACK!” read a July headline on the fascist zine Noose, an Atomwaffen site. After years of trying, the article said, Atomwaffen members had finally tracked down Mason for an exclusive interview! And to the violent group’s absolute glee, Mason was still Mason, an unhinged admirer of Manson and mass murderers. “My views on Manson have not changed,” he told an Atomwaffen member. “We had a society post-WW2 that was disintegrating, a mile a minute. We had a hippie generation, a country that was heading headlong into national suicide. Manson’s commune was solidly, solidly white.” When asked for his thoughts on Anders Breivik, the far-right Norwegian terrorist convicted of killing 77 people in a bombing and mass shooting in 2011, Mason replied that Breivik was “dead-on.”“I’m never gonna disown anybody who does something like that,” Mason said. Elsewhere in the interview, Mason said he’s “mildly encouraged” by the rise of Donald Trump.As recently as Sunday, one day before Manson died, Mason apparently wrote an article on the Universal Order website: a 1,400-word treatise praising Nazi eugenics and euthanasia.   Mason’s young devotees, meanwhile, have hinted on Twitter ― another key radicalization platform ― that they’re planning a memorial for “Charlie,” a more elaborate send-off for this proto-alt-right Hitlerian avatar of death and terror.“#JeSuisCharlie,” one commenter posted."

Dunston, ContributorPolicy Analyst | Political Commentator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/impose-a-moratorium-on-judicial-appointments-until_us_5a137270e4b08b00ba673334,The politicization of the judicial branch has reached new heights.,2017-11-21,"<p>President Trump observes as Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch (left), flanked by his wife, is sworn in by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy (right).</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1373bf150000e9278591eb.jpg?ops=crop_193_0_807_667%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A moratorium on all future judicial appointments should be imposed by Congress until Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation comes to a close.Since President Trump’s inauguration, nearly 70 judicial nominations have been under consideration to fill approximately 155 federal judicial vacancies. A few of the president’s nominations have raised eyebrows on both sides of the aisle ― the latest being Brett Talley, a 36-year-old legal novice, who has never tried a case.With apparent ties to the Trump administration, it is no surprise Talley is a member of an exclusive club. Four of Trump’s judicial nominations have been deemed “not qualified” by the American Bar Association, four candidates in 10 months; a historic feat in its own right.A political fight for control over the judicial branch has simmered for generations. The simmer is quickly approaching a rolling boil. What was once heralded as a coveted honor, bestowed only upon great legal scholars who devoted a lifetime of service to the United States, is now diminished to a political game of monopoly.Political parties seem to care less about civility, shared values, and placing country above party. The days when a diverse group of judges could set aside their political differences to agree on an interpretation of the Constitution that upheld and protected a woman’s right to choose, seem long gone.To the casual reader, some context may be necessary. Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case referenced above, won by a 7-2 margin. A winning coalition was facilitated by a conservative Associate Justice (Blackmun), with the support of two additional conservative Justices (Burger and Stewart), three liberal Justices (Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall), and one liberal Justice (Powell) appointed by a Republican president. It is also important to note, the two dissenting Justices (White and Rehnquist), were split politically as well.Competing political factions have wrestled for centuries, jockeying to gain leverage to secure a key vote on a contentious social, political, or legal issue. While Republicans are currently receiving the lion’s share of criticism for engaging in political shenanigans ― namely, for refusing to hold a hearing for President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland ― Democrats too, have engaged in their fair share of chicanery.In 1987, Robert Bork, a Reagan nominee, was infamously rejected by a Democratic controlled Senate. Douglas Ginsburg was nominated after Bork was rejected, but ultimately withdrew from consideration after increased scrutiny over his admitted use of marijuana as a college student and professor at Harvard University. The irony, especially given the legalization of recreational marijuana use in many states today, is laughable. Pro-marijuana legislation, by the way, championed by none other than the Democratic party.Since then, Republicans have been emboldened to elect an executive who will nominate conservative judges, who interpret the Constitution more in-line with their self-professed values. Those values include the protection of the right to bear arms (with the exception of minorities who legally bear arms); the protection of life (with a curious caveat of capital crimes and/or a conflict with the right to bear arms); and the protection of religious freedoms (with the exception of non-Christians).The question of impartiality, especially after a number of public statements made by various Trump nominees that suggest an overt political preference, raises legitimate concerns over a potential erosion of the court. Keep in mind, once confirmed, appointees serve for life. Imagine allowing a person who is ethically malleable, with questionable judgment and divisive partisan views, to serve on the bench for the next 25-40 years.Can the country truly afford another Roy Moore?Until the Special Counsel’s investigation is brought to a close, judicial appointments should be placed on moratorium. The American people must be assured that President Trump did not engage in collusion with a foreign adversary, nor attempt to obstruct justice, before considering any of his potential lifelong appointments. The stakes are simply too high."

A spokesman with the U.S. Attorney’s Office said Mesri has not been arrested, and declined to comment on the suspect’s whereabouts.The indictment described Mesri as a “self-professed expert” in hacking who had worked on behalf of Iran’s military to attack military systems, nuclear software systems and Israeli infrastructure.It also alleged that he helped an Iranian hacking group, Turk Black Hat Security Team, deface hundreds of websites in the United States and other countries.The cyber attack surfaced over the summer as HBO was running a new season of “Game of Thrones” and as the cable network’s parent Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) sought regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T Inc (T.N) in an $85.4 billion deal announced in October 2016.The indictment charges Mesri with hacking into HBO from May to August and stealing unaired episodes of programs including “Ballers,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “The Deuce.”Mesri also stole scripts and plot summaries for “Game of Thrones,” according to the indictment. It said he obtained credentials that HBO employees use to access the network, then used those accounts to steal data from the company’s servers from May to August of this year.He demanded up to $6 million to keep the data secret in extortion emails to HBO staff, some of which ended with photos of Night King, a menacing zombie villain from “Game of Thrones,” according to the indictment.Reuters was unable reach Mesri for comment.Prosecutors charged Mesri with computer fraud, wire fraud, extortion and identity theft.HBO spokesman Jeff Cusson declined to comment on the indictment. ”As far as the criminal case is concerned, we prefer to leave any comments to the US Attorney’s Office,” he said in an email.He declined to say if the company’s investigation into the breach was complete or how much the incident had cost the cable network."

Public activities like concerts and sporting events have traditionally been heavily restricted in the Saudi kingdom. The country’s newly established General Entertainment Authority has worked to promote leisure activities in recent months with a budget of roughly $3 billion.As of June, there had been more than 3,000 public events in 2017, up from just 300 the entire previous year, according to the GEA.The kingdom’s strict morality laws, which enforce prohibitions on alcohol, gender segregation and modest clothing, present some challenges to the GEA’s push. September marked the first time women in Saudi Arabia were allowed into the national stadium alongside men. Women still cannot attend certain events, like the upcoming concert with Nelly and a show earlier this year that featured country music star Toby Keith.Even with an all-male audience, non-Saudi entertainers can face some obstacles in the content they’re allowed to perform. A co-ed hip-hop dance group called iLuminate reportedly had to adjust their costumes and moves for a performance in Riyadh.Keith, whose hits include “Whiskey Girl” and “I Love This Bar,” said he was told not to perform songs about drinking, marijuana or sex. “There were only four or five things that I could play that were famous,” he told The Atlantic.Nelly’s single “Hot in Herre” references alcohol and repeatedly instructs women to “take off all your clothes.”The rapper’s scheduled performance in Jiddah has drawn criticism from some Saudis, who are pointing on social media to a recent rape allegation made against him, according to The Associated Press.Nelly was arrested in October after a woman accused the rapper of raping her on his tour bus. The woman subsequently told police she wished to cease the investigation, and Nelly was not charged with a crime."

Zimbabwe’s ruling ZANU-PF party had fired Mugabe as its leader earlier that day and expelled his politically powerful wife, Grace, from its ranks.Crowds of Zimbabweans gathered at Unity Square in the capital of Harare following the announcement of Mugabe’s resignation, cheering his ouster and waving signs.Once a celebrated freedom fighter, Mugabe has been accused of orchestrating human rights abuses against impoverished black Zimbabweans, white farmers and thousands of LGBTQ people while amassing vast wealth as the nation spiraled into poverty.His resignation is the culmination of a military action that began last week, when Zimbabwe’s armed forces seized control of state television, surrounded government buildings and detained the president in his home on Wednesday. Military officials denied at the time that they were attempting to depose the 93-year-old president, arguing that they were only targeting “criminals” around him. But as time went on and Mugabe kept silent, it became increasingly clear the leader’s days in power were numbered. Zimbabwe’s state-run newspaper released photos on Thursday purporting to show negotiations between military officials and the president. Tension and uncertainty dominated the days that followed, as Mugabe officially remained president but the military was effectively in control. Mugabe further confused observers when he made a public appearance last Friday, attending a graduation ceremony for Zimbabwe Open University.Mugabe has governed Zimbabwe since 1980, winning the presidency after he helped the country gain independence after a long struggle against colonial rule and governance by its white minority. Throughout his tenure, the strongman held onto power through crackdowns on opposition and dissent. Even as Zimbabwe’s economy collapsed in the past decade and the regime drew harsh international condemnation, Mugabe found ways to remain in control.In recent years, however, Mugabe’s advanced age and mental lapses grew increasingly apparent. He often slept through public events, had been oblivious while delivering the wrong speech to Parliament and seemed unfit for even basic ceremonial duties. Sensing an impending end to his rule, the country’s power brokers had begun a bitter jockeying over who would replace him.The current crisis began when Mugabe fired his vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, on Nov. 6, a move widely seen as a means to consolidate power within the president’s family and potentially clear the way for his wife to become his successor. The move upset Mnangagwa’s supporters in the military.Instead of waiting for a transition of power to Grace Mugabe, Gen. Constantino Chiwenga, the head of the nation’s military, issued a statement on Nov. 13 threatening to step in if Mugabe failed to halt purges against Mnangagwa loyalists. The army ultimately took action late the following night, bringing troops and military vehicles into the streets of the capital. The U.S. State Department’s top official for Africa told Reuters on Thursday that the country was seeking “a new era,” and encouraged Mugabe to step aside.“It’s a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that’s really what we’re hoping for,” Donald Yamamoto, acting assistant secretary of state for African affairs, told the news outlet.Mnangagwa, who issued a statement from an undisclosed location on Monday night calling for Mugabe to resign, now stands to become the country’s next leader. But there is concern among rights groups over both the nature of the change in leadership and Mnangagwa’s past.The military and 75-year-old Mnangagwa played key roles in asserting Mugabe’s authoritarian rule over the country, and have been implicated in orchestrating killings, disappearances and other rights abuses.This article has been updated with more details on Mugabe’s resignation. Willa Frej, Nick Visser and Lydia O’Connor contributed reporting."

Throughout his lengthy tenure, he’s been accused of systematically violating human rights and violently cracking down on dissent as Zimbabwe spiraled deeper into poverty.Thousands of elated civilians danced and sang in the streets as news broke that Mugabe was officially stepping down. Many say his political departure, triggered by a military takeover last week, marks a new chapter in the country’s history.“This is a good day for Zimbabwe. This is a new era for our nation,” one man told BBC News. “It is not a secret that everyone in Zimbabwe has been waiting for this moment,” another woman said. “It’s a fresh start for Zimbabwe.”The ruling ZANU-PF party will soon install Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s former deputy, as the new president. But Mnangagwa, a former national security minister who is strongly backed by the military, has been complicit in some of the government’s most egregious abuses of power.“It’s a change in leadership of individuals, but the authoritarian system remains intact,” cautioned Dewa Mavhinga, the Southern Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The military has been implicated in some of the most serious human rights abuses in Zimbabwe’s past” for which there has been no accountability, he told HuffPost on Tuesday.But for the time being, Zimbabwe’s political shakeup brings hope to a population that has been opressed for decades under Mugabe’s leadership.Take a look at some of the celebrations following his resignation on Tuesday:"

There surely are flaws in that hypothesis, but consider ratatouille and kindred dishes: It’s as though the cook has walked through the garden blindfolded and filled a basket with every summery thing that came to hand.At the moment, our New York City farmers’ markets present a different picture: roots, tubers and sturdy greens dominate, and many will continue to improve in flavor for another couple of months. There’s nothing stark about the winter market, even if the colors are muted.Jackie and I didn’t go to the market last weekend, because we’re running down the fridge before a trip, but the November produce we had in the house was muted in color too, and in putting together a recent chicken dinner I reached for a leek, pearly white tinged with pale green, and a small bulb of fennel of similar hue. Beyond their matchy-matchy colors, leeks and fennel share a gentle sweetness that brings their entirely distinctive flavors together.They also pair well with chicken: they support without dominating. Leeks in particular seem to have an affinity with either white or dark meat, and fennel brings in its own herbal aroma. And that’s what we had for dinner: Chicken legs with creamed leeks and fennel.The day before, I’d cut the breasts and legs from a good chicken – and boned the legs, too (using the bones, carcass and trimmings to make stock, and freezing the now-boneless breasts for another time). An hour before I planned to cook, I salted the boneless legs and left them in the refrigerator to improve. Note: If you make this dish with skin-on chicken breasts, which would be an elegant option, shorten the initial browning time by three or four minutes.As dinner time approached, I halved the white and palest green parts of a medium-large leek lengthwise (don’t worry too much about the size; there’ll be plenty no matter what) and rinsed under running water, checking for soil. After patting it dry, I cut it crosswise into 2-inch (5-cm) lengths, then lengthwise into thin strips. You can also cut it across into eighth-inch (3 or 4-mm) semicircles if you find that easier. After removing the tougher stems from a small fennel bulb (a medium-sized one would work in this dish too), I halved it lengthwise, removed the core and sliced it into strips an eighth of an inch wide or a little wider.I set a skillet over medium heat; when it was moderately hot, I added a little butter. As it melted and foamed, I patted the two chicken legs dry, seasoned them with pepper (they were already salted) and laid them into the skillet (opened flat, not rolled: this enables all the skin to brown nicely). To make sure the skin was in contact with the hot pan and hot butter, I pressed the chicken down with a spatula. Actually, I used my fingers, but some people are squeamish about raw poultry and splattering fat. After 10 minutes of cooking – unattended apart from checking that the fire wasn’t too hot, which it was – I removed the crisp-skinned but not yet fully cooked legs to a plate (skin side up, so it wouldn’t get soggy), added the leeks and fennel, with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and sautéed for a minute or so, until the vegetables had begun to soften. Then, I added half a cup (120 ml) of chicken stock, brought it to the boil, lowered the heat to medium-low and returned the chicken to the pan, nestling the pieces in the vegetable mixture and ensuring that the skin was not submerged. This simmered for another 10 minutes or until the chicken was tender, as verified by poking it with a thin skewer (a cake-tester in this case), which entered with minimal resistance.I moved the chicken to a warm plate, added 1/3 cup (80 ml) of heavy cream to the pan with the leek mixture, and simmered until a smooth, lightly viscous sauce formed, just a minute or so. I considered adding a teaspoonful of lemon juice, but it was not needed; use your own judgment on this. After checking for seasoning, I spooned half of the creamed leeks-fennel onto each of our (warmed) plates and set a piece of chicken on top, drizzling with some of the creamy sauce.

There surely are flaws in that hypothesis, but consider ratatouille and kindred dishes: It’s as though the cook has walked through the garden blindfolded and filled a basket with every summery thing that came to hand.At the moment, our New York City farmers’ markets present a different picture: roots, tubers and sturdy greens dominate, and many will continue to improve in flavor for another couple of months. There’s nothing stark about the winter market, even if the colors are muted.Jackie and I didn’t go to the market last weekend, because we’re running down the fridge before a trip, but the November produce we had in the house was muted in color too, and in putting together a recent chicken dinner I reached for a leek, pearly white tinged with pale green, and a small bulb of fennel of similar hue. Beyond their matchy-matchy colors, leeks and fennel share a gentle sweetness that brings their entirely distinctive flavors together.They also pair well with chicken: they support without dominating. Leeks in particular seem to have an affinity with either white or dark meat, and fennel brings in its own herbal aroma. And that’s what we had for dinner: Chicken legs with creamed leeks and fennel.The day before, I’d cut the breasts and legs from a good chicken – and boned the legs, too (using the bones, carcass and trimmings to make stock, and freezing the now-boneless breasts for another time). An hour before I planned to cook, I salted the boneless legs and left them in the refrigerator to improve. Note: If you make this dish with skin-on chicken breasts, which would be an elegant option, shorten the initial browning time by three or four minutes.As dinner time approached, I halved the white and palest green parts of a medium-large leek lengthwise (don’t worry too much about the size; there’ll be plenty no matter what) and rinsed under running water, checking for soil. After patting it dry, I cut it crosswise into 2-inch (5-cm) lengths, then lengthwise into thin strips. You can also cut it across into eighth-inch (3 or 4-mm) semicircles if you find that easier. After removing the tougher stems from a small fennel bulb (a medium-sized one would work in this dish too), I halved it lengthwise, removed the core and sliced it into strips an eighth of an inch wide or a little wider.I set a skillet over medium heat; when it was moderately hot, I added a little butter. As it melted and foamed, I patted the two chicken legs dry, seasoned them with pepper (they were already salted) and laid them into the skillet (opened flat, not rolled: this enables all the skin to brown nicely). To make sure the skin was in contact with the hot pan and hot butter, I pressed the chicken down with a spatula. Actually, I used my fingers, but some people are squeamish about raw poultry and splattering fat. After 10 minutes of cooking – unattended apart from checking that the fire wasn’t too hot, which it was – I removed the crisp-skinned but not yet fully cooked legs to a plate (skin side up, so it wouldn’t get soggy), added the leeks and fennel, with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and sautéed for a minute or so, until the vegetables had begun to soften. Then, I added half a cup (120 ml) of chicken stock, brought it to the boil, lowered the heat to medium-low and returned the chicken to the pan, nestling the pieces in the vegetable mixture and ensuring that the skin was not submerged. This simmered for another 10 minutes or until the chicken was tender, as verified by poking it with a thin skewer (a cake-tester in this case), which entered with minimal resistance.I moved the chicken to a warm plate, added 1/3 cup (80 ml) of heavy cream to the pan with the leek mixture, and simmered until a smooth, lightly viscous sauce formed, just a minute or so. I considered adding a teaspoonful of lemon juice, but it was not needed; use your own judgment on this. After checking for seasoning, I spooned half of the creamed leeks-fennel onto each of our (warmed) plates and set a piece of chicken on top, drizzling with some of the creamy sauce. If it hadn’t been winter, I’d have had a bunch of tarragon in the house, and I’d have added some to the sauce at the last minute; I could have done this with parsley, but the sauce was delicious (very) as it was. Between the fat and juices in the pan, the stock and the chicken itself, there is a lot of poultry flavor here, yet the leeks and fennel have their say too. I’d serve this with rice. In fact, I did."

We can’t just assume that every man has done something awful or that every man is guilty; due process is important and has to take place,” the “Tribes of Palos Verdes” actress said. As more and more women and men come forward with stories of sexual harassment and assault, the actress said she’s “excited” to see what might change. “Things have to come out in the open in order to be dealt with, and this is definitely one of those times,” Garner said. “There are a lot of really smart people asking tough questions, and I feel excited to see what the outcome will be.” Garner’s estranged husband, Ben Affleck, was called out last month for groping “One Tree Hill” actress Hilarie Burton on “Total Request Live” in 2003. He later apologized in a tweet.Affleck came under fire again last week when he appeared to make a joke about sexual harassment during a press tour stop for “Justice League.” The actor addressed his misfire during an interview on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” “It was a serious question and I kind of felt uncomfortable, and didn’t know what to say and laughed awkwardly. It’s a tricky thing to try to handle,” Affleck said.“I think the most important thing to do is to support the voices coming forward, believe them, and create a business where more women are empowered and in place so less of this happens,” the actor said. “And so that there is a way of reporting this stuff so that people can feel safe doing it.” "
21,IMPACT,'These Storms Are Just Crazy': Craft Beer Brewers Feel Effects Of Climate Change,"Aleszu Bajak, On assignment for HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/craft-beer-trump-climate_us_5a1419ace4b0c335e9973a91,"In the face of Trump's inaction, dozens sign Brewery Climate Declaration.",2017-11-21,"A woman jumps over a puddle after a heavy rain in Davis Square in Somerville, MA, in September",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a142480150000e627859326.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hurricane Irene’s march through Vermont’s Mad River Valley in 2011 tore down bridges and turned roads to rubble in towns like Waterbury. The storm littered businesses and city offices with debris and sewage, and damaged close to 100 homes.One of its victims was The Alchemist brewpub, which owners John and Jen Kimmich had built from the ground-up into a darling of the craft beer scene, known throughout New England for Heady Topper, its standout India pale ale.When the waters receded, very little in the brewpub was salvageable. The Kimmichs had actually been working on a plan B: building a production facility – with a strong structure – on higher ground. That opened days after Irene. Still, the storm was demoralizing. They were inches away from throwing in the towel.“We had a decision to make ― either make an insurance claim and sell our business, or double down, focus on growth and rehire everyone,” says Jen Kimmich. She and her husband opted for the latter, rebuilding on higher ground with a stronger structure.In the face of a changing climate, craft breweries such as The Alchemist are feeling the impacts. More than 5,000 craft breweries now operate across the U.S., and many were built in affordable but precarious locations, like floodplains or forests, making them especially vulnerable to extreme weather events like Hurricane Irene and shifting climate patterns that threaten their business.Breweries rely on raw ingredients such as hops, water and grain, and supplies can be choked off by drought, storms or pests. These problems will only become more intense with climate change, scientists say.Climate swings have already resulted in U.S. hop shortages that had brewers sourcing from as far away as Argentina. To survive the next climate-driven hop squeeze, Kimmich has a plan. “The best way we can mitigate that risk is to pre-pay for hops,” she says. “That puts us first in line in case there’s another shortage.”The Alchemist isn’t alone in pre-paying for hops. Most craft breweries purchase hop contracts ― several years in advance, in some cases. However, if hop shortages become more frequent, which scientists have predicted will happen in some regions due to climate change, there may not even be a line for buyers to wait in. Nature has a habit of throwing a wrench into things.Aeronaut Brewing Co. in Somerville, Massachusetts, experienced that firsthand this year, when hops the operators expected from western Massachusetts were delayed, then canceled. “Unfortunately, due to the late-season warm weather this year, the crop was not ready until way later than expected,” says Ben Holmes, co-owner of Aeronaut. “Finally, when [they] were about to harvest, they were hit by a bad blight, which knocked out the entire crop.”Aside from shocks to his hops supply, Holmes has had to contend with rising utility bills imposed by the city to address its aging sewer and storm drainage systems, which officials say are ill equipped to handle major storms and rising seas.“As Somerville tries to cope with climate change, we are facing bigger and bigger challenges with flooding, mitigation of which is requiring major infrastructure investments which are incidentally being tacked onto our water bill proportional to use,” Holmes says.Since his brewery uses a lot of water ― not just for beer, but also for cleaning tanks, hoses and kegs ― Aeronaut ends up paying a lot toward Somerville’s cost of preparing for climate change. In fact, craft breweries across the nation are investing in wastewater treatment and solar power generation to offset rising utility bills.New Belgium Brewing Co.’s solar panels, for instance, generate almost 5 percent of the power for its packaging facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. Louisiana’s Abita Brewing Co., meanwhile, has installed an anaerobic digester to convert waste into biogas that’s recycled back into the brewery.But Steve Frazier, head brewer at The Brewer’s Art in Baltimore, Maryland, says it’s not always easy for small craft breweries to enact resiliency measures like hop contracts or infrastructure buildouts because the return on investment isn’t as obvious. What’s more, he says, “smaller outfits can’t usually budget for big efficiency projects when they are just fighting to stay relevant, or trying to meet production demands.”Aside from hops, Frazier also worries about the effects climate change will have on beer’s other main ingredients: barley and water. While the amount of water used to make beer varies, it is estimated to take roughly 20 gallons of water to make a pint of beer. Many large craft breweries ― like New Belgium, Sierra Nevada and Stone ― have opened production facilities on the East Coast, in large part to lower distribution costs, but also, Frazier believes, to soften the blow of continued water scarcity in the West.“I don’t think any of the West Coast breweries that have recently opened East Coast facilities would come right out and say it, but I bet it will get really expensive to brew beer out West in the next 20 years if water gets any more scarce,” Frazier says.While not a direct solution, dozens of craft brewers have signed the Brewery Climate Declaration, which calls attention to the effects of climate change on the industry and outlines actions breweries are already taking. That includes Michigan’s Brewery Vivant sourcing 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources and California’s North Coast Brewing Co. diverting more than 90 percent of its brewery waste from the landfill.“We hope that by signing onto pacts such as this one, and doing everything we can to keep this topic visible, we can make it clear that businesses must give a damn about climate change,” says Holmes of Aeronaut Brewing.Kimmich agrees. “On the heels of our president pulling out of Paris, we want to show that if the government won’t move in the face of climate change, business leaders will,” she says. “The writing’s on the wall. The science tells us that climate change is real and it’s just speeding up. These storms are just crazy. I’m sure there’s more to come.”Aleszu Bajak is a science journalist who teaches at Northeastern University.

Al Franken (D-Minn.), despite allegations of “stupid and foolish” sexual harassment.The staffers ― who Minnesota’s Star Tribune newspaper describes as 36 production assistants, writers, producers and original cast members, including Jane Curtin ― express support for the former “SNL” writer and performer in a statement released by NBC News on Tuesday. The network wouldn’t provide the names of signers to HuffPost.Their statement follows allegations that Franken forced himself upon journalist Leeann Tweeden in 2006, and inappropriately grabbed a woman named Lindsay Menz while posing for photos in 2010. “What Al did was stupid and foolish, and we think it was appropriate for him to apologize to Ms. Tweeden, and to the public,” the statement reads.“In our experience, we know Al as a devoted and dedicated family man, a wonderful comedic performer, and an honorable public servant. That is why we are moved to quickly and directly affirm that after years of working with him, we would like to acknowledge that not one of us ever experienced any inappropriate behavior; and mention our sincere appreciation that he treated each of us with the utmost respect and regard.“We send our support and gratitude to Al and his family this Thanksgiving and holiday season,” the statement concludes.Franken has said that he does not remember taking the photo with Menz, but felt “badly” that she felt disrespected. He has apologized to Tweeden, though he said he didn’t remember events happening the way she does.The “SNL” support for Franken doesn’t mean jokes about him are off the table. Over the weekend, SNL’s “Weekend Update” skewered Franken over the allegations brought by Tweeden, which include a photo showing him reaching for her breasts as she sleeps.“Now I know this photo looks bad,” “Weekend Update” co-host Colin Jost said, showing the photo. “But remember, it also is bad.”It’s “pretty hard to be like, ‘Oh, c’mon he didn’t know any better, he was only 55,’” Jost added."

The Wall Street Journal, which broke the news Sunday, said the bid was the first for the company to be publicly reported.Contreras-Sweet, founder and former executive chairwoman of ProAmerica Bank, wrote a letter to TWC’s board on Nov. 8 expressing a desire to acquire the studio’s assets and to transform the organization into one led by women.“I will be Chairwoman of a majority-female board of directors,” Contreras-Sweet wrote in the document, obtained by Deadline. “Women will be significant investors in the new Company and control its voting stock.”Contreras-Sweet also outlined her plan to retain “most if not all” current employees and vowed to set up a litigation fund and mediation process for the victims of alleged sexual harassment by TWC’s disgraced co-founder Harvey Weinstein. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct since October. “As a long-time business leader and advocate for gender and racial equality, I have been profoundly affected by the recent revelations surrounding this Company’s leadership,” Contreras-Sweet said in the letter.“I have assembled a first-class team of financial partners, advisors and consultants to put together a proposal to acquire the [company’s] assets,” she continued. “We believe [this] will present a path forward that is in the best interests of all of the company’s stakeholders.”Contreras-Sweet has “four bona fide backers … ready to pony up $275 million in funds” for the acquisition, according to Deadline. She also has the support of Gloria Allred, the attorney who is representing several of Weinstein’s alleged victims.“I have had discussions with Maria. In my opinion, she is the right person with her background to lead this company, and she would be a very important asset to the new Weinstein Company,” Allred told CNNMoney. “I would like to see her and her team acquire the company, and I think that is the only way that TWC can be saved.”Deadline reported that though there are rumors of other potential bidders, including Lions Gate Entertainment, A&E Networks and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, “it will be a daunting task to best the amount and terms offered by Contreras-Sweet.”Private equity firm Colony Capital previously entered negotiations to acquire TWC, according to The New York Times, but the two sides failed to reach an agreement."

As The Washington Post reported Monday, eight women have accused Rose of making unwanted sexual advances, including groping them and making lewd phone calls, from the late 1990s to 2011. Some of the women accusing Rose of the behavior worked for Rose on his interview show, which aired on PBS and Bloomberg. (Bloomberg TV has suspended distribution of the program.) Other accusers aspired to work for Rose.CBS previously announced it was suspending Rose as the network “look[ed] into the matter.” Rose has co-hosted the CBS morning talk show since 2012. Rose is also a longtime contributor to “60 Minutes,” CBS’s popular news magazine program.Later Tuesday, CBS Evening News reported that three women who work at the network came forward after The Washington Post report to say Rose harassed them as well.Another woman came forward Wednesday with allegations against Rose. Sarah Gordon, who worked as an intern on Rose’s show in 2002, told NBC News the anchor forced her to watch a sexually explicit scene from the film “Secretary” and asked her if the scene made her feel aroused. The talk show host issued a statement Monday in response to the allegations, apologizing for some of his actions while claiming not all of the accusations in the Washington Post story are “accurate.” “It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed,” Rose wrote. “I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.”Rose’s former “This Morning” co-hosts addressed the allegations during Tuesday’s broadcast.“These allegations are extremely disturbing and we take them very seriously,” Norah O’Donnell said. “This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and more generally the safety of women.”This story has been updated with more information on the allegations and the responses to them, more allegations, and PBS’s decision."

Located on a grassy hill, the white building with black shutters is surrounded by silence and crowned by rustling trees.Inside the main house, which was built in 1938, employees and volunteers work to protect one of the most essential tenets of American freedom: the First Amendment. The land beneath their feet was once owned by Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, who inherited the estate from his father in 1756. As a paragon of free speech as well as a slave owner, Jefferson embodies many of the inconsistencies that have historically plagued the free speech movement since its emergence.The First Amendment governs the right to express an opinion or idea without fear of government retaliation or censorship. “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;” it reads, “or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”However, despite the universal ideals espoused in its terminology, when the amendment was ratified, the full protection of its constitutional rights was extended primarily to a select pocket of the population: white, propertied men. The lingering effects of this foundational inequality persist. As a result, the present-day job of protecting free speech can get ugly. Clay Hansen is executive director of the Thomas Jefferson Center (TJC) and, as such, a professional advocate for free speech and expression. Hansen, a man of imposing stature and rosy complexion, speaks in a measured tone that’s at once authoritative and congenial. On the day we spoke at his place of work, pro athletes around the country were exercising their First Amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem. They were following the example set by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who in 2016 began protesting racial injustice in America by taking a knee during the national anthem. Many mainstream media outlets, politicians and celebrities have valorized Kaepernick’s protests and his invocation of the First Amendment. At the TJC, however, Hansen is tasked with defending both the Kaepernicks of the country and far less palatable practitioners of free speech. “This job is not one you go home and brag about at Thanksgiving dinner,” he explained. “I don’t get to go home and regale my family with stories of defending the Westboro Baptist Church. It’s Nazis and funeral protesters, and it’s tough.”Hansen fights for such individuals’ inalienable right to speak freely because, in his mind, “If we don’t defend these people now, it could be you next.”Since it was inaugurated in 1991, the nonpartisan, nonprofit TJC has fought to protect the right to free expression, no matter how offensive and abhorrent that expression might seem. “The First Amendment applies to everyone,” Hansen said. “It applies to the ignorant and the hateful and everybody else, regardless of how much you disagree with them personally.”Hansen has worked at the center for six years now. Interested in theater and visual art early in his career, he initially tried his luck in New York City’s publishing industry. Eventually he went to law school, had kids and began working as a free speech defender, thinking if he wasn’t making art professionally himself, at least he could champion the rights of those who did.As an institution, the TJC provides legal advocacy in First Amendment court cases. In 2015, Hansen worked on the Supreme Court case Elonis v. United States, in which he argued that “criminal convictions for threatening another person online should require a subjective intent to threaten the recipient of the message, rather than merely showing that a reasonable person would find the message threatening.” Earlier this year, he also represented an Asian-American rock band, The Slants, that was denied federal trademark registration because of the racial slur in the group’s name.The TJC also engages in public outreach and education, and attempts to spread awareness of First Amendment principles nationwide. Other U.S. organizations with similar missions include the James Madison Center for Free Speech in Indiana and The Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University. In particular, the TJC focuses its attention on high school and college campuses, where freedom of expression is regarded with ever-increasing skepticism in 2017.According to a recent survey conducted by The Cato Institute (in collaboration with YouGov), Americans hold varied and contradictory beliefs regarding the First Amendment. However, the results of the institute’s 2,300-person survey showed that, across political and racial divides, a significant portion of respondents agreed that “a big problem this country has is being politically correct,” pointing to college campuses as the issue’s focal point. Campuses have a long history of playing focal point to freedom of expression debates of all kinds. In December 1964, students at the University of California, Berkeley, began protesting political speech restrictions on campus. The demonstrations continued for months, solidifying UC Berkeley’s symbolic status as the nucleus of the free speech movement. In the years since, the campus’s Sproul Plaza and Mario Savio Steps have been marched on, sat upon and otherwise occupied by an assortment of protests.This past year, though, the famously liberal-leaning university was criticized for censoring conservative voices after canceling speaking engagements by people including Ann Coulter, Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos. Right-wingers have adopted the fight for free speech as their own, often battling a campus community with an intolerance for intolerance. In September 2017, Yiannopoulos announced his own “Free Speech Week” at Berkeley. Though it was eventually canceled due to safety concerns, the rally was meant as a platform for the “alt-right” media personality, known for, among other things, calling Black Lives Matter a “terrorist organization” and likening feminism to a “cancer.” Hordes of students and Berkeley citizens protested Yiannopoulos’s presence on campus, chanting, “Nazi scum off our streets!” and “Right-wing fascists go away!” Berkeley’s faculty called for a complete boycott of classes and campus activities, arguing that personalities like Yiannopoulos disfigure the idea of “free speech” to shame and threaten marginalized members of the campus and community. “There are forms of speech that are not protected under the First Amendment,” members of Berkeley’s faculty wrote in an open letter. “These include speech that presents imminent physical danger and speech that disrupts the university’s mission to educate. ... As faculty, we reject both the administration’s rhetoric of false equivalency that all speech ― including ‘hate speech’ ― merits value and respect.”Hansen stands on the opposite side of this debate. He believes firmly that, no matter how contemptible an idea may be, Americans have the constitutional right to express it. “It’s a difficult time right now to convince people that free speech isn’t only a good idea but one worth fighting for,” Hansen said. “Especially when you’re defending people when you hate what they are saying.”According to Hansen, one of the most common misconceptions when it comes to free speech is that hate speech is excluded from the First Amendment. The Cato Institute found a quarter of Americans erroneously believe it’s against the law to make a racist statement in public. There are certain speech acts that are not permitted by the law ― libel, defamation, true threats and incitement, to name a few ― but hate speech is not among them. That is why earlier this summer, when white nationalist organizer Jason Kessler began securing permits for a “Unite the Right” rally, there wasn’t much that someone like Hansen could legally do to prevent it.“Was the ‘Unite the Right’ rally hate speech as most people would define it? Yes, but that didn’t get us anywhere when it came to the question of whether the city could prevent it preemptively,” Hansen explained. “That’s the most difficult thing for a government to do. There are plenty of things you can do after the fact if a speaker crosses the line. But to silence a speaker before anything comes out of his or her mouth [...] you have to meet an extraordinarily high burden and it’s almost never admissible.”Hansen said that he met with Charlottesville city officials a week before the “Unite the Right” rally took place on Aug. 11 and 12. City attorney Craig Brown confirmed that he reached out to the TJC for counsel after Kessler filed a lawsuit to move the rally from Emancipation Park to the larger McIntire Park. Brown said it’s not unusual for the city to use the TJC as a “sounding board” for First Amendment issues, as “they are experts in the field.”“First Amendment case law favors reactive, rather than proactive, remedies to offensive or even potentially dangerous expression,” Hansen clarified. “The exception to this general rule, of course, is that the government is allowed to place reasonable restrictions on the time, place and manner in which such speech may occur.”You can’t stop a person from speaking, Hansen said, but you can try to shape when, where and how loud they do it. It’s illegal, for example, to shout your opinion using a megaphone in a private neighborhood at night. So while Hansen didn’t expect the city would be able to prevent the rally completely, he hoped to work with officials in order to make the event as safe, contained and manageable as possible. The “Unite the Right” rally ended up bleeding beyond its zoned location into multiple parks and private properties, with white supremacists passing by a synagogue and a funeral home. Tensions between neo-Nazis and the groups of counterprotesters eventually escalated, resulting in the death of 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. “The next time this comes up we can’t have the same outcome,” Hansen said. “I think our biggest task right now is providing some kind of reasoned guidance to both cities and courts going forward. We need to figure out a better way of articulating the standards for these things.”The TJC is serious about regulating the ways that rallies like “Unite the Right” take shape moving forward, but Hansen’s organization will continue to protect their right to existence otherwise. His reasoning is practical. “If you keep these people in the dark, you lose track of them, you allow them to fester in the shadows. It’s better to keep a spotlight on them.”Hate speech out in the open, Hansen asserts, is more difficult for people to repudiate or sweep under a rug. “You start denying these people the right to speak publicly and you’re just providing evidence that things like racism and anti-Semitism aren’t problems. You let these guys come out and speak, and all of a sudden you can’t deny it. All these guys marching down the lawn chanting ‘Jews will not replace us,’ and, well, your uncle can’t claim that anti-Semitism is fake news anymore.”Prominent displays of hate speech, however, are not without their inherent dangers. The line between language that is intolerant and language that is threatening or inciting violence can be blurry. And even speech acts unaccompanied by physical violence can trigger, intimidate and terrorize certain individuals.In an opinion article for the Los Angeles Times, Northwestern University sociology professor Laura Beth Nielsen described some of hate speech’s negative consequences: “Racist hate speech has been linked to cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and requires complex coping strategies. Exposure to racial slurs also diminishes academic performance.”Even without violence, hate has its physical repercussions. But as David Straughn, a Black Lives Matter activist in Charlottesville, explained, the “Unite the Right” rally hardly qualified as nonviolent.“White people always talk about free speech and how they have a right to be heard,” Straughn said. “But during the weekend of Aug. 12, I did not see one microphone, one public amplification system or one generator. They weren’t coming for free speech. They were coming to intimidate and harm and beat and and murder Charlottesville civilians and community members, predominantly people of color. They were coming to hurt people.”Straughn is skeptical of the idea that free expression is, in reality, a right afforded to all Americans. “I think that if 1,000 members of Black Lives Matter put together a rally, the police would have been much more present. There would have been more of a pushback from elected officials. They wouldn’t have told people, like they told us [about the ‘Unite the Right’ rally], to ‘just ignore it.’”In Straughn’s view, free speech privileges whiteness. “White men were the first people to speak for this country and the last people to speak for this country. White supremacists have been protected for hundreds of years. We’re just trying to catch up. The truth of the matter is, they will always be protected.”Nielsen makes a similar argument in her piece, highlighting instances when freedom of speech has been waived to protect the powerful. It is illegal, for example, to panhandle, the logic being that asking for money is a distraction to the commuters, business owners, workers and shoppers navigating public city space. Yet catcalling or hurling a racial slur at a woman or person of color is entirely legal. Hansen believes in the First Amendment’s ability ― and, more so, responsibility ― to protect all Americans. Yet in practice, online and off, the universal mandate can fail to sufficiently challenge the racism, sexism and classism embedded in everyday life. Has free speech truly transcended its original scope of protecting, first and foremost, white men? Perhaps not. According to critics like Neilsen, at least, insisting upon First Amendment absolutism runs the risk of further entrenching those inequities.The shadow of the “Unite the Right” rally still looms large in Charlottesville. Signs reading “Heather,” “Unite C’ville” and “If equality and diversity aren’t for you then neither are we” can be seen in storefronts across the downtown mall area. The horrific events in August left a dark imprint on the city’s morale, as well the city’s perception of free speech. One of the ways Hansen is working to rehabilitate Charlottesville’s faith in free speech is through a public art project called the Free Speech Wall. Architects Peter O’Shea and Robert Winstead worked to mount a two-sided wall made of Buckingham slate outside of Charlottesville’s City Hall that measures about 54 feet long and 7.5 feet high. The wall operates as a massive chalkboard, which passersby are permitted to adorn with any words or images they wish. The wall is meant to serve as a physical manifestation of the First Amendment, a demonstration of free speech in action. “Our policy has always been that we don’t censor anything that’s up there,” Hansen said. It is habitually wiped clean every few days by TJC employees and volunteers to make room for more messages. But aside from that, representatives do not remove any expressions that might be deemed “offensive” to some. Fellow Charlottesville residents, however, can erase, and even adapt, any inappropriate or derogatory remarks they find. “As private citizens, you are free to write whatever you want,” Hansen explained. “To us, the project isn’t only about what’s written on the wall but what’s erased from the wall. Things are often changed and co-opted by others to make it their own. It’s a real, living process.”This idea ― that the project’s power resides not only in what is visible, but also in what is erased ― extends, in Hansen’s mind, to another prevalent discussion concerning free expression today: what to do with Confederate monuments, the question that spurred the “Unite the Right” rally in the first place.The answer, Hansen explained, is complicated. First of all, many monuments are protected by local laws that prevent their removal outright. But legal regulations aside, Hansen believes that neither keeping nor removing Confederate monuments is a sufficient response. “We see this idea of memorializing things as an evolving process. It’s not about the monument itself, but rather what message is conveyed, and how that changes over time.”When discussing the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that incited so much controversy, Hansen claimed the removal of any statue “is equally important as a speech act as erecting it in the first place.” Instead of removing the Lee monument and leaving no trace, though, Hansen suggested that the city replace the statue with some kind of memorialization ― a rundown of the statue’s entire history, outlining why it was erected and why citizens decided it no longer represented their community.“I think that’s a better outcome than just making it disappear overnight and certainly better than it being left to the people to drag it down with ropes,” he added.Today, free expression can be a target for both progressive activists and conservative traditionalists. Some on the left see the amendment as enabling hate and bigotry, threatening those who are already marginalized and persecuted. Some on the right perceive acts of protest like kneeling during the national anthem as anti-patriotic. And perhaps most hazardous is a president who has, as Hansen put it, demonstrated “a tenuous grasp on constitutional principles, particularly when it comes to the First Amendment.”Between attacking the press and condemning protesters, President Donald Trump has exhibited, in Hansen’s words, a “very unfriendly view toward the principles of free speech and expression we are trying to uphold.”Since Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, the number of hate groups in the United States has increased, from 892 in 2015 to 917 in 2016. Mark Potok, senior fellow of the Southern Poverty Law Center and editor of its Intelligence Report, called 2016 “an unprecedented year for hate.” “These extremists think they finally have an ally who has the president’s ear,” he reported, referring to Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist.This swell corresponds with a surge of hate crimes and speech acts. Just last month a video surfaced ― and quickly went viral ― showing a white man on a subway drunkenly screaming obscenities at black passengers. In between racial slurs, the man chanted, “First Amendment! First Amendment!”Hansen is often tasked with protecting these kinds of First Amendment advocates ― from people who use speech to intimidate and menace people of a different ethnicity to those who express sexual, disparaging and humiliating opinions about female co-workers. And in 2017, with hate groups emerging and growing fortified by the current administration, the First Amendment is on the receiving end of some seriously bad PR. However, the more the American public grows dubious of the First Amendment’s exigency, the more urgent Hansen considers his line of work. “There are real, practical reasons to defend ugly speech. It’s not easy, though, and I admire people who do it way more publicly and directly than we are able to. It takes a lot of guts and internal resolve to commit to the positive outcomes you know will emerge from this.”"

Though it was eventually canceled due to safety concerns, the rally was meant as a platform for the “alt-right” media personality, known for, among other things, calling Black Lives Matter a “terrorist organization” and likening feminism to a “cancer.” Hordes of students and Berkeley citizens protested Yiannopoulos’s presence on campus, chanting, “Nazi scum off our streets!” and “Right-wing fascists go away!” Berkeley’s faculty called for a complete boycott of classes and campus activities, arguing that personalities like Yiannopoulos disfigure the idea of “free speech” to shame and threaten marginalized members of the campus and community. “There are forms of speech that are not protected under the First Amendment,” members of Berkeley’s faculty wrote in an open letter. “These include speech that presents imminent physical danger and speech that disrupts the university’s mission to educate. ... As faculty, we reject both the administration’s rhetoric of false equivalency that all speech ― including ‘hate speech’ ― merits value and respect.”Hansen stands on the opposite side of this debate. He believes firmly that, no matter how contemptible an idea may be, Americans have the constitutional right to express it. “It’s a difficult time right now to convince people that free speech isn’t only a good idea but one worth fighting for,” Hansen said. “Especially when you’re defending people when you hate what they are saying.”According to Hansen, one of the most common misconceptions when it comes to free speech is that hate speech is excluded from the First Amendment. The Cato Institute found a quarter of Americans erroneously believe it’s against the law to make a racist statement in public. There are certain speech acts that are not permitted by the law ― libel, defamation, true threats and incitement, to name a few ― but hate speech is not among them. That is why earlier this summer, when white nationalist organizer Jason Kessler began securing permits for a “Unite the Right” rally, there wasn’t much that someone like Hansen could legally do to prevent it.“Was the ‘Unite the Right’ rally hate speech as most people would define it? Yes, but that didn’t get us anywhere when it came to the question of whether the city could prevent it preemptively,” Hansen explained. “That’s the most difficult thing for a government to do. There are plenty of things you can do after the fact if a speaker crosses the line. But to silence a speaker before anything comes out of his or her mouth [...] you have to meet an extraordinarily high burden and it’s almost never admissible.”Hansen said that he met with Charlottesville city officials a week before the “Unite the Right” rally took place on Aug. 11 and 12. City attorney Craig Brown confirmed that he reached out to the TJC for counsel after Kessler filed a lawsuit to move the rally from Emancipation Park to the larger McIntire Park. Brown said it’s not unusual for the city to use the TJC as a “sounding board” for First Amendment issues, as “they are experts in the field.”“First Amendment case law favors reactive, rather than proactive, remedies to offensive or even potentially dangerous expression,” Hansen clarified. “The exception to this general rule, of course, is that the government is allowed to place reasonable restrictions on the time, place and manner in which such speech may occur.”You can’t stop a person from speaking, Hansen said, but you can try to shape when, where and how loud they do it. It’s illegal, for example, to shout your opinion using a megaphone in a private neighborhood at night. So while Hansen didn’t expect the city would be able to prevent the rally completely, he hoped to work with officials in order to make the event as safe, contained and manageable as possible. The “Unite the Right” rally ended up bleeding beyond its zoned location into multiple parks and private properties, with white supremacists passing by a synagogue and a funeral home. Tensions between neo-Nazis and the groups of counterprotesters eventually escalated, resulting in the death of 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. “The next time this comes up we can’t have the same outcome,” Hansen said. “I think our biggest task right now is providing some kind of reasoned guidance to both cities and courts going forward. We need to figure out a better way of articulating the standards for these things.”The TJC is serious about regulating the ways that rallies like “Unite the Right” take shape moving forward, but Hansen’s organization will continue to protect their right to existence otherwise. His reasoning is practical. “If you keep these people in the dark, you lose track of them, you allow them to fester in the shadows. It’s better to keep a spotlight on them.”Hate speech out in the open, Hansen asserts, is more difficult for people to repudiate or sweep under a rug. “You start denying these people the right to speak publicly and you’re just providing evidence that things like racism and anti-Semitism aren’t problems. You let these guys come out and speak, and all of a sudden you can’t deny it. All these guys marching down the lawn chanting ‘Jews will not replace us,’ and, well, your uncle can’t claim that anti-Semitism is fake news anymore.”Prominent displays of hate speech, however, are not without their inherent dangers. The line between language that is intolerant and language that is threatening or inciting violence can be blurry. And even speech acts unaccompanied by physical violence can trigger, intimidate and terrorize certain individuals.In an opinion article for the Los Angeles Times, Northwestern University sociology professor Laura Beth Nielsen described some of hate speech’s negative consequences: “Racist hate speech has been linked to cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and requires complex coping strategies. Exposure to racial slurs also diminishes academic performance.”Even without violence, hate has its physical repercussions. But as David Straughn, a Black Lives Matter activist in Charlottesville, explained, the “Unite the Right” rally hardly qualified as nonviolent.“White people always talk about free speech and how they have a right to be heard,” Straughn said. “But during the weekend of Aug. 12, I did not see one microphone, one public amplification system or one generator. They weren’t coming for free speech. They were coming to intimidate and harm and beat and and murder Charlottesville civilians and community members, predominantly people of color. They were coming to hurt people.”Straughn is skeptical of the idea that free expression is, in reality, a right afforded to all Americans. “I think that if 1,000 members of Black Lives Matter put together a rally, the police would have been much more present. There would have been more of a pushback from elected officials. They wouldn’t have told people, like they told us [about the ‘Unite the Right’ rally], to ‘just ignore it.’”In Straughn’s view, free speech privileges whiteness. “White men were the first people to speak for this country and the last people to speak for this country. White supremacists have been protected for hundreds of years. We’re just trying to catch up. The truth of the matter is, they will always be protected.”Nielsen makes a similar argument in her piece, highlighting instances when freedom of speech has been waived to protect the powerful. It is illegal, for example, to panhandle, the logic being that asking for money is a distraction to the commuters, business owners, workers and shoppers navigating public city space. Yet catcalling or hurling a racial slur at a woman or person of color is entirely legal. Hansen believes in the First Amendment’s ability ― and, more so, responsibility ― to protect all Americans. Yet in practice, online and off, the universal mandate can fail to sufficiently challenge the racism, sexism and classism embedded in everyday life. Has free speech truly transcended its original scope of protecting, first and foremost, white men? Perhaps not. According to critics like Neilsen, at least, insisting upon First Amendment absolutism runs the risk of further entrenching those inequities.The shadow of the “Unite the Right” rally still looms large in Charlottesville. Signs reading “Heather,” “Unite C’ville” and “If equality and diversity aren’t for you then neither are we” can be seen in storefronts across the downtown mall area. The horrific events in August left a dark imprint on the city’s morale, as well the city’s perception of free speech. One of the ways Hansen is working to rehabilitate Charlottesville’s faith in free speech is through a public art project called the Free Speech Wall. Architects Peter O’Shea and Robert Winstead worked to mount a two-sided wall made of Buckingham slate outside of Charlottesville’s City Hall that measures about 54 feet long and 7.5 feet high. The wall operates as a massive chalkboard, which passersby are permitted to adorn with any words or images they wish. The wall is meant to serve as a physical manifestation of the First Amendment, a demonstration of free speech in action. “Our policy has always been that we don’t censor anything that’s up there,” Hansen said. It is habitually wiped clean every few days by TJC employees and volunteers to make room for more messages. But aside from that, representatives do not remove any expressions that might be deemed “offensive” to some. Fellow Charlottesville residents, however, can erase, and even adapt, any inappropriate or derogatory remarks they find. “As private citizens, you are free to write whatever you want,” Hansen explained. “To us, the project isn’t only about what’s written on the wall but what’s erased from the wall. Things are often changed and co-opted by others to make it their own. It’s a real, living process.”This idea ― that the project’s power resides not only in what is visible, but also in what is erased ― extends, in Hansen’s mind, to another prevalent discussion concerning free expression today: what to do with Confederate monuments, the question that spurred the “Unite the Right” rally in the first place.The answer, Hansen explained, is complicated. First of all, many monuments are protected by local laws that prevent their removal outright. But legal regulations aside, Hansen believes that neither keeping nor removing Confederate monuments is a sufficient response. “We see this idea of memorializing things as an evolving process. It’s not about the monument itself, but rather what message is conveyed, and how that changes over time.”When discussing the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that incited so much controversy, Hansen claimed the removal of any statue “is equally important as a speech act as erecting it in the first place.” Instead of removing the Lee monument and leaving no trace, though, Hansen suggested that the city replace the statue with some kind of memorialization ― a rundown of the statue’s entire history, outlining why it was erected and why citizens decided it no longer represented their community.“I think that’s a better outcome than just making it disappear overnight and certainly better than it being left to the people to drag it down with ropes,” he added.Today, free expression can be a target for both progressive activists and conservative traditionalists. Some on the left see the amendment as enabling hate and bigotry, threatening those who are already marginalized and persecuted. Some on the right perceive acts of protest like kneeling during the national anthem as anti-patriotic. And perhaps most hazardous is a president who has, as Hansen put it, demonstrated “a tenuous grasp on constitutional principles, particularly when it comes to the First Amendment.”Between attacking the press and condemning protesters, President Donald Trump has exhibited, in Hansen’s words, a “very unfriendly view toward the principles of free speech and expression we are trying to uphold.”Since Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, the number of hate groups in the United States has increased, from 892 in 2015 to 917 in 2016. Mark Potok, senior fellow of the Southern Poverty Law Center and editor of its Intelligence Report, called 2016 “an unprecedented year for hate.” “These extremists think they finally have an ally who has the president’s ear,” he reported, referring to Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist.This swell corresponds with a surge of hate crimes and speech acts. Just last month a video surfaced ― and quickly went viral ― showing a white man on a subway drunkenly screaming obscenities at black passengers. In between racial slurs, the man chanted, “First Amendment! First Amendment!”Hansen is often tasked with protecting these kinds of First Amendment advocates ― from people who use speech to intimidate and menace people of a different ethnicity to those who express sexual, disparaging and humiliating opinions about female co-workers. And in 2017, with hate groups emerging and growing fortified by the current administration, the First Amendment is on the receiving end of some seriously bad PR. However, the more the American public grows dubious of the First Amendment’s exigency, the more urgent Hansen considers his line of work. “There are real, practical reasons to defend ugly speech. It’s not easy, though, and I admire people who do it way more publicly and directly than we are able to. It takes a lot of guts and internal resolve to commit to the positive outcomes you know will emerge from this.”"
33,POLITICS,Gun Control Attitudes May Not Have Changed Much Despite Recent Mass Shootings,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-shootings-gun-control-attitudes_us_5a13511be4b0aa32975d3e72,America remains split on whether lawmakers should try to take action to reduce massacres.,2017-11-20,A makeshift memorial in Las Vegas a week after the Oct. 1 mass shooting that left 58 people dead.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a135167180000849ff6d2ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mass shootings in America rarely lead to political change, but they often do result in a brief spike in support for gun control. But as new polling suggests, with opinions on the topic starkly divided along political lines, it’s not clear whether two of the most recent high-profile shootings did anything to change people’s minds.In the past two months, HuffPost polled opinions on gun control three times: immediately after the Las Vegas shooting at the beginning of October; toward the end of the month, when it had largely faded from the news; and in early November, following the Texas church shooting.It’s possible that the nation is now sufficiently numbed that such tragedies are no longer sufficient to provide a jolt to public opinion; it’s also possible that the fallow time between high-profile shootings has been so brief that opinions never had time to go down from their heightened state. Either way, the consistency on many of the questions asked is notable.Support for making gun laws stricter hovered between 49 and 51 percent in all three surveys ― similar to the 48 percent it stood at both this June (in the wake of the congressional baseball shooting) and last June, in a survey taken just before the Orlando nightclub shooting. The attack in Orlando, Florida, as well as the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California, saw support tick up to 55 percent.The percentage of Americans who want members of Congress to take action to reduce mass shootings, rather than believing that mass shootings cannot be reduced through legislation, remained at 41 percent in all three surveys. The share who, regardless of their opinions on gun control, thought it would be politically possible for Congress to pass stricter gun laws, stayed at 37 percent.Other surveys have found higher overall backing for stricter gun control and, in some cases, a recent increase in support.Quinnipiac University polls taken after the Las Vegas and Texas shootings both put voters’ support for stricter gun laws at 60 percent, up from 54 percent in June. Gallup, which has tracked opinion on gun laws since the 1990s, found support for stricter guns laws edging up from 55 percent to 60 percent after the Las Vegas shooting.By contrast, CNN’s post-Las Vegas poll, taken in the time between the two shootings, found 52 percent of Americans in favor of strict gun controls laws, similar to the 55 percent who supported them the previous June.Regardless of Americans’ opinions on gun control in general, some specific restrictions have remained widely popular both in the wake of new tragedies and during the times when such incidents have faded from the news. Support for universal background checks has never dipped below 88 percent in Quinnipiac’s polling ― a nearly unheard-of level of unanimity ― and currently stands at 95 percent.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the most recent HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups: The three HuffPost/YouGov polls each consisted of 1,000 completed interviews.

34,POLITICS,Chuck Schumer Calls On New York’s Breakaway Democrats To Rejoin Mainstream Party Caucus,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senator-chuck-schumer-new-york-idc_us_5a1323b0e4b0c335e9966b2f,Activists had asked the U.S. Senate minority leader to speak up.,2017-11-20,U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged a group of breakaway New York Democrats to return to the party fold.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a132474150000331b85905e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on a group of breakaway Democrats in the New York Senate to caucus with the Democratic Party, enabling the party to control the legislative chamber.Currently, Democrats enjoy a 32–31 numerical majority in the state Senate, but a group of nine Democrats have chosen to form a majority coalition with the Republicans. Eight Democrats are members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a caucus that has a power-sharing arrangement with the GOP, and a ninth lawmaker, Simcha Felder, caucuses with the GOP.Schumer was asked about the matter on Monday during an event in Brewster, New York, where the Senator hoped to pressure New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority to adopt positive train control.“The IDC, they’re elected as Democrats and they should caucus with the Democrats and create a Democratic majority,” Schumer said. “That’s the right thing to do. I have worked very hard through the years to help elect Democrats and create a Democratic majority in the Senate.”“The IDC, they don’t run as Republicans, they just caucus with the Republicans. That’s wrong,” he added. “They ought to caucus and work with the Democrats.” Schumer joins a chorus of top Democrats who have urged the breakaway Democrats to return to the fold. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) has been outspoken about the need for the IDC to form a majority with Democrats, as have all 18 Democrats representing New York in the U.S. House.Candice Giove, a spokeswoman for the IDC, said in an email message that members of the IDC have the “greatest respect for Senator Schumer.”“However, on this issue he is wrong,” Giove said. “The IDC, a third separate conference, has never caucused with Republicans and has consistently helped to elect Democrats throughout this state.”Indeed, IDC members do not caucus with Republicans, but the group’s power-sharing agreement with the GOP minority, together with Felder’s membership in the GOP caucus, ensured Republican control of the state senate in the 2016 legislative session.Last Thursday, two activists affiliated with the Brooklyn chapter of Indivisible, a network of progressive grassroots groups, penned an op-ed in the New York Daily News admonishing Schumer for his “intolerable silence” on the matter.“Even though he is one of the nation’s two most powerful Democrats, representing a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2–1, Schumer inexcusably tolerates illegitimate Republican control of one house of New York’s Legislature, the state Senate, with the help of a group of breakaway Democrats,” Liat Olenick and Christopher Denicola wrote.Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and several New York–based progressive activists praised Schumer for his remarks on Monday.“Senate Democrats have always had a great friend in Chuck Schumer and we appreciate his support,” Stewart-Cousins said in a statement. “More and more Democratic leaders are standing up and calling on the IDC to respect the wishes of New Yorkers who voted numerous times for a Democratic Senate majority and want Democrats to work together. The Senate Democrats agree.”The New York chapter of the Working Families Party said it was “good to see” Schumer weigh in on the matter.The IDC formed after an internal party dispute in 2011, and for years it remained largely off the radar of national Democrats. In 2013, Democrats also had a 33-seat majority, which would have enabled them to control the Senate, even without Felder. But the IDC’s insistence on remaining in a power-sharing coalition with Republicans prevented that from happening. Then, losses in the 2014 elections wiped away Democrats’ thin numerical majority.But in the November 2016 election, Democrats won a numerical majority again, reviving grassroots scrutiny on the breakaway bloc. The election of President Donald Trump also heightened progressive political activism, bringing the IDC to the attention of many left-leaning New Yorkers who were previously unaware of its existence. Progressive activists have organized demonstrations outside the offices of the IDC’s members, at times attracting up to 100 protesters.Members of the New York Senate’s mainstream Democratic caucus argue that the IDC’s arrangement has prevented them from passing important pieces of legislation, and has delayed or diluted other bills. “They are giving power to the Republicans to decide whether those issues get brought up at all,” Deputy Democratic Leader Michael Gianaris told HuffPost in May. “Things that do get done, get done much later than they should or get watered down.”They further claim that the IDC members choose to work with Republicans for the perks it affords them, including leadership posts on Senate committees. The GOP majority even rewards the dissenting Democrats with financial stipends, known as “lulus,” that are normally reserved for committee chairmen.Both the New York attorney general’s office and the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn opened investigations into the practice after The New York Times unearthed it in May.This article was updated to clarify the IDC’s role within the Senate, and to note Democrats’ previous numerical majority in 2013."

The sophomore at Port Richmond High School on New York’s Staten Island asked her congressman, Dan Donovan (R-NY), a hard-hitting question during a town hall forum on Sunday afternoon. Mendez introduced herself as a youth leader of the organization Make The Road New York, an organization that fights for Latinx and immigrant rights. “Myself and many students here have knocked on your constituents’ doors and talked to registered voters all over Staten Island and many from the South Shore to tell our stories and talk to them about the importance of having a clean Dream Act,” Mendez said in front of a crowd of about 200 people.She referred to the push for a bill that would create a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ― without including provisions for a wall on the border with Mexico or other immigration matters.About two months ago, President Donald Trump announced that he was ending that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, put in place by former President Barack Obama, that had protected Dreamers from deportation. Trump’s move left nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants at risk of losing jobs and being deported when their protections expire. He has urged Congress to craft legislation that would create new protections from deportation for many Dreamers, but he also wants the additional provisions in the measure.Mendez, in her comments to Donovan, referred to her parents as immigrants (without clarifying their immigration status) and said she has a sister protected by DACA. (According to a representative of Make The Road New York, Mendez’s eldest sister, Angeles, is covered by the program while she and her younger sister ― seen in the video holding a box of signed petitions ― are both U.S. citizens.) Referring to the petitions, Mendez told Donovan: “I want to personally hand this to you so that you would know that Staten Island … does not support having to see families like mine ripped apart.”She bluntly asked Donovan whether he supported “the clean Dream Act that would not put money in the wall or put more money [for] agents that will separate and terrorize families like mine? Will you vote yes and support us to get this Dream Act passed?”Donovan said there “will be a fix to DACA,” but not without the other provisions sought by Trump.“I support DACA, but I also support protecting the border,” he said. “And there’s not enough votes in Congress right now to get a clean DACA, clean Dream Act bill passed without attaching some monies for some type of border security.” Mendez pressed the lawmaker: “And if we do get enough voters, will you vote yes” on a clean bill?Donovan replied: “I support the president in securing our borders.” The young high school girl did not let up, asking Donovan to be “a little bit more specific.” “I’m in favor of fixing DACA, and I’m also in favor of securing our borders.” Donovan said.“So that’s a no,” she quickly responded, arriving at the bottom line."

The State Department opinion aside, the Trump administration has tried to dismantle policies created to protect transgender rights.In July, President Donald Trump surprised many people, including top military officials, by announcing plans to ban trans people from serving in the armed forces. He claimed the presence of trans people in the military was costly and created “disruption” ― ideas that have been thoroughly debunked by military experts and LGBTQ advocates.A federal judge blocked the enforcement of that proposed ban in October, holding that the reasons the Trump administration gave for it “do not appear to be supported by any facts.”Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a directive in October that reversed workplace protections for trans people, stating that the Justice Department would roll back 2014 guidance on the interpretation of Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.“Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women,” Sessions said in the memo, “but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.”Trump’s first year in office has been the deadliest year for trans people in at least a decade, according to a report from the Human Rights Campaign and the Trans People of Color Coalition.“There is still so much to be done to combat transphobia across our country and around the world,” the report says. “Nowhere is that more evident than at the doorstep of the White House, where Donald Trump and Mike Pence have made discrimination against LGBTQ people, as well as so many others, a top priority.”It’s unclear if Trump’s White House will acknowledge Transgender Day of Remembrance this year, although President Barack Obama did. A representative for the White House did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a135b89150000460085916f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his new music video, “Love Is Love,” Trey Pearson finds vigor and self-acceptance amid a bevy of gay and lesbian pals on a crowded dance floor.To anyone with a passing knowledge of queer nightlife, it’s a familiar scene. For Pearson, the clip represents the culmination of a personal, and at times painful, journey. Released Nov. 17, “Love Is Love” is the title track from the singer-songwriter’s debut solo EP of the same name. (The first single, “Silver Horizon,” dropped in April.) The seven new songs are the first that Pearson — who spent 20 years as the lead singer of the Christian rock band Everyday Sunday — has written and recorded since publicly coming out as gay in 2016.“I really wanted to capture the range of emotions I’ve felt in the past year,” Pearson, 37, told HuffPost. “I felt like I didn’t have to hold back this time. I felt like I was able to be completely vulnerable. To be able to do that as an artist is the best feeling in the entire world.”“Love Is Love” borrows its title from “Hamilton” composer Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 2016 Tony Awards speech honoring the 49 victims of Orlando’s Pulse nightclub massacre, many of whom identified as queer. Hoping to create “a tribute to all LGBTQ sacred spaces,” Pearson opted to shoot the video in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, as opposed to a city with a globally known queer community like New York or San Francisco. Doing so, he said, would highlight the people and places “that really gave me refuge when I came out.”“When I came out, I lost a lot of people in my life,” he explained. “I felt like I’d moved to a completely new city, even though I still lived [in Columbus]. I had to just completely start over and rebuild relationships and figure out my life as an out gay man.”Pearson’s struggles after his coming out came to a head in September 2016, when he and his band were cut from the lineup of California’s Joshua Fest, a “family-friendly” Christian music festival, after 11 members of the event’s production team threatened to walk out if he performed. (At the last minute, he was invited to join the members of Five Iron Frenzy, a ska-punk band, for an encore.)He tackles his faith directly on the midtempo ballad, “Hey Jesus,” on which he sings, “I know that I could never change, I tried so hard, brought so much pain, I just wanna be loved for who I am.” “In 2017, in a Western evangelical culture of Christianity, we can mix up what we think [religion] means, and what it means to follow Jesus,” Pearson said of the song. “I’ve learned not to care as much about that. To love your neighbor as yourself ... to me, that was the true message of Jesus.”Sonically, “Love Is Love” marks a new chapter for Pearson, who left behind Everyday Sunday’s rock vibe in favor of a polished pop sound inspired by Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff. He doesn’t see references to his faith on “Love Is Love” as any different from bands like Coldplay or U2, both of whom have explored spirituality in their work. “All kinds of artists like to explore life’s mysteries,” he said. With the release of “Love Is Love” behind him, Pearson is in the early stages of planning a 20-city concert tour. Ultimately, he’d like to inspire listeners who may be struggling with their sexuality or other areas of their identity through his music and performances.“I have this passion to be a voice to help as many other people as I can to find their voice and their truth,” Pearson said. “Everything that I can do with my art to speak up and speak out, I want to do.”"

Released Nov. 17, “Love Is Love” is the title track from the singer-songwriter’s debut solo EP of the same name. (The first single, “Silver Horizon,” dropped in April.) The seven new songs are the first that Pearson — who spent 20 years as the lead singer of the Christian rock band Everyday Sunday — has written and recorded since publicly coming out as gay in 2016.“I really wanted to capture the range of emotions I’ve felt in the past year,” Pearson, 37, told HuffPost. “I felt like I didn’t have to hold back this time. I felt like I was able to be completely vulnerable. To be able to do that as an artist is the best feeling in the entire world.”“Love Is Love” borrows its title from “Hamilton” composer Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 2016 Tony Awards speech honoring the 49 victims of Orlando’s Pulse nightclub massacre, many of whom identified as queer. Hoping to create “a tribute to all LGBTQ sacred spaces,” Pearson opted to shoot the video in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, as opposed to a city with a globally known queer community like New York or San Francisco. Doing so, he said, would highlight the people and places “that really gave me refuge when I came out.”“When I came out, I lost a lot of people in my life,” he explained. “I felt like I’d moved to a completely new city, even though I still lived [in Columbus]. I had to just completely start over and rebuild relationships and figure out my life as an out gay man.”Pearson’s struggles after his coming out came to a head in September 2016, when he and his band were cut from the lineup of California’s Joshua Fest, a “family-friendly” Christian music festival, after 11 members of the event’s production team threatened to walk out if he performed. (At the last minute, he was invited to join the members of Five Iron Frenzy, a ska-punk band, for an encore.)He tackles his faith directly on the midtempo ballad, “Hey Jesus,” on which he sings, “I know that I could never change, I tried so hard, brought so much pain, I just wanna be loved for who I am.” “In 2017, in a Western evangelical culture of Christianity, we can mix up what we think [religion] means, and what it means to follow Jesus,” Pearson said of the song. “I’ve learned not to care as much about that. To love your neighbor as yourself ... to me, that was the true message of Jesus.”Sonically, “Love Is Love” marks a new chapter for Pearson, who left behind Everyday Sunday’s rock vibe in favor of a polished pop sound inspired by Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff. He doesn’t see references to his faith on “Love Is Love” as any different from bands like Coldplay or U2, both of whom have explored spirituality in their work. “All kinds of artists like to explore life’s mysteries,” he said. With the release of “Love Is Love” behind him, Pearson is in the early stages of planning a 20-city concert tour. Ultimately, he’d like to inspire listeners who may be struggling with their sexuality or other areas of their identity through his music and performances.“I have this passion to be a voice to help as many other people as I can to find their voice and their truth,” Pearson said. “Everything that I can do with my art to speak up and speak out, I want to do.”"

I am 22 years old and have been a longtime resident of the great state of Ohio. Earlier this month, my classmates and I had the opportunity to travel to Washington D.C. and visit the office Republican Senator Robert Portman to discuss our nation’s outdated immigration system.During our visit to Senator Portman’s office, we met with the senator’s legislative correspondent and expressed why it was crucial that the senator show his support for legislation that would protect Dreamers and TPS holders.I told Senator Portman’s staffer about my personal story: how I arrived in the United States at the age of four with my mother, lived in fear throughout high school due to my lack of immigration status and now live in fear now that Donald Trump has ended deportation protections for Dreamers.After sharing my concerns, I was surprised to hear from the staffer that Senator Portman did not support the Dream Act, a bill that would grant over 800,000 Dreamers like me a pathway towards citizenship because he did not consider it good policy. I was told that Senator Portman believes that the Dream Act has too much room for fast-track citizenship and was open to potential fraud. This shocked me. I have met with Senator Portman’s staff at his Cincinnati office and have repeatedly been told the senator was still listening to his constituents’ opinions on the Dream Act.I felt a mixture of emotions while listening to the staffer. I was confused, angered and disappointed that Senator Portman would allow his staff to give mixed statements to his constituents about an important bill that would change the lives of thousands of young hard working immigrants across the state of Ohio. It became clear that Senator Portman would prefer his staff members give mixed information on his position on a crucial piece of legislation for our country rather than be a champion for Dreamers like me.The clock is ticking for thousands of Dreamers across the country, many of whom will lose their DACA protection starting on March 6, 2018. That is why my friends and I have requested a meeting with Senator Portman so that we don’t get any more misinformation from his staff, and we can get an answer to our question: Will Senator Portman protect the thousands of Dreamers all across Ohio by supporting the Dream Act?So far, our meeting requests have gone unanswered."

Trudeau will apologize “for the persecution & injustices [LGBTQ people] have suffered” at the House of Commons next week, according to a tweet from him and an invitation to the event obtained by the Canadian outlet The Globe and Mail.The address is “expected to be the most comprehensive ever offered by any national government for past persecution of sexual minorities,” the outlet wrote. Trudeau’s address will likely focus largely on Canada’s past treatment of LGBTQ service members and other government employees. From the 1950s until 1992, many of those the government suspected of being gay were interrogated, put through humiliating tests to expose their sexual orientation and expelled from their Canadian government positions.The forthcoming apology is one of several redresses recommended by the Canadian LGBTQ advocacy group Egale, which has been working with Trudeau’s administration to address sexual minority equality issues in Canada. The planned apology comes as U.S. President Donald Trump attempts to walk back American progress in the same sphere. In August, Trump released a memorandum banning transgender people from serving in the U.S. armed forces, just over a year after the Pentagon’s 2016 decision to lift the ban. However, a federal judge last month blocked its enforcement.Since his 2015 election, Trudeau has also issued apologies for Canada’s past treatment of indigenous peoples and for the so-called “Komagata Maru incident” in 1914, in which Canada denied entry to hundreds of Sikh, Muslim and Hindu passengers and forced them to return to a violent situation back in India.

It replaced another charter school in the same building. The previous tenant, Medical Academy Charter School closed because of financial problems and low enrollment. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a12ba781800003a00f6d04c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The just-released Network for Public Education (NPE) report, “Charters and Consequences,” documents charter school scams supported by wealthy “philanthropists,” powerful political interests and an assortment of entrepreneurs looking to make money off of education. Eleven studies look at the charter school assault on public education, from Oakland, California to Brooklyn, New York with stops in Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Operating “behind a wall of secrecy,” the dark side of the charter movement includes “mismanagement, failure, nepotism or outright theft and fraud” and “abuse of taxpayer funds.” The full report is available online. Unless otherwise noted, information in this blog comes from the report.More than 3 million children attend charter schools in 44 states and the District of Columbia. The charters include national business chains, questionable “non-profits,” mysterious cyber-schools, “mom and pop” small schools, and far too few innovative quasi-public schools. About 20 percent of the charters operate directly to make a profit off of children and local governments. But there are many ways for charters to make money, including high salaries to sponsors, sub-contracting to friendly vendors and elaborate real estate ruses that allow charters to essentially rent facilities at exorbitant rates from their corporate partners.The wave of mismanagement plaguing the charter school industry was documented in an audit released by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education in September 2016. Thirty-three charters in six states were reviewed, and auditors concluded that 22, or two-thirds, “lacked the necessary internal controls, resulting in a significant risk to Department of Education funds.” In one of the more egregious cases, the Chief Executive Officer of a Pennsylvania Charter Management Organization:... wrote checks to himself totaling $11 million dollars, during the 2008-09 school year alone. The report also cited examples of criminal cases of outright fraud due to Charter and Education Management Organizations (CMOs and EMOs) having far too much control of charter schools and charter school boards.NPE found ingenious strategies for turning so-called “non-profit” charter schools into profit-making enterprises. KIPP (the Knowledge is Power Program) is one of the largest charter chains in the United States. It operates 209 schools with approximately 90,000 students. KIPP schools, which each has its own revenue stream, are supported by the KIPP Foundation that acts as the networks “central office.” According to NPE findings, the foundation’s “2014 expenses were over 72 million dollars — more than $360,000 a school.” That included over $2 million dollars spent on fundraising and administrative costs of nearly $6 million dollars.At the same time the foundation claimed to be operating at a $3 million dollar loss, it managed to pay its top leaders quite well. KIPP co-founder David Levin’s compensation package was nearly $475,000, just from the foundation. Co-founder Mike Feinberg was paid $219,596 from KIPP Inc.’s Houston division and another $221,461 from the KIPP Foundation. Feinberg claimed he earned his money by working 50 hours a week for KIPP’s Houston Schools and another 40 hours a week for the foundation.Levin and Feinberg are not even the highest paid charter kleptocrats. At Success Academy in New York City, CEO Eva Moscowitz received $600,000 in 2014 for managing 41 charter schools. But the real dollar winner is probably Stuart J. Udell, CEO of the for-profit K-12 online charter provider. His base salary was $650,000, and he received a performance-based bonus, equity incentives, and a sign-on bonus of $400,000. In 2013, K12’s Colorado charter chain had a four-year graduation rate of only 21.5 percent, so its CEO’s performance bonus clearly was not based on the performance of the company’s students.Charters have also discovered ingenious ways of promoting their brands. The Washington Post publishes a list of America’s Most Challenging High Schools based on the number of AP and IB tests taken by the school’s students divided by the number of graduates. Initially the list was dominated by public schools located in affluent communities, but now most of the top-ranked schools are charters, nine out of 10 in 2017. Since the list ignores how well students do on the exams, these charters simply make their students sit for the tests as a requirement for graduation. Then they promote their high ranking as a justification for more charter schools.NPE did an analysis of the top-performing schools on the 2017 list and found a number of surprises. The No. 1 school on the list was BASIS Charter School Phoenix. Its 2016 graduating class had only 24 students and an attrition rate of 44 percent from the entering ninth grade class. Since BASIS Phoenix does not have a free or reduced-price lunch program, nor does it provide students with transportation, it easily eliminated many low-income students. The school also pressures parents to make a $1,500 annual donation per child and charges high fees to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. Bingo! That explains the disappearing students, the low graduation numbers, and the high percentage of students who manage to take the exams.Charters claim they do not drain money away from public schools, but Dr. Joe Roy, superintendent of the Bethlehem (Pennsylvania) School District, strongly disagrees. According to Roy, charter schools suck off about 10 percent of his district’s annual budget. He estimates that if the charter schools closed and the district reabsorbed the students, it would save $20 million a year. Some of the biggest ripoffs in Pennsylvania are by cyber-charters that bill districts for the full charge of educating special needs children, regardless of a child’s disabilities or the services they provide. One cyber-charter founder was arrested and charged with tax fraud, not for taking public money, but for under-reporting how much he took.California has the most charter schools and charter school students in the United States, which is not surprising, because it also has the most K-12 students. What is surprising is the big money behind the charter schools movement. The leader of the push for “charterization” in California is the California Charter Schools Association (CCSA) and its politically influential political action committee or PAC. Donors to CCSA Advocates’ super PAC include Doris Fisher, co-founder of GAP; Eli Broad, wealthy builder and real estate developer; Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix; and members of the Walton family. CCSA and its allies spent almost $2.3 million last year to influence the Los Angeles school board election.In Brooklyn, New York Success Academy Charter School Network CEO Eva Moskowitz claims to do miracles educating impoverished inner-city minority youth, at least based on standardized test scores. NPE decided to take a closer look at a Success Academy Charter School in Bed-Stuy, and the miracles dissolved. Better results reflected Success’ “success” in keeping out as many harder-to-teach children as possible. The Success Academy charter reported that 60 percent of its students came from disadvantaged families, which seems like a lot, but not compared to the three nearby public schools where the poverty rate for student families averaged almost 85 percent, and while the Success charter reported that 18 percent of its students received special services, each of the three public schools had at least 25 percent of its students classified as special needs. One way Success remains successful is by driving out the children it does not want. At Success Bed-Stuy, the student suspension rate was 11 percent. At the three nearby public schools in was an average of less than 1 percent.The Network for Public Education report concludes charter schools are a “failed experiment.” NPE supports the “freedom to innovate” that the charter movement promises, but wants that freedom “offered to public schools by the district or the state.” The report does not demand the “immediate closure of all charter schools, but rather we advocate for their eventual absorption into the public school system. We look forward to the day when charter schools are governed not by private boards, but by those elected by the community, at the district, city or county level.”Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8 "

Rose, who has long hosted an interview show on PBS and also co-anchors “CBS This Morning,” is accused of making sexual advances toward multiple women — some of whom worked on his show. He is also accused of groping women and walking in front of them while naked.A PBS spokesperson said the network is immediately suspending distribution of the program, which is produced by an independent company, in response to the allegations.“PBS was shocked to learn today of these deeply disturbing allegations,” the spokesperson said. “PBS does not fund this nightly program or supervise its production, but we expect our producers to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect.” Bloomberg TV, which broadcasts “Charlie Rose” as well, also said it is suspending the show.CBS also suspended Rose after learning of the allegations.“Charlie Rose is suspended immediately while we look into this matter,” the network said in a statement. “These allegations are extremely disturbing and we take them very seriously.”“He was a sexual predator, and I was his victim,” said Reah Bravo, one of the women who spoke to the Post. Bravo worked for Rose’s interview show starting in 2007 and says he made multiple advances when the two were alone together. Several women described Rose putting his hands on their legs. Another said he repeatedly made lewd early morning or late-night phone calls to her. One woman said Rose groped her breasts while they were driving in a car together. Rose reportedly also gave women shoulder rubs without their permission, an action one source told the Post was known among staffers as “the crusty paw.”The incidents date from the late 1990s to 2011, and the women ranged in age from 21 to 37 at the time of the incidents they describe. Two women told the Post they reported Rose’s inappropriate actions to Yvette Vega, a longtime producer on his show. Vega told the Post she “failed” to help those women.“I should have stood up for them,” she said.Read the full Washington Post report here.“It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed,” Rose said in a statement in response to the Post’s reporting. “I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.”Rose, 75, has hosted his PBS show since 1993, and has co-anchored the CBS morning program since 2012. He joins a growing list of men in positions of power who have been accused of sexual harassment and assault in recent weeks, beginning with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in October. Earlier Monday, New York Times star reporter Glenn Thrush was suspended from the newspaper after a Vox report detailed several instances of him behaving inappropriately with female journalists. This post has been updated with more information about the allegations and responses from PBS, Bloomberg TV and CBS."
44,POLITICS,Alabama Secretary Of State Said Hundreds May Have Voted Illegally. None Will Face Charges.,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-crossover-voting_us_5a1320fce4b0aa32975cd765,Critics accused him of trying to intimidate voters after he pushed for an investigation into people who may have violated a new law in the state.,2017-11-20,"In this file photo from 2015, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) introduces Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) at an event. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1324f9140000891d50e6e3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After publicly suggesting that nearly 700 voters could face jail time for violating a new voting law in the state, Alabama’s secretary of state has announced that he won’t refer anyone to be prosecuted following further investigation from election officials. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) said last month that his office had identified 674 people who may have illegally voted in the September GOP runoff election between Roy Moore and Sen. Luther Strange. The state recently passed a law prohibiting people from voting in primary elections for two different parties, and the Moore-Strange contest was the first time it had been in effect.Merrill told ThinkProgress that he believed anyone who violated the law should face the maximum penalty: a fine of up to $15,000 and as many as 10 years in prison.Merrill’s office asked local probate judges to verify the names of 674 people suspected of breaking the law and investigate what had happened. The office said Friday in a statement that it had found 534 cases of a poll worker, election official or voter committing an error and 140 confirmed incidents of illegal crossover voting.When Merrill followed up on those 140 cases with the probate judges, there wasn’t a single incident in which a judge recommended referring the case to local prosecutors for potential charges. Merrill’s office said it will document the names of crossover voters, but that it now considered the matter closed.Critics say Merrill was too quick to suggest that hundreds of people had committed a crime when there was widespread confusion among voters and election workers about the new law. The incident underscores how episodes that seem like nefarious examples of voter fraud can be inadvertent errors. Moore defeated Strange by more than 44,000 votes in the special election in September.Merrill told HuffPost in an interview that he didn’t initially intend to draw attention to the crossover voters. He said he sent the list of suspected crossover voters to local officials, and that they gave it to the press. Merrill said he wanted to be as clear as possible about what he was doing to address the issue when a reporter contacted him about it. He said he wouldn’t do anything differently in the future, except maybe ask the local probate judges not to share information with the press until their offices had been able to review it.Although Merrill previously said anyone who violated the new law should be punished, he said Friday that he was “excited” no prosecution was recommended.“We were very excited to see that our efforts to educate and inform voters, in conjunction and cooperation with local election officials, were successful and that the Probate Judges have determined these findings do not warrant prosecution,” he said in a statement.Randall Marshall, the executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, said state election officials always had the information needed to prevent people who had voted in the Democratic primary from voting in the Republican runoff. “Much as we predicted, the Secretary of State’s initial grandiose statements about this being a widespread problem that should result in people being imprisoned has now ended with a whimper,” Marshall said in a statement to HuffPost. “This was always a matter that could be prevented by state election officials ― after all, they have the records of who voted in the initial primaries and could effectively prevent such a person from voting in a runoff election. We hope the fear of prosecution has not deterred any eligible voters from participating in the upcoming election, and we are focused on ensuring Alabamians are informed about their right to vote on December 12.”Merrill told HuffPost he didn’t think anyone would be confused about who they could vote for or whether they would be eligible to vote in the special election next month.“I don’t know why anybody would think this is even applicable to a general election because this is only applicable to the primary process and the primary process has been executed,” he said.Asked whether a Republican who showed up at the polls might think they weren’t allowed to vote for a Democrat, Merrill said, “That doesn’t confuse me, and I don’t know why it would confuse anybody that’s a thinking person in the state.”“That’s never been introduced in the history of the state,” he said. “It’s been introduced by some trolls in Twitter and some trolls on Facebook, but it hasn’t been introduced by anybody who’s got any credibility.”More than half of the people who Merrill’s office suspected of violating the crossover voting law came from Jefferson County, the state’s most populous. Alan King, the county’s probate judge, told HuffPost earlier this month that more than 300 of the cases came from a precinct where the chief inspector had crossed off names in a pollbook to indicate people who were ineligible to vote. Merrill’s office, King said, misinterpreted those crossed-out names as people who had illegally voted in both the Democratic primary and the Republican runoff. King said Merrill had threatened voters “prematurely.”Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) previously accused Merrill of trying to intimidate voters by promising such harsh penalties ― an accusation Merrill strongly denied. Sewell said Monday in a statement that she was glad Merrill was dropping the matter.“I am pleased that no voters are facing prosecution under Alabama’s new crossover voting law,” she said. “As our state continues to inform election officials and voters about how the new law works, it is important that we prioritize voter education over punitive measures.”Nancy Worley, the chairwoman of the Alabama Democratic Party, said she wished Merrill had done a more thorough review before making a public statement.“I think there’s always concern when an election official has publicized wrongdoing and people don’t understand that thoroughly,” she said."
45,BLACK VOICES,People Of Color Are More Likely To Be Exposed To Pollution Than White People,Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/people-of-color-higher-pollution-exposure_us_5a131756e4b0c335e9964a2c,Yet not much is being done to fix it.,2017-11-20,Air pollution in Los Angeles has gotten worse in the last couple of years.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a136238180000849ff6d30f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A recent government-funded study has found proof that environmental racism is alive and well.The report found that people of color in the U.S. are more likely to encounter harmful air pollution than white people. Despite overall improvements in air quality, this disparity hasn’t improved much in recent years.The University of Washington study, published in September, found that exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), a key transportation-related pollutant, is highly influenced by race more so than income, age or education. “What surprised us is that race matters more than income when it comes to who is breathing in NO₂,” Julian Marshall, a senior author of the study, said in the report. “I just stared at these findings and thought: ‘What is going on?’ You would think places near highways would cost less. But it’s race that is driving this, not income,” said Marshall, an environmental engineering professor at the University of Washington. “Urban planners tell us that cities are still really segregated ― people live close to people who look like them. We are seeing the outcome of that.” Exposure to NO₂ ― emitted when cars, trucks and power plants burn fuel ― can trigger health issues, especially those related to the respiratory system, such as asthma. Pollutant sources, including landfills, waste sites, highways and industrial facilities, are most often near communities of color, putting those neighborhoods at greater risks. Though the overall exposure to NO₂ among all Americans dropped from 2000 to 2010, black and Latino people experienced a 37 percent higher rate of exposure in 2010 compared with white people. That’s only a 3 percentage point decrease from a decade prior.Pollution has become worse in some areas in the U.S., including the Midwest and California. In 2000, concentrations of the pollutant were 2.5 times higher in neighborhoods with a low white population than in areas that were overwhelmingly white. This number increased to 2.7 times higher in 2010.The study, partially funded by the Environment Protection Agency, noted that in 2010, about 5,000 premature deaths from heart disease would’ve been prevented if people of color breathed in the same level of the pollutant as did white people. It also noted that not much has been done to address this issue. And it’s not for certain that the EPA will find a solution since Trump expressed his intentions to cut funding for the environmental justice program.“We have policies in place to reduce pollution in general but we don’t have policies in place on environmental justice,” Marshall said. “We aren’t addressing the disparities in health risks. It’s important that this is recognized. We can’t just ignore it.”"

But Roy Moore does not speak for Christianity, and he acts in ways that are contrary to our faith.”More than 55 Alabama pastors initially signed the open letter on Nov. 16. Hundreds of other ministers and lay Christians from within and outside of Alabama have added their names to the campaign after it was posted online on Nov. 18 to the petition site Groundswell, operated by New York’s Auburn Theological Seminary.The ministers from Alabama appeared to be predominantly from mainline Protestant churches, which are a minority in Alabama’s largely evangelical Protestant religious landscape. Other signers were from historically black Baptist congregations or non-denominational congregations.Since early November, Moore has been battling allegations that he sexually assaulted or targeted teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore has repeatedly denied the mounting attacks against his character, claiming that they are politically motivated. Some evangelical Christian leaders have stood firm in their support of the candidate, while others are wavering.But for progressive Christians in Alabama, the allegations against Moore were another nail in the coffin, reinforcing a view of him that has been negative for quite some time. Moore, a Southern Baptist, long has been a controversial figure in Alabama’s politics ― and nationally, as well. He’s been booted from his post as chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court twice ― first, for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building, and later for ordering probate judges to refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing such unions.The pastors’ letter refers to Moore’s virulently anti-queer and anti-Muslim stances, as well as his championing of Christian nationalism.“It is our belief that in light of Roy Moore’s extremist beliefs, his patterns of behavior, and the recent allegations against him, no person of faith can, in good conscience, support him or his religious nationalism,” the pastors wrote. “He has done harm to our government; he has done harm to our Christian witness; and he has done harm to vulnerable people.”Rev. Dr. Dave Barnhart, Jr., who pastors a group of United Methodist house churches in Birmingham, Alabama, brought the campaign to Groundswell. He told HuffPost that the idea for the letter began organically on a Facebook post, after some clergy suggested responding together to news that conservative Christian pastors in Alabama had released a letter endorsing Moore. (It turns out this endorsement was actually a re-release of an earlier letter written in August, and that some of the signatories had not been contacted about the update).Barnhart said he hopes the letter will encourage voters who don’t typically show up to the polls to take part in Alabama’s Dec. 12 special election. He also hopes to reach conservative Christians who are on the fence about Moore.Another target audience is non-Christians, he told HuffPost. “I would hope that for those who have rejected Christianity because they think it means being authoritarian, anti-gay, and anti-Muslim, that they would hear that Roy Moore does not speak for us,” Barnhart said in an email.This desire to present an alternate vision of Christianity is also what motivated Rev. Jennifer Sanders, pastor of Beloved Community Church in Birmingham, Alabama, to sign the letter. She told HuffPost in an email she believes the letter “disrupts the illusion of consensus, the notion that Christianity in Alabama speaks only with a fundamentalist voice.”“I signed the letter because in his career Roy Moore has consistently advanced an agenda that denies that all people ― in our beautiful diversity ― are made in the image of God,” she said. “His demagoguery contradicts the continual Gospel emphasis on siding with the marginalized.” Below, Alabama faith leaders hold a press conference to condemn Roy Moore’s policies.Adam Mixon, pastor of the Zion Spring Baptist Church in Birmingham, told HuffPost his congregation tends to be conservative on moral issues. But because of its history as a black church in a poor neighborhood, the church’s politics tend to lean toward supporting minorities.The sexual assault allegations against Moore simply solidified Mixon’s resolve to reject the candidate and his policies.“I hope signing the letter causes others to begin to question the inconsistency in application of the core Christian principle of ‘loving one’s neighbor’ by many white conservative evangelicals,” he said.Rev. Carolyn Foster, a deacon at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Birmingham, told HuffPost that Moore’s policies reminded her of the “violence, injustice, and abuse of power” once sanctioned by Christians in the segregated South. She signed the letter because Moore’s brand of Christianity “does not align or even closely resemble” the nature of God. “For me, it is not about being a progressive or a conservative Christian; it’s about being right or wrong as it relates to Christian teachings and values,” she said. “Christian allegiance should be to God, not party affiliation. I pray this letter embolden more Christians who feel as I do to speak up against the misuse of the faith.”The full letter:November 16, 2017An Open Letter From Alabama Pastors About Roy MooreUnder ordinary circumstances, we clergy refrain from speaking directly about political candidates, and only speak to issues.

Each woman shared her story of sexual harassment; many instances took place in public spaces like sidewalks and street corners and public benches. Hatch told HuffPost that after this strange man told her to “cheer up,” she became really angry. “That single phrase, which I am used to hearing, finally irritated me so much to the point where I needed to do something about it,” she said. “It prompted me to have a conversation with my girlfriends about harassment and we ended up story swapping for over an hour, talking about sexual harassment like it was the most normal thing in the world.”Hatch said she was prompted to start the project after her male friends expressed their “disbelief and horror” that she and her girlfriends experienced sexual harassment as much as they did. “I realized that it wasn’t just the harassment itself that was the problem, it was the awareness surrounding it,” she said. Hatch said the series has been received very well, and she’s had an overwhelming amount of women of all ages, sizes and ethnicities who want to partake. “It has been both therapeutic for the women involved and myself,” she said. “There has been an extremely positive reaction from the women who I have photographed, as they are reclaiming ownership of that experience, and turning a situation where they were once victimized into one where they are empowered.” She added that she hopes this series can elevate women’s voices in conversations around street harassment. “This project is for the women involved, and for people who have stories to share,” Hatch told HuffPost. “I want to give women a voice, and continue to raise awareness for an issue that was previously barely spoken about.”Scroll below to see more from Hatch’s “Cheer Up Luv” series.

We support his decision to enter a substance abuse program. In the meantime, we will not be commenting further.”Vox’s Laura McGann says she interviewed 40 individuals while reporting the piece, in which she also describes an inappropriate interaction she said she had with Thrush five years ago, when they both worked for Politico.McGann writes that she had been with Thrush and a few other reporters at a bar in Virginia. Toward the end of the evening, only she, Thrush and one other colleague remained. McGann says Thrush gave the other colleague a $20 bill as an incentive for her to get in a cab and leave. After the colleague left, McGann said Thrush did the following:He slid into my side of the booth, blocking me in. I was wearing a skirt, and he put his hand on my thigh. He started kissing me. I pulled myself together and got out of there, shoving him on my way out.McGann says Thrush sent her a vague but apologetic email the following morning, and that he did not specify why he was apologizing. She also said that later that same afternoon, she noticed Thrush in “deep conversation with a number of men,” after which she said she believed that “certain men in the newsroom... started to look at me differently.” While interviewing one of those men for the new Vox story, McGann learned that this seemed to be a correct reading of the situation: The man said Thrush had relayed a story in which McGann had come onto him and he’d rebuffed the advances. “The source said that Thrush frequently told versions of this story with different young women as the subject,” McGann writes. “He would talk up a night out drinking with a young attractive woman, usually a journalist. Then he’d claim that she came onto him. In his version of these stories, Thrush was the responsible grown-up who made sure nothing happened.”McGann added that the entire ordeal with Thrush and subsequent feelings had made her feel as though she shouldn’t be in journalism and that she “had brought this all on myself.”The Vox report cites several other accounts from women who said Thrush kissed and/or groped them when they didn’t want him to, as well as one who said Thrush came inside her home after she’d been drinking and he offered her a ride. McGann writes that the women she spoke to described feeling “scared, violated, ashamed, weirded out” and that she was (and currently still is) angry.Thrush said in a statement emailed to McGann over the weekend that he apologizes “to any woman who felt uncomfortable in my presence, and for any situation where I behaved inappropriately. Any behavior that makes a woman feel disrespected or uncomfortable is unacceptable.”Thrush, 50, is a well-known journalist. Bobby Moynihan has repeatedly portrayed him in “Saturday Night Live” sketches depicting the White House briefing room.Alongside fellow New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, Thrush is currently writing a book about President Donald Trump for Random House. Responding to the allegations against Thrush, Random House told HuffPost: “This matter recently came to our attention and we are looking at it closely and seriously.”You can read the entire report on Vox here.

The first trial is now underway.,2017-11-20,"An activist stands amid smoke from a stun grenade while protesting in Washington, D.C., Jan. 20, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1302bd140000c70250e653.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― They may not have broken any windows, set any fires, tossed any rocks or thrown any bricks. But a United States prosecutor here Monday told a jury that six defendants facing felony charges in connection with the protests and mayhem surrounding President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January deserve to be found guilty of several felony crimes that would expose them to potential sentences of decades in prison.Six defendants ― Jennifer Armento, Alexei Wood, Oliver Harris, Michelle Macchio, Brittne Lawson and Christina Simmons ― were among the 234 people arrested en masse during protests on Jan. 20, commonly referred to as the J20 protests. They’re the first group to go to trial, and their case could determine whether prosecutors continue pursuing felony rioting charges against the nearly 200 people who have trials spread out over the course of the next year.In a dramatic opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff repeatedly referred to a “sea of black masks” that roamed the city causing chaos, violence and destruction. Authorities have said there was more than $100,000 in property damage that day. The prosecution’s first witness was the manager of a downtown Au Bon Pain cafe that had its windows broken.Kerkhoff, in her opening statement, told the stories of individuals who were working downtown that day and were affected by the unrest: a Starbucks worker who had to “dive for cover” as a window was smashed; a shop owner who was devastated to find her own window broken; a limousine driver whose vehicle was set on fire after the defendants had been arrested; and police officers who felt “helpless” as the large group overran the downtown area. Kerkhoff told the jurors that the six defendants “made a choice” to take part in a violent and destructive riot, arguing they “had countless opportunities to walk away, to say this was too much, this isn’t what I signed up for, this isn’t what I’m going to do, this isn’t how I’m going to express my opinion.”Instead, she said, the defendants chose to stay, and “helped this path of destruction through the city,” moving together with the group as individual members popped out, caused destruction and were “reabsorbed” into the massive group.“Each of them made a choice, and each of them played a role,” Kerkhoff said. “You don’t personally have to be the one who breaks the window to be guilty of rioting.”Kerkhoff claimed that even as the defendants saw the destruction members of the group were causing, they stayed with the group until they were rounded up by police. “Each of these defendants still said ‘I’m in.’ ‘Let’s keep going, I’m in,’” she said. Alleging that one of the defendants was masked, she added: “That mask comes off today.”Several attorneys for the six defendants, on the other hand, told the jury there was not evidence that their clients participated in any destruction. But they were indiscriminately treated by police, with defendants’ attorneys alleging that the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department ― which is facing a lawsuit for its tactics that day ― violated its own policies by “kettling” a large group of people. It’s much easier to treat everyone the same, call the protest a riot, and lock everyone up, rather than comply with the First Amendment, one lawyer argued.Steven McCool, who was representing Harris, suggested the charges were being pursued because groups like the American Civil Liberties Union would sue the police department, and the government would lose. “They want to convict everyone they trap,” McCool said.Defense attorneys prepared jurors to see lots of videos showing the destruction from that day, but said it was important for them to remember that the government wouldn’t be able to prove their clients took part in it.Tammy Jacques, representing Christina Simmons, said that her client was “arrested for something she did not do,” and noted this was the first presidential election Simmons was old enough to vote in. “She was in the District of Columbia doing what she had the right to do. The right to protest,” Jacques said.Brett Cohen was in court representing Alexei Wood, whose case has drawn particular attention because the 37-year-old videographer and photographer said he was there in his capacity as a photojournalist. Kerkhoff said in her opening that anyone can be a photographer in this day and age because of technology. She said that Wood did not hide his face, and darkly warned that Wood’s Facebook livestream, a key piece of government evidence in the case, was available on the internet for “anyone that wanted to watch.” Kerkhoff said jurors would see Wood “cheering when the destruction happens” and “celebrating” when someone was struck in the groin with a rock.Cohen, Wood’s attorney, painted a different picture, saying his case was “a little bit different” than the others because it “involves the right to a free press.” Wood is a professional photographer, mostly working on weddings and commercial photography, Cohen said. But he developed an interest in photojournalism in recent years. “He’s independent, he’s up-and-coming, and he’s building a resume,” Cohen said. So, he argued, it made sense for Wood to attend the inauguration, a perfect opportunity to advance his work.Cohen said that Wood may have said things on the livestream that are “disagreeable,” but he didn’t do anything illegal. Cohen also said Wood’s comments, which appeared to be supportive of the property destruction, were directed at the audience watching the livestream, not the people out on the street. The government, Cohen said, would have to prove that Wood’s statements or reactions were made with the intent of furthering the riot and the destruction of property. Prosecutors have dropped charges against seven of the nine journalists arrested in the kettle that day.Kerkhoff said that people are allowed to have emotions and feel what they want, but that this case wasn’t about that. It was, she said, about the defendants’ choice to stick with a group that caused mayhem in downtown D.C.“That is why we’re here. Violence and destruction was a choice,” Kerkhoff said. “And they made choices that day to participate in it.”Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

Alleging that one of the defendants was masked, she added: “That mask comes off today.”Several attorneys for the six defendants, on the other hand, told the jury there was not evidence that their clients participated in any destruction. But they were indiscriminately treated by police, with defendants’ attorneys alleging that the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department ― which is facing a lawsuit for its tactics that day ― violated its own policies by “kettling” a large group of people. It’s much easier to treat everyone the same, call the protest a riot, and lock everyone up, rather than comply with the First Amendment, one lawyer argued.Steven McCool, who was representing Harris, suggested the charges were being pursued because groups like the American Civil Liberties Union would sue the police department, and the government would lose. “They want to convict everyone they trap,” McCool said.Defense attorneys prepared jurors to see lots of videos showing the destruction from that day, but said it was important for them to remember that the government wouldn’t be able to prove their clients took part in it.Tammy Jacques, representing Christina Simmons, said that her client was “arrested for something she did not do,” and noted this was the first presidential election Simmons was old enough to vote in. “She was in the District of Columbia doing what she had the right to do. The right to protest,” Jacques said.Brett Cohen was in court representing Alexei Wood, whose case has drawn particular attention because the 37-year-old videographer and photographer said he was there in his capacity as a photojournalist. Kerkhoff said in her opening that anyone can be a photographer in this day and age because of technology. She said that Wood did not hide his face, and darkly warned that Wood’s Facebook livestream, a key piece of government evidence in the case, was available on the internet for “anyone that wanted to watch.” Kerkhoff said jurors would see Wood “cheering when the destruction happens” and “celebrating” when someone was struck in the groin with a rock.Cohen, Wood’s attorney, painted a different picture, saying his case was “a little bit different” than the others because it “involves the right to a free press.” Wood is a professional photographer, mostly working on weddings and commercial photography, Cohen said. But he developed an interest in photojournalism in recent years. “He’s independent, he’s up-and-coming, and he’s building a resume,” Cohen said. So, he argued, it made sense for Wood to attend the inauguration, a perfect opportunity to advance his work.Cohen said that Wood may have said things on the livestream that are “disagreeable,” but he didn’t do anything illegal. Cohen also said Wood’s comments, which appeared to be supportive of the property destruction, were directed at the audience watching the livestream, not the people out on the street. The government, Cohen said, would have to prove that Wood’s statements or reactions were made with the intent of furthering the riot and the destruction of property. Prosecutors have dropped charges against seven of the nine journalists arrested in the kettle that day.Kerkhoff said that people are allowed to have emotions and feel what they want, but that this case wasn’t about that. It was, she said, about the defendants’ choice to stick with a group that caused mayhem in downtown D.C.“That is why we’re here. Violence and destruction was a choice,” Kerkhoff said. “And they made choices that day to participate in it.”Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

55,POLITICS,Janet Yellen To Step Down From Fed After Successor Assumes Chairmanship,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-chair-janet-yellen-announces-resignation_us_5a133754e4b0bfa88c1c3d41,The first female chair of the Federal Reserve declined the option to stay on as a lower-ranking Fed official.,2017-11-20,Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen announced on Monday that she would leave the central bank in February.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1337df180000849ff6d22d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen announced Monday that she will leave the U.S. central bank when her term ends in February.Earlier this month, President Donald Trump named Jerome Powell, a Republican Fed governor who worked closely with Yellen, as the next Fed chair. Powell is now up for Senate confirmation, which he is widely expected to receive.Although Yellen’s term as chair would end once Powell takes office in February, she had the opportunity to stay on as a Fed governor until Jan. 31, 2024.In a Monday letter to Trump, Yellen revealed that she would not be availing herself of that opportunity.“As I prepare to leave the Board, I am gratified that the financial system is much stronger than a decade ago, better able to withstand future bouts of instability and continue supporting the economic aspirations of American family and businesses,” she wrote in the letter. “I am also gratified by the substantial improvement in the economy since the crisis.”The White House responded to Yellen’s announcement by praising her tenure.“The president has great respect for Chair Yellen and her service as Chair of the Federal Reserve. He wishes her well in her future endeavors,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.President Barack Obama appointed Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve in October 2013, as then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke’s second 4-year term came to an end. The Senate went on to confirm Yellen, making her the first woman to lead the United States’ powerful central bank when she took office in February 2014.Obama had originally hoped to name his former economic adviser Lawrence Summers to the top post. But he bowed to pressure from women’s groups and other progressive activists to name Yellen instead.Summers had once suggested that women might have intrinsically less aptitude for math and science. He also elicited the ire of left-leaning activists for his support of 1990s-era financial deregulation and failure to anticipate the financial crisis of 2008.When Obama appointed Yellen, she was serving as vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Prior to that she had served as president of the regional Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and was a longtime economist at the University of California, Berkeley.Yellen is generally credited with enabling the current run of economic growth by maintaining low interest rates well into the recovery from the Great Recession. In December 2015, Yellen raised the central bank’s federal funds rate, a benchmark that influences borrowing costs throughout the economy, marking the first such hike since the 2008 financial crisis.Yellen drew praise from progressives for resisting pressure to raise rates earlier and raising it further only gradually thereafter.“The single most important thing that she has done since 2014 is restrain the pace of the tightening of monetary policy and allow the economy to continue producing more jobs,” said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist, who spent two decades at the Fed, including as a special adviser to Chair Bernanke and then-Vice Chair Yellen. ""We have had 10 million new jobs under her tenure ― and that number might have been half as big or zero under a different Fed chair.”Yellen was also willing to use her perch as Fed chair to expound on the Fed’s role in reducing economic inequality, including the wide disparity in opportunities available to workers of color as compared to white workers.The Fed Up campaign, a coalition of progressive groups that pushes the Fed to prioritize full employment, urged President Trump to re-appoint Yellen.The organization lamented Yellen’s decision to leave the central bank.“Janet Yellen’s retirement is a loss for working people across the country,” said Jordan Haedtler, Fed Up campaign manager, in a statement. “Janet Yellen did more than most of her predecessors to achieve the Fed’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.”“Yellen showed remarkable leadership and spoke out about economic inequality, racial disparities in the economy, the role of women in the workplace, and the need for more diversity at the Fed,” Haedtler added.Despite some initial skepticism, Yellen even won over many Wall Street insiders, who benefit from higher rates, but value steady economic growth above all.At one point during the 2016 presidential election, Trump went after Yellen for keeping rates low, which he claimed she did to benefit the incumbent Democratic Party ― and by default, Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton.Since taking office he has changed his tun and claimed that he was seriously considering appointing her to a second term.When Trump ultimately named Powell to the post, he praised Yellen as a “a wonderful woman, who’s done a terrific job.”At the time, some analysts deemed Trump’s decision sexist, since he was replacing her with Powell, who unlike Yellen, has less experience at the Fed and no advanced degree in economics.“Denying Yellen reappointment fits the trend in this administration of marginalizing the views of women, people of color, and working families in favor of white men with ties to Wall Street,” Fed Up said in its Monday statement."
56,STYLE,How Adding Bright Colors To Your Wardrobe Can Help You Beat The Winter Blues,Julia Brucculieri,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bright-colors-beat-the-winter-blues_us_5a0f1373e4b0e97dffed0723,Embrace the rainbow.,2017-11-20,Channelling Big Bird never looked as chic as it did outside Copenhagen Fashion Week in 2016. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a12f2b91500004600858f7e.jpeg?cache=Leu9MaYCdi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the weather gets colder and the days get grayer, it’s easy to catch a case of the winter blues, especially when it comes to getting dressed. Gray, black, navy and other deep tones tend to dominate our wardrobes during the winter months, with bright, flashy colors taking a back seat. “We tend to mirror our environment in the clothes that we wear,” said Leslie Harrington, executive director of the Color Association of the United States.There’s actually a physiological reason for this, according to Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute.“There is less bright sunlight and cloudier days in winter, so it is more difficult for the eye to accept the brightness,” she noted, whereas in the summer, bright sunlight makes it “easier for the eye to ‘take in’ additional brightness.”The all-black-everything aesthetic is classic, but there’s a serious case to be made for adding some bold shades to the mix when it comes to avoiding a winter slump. Studies have shown that there is definitely a link between color and emotions, and, generally speaking, colors “can have a profound effect on us both psychologically and physiologically,” Eiseman explained.In her 2017 book, The Complete Color Harmony, Pantone Edition, she noted that as “part of our psychic development, color is tied to our emotions as well as our intellect. Every color has meanings that we inherently sense, or have learned about by association and/or conditioning, which enable us to recognize the messages and meanings delivered.”“When you see certain colors, they have associations to them and those associations are linked to how they make us feel and behave,” Harrington said. “Warmer colors, brighter colors, we always talk about them being happier. That’s because they make us feel happy when we look at them.” Harrington said that seeing certain colors produces hormones or endorphins ― “all that kind of good stuff” ― which can make us feel better.Take the color yellow, for example. As Eiseman pointed out, in many societies yellow is symbolic of the sun and “the inevitable warming and welcoming presence that helps us greet a new day — or at least the promise of a sunny day when the cloud cover is gone.” Both experts noted the potential positive affects of seeing yellow, a color that is so often equated with feelings of happiness, joy and even optimism. Research has shown that both yellow and green evoke positive emotions, for example, while black and gray are reminiscent of mourning, sadness and depression.So can wearing certain colors, like yellow or even bright orange or green, actually make us feel better on a cold, dark winter day? Yes, according to Eiseman and Harrington. “Just as sunshine can make us happier for the [aforementioned] reasons, we can help to induce that hopeful feeling by wearing something yellow,” Eiseman said, adding that when other people see someone in a bright color, they, too, might feel happier. “It’s interesting that it can start a chain reaction that creates a more positive energy for the person wearing the colors as well as those who observe the color.” Harrington agreed that bright colors can stimulate both the person wearing them and those around them, creating a sort of cycle of positivity.“Because [bright colors] usually aren’t the norm, they will attract attention and usually other people tend to like them and will comment to somebody, ‘Oh, you look great. I love that color,’” Harrington said. “That then feeds into this cycle of feeling good about ourselves.” Those who don’t plan on giving up their tendency for all black shouldn’t worry. As Harrington explained, you don’t need to wear bright colors from head-to-toe to reap the positive benefits. “If it’s more for you to feel it, [a colorful item] can be tucked under things,” Harrington said. “If you put on a really bright shirt then put a gray sweater, jacket or blazer on top of it, you’ll still get as much benefit from it, because it’s you who knows you’re wearing that color. Some of us like to have it for us, but not to be seen in it by everybody else.” “The whole point is that if you add those brighter, more uplifting colors, they definitely do impact how you feel and how other people perceive you,” she added. Eiseman said if you’re feeling like your wardrobe (and your spirit) is a little under-the-weather, the addition of a bright scarf, some colorful jewelry or even vibrant shoes can go a long way. Something else to remember: Despite the fashion industry’s unspoken rule telling us dark tones are meant for fall and winter and bright shades are meant for spring and summer, that isn’t set in stone. “There’s nothing written saying you cannot wear brighter colors in the winter,” fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen told HuffPost. “I think that we should kind of do away with these fashion rules that may not be appropriate for our mental health.”At the end of the day, you should really wear whatever makes you happy. If you want to layer your gray sweater with your black scarf and matching black coat, you should definitely do you.We’re just saying a little pop of color never hurt anybody. "

Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), who resigned last month after it was revealed that he’d urged a woman he was having an affair with to have an abortion.Lamb, 33, is a federal prosecutor and a Marine Corps veteran. He’ll be facing GOP state Rep. Rick Saccone in the March 13 special election.Democratic leaders said 554 county committee members from Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District gathered at a local high school on Sunday to select their candidate in a nominating convention. Lamb won on the second ballot.“This unprecedented convention was held to enable the State Party to hear the voices of the people who live in the 18th Congressional District, and we are thrilled with the outcome,” Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Marcel L. Groen said in a statement.Lamb on Sunday dodged a question about whether he’d support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) if elected to Congress, telling a reporter from The Washington Post that the query is “too soon, and presumptuous.” Republicans effectively made hay of the Democratic leader’s national unpopularity to help them win a special congressional election earlier this year in Georgia. The GOP also prevailed in special congressional elections in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina.While recent Democratic gains in Virginia and New Jersey have raised excitement and expectations within the party, a win in the Western Pennsylvania district will be no easy task. President Donald Trump won it by almost 20 points in last year’s election. Murphy, a prominent anti-abortion congressman, admitted to having an affair with a “personal friend” in September. The woman called him out for his views in a text message after he asked her to have an abortion during an “unfounded pregnancy scare.”While Murphy had initially said he would retire next year at the end of his term, he was quickly pushed out by top Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), in October.This article was updated to more accurately reflect Pelosi’s role in special congressional elections."

I’m not supposed to be here. I am in the final month of my 60th journey around the sun. This wasn’t part of the script.It is not a common thought in the minds of many people who are transgender in this country ― in my mind, the idea of becoming an out, transgender sexagenarian was relegated to categories of fantasy or delusion but is now approaching reality.Whatever shall I do?I will say I have done a little research about what additional restaurants offer a 60+ discount. Applebee’s, Ben & Jerry’s, Village Inn and Subway are on the list. Waffle House (Mondays only) is too. Lots of places start their senior discounts at 55.If I want a Boston Market discount, I’ll need to hang in there for another half-decade. Chick-Fil-A offers a free senior drink, not including coffee (not that I’d ever go there).As an activist who found her activism later in life, I know there are many younger activists who have been doing this longer than I have. I also know when I started doing activism in Kansas, there were few transgender footsteps for me to follow.Today, there are many trans and gender non-conforming (TGNC) activists across the state. Their messages are changing hearts and minds wherever they raise their voices. It does my heart good to see this in ever-increasing numbers.I did not set out to become an activist. I simply knew I could not be silent in the face of oppression and marginalization. Then one day someone referred to me as an activist, and I realized it was true.I don’t plan on slowing down anytime soon. I have provided or participated in more than 50 presentations in 2017. This includes Transgender Faith Tour presentations in Chicago, Illinois; Ft. Worth, Texas; Evansville, Indiana; Kearney, Nebraska; Mankato, Minnesota; and Cedar Falls, Iowa.That said, my activism is changing, and I am trying to learn to find, as I have always tried to do, the places where my activism is most effective.I have identified learning to support and mentor (as well as learn from) these emerging leaders in the TGNC movement, as one of those places where I would like to focus more. The end of legalized discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression will happen more quickly as we bridge the decades of our lifetimes, which do create barriers to our community’s success.My work as a mental health clinician at Valeo Behavioral Health Care in Topeka is both amazingly rewarding and incredibly exhausting, and I do not have the same energy I used to have. Becoming able to provide therapy for transgender and gender non-conforming clients is far beyond anything I would have ever dreamed for.As I begin to experience the realities of being a 60-year-old, transgender human being, it is increasingly impossible to ignore the struggles and obstacles of LGBT senior status.It is also increasingly impossible to live with the diseased targeting of marginalized Americans by the current administration. All of us, from youth to seniors, must unite, stand up, speak out, and refuse to accept this dehumanization of our lives and identities.If it all comes out in the wash, what comes out is this: We are making progress, we are going to win, and we will never stop until we achieve full legal recognition of our right to define our own identities.We have already started discussions within Kansas Statewide Transgender Education Project about creating strategies for building leadership to ensure KSTEP will continue to grow into the future, and continue to make a difference in the lives of TGNC Kansans.Expect an increased focus on helping to build this leadership throughout Kansas, and throughout the United States. Anyone who is interested in learning more about this is encouraged to inquire at info@kstep.org.As for me, I’m not going anywhere. Just getting ready to start my 61st trip around the sun.

Davis, for her part, already has announced plans to seek another term.Davis sparked a media firestorm when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2015 marriage equality ruling. Footage of Ermold and his now-husband, David Moore, engaging in a heated exchange with Davis at a Rowan County municipal office was featured in national news reports as the controversy unfolded.Ermold hinted at his campaign plans on Twitter Nov. 10, stressing that he needed “to get a few things in order” before a formal announcement could be made. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost. Liberty Counsel’s Mat Staver, who represented Davis during the battle over the marriage licenses, told AP his client “doesn’t have any major concerns” about the 2018 election. “She loves her job and she loves the people,” he said.Davis was briefly jailed for contempt of court over her refusal to issue same-sex marriage licenses. She was released under the condition that she not interfere with the issuance of the licenses by deputy county clerks.Having spent much of 2017 out of the public eye, Davis made waves in October when she accompanied the Liberty Counsel’s Harry Mihet on a nine-day trip to Romania with the aim of encouraging that nation’s lawmakers to adopt legislation against same-sex marriage. Mihet, who is a Romanian native, and Davis reportedly held conferences in several cities in an effort to persuade local politicians to support amending the country’s constitutional definition of family, which would, in turn, rule out the possibility of legalizing same-sex marriage. A national referendum on that proposal is expected before year’s end.Catch the latest in LGBTQ news by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter. "
61,POLITICS,Does Trump Support Roy Moore? White House Official Ducks The Question 15 Times.,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marc-short-donald-trump-roy-moore_us_5a119bd4e4b0e97dffedf95d,"Marc Short says the president has ""concerns,"" but won't say whether Trump believes the women alleging sexual misconduct.",2017-11-19,"Marc Short, White House director of legislative affairs, won't say whether Trump believes the women accusing Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore of sexual misconduct.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a119c2e150000331b858d56.jpeg?ops=crop_93_340_3307_1986%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A top White House official on Sunday avoided answering the question ― 15 times ― as to whether President Donald Trump supports Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by seven women.Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that Trump thinks it would be “disqualifying” for Moore if the allegations that he routinely sought sexual relationships with teenage girls are true. But he repeatedly ducked questions about whether Trump thinks the women’s accusations are credible.“Does the president believe them?” Stephanopoulos asked.“We are uncomfortable with the explanations Roy Moore has given to date,” Short said. “At this point, we think, though, it’s best for the people of Alabama that all the information is in front of them for them to make the decision.”“But I’m asking you a direct question on behalf of the president,” Stephanopoulos tried again. “You work for the president. Does the president believe the women or not?”“He has concerns about the accusations, but he is also concerned that these accusations are 38 years old,” Short said. “Roy Moore has been in public service for decades, and the accusations did not arise until a month before the election.”“So you’re not willing to make a yes or no judgment on whether the president believes the women?” Stephanopoulos asked.“I think I have answered your questions three times now,” Short said.“No, you have said you have questions and concerns,” Stephanopoulos replied.This back-and-forth exchange played out a total of 15 times as Stephanopoulos tried to get Short to clarify whether Trump is backing Moore ahead of his Dec. 12 special election against Democrat Doug Jones. At one point, Short said Trump would be campaigning for Moore if he didn’t believe the women. But soon after that he said nobody really knows who is telling the truth.“If dating a 14-year-old ― and you have used the word pedophilia in the past ― is disqualifying, it comes down to a matter of whether or not you believe the women who made that allegation,” Stephanopoulos said.“Sitting here 40 years after the fact, I cannot have any more information to tell you one way or the other,” Short replied. “There are two people who know that: Roy Moore and the accuser.”The White House’s vagueness on whether Trump believes Moore’s accusers puts the president at odds with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who have said they believe the women.Part of the reason it’s tricky for White House officials to talk about the allegations against Moore is because 16 women have accused Trump of sexual assault. The White House’s official position is that they are all lying."

It’s also what you’ll hear from people like Jodi Ray, who is the project director for Florida Covering Kids and Families, a nonprofit that has spearheaded state efforts to get residents health insurance under “Obamacare.”Ray has been there since the program’s beginning, going back to late 2013, when the website didn’t work, and when a combination of plan cancellations and sudden rate hikes sparked an uproar. For a while, it looked like the whole system might just fall apart. It didn’t, of course, and Florida would go on to have some of the largest signup numbers of any state in the country.This year, Ray says, interest in plans seems even stronger. She says she’s seen it at her office and at walk-in enrollment events, like one at the University of South Florida on Wednesday, where a group of “navigators” (the Affordable Care Act’s official enrollment advisors) kept busy with a steady stream of consumers all morning long. Ray has heard similar accounts from her contacts around the state ― including enrollment counselors in the small, rural counties that are traditionally the hardest for organizations like hers to reach. “They said this year, they have been busier than they have ever been, which astonishes me.”The numbers tell a similar story. Through the first two weeks, 1.5 million people signed up for private insurance through HealthCare.gov, the Department of Health and Human Services reported on Wednesday. That’s roughly 50 percent more than last year’s sign-ups after two weeks.States that run their own online marketplaces, such as California and Minnesota, are reporting similar surges. Charles Gaba, the analyst who runs ACAsignups.net, says that he expects sign-ups on HealthCare.gov to pass 2 million over the weekend, with enrollments from state-run marketplaces bringing the national total to around 4 million.But “nobody is calling trends yet,” Ray warns, and it’s easy to see why she is wary. In the past, open enrollment has extended into January. With the much shorter period, accelerated sign-ups are necessary just to hit last year’s mark.Meanwhile, organizations like hers are operating with fewer financial resources, because the Trump administration decided to slash federal support. (Florida’s Covering Kids took a cut of about $900,000, out of a total $5.8 million budget, according to Ray.) Nor can they can count on the usual barrage of national advertising to promote enrollment, because the Trump administration pulled way back on that spending, too.The scaled-back outreach seems especially troubling because Republican efforts to repeal the program appear to have created a great deal of confusion over its status. “We’ve got people calling us and saying they stopped paying their premiums, because they thought it was all gone,” Ray said.Still, the Affordable Care Act has proven surprisingly resilient in the past -– and it may be doing so again, sometimes for reasons that are surprising a lot of experts. A case in point is the way Trump’s most well-publicized effort at sabotage has played out.In October, Trump finally carried out his threat to stop a set of vital payments to insurance companies. By that time, several insurers had already left the market, in no small part because they feared such a move was coming. Those that remained jacked up their premiums. But in most states they did so in a way that shielded some or all of their customers ― and, for a variety of complicated reasons, it means that lower-income consumers are actually getting even more assistance than they would have otherwise.It’s a clumsy solution that hasn’t worked for everybody. The number of upper-middle-class consumers facing high, sometimes unaffordable premiums is going up. And it was already pretty high, for reasons that have as much to do with the program’s design as anything the Trump administration did.But people who make a little less money, and thus qualify for the law’s financial assistance, are generally getting a better deal this year. Either they can spend the same amount of money and get a better plan, or they can keep the same plan and just spend less on it.Online brokers, like HealthSherpa, have noticed a shift ― with average lower premiums coming down and interest in “gold” plans, the more generous alternative to traditional “silver” plans, ticking up. And although its sample is not necessarily representative of the whole, officials at Covered California, that state’s marketplace, reported last week they are seeing the same two trends among their consumers.Strange as it may sound, all the turmoil may be helping too ― or, at least, having more of a mixed effect than everybody was expecting as recently as last month. At another open enrollment on Wednesday, sponsored by the Health Council of South Florida and held in northwest Miami, Jesse Miro, one of the Health Council’s navigators, told HuffPost that confusion over news reports may be prompting more people to ask questions ― and, ultimately, to check out their coverage options online, where they are discovering the deep discounts.Like Ray, Miro said he’s heard of people dropping coverage because they thought the program had ended. But now he’s wondering if the prospect of repeal is having the opposite effect on at least some consumers ― prodding them to sign up, or at least investigate their options, because they think that once they have some insurance it will be easier to hold onto it. “Some seem to think that if they get in now, they’ll get locked in ― end up grandfathered somehow.”Still, the people who work in outreach say that, with less publicity and less funding from Washington, they will have less capacity to help people who are hardest to reach, or whose circumstances are the most complicated.“I have a woman, she and her kids were all uninsured ― one college aged, one high school, she’s a waitress in a restaurant,” Ray said on Wednesday, describing a family with a particularly complex income situation. “We enrolled them yesterday, for first time in years. All she could talk about is scheduling her first appointment for a checkup. She was ecstatic. But analyzing health insurance for her was very involved.”"

It also follows at least eight women recently accusing Ratner of sexual assault.Keri Claussen Khalighi, a fashion model at the time of the alleged 1991 incident, told the Times she met Simmons at a casting call. At some later point, she said she had gone back to Simmon’s New York apartment to watch a music video the men were working on.

Both women are Democrats.“Cantrell has staked her mayoral campaign on providing equality to all the elements of the New Orleans community that were previously shut out ― both in terms of economic opportunity and government contracting opportunities,” said Brian Brox, a political science professor at Tulane University.“The support behind Charbonnet was clearly with the powers that be, and her campaign finance reports reflects that,” Brox added. Cantrell’s election marks the latest in a series of victories for national liberal organizations like the Working Families Party, the local chapter of Indivisible, and Our Revolution, the legacy organization of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. The Working Families Party and Our Revolution played a role this year in electing progressive mayors of Jackson, Mississippi, and Birmingham, Alabama, as well as a city council member in a newly created city outside of Atlanta.In New Orleans, the Working Families Party reached out to some 40,000 voters through text messages, canvassing and phone-banking, according to Joe Dinkin, WFP’s national communications director.“Around the country, and especially in cities across the south, in 2017 we’re seeing outsider candidates who put forward a transformative, progressive vision of making government serve the many and not the few, and voters are rewarding them for it,” Dinkin said in a an email. Cantrell, 45, is also the city’s first non-native mayor in recent history ― and possibly since the city’s inception, according to Brox.“New Orleans has been pretty strong in its preference for native sons and native daughters,” Brox said. “With Cantrell’s election, New Orleans has expanded its pool of potential candidates by showing you no longer have to have graduated high school in the city to be politically viable.” Cantrell grew up in Los Angeles, and moved to New Orleans to attend college at Xavier University of Louisiana. She first gained renown as head of the Broadmoor Improvement Association, where she helped thwart a city plan to raze the neighborhood in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.Cantrell went on to win election to New Orleans’ City Council in 2012. Her biggest accomplishment on the governing body was spearheading the passage of a smoking ban in city bars, restaurants and casinos, which took effect in April 2015.Ahead of last month’s nonpartisan primary, Cantrell picked up endorsements from the Working Families Party and local social justice groups like Step Up Louisiana, thanks to her support for a $15 minimum wage and her ambitious criminal justice reform policies. (Indivisible and Our Revolution got behind Cantrell during the runoff.)Although Louisiana law bars New Orleans from raising its minimum wage above that of the state, Cantrell has said she would lobby the state legislature to change that law, and that in the meantime she would support making it the minimum for city employees.Cantrell’s proposals for criminal justice reform include creating a job training and temporary employment program for released criminals and underprivileged young people. She has said she would also seek greater discretion in the prosecution of nonviolent crime.After placing first in the primary, Cantrell picked up the support of third-place finisher and former Civil District Court Judge Michael Bagneris and fourth-place finisher Troy Henry. (Outgoing Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat who is term-limited after eight years at the helm, did not endorse in the race.) Boosted by a wealth of endorsements, Cantrell led Charbonnet by a comfortable margin in several pre-election polls. Cantrell did not walk back any of her progressive positions during the runoff, but she focused on a more consensus-driven message on the stump. The turn in Cantrell’s rhetoric led The Advocate to declare in a Sunday analysis that “only in the fine points” is one able to notice the differences between the two candidates.“She ran a frontrunner’s campaign in the runoff, trying not to lose the support she already had,” Brox said.Notwithstanding progressive excitement over Cantrell’s victory, the race was fundamentally about local issues, such as cleaning up the city’s Sewerage and Water Board and addressing violent crime. New Orleans has one of the highest murder rates of any big city. Particularly when it comes to making the city safer, Cantrell is likely to embrace short-term solutions, like an increased police presence, that are not exactly known to delight liberals, according to Brox.“I don’t see a ton of ideological difference between Cantrell and Charbonnet,” Brox said. “And Cantrell is going to be constrained to some degree by the City Council and the district attorney, who favors a tough-on-crime approach.”This story has been updated to include Dinkin’s comments.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified the former civil district court judge who ran in the primary as Charles Bagneris.

This year’s Turkey Trot took place on Oct. 14.Though the fall festival includes many events, it’s best known for the “turkey drop,” in which live turkeys are dropped from a plane 500 feet in the air. Festivalgoers chase and catch the surviving turkeys. Last year, a dozen turkeys were dropped and two died on impact, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.This year, several turkeys were dropped and there were no apparent reports of turkey deaths.Even if the turkeys survive, however, the noise of the plane and the drop itself would be terrifying, Yvonne Vizzier Thaxton, a poultry science professor, said last year.The FAA spokesman explained to HuffPost that the agency has no power when it comes to animal welfare issues.“Our regulations only cover ‘objects,’ and specify that they can be dropped from aircraft as long as they don’t pose a danger to people or property on the ground,” he said. “In this case, investigators determined that the pilot did not violate FAA safety regulations because the turkeys were dropped over a creek and a park, well away from crowds at the festival.”He noted that local and state officials would be the ones to address any animal cruelty issues. Unfortunately for the turkeys, it doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen anytime soon.Marion County Sheriff Clinton Evans told the Democrat-Gazette this week that Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Kenford Carter would not be pursuing any charges related to the turkey drop."

Chris Mutsvangwa, who has been leading a campaign to oust Mugabe, told Reuters in a text message moments after Mugabe finished his speech that people would take to the streets of Harare on Wednesday.Mugabe, the only leader the southern African nation has known since independence from Britain in 1980, was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa, the deputy he sacked this month in a move that triggered the mid-week intervention by the army.In scenes unthinkable just a week ago, the announcement drew cheers from the 200 delegates packed into ZANU-PF’s Harare headquarters to seal the fate of Mugabe, whose support has crumbled in the four days since the army seized power.Mugabe was given until noon (5.00 a.m. ET) on Monday to resign or face impeachment, an ignominious end to the career of the “Grand Old Man” of African politics who was once feted across the continent as an anti-colonial liberation hero.Even in the West, he was renowned in his early years as the “Thinking Man’s Guerrilla”, an ironic nickname for a man who would later proudly declare he held a “degree in violence”.As the economy crumbled and political opposition to his rule grew in the late 1990s, Mugabe seized thousands of white-owned farms, detained opponents and unleashed security forces to crush dissent.When the vote was announced, war veterans leader Chris Mutsvangwa, who has spearheaded an 18-month campaign to remove a man he openly described as a “dictator”, embraced colleagues and shouted: “The President is gone. Long live the new President.”Mugabe’s 52-year-old wife Grace, who had harbored ambitions of succeeding her husband, was also expelled from ZANU-PF, along with at least three cabinet ministers who had formed the backbone of her “G40” political faction.Speaking before the meeting, Mutsvangwa said Mugabe, who has so far resisted calls to quit, was running out of time to negotiate his departure and should leave the country while he could. “He’s trying to bargain for a dignified exit,” he said.If Mugabe refused to go, “we will bring back the crowds and they will do their business,” Mutsvangwa told reporters.Mnangagwa, a former state security chief known as “The Crocodile,” is expected to head an interim post-Mugabe unity government that will focus on rebuilding ties with the outside world and stabilizing an economy in freefall.The next presidential election is due in 2018.On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Harare, singing, dancing and hugging soldiers in an outpouring of elation at Mugabe’s expected overthrow.His stunning downfall is likely to send shockwaves across Africa, where a number of entrenched strongmen, from Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni to Democratic Republic of Congo’s Joseph Kabila, are facing mounting pressure to step down.“READY TO DIE”On Saturday, men, women and children ran alongside the armored cars and troops who stepped in to target what the army called “criminals” in Mugabe’s inner circle.Meanwhile, the man himself remained under house arrest in his lavish “Blue Roof” compound, watching the support from his party, security services and people evaporate.Speaking from a secret location in South Africa, his nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, told Reuters Mugabe and his wife were “ready to die for what is correct” rather than step down in order to legitimize what he described as a coup.Zhuwao, who was also sanctioned by ZANU-PF, did not answer his phone on Sunday. However, Mugabe’s son Chatunga railed against those who had pushed out his father.Despite the euphoria, some Mugabe opponents are uneasy about the prominent role played by the military, and fear Zimbabwe might be swapping one army-backed autocrat for another, rather than allowing the people to choose their next leader.“The real danger of the current situation is that having got their new preferred candidate into State House, the military will want to keep him or her there, no matter what the electorate wills,” former education minister David Coltart said."

A coalition of Asian-American organizations were rallying to push Congress to pass the legislation that would protect young undocumented immigrants. The 19 individuals were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, a spokesperson for U.S. Capitol Police told HuffPost.Those arrested said they were prepared to face the consequences to defend the rights of the undocumented community. “I stood with my sisters and brothers to be arrested today because the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community can no longer stand idly by while Congress and the Trump administration criminalize immigrants and people of color,” Luisa Blue, who was one of those arrested and is a founding member of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA), told HuffPost. The people arrested, who were reportedly blocking Ryan’s office, were released the same day.APALA is part of the coalition, the AAPI Immigrant Organizing Table, as are the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium and the HANA Center, among others. They were demanding a “clean” Dream Act, which would provide a pathway for Dreamers to obtain citizenship without adding measures that would harm other immigrants.The push for the Dream Act, a longstanding wish of immigration reformers, has grown all the stronger since the Trump administration announced it would terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program back in September. DACA was shielding some 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Some 21,000 of the 154,000 who were eligible to renew their DACA protections at least one more time were not able to do so by the Oct. 5 deadline.Congress now has until March 2018 to find some other way to protect those young people from being deported.While most Dreamers hail from Latin American countries, there were many Asian-Americans who were eligible for DACA as well. Some 16,000 undocumented Asian youth were shielded by the Obama-era program. And currently, there are about 1.7 million undocumented Asian immigrants in the U.S. The group represents the fastest growing demographic among undocumented immigrants. "
