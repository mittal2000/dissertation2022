3,ARTS & CULTURE,An Exhaustive List Of Art Projects Threatened By The Proposed NEA Cuts,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/list-of-nea-funded-projects_us_588a242ee4b061cf898d3c59,Artist Tega Brain created a website that lists what could be lost if arts funding dies.,2017-01-27,"A detail from artist Barbara Kruger's ""The future belongs to those who can see it"" at the National Gallery of Art on September 28, 2016 in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588a52af17000025002d8b46.jpeg?cache=wEt0HNZnYc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In response to reports that President Donald Trump would like to slash national arts funding, artist Tega Brain has created a simple and effective website that celebrates the creative projects those plans threaten.Head to neafunded.us and you’ll find a scrolling list of art projects funded by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in 2016 alone. From a playwriting competition in Atlanta, Georgia, to a poetry series in Kansas City, Missouri, to a film festival in Cleveland, Ohio, to music education in Las Vegas, Nevada, the seemingly never-ending scroll ― based on the latest NEA grant report ― highlights the kinds of endeavors states could lose if arts funding dies.In an email to The Huffington Post, Brain, an Australian-born, New York-based artist who specializes in “eccentric engineering,” explained that she created the website after learning that the current administration reportedly intends to close the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) amidst a larger push to slash government budgets.“It is an animated list of the incredibly wide range of arts projects and community arts organizations that receive some support through the NEA,” she wrote, noting that many of the highlighted projects on her website are not located in big urban cultural centers.“It is part of NEA’s mandate to support practices in all parts of the United States,” Brain added. “It’s well known in the art world that you’re more likely to get NEA support in remote places over city areas.”NEA funding, which makes up a fraction of one percent of the federal budget, is not only used to support artists, actors and musicians, but also producers, designers, lighting crews, cultural spaces and venues, catering companies, accountants and more, Brain reiterated.“Think about how many people you know whose job has something to do with the arts,” she said. “This is relevant to us all ... you can’t help but be struck by the range of different communities involved and by the dozens or more people that each of these small grants would benefit or employ.”According to The Independent, a White House petition to save arts funding is still not registering signatures. Only 97 signatures showed up as of the publication of this piece, and the link for reporting issues leads to an error page.When asked what advice she could offer to people who wish to get involved in advocating for or preserving the NEA, Brain replied:Do real activism. Bring people together who are concerned with this issue, or, connect with existing activist groups and initiatives who could become invested in this issue. If you are not sure how to do this, the Indivisible Guide or the Center for Artistic Activism webinar series on art and activism are good places to start. Eat together, talk and figure out ways to express dissent. Think of either the most powerful person in the arts who you know, or someone who is close to the NEA and get them onboard. Work with them to find ways to act that go beyond just being vocal on the internet. Disrupt and make this issue heard. Check out an abbreviated list of projects featured on Brain’s website below. "
4,WOMEN,You Call Us Malcontents And Dissidents Like It's A Bad Thing,"Tasha Withrow, ContributorJust an awkward tattooed girl from Appalachia trying to make it.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/you-call-us-malcontents-and-dissidents-like-its-a_us_588b67e9e4b02d07f20d91f2,A few friends of mine and I attended the Women’s March in D.C. on the 21st and it was one of the most empowering experiences,2017-01-27,"<p>Women’s March, Washington, D.C. January 21, 2017. At the White House.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588b771e17000024002d8d7c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few friends of mine and I attended the Women’s March in D.C. on the 21st and it was one of the most empowering experiences I’ve had the pleasure to be a part of. I haven’t been to a large protest since Bush’s second inauguration in January of 2005, so it’s been quite a while since I really felt like I was a part of something that was trying to ignite change. Throughout the day I continued to be amazed as to how many people were there and seeing the oceans of people gave me goosebumps. Finally, I thought enough people were getting pissed off and ready to stand up for what we felt was important and right. And I wasn’t completely wrong, there ended up being millions of people marching all over the world. But then came the naysayers. Men and women alike. I expected some resistance over the march, but not to the caliber of which it hit. What has bothered me more is the amount of women attacking other women and denouncing any and sometimes all affiliations with other women and or “feminism”. There were women who came forward to tell us that we do not represent them and that the march was not their march. They have every right to feel that way, and it is because of men and women of past generations marching over and over that they are afforded that opinion and ability to express it. Because before, we had to ask permission to speak such things.Without resistance and without dissent, we wouldn’t have the ability to express our individual thoughts. So for that, I say thank you to the women (and men) before me that continued to march and not back down. I say thank you to the naysayers, who give us even more of a reason to continue to push back and give us more passion to fight. You are what fuels us. I am under no illusion that things are better than what they were decades ago. I also know that we still have a lot of work to do. Institutional sexism and racism are still thriving and creating hurdles for millions of Americans. You don’t have to believe it for it to be true or not, it’s there and it’s happening. It’s a matter of opening your eyes and your mind to new perceptions and the world around you. Just because you haven’t personally experienced it, or because those around you in your small little world haven’t experienced it, doesn’t mean that it isn’t real and that it isn’t happening. I’m grateful that there are women in our country that have never had to experience the things that millions of people marched for last weekend, and will continue to march for. I am also grateful that women here do not experience many of the atrocities that women in the developing world endure. But that does not mean I don’t have reasons to fight for what is right here and it doesn’t mean that there aren’t things here that need to be addressed and fixed. I live here and if we have the opportunity to make life better HERE, then we should. But I digress....Lastly, as many women have said before, I refuse to apologize for my behavior and I refuse to conform to what you feel like we should be doing. I refuse to fit in your little box of what a woman is supposed to be. I refuse to not say the word FUCK or PUSSY because you feel like it isn’t lady like. For too long we have stood to the side and allowed others to tell us how to act, how to speak, and to smile more often. Well, FUCK THAT.I have heard over and over again since last weekend that the signs and how women were dressed were “so inappropriate and vulgar” that it took away from the message of the march. I keep hearing about the speech Madonna and Ashley Judd gave, but I haven’t heard a thing about the speech Angela Davis gave. I don’t hear about the signs being held up that represented real problems that women, people of color, the LGBT community, Muslims, and other disenfranchised human beings experience on a daily basis. All I’ve heard is the fact that people are offended over the word fuck and a couple people dressed as vaginas. And I think that’s because you don’t want to focus on the real problem and you don’t want to admit that there is a problem. I wrote an article before the march outlining a few reasons why I would be attending, and I feel like that list has grown exponentially. Just in the first week of his presidency, Donald Trump has signed executive orders and verbalized plans that have instilled fear into so many different communities around the country. And that’s just the beginning. If you have a few minutes to gaze at some of the bills that have been introduced and are awaiting votes from the house and senate, do so. It’s pretty scary. Unless of course, “1984” and “Fahrenheit 451” are examples of how you want society to be. Because that’s where we’re headed. The Women’s March has turned into much more than just a march for women. It’s meaning and purpose has spread beyond women’s rights and has become a movement for all human rights. All the things that we have accomplished in this country, can be attributed to civil disobedience and people refusing to accept the status quo. Protesting and dissent it what this country owes its existence to. And even if you don’t feel like we have valid reasons to do so, I do, and so many others do as well. And we will continue to fight for you. No one is free, until everyone is free. If the last week has been any kind of indicator of what’s to come, I truly believe that we have started something. I feel in my heart that people are finally getting pissed off and are refusing to accept things as they are. Things are happening, people of this country are mobilizing, and we are standing together to fight back.In closing, I will say this to those who feel you do not need represented:I will continue to fight for women and minority women to have equal pay among their male counterparts.I will continue to fight for women (and men) to have access to health care, and have SAFE access to reproductive health care, that is not restricted based on a politician’s religious views. I refuse to allow a group of rich men regulate a body part that they do not have.I will continue to fight for women (and men) who have been sexually assaulted to have the courage to come forward knowing that their offender will face appropriate consequences, and not have to experience what I and so many other people have of being told to get over it, no one will believe you, or it was your fault anyways. I will continue to fight for the LGBT community to maintain their right to love and marry who they want and to be treated fairly under the law. And for the trans community, to have the right to be who they are without judgment and segregation. I will continue to fight for people of color, that are jailed, murdered, and restricted from opportunities at a much higher rate compared to their white counterparts.I will continue to fight for my friends that are not of this country or the Christian faith, that have been treated as the enemy or less than, and have continued to endure prejudice and threats of displacement and separation from their friends and families. I will continue to fight for the poor, who are constantly overlooked and demonized as people who have caused their fates, and no matter how hard they try they cannot escape the perpetual cycle of institutional poverty. And lastly, I will continue to fight for YOU. So that you may continue to experience life without the obstacles some of us have come to and may continue to hit over and over. Also so that you may continue to express your dissatisfaction with us and your distaste for our vulgar language and behavior. Not everyone walks the same path, and not everyone is afforded the same abilities to get where they want to be.I will continue to fight for compassion and empathy, because we are all human, and it’s time to prove it."

An issue that captured the attention and hearts of people across the planet is about to heat up again. Your participation will make our universal call to protect sacred waters more beautiful and powerful. No matter where we stand politically, water should be something we can all agree on as a common source of life for us and the crops that feed us. The youth and elders of Standing Rock have shown us a prayerful and positive way to oppose this pipeline which puts at risk the water supply for up to 20 million Americans. This Saturday there is a broadcast from Standing Rock to accompany global events expressing a positive message called Global Prayer Action.“When we strive to make our lives, every thought, word and action, a living Wopida, we are given a great spiritual gift. For whenever our soul and the inmost chambers of our heart are filled with thanksgiving and gratitude it also naturally becomes filled with compassion, love, understanding, forgiveness, joy, happiness and oneness. When our lives are centered in this State of Consciousness, there is no room left for the experience of fear, hate, prejudice, revenge, jealousy, loneliness and disunity. There is no room for anything that separates ourselves and our oneness with our Beloved Creator, our Human Family and all Life, seen and unseen.” – Hereditary Chief, Phil Lane Jr.This is a nonpartisan issue and many of us knew to expect this battle to heat up again at Standing Rock and across the planet as people awaken to the simple idea that some things, like water, the soil and air, living beings, and ancient cultures are worth more than profit-driven bottom lines. Obama had tucked a legal framework in TPP called ISDS (Investor State Dispute Settlement) that would allow foreign corporations and investors to sue our country if we stood in the way of their projected profits. Having already purchased the pipeline for Keystone XL, these companies had no plans to let that investment become a loss, same is true for Dakota Access Pipeline. So this is not a time to point fingers at Trump, it is time to recognize that this unfolding drama was inevitable regardless of who won last Novembers election. Instead it is a time to unite across political divides for something that is bigger than us, something that will effect coming generations, and that is the much needed shift away from a fossil fuel powered society.We all use cars, so none is above the other in this discussion. We stand at a crossroads, in a circle, despite our differences to bring about a healthy evolution to our global community. This is a time for celebration with an acknowledgement that compassion and love will be the best tools at our disposal to make this a gentle and peaceful transition.“It was so beautiful to see so many people of so many different faiths, different tribes, different skin colors, different creeds all coming together unified. I have never seen anything like that in my life and I’ve been a part of many amazing movements. I am so grateful for that!” -Victory Lonnquist, Standing Rock Medic Global Wopida Audio BrodacastAt the Global Prayer Action website you can register a local event on the interactive map or find other events currently planned for your area. There will be a live webcast at 12pm CST which you can also receive information about. These webcasts are cultural gems, with wisdom from various indigenous leaders, youth, and more and you can listen to previous live broadcasts here (note, because these were recorded live, the program usually starts about 20-30 seconds after you hit play)People will be showing up at local banks who have funded the pipeline with drums, banners, and their loved ones to send a message:“Bankers, we understand that all of us our stuck in this same system that harms our planet but each of us have the power and responsibility to do our part to make positive change. Invest in renewables!”As we quickly approach a time where renewables are more profitable than dirty fossil fuels, and the risk to investors and the environment becomes more costly we will begin a long-awaited transition. Recently the City of Seattle agreed to divest nearly $3 billion from Wells Fargo for their support of Dakota Access Pipeline. Another way that you can participate is by sharing your opinion with the Army Corps of Engineers while public input is welcome at this link.The front lines are everywhere and Standing Rock is not the only place facing threats to their water. What began in 2016 is becoming a global movement in 2017. Honor the sacred and protect what you love, we are all in this together. Please join us this Saturday for Global Prayer Action."
6,POLITICS,Exxon Mobil Actually Put A Climate Scientist On Its Board Of Directors,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-mobil-susan-avery_us_588a409be4b061cf898d6e35,"But for environmentalists, this may be too little too late.",2017-01-26,Environmentalists are skeptical of Exxon Mobil's move. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588a42f31700002f001d0954.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exxon Mobil Corp. has added an atmospheric scientist to its board, likely in a move to counter its image as a hard-line skeptic of climate change research. Susan Avery, 67, the former president of the Massachusetts-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, was elected Wednesday to become the company’s 13th director on the board. A respected scientist who spent years researching atmospheric variability, she starts on Feb. 1.Her election could mark a turning point for the Texas-based oil giant, which spent more than a decade funding a Big Tobacco-style disinformation campaign to undermine the growing scientific consensus on global warming. When that failed, Exxon Mobil scaled back funding for the most egregious climate science deniers and acknowledged that the climate is changing. It even publicly backed a tax on carbon in 2009 and the Paris climate accord last year. But the company continued to pay millions to proxy groups and lawmakers who fought regulations on carbon emissions. It scored below all its U.S. and European rivals in a recent ranking of oil majors’ readiness to deal with global warming. It also refused to disclose risks to its business posed by climate change, despite a high-profile shareholder revolt last May in which investors demanded more detailed financial reports.Appointing Avery to the board may help appease some dissident shareholders, including institutional investors like the California Public Employees Retirement System, New York City’s pension funds and the Church of England’s endowment.“Making sure you actually bring on a director with expertise in climate change, we think that’s a first step,” said Veena Ramani, who leads the corporate governance program at the Boston-based shareholder advocacy group Ceres. “This is all about decision-making, so we need more than one person who has the competence to think about these issues.”But unless Exxon Mobil’s new chairman and chief executive, Darren Woods, gives Avery ample room to reshape the company’s climate strategy, her job could prove difficult, according to Karina Litvack, an independent director on the board of the Italian oil giant Eni.“Figuring out how to translate an understanding of the science into practical business objectives, with a clear roadmap, timelines, capex budgets and so on ― that is the really tough job that requires a combination of business acumen, climate awareness and exceptional leadership,” Litvack, who spoke as an expert in corporate governance and climate change but declined to comment on behalf of Eni, told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “This is where the role of the chairman and CEO makes all the difference.”The oil and gas business is built on bets that could take decades to yield profit. Oil companies deduct the current cost of digging a well from their tax bills, then speculate on how much they can sell the extracted crude for in the years to come. Those predictions fail to factor in what could happen to oil prices if, say, major economies like the United States or China put a tax on carbon emissions or apply strict rules to the use of fossil fuels to combat climate change. That leads to risky bets. For example, Exxon Mobil invested heavily in Canadian tar sands, a particularly dirty type of fuel extracted from a mix of sand, clay and a thick, viscous oil called bitumen. Tar sands account for about 35 percent of the company’s liquid holdings, up from 17 percent a decade ago, according to InsideClimate News. Some analysts now expect Exxon Mobil to write down the value of those assets during its fourth quarter earnings call on Monday. The company, hobbled by persistently low oil prices, conceded in October that it may have to do so. “You can tie this back to governance, actually,” said Shanna Cleveland, who directs work on energy companies at Ceres. “Nobody on the board was apparently asking them, ‘Is it reasonable to be putting so much money and growth strategy into oil sands?’ They’re expensive, dirty and have a long time frame of operating before you start to get any returns.” Neither Exxon Mobil nor Avery responded to requests for comment. Still, Avery’s election failed to impress environmentalists, who pointed to blockbuster reports in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times that Exxon Mobil understood the effects of global warming decades ago but covered up the evidence anyway. A coalition of state attorneys general opened fraud investigations into corporations that conceal climate risk, including Exxon Mobil. The company vehemently denied the allegations and insisted that the probe was politically motivated. This month, a Massachusetts judge ordered the firm to hand over decades of documents related to its views on climate change.“This is a little late in the game, considering Exxon has known about climate change since the 1970s,” Jamie Henn, spokesman for the environmental campaigning nonprofit 350.org, said in a statement. “It’s hard to believe this is little more than a PR stunt meant to pave over the decades the company spent deceiving the public about the crisis.”“We wouldn’t have given Philip Morris a pass for putting a doctor on their board, and we aren’t going to let Exxon off the hook either,” Henn added. “Exxon lied, people died, and they must be held accountable.”This article has been updated to include comment from Karina Litvack."

Susan Avery, 67, the former president of the Massachusetts-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, was elected Wednesday to become the company’s 13th director on the board. A respected scientist who spent years researching atmospheric variability, she starts on Feb. 1.Her election could mark a turning point for the Texas-based oil giant, which spent more than a decade funding a Big Tobacco-style disinformation campaign to undermine the growing scientific consensus on global warming. When that failed, Exxon Mobil scaled back funding for the most egregious climate science deniers and acknowledged that the climate is changing. It even publicly backed a tax on carbon in 2009 and the Paris climate accord last year. But the company continued to pay millions to proxy groups and lawmakers who fought regulations on carbon emissions. It scored below all its U.S. and European rivals in a recent ranking of oil majors’ readiness to deal with global warming. It also refused to disclose risks to its business posed by climate change, despite a high-profile shareholder revolt last May in which investors demanded more detailed financial reports.Appointing Avery to the board may help appease some dissident shareholders, including institutional investors like the California Public Employees Retirement System, New York City’s pension funds and the Church of England’s endowment.“Making sure you actually bring on a director with expertise in climate change, we think that’s a first step,” said Veena Ramani, who leads the corporate governance program at the Boston-based shareholder advocacy group Ceres. “This is all about decision-making, so we need more than one person who has the competence to think about these issues.”But unless Exxon Mobil’s new chairman and chief executive, Darren Woods, gives Avery ample room to reshape the company’s climate strategy, her job could prove difficult, according to Karina Litvack, an independent director on the board of the Italian oil giant Eni.“Figuring out how to translate an understanding of the science into practical business objectives, with a clear roadmap, timelines, capex budgets and so on ― that is the really tough job that requires a combination of business acumen, climate awareness and exceptional leadership,” Litvack, who spoke as an expert in corporate governance and climate change but declined to comment on behalf of Eni, told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “This is where the role of the chairman and CEO makes all the difference.”The oil and gas business is built on bets that could take decades to yield profit. Oil companies deduct the current cost of digging a well from their tax bills, then speculate on how much they can sell the extracted crude for in the years to come. Those predictions fail to factor in what could happen to oil prices if, say, major economies like the United States or China put a tax on carbon emissions or apply strict rules to the use of fossil fuels to combat climate change. That leads to risky bets. For example, Exxon Mobil invested heavily in Canadian tar sands, a particularly dirty type of fuel extracted from a mix of sand, clay and a thick, viscous oil called bitumen. Tar sands account for about 35 percent of the company’s liquid holdings, up from 17 percent a decade ago, according to InsideClimate News. Some analysts now expect Exxon Mobil to write down the value of those assets during its fourth quarter earnings call on Monday. The company, hobbled by persistently low oil prices, conceded in October that it may have to do so. “You can tie this back to governance, actually,” said Shanna Cleveland, who directs work on energy companies at Ceres. “Nobody on the board was apparently asking them, ‘Is it reasonable to be putting so much money and growth strategy into oil sands?’ They’re expensive, dirty and have a long time frame of operating before you start to get any returns.” Neither Exxon Mobil nor Avery responded to requests for comment. Still, Avery’s election failed to impress environmentalists, who pointed to blockbuster reports in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times that Exxon Mobil understood the effects of global warming decades ago but covered up the evidence anyway. A coalition of state attorneys general opened fraud investigations into corporations that conceal climate risk, including Exxon Mobil. The company vehemently denied the allegations and insisted that the probe was politically motivated. This month, a Massachusetts judge ordered the firm to hand over decades of documents related to its views on climate change.“This is a little late in the game, considering Exxon has known about climate change since the 1970s,” Jamie Henn, spokesman for the environmental campaigning nonprofit 350.org, said in a statement. “It’s hard to believe this is little more than a PR stunt meant to pave over the decades the company spent deceiving the public about the crisis.”“We wouldn’t have given Philip Morris a pass for putting a doctor on their board, and we aren’t going to let Exxon off the hook either,” Henn added. “Exxon lied, people died, and they must be held accountable.”This article has been updated to include comment from Karina Litvack."

Despite living in Pakistan for the past 17 years, she has been unable to properly learn Urdu and remains confined to her native Pashto. As a member of the transgender community, language is just one of the barriers she faces.“I never learned Urdu because I rarely go out of the small world we have created for ourselves [to stay safe],” she says in Pashto.Gulalai left Afghanistan when she was only eight years old. Now a shy 25-year-old, she speaks only when spoken to.Whatever the constraints of her life in Pakistan, she is certain that it offers a better future than her birth country, to which Pakistan is coercing waves of former refugees to return.Only fragments of memory remain from Gulalai’s childhood somewhere in the suburbs of the capital, Kabul. She was born a boy but realized as a small child that she was meant to be a girl. Her parents were determined she would grow up to be a “man,” and when she failed to live up to this, they beat her.The punishments were harsh and relentless. Aged eight, she found the courage to run away. From Kabul she made her way to Jalalabad, where she found some protection from others in what we would now know as the transgender community.All that is left from her family memories are some pain and wistful thoughts of her lost younger brother. She remembers him having a limp, but cannot recall his name. “I always wonder what happened to him,” she says.Once in Pakistan, she was introduced to someone she was told was a guru – an elder in the transgender community – who took her in. Like so many trans youngsters, she grew into one of the only professions open to her, that of a dancer.“Most of the transgender people are either thrown out or run away from their homes at an early age,” says Farzana Jan, a transgender activist whose home in Peshawar is a meeting point for the community. One of the leaders of rights group Trans Action Alliance, based in the capital of KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) province, she explains the bind that Gulalai and others are in: “They neither get formal education nor any professional training. So they can’t get into a profession deemed respectable by the rest of society.”Among those who do not become dancers, Farzana says, many find work on Dalazak Road, Peshawar’s red-light district. Dancers are in demand for public events such as weddings, and Gulalai remembers how she shook with fear on her first outings.“I realized that I would have to dance in order to survive because my guru expected me to earn money. We are often teased, groped and abused by men.”However, even this precarious life is now under threat.Pakistan is determined to send Afghan refugees back, after a string of terror attacks blamed on Afghan insurgents. Many Afghans face police harassment in Pakistan and have elected reluctantly to return. But even this option is complicated for Gulalai.“I’m neither an Afghan national nor a Pakistani national,” she says, her face wrinkling into tears.Gulalai’s estrangement from her family means she has no record of her birth or paperwork to support her Afghan citizenship. Unable to prove her Afghan nationality, she has not been registered by authorities in Pakistan as a refugee.When a deadline was announced for Afghans to leave Pakistan, many transgender refugees turned to Farzana Jan for help and advice. “I told them I would try my best, but even then, I knew I couldn’t do much,” she says.Life without papers is claustrophobic for Gulalai. She cannot travel to other cities without an I.D. card to show at the security checkpoints; this also prevents her from something as straightforward as having a cellphone registered in her name.“I can’t have a SIM [card] in my name because I’m not registered in the Pakistani government’s database.”Gulalai shudders at the notion of going back to Afghanistan. Like all members of the trans community, she has heard the horrific tales of violence in the country of her childhood.“We have received several videos of violence against the transgender community in Afghanistan,” says Farzana. “In many areas of Afghanistan, the body parts of transgender people are chopped off before they are killed.”She relates the story of one transgender Afghan refugee who left Pakistan three years ago. “She started dancing at weddings in Jalalabad [in eastern Afghanistan], but was soon arrested by the police because it’s forbidden to do so.”“She’s still stuck in an Afghan jail where she’s forced to live in the men’s section, often getting harassed and abused.”The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), which is facilitating the return of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, has faced criticism for legitimizing what critics say amounts to forced returns.Duniya Aslam Khan, the UNHCR spokesperson in Pakistan, says the agency is aware of fears among the Afghan trans community and would make them a priority: “Transgender people are more than welcome to contact us to discuss their issues. We understand their issues and are very sensitive toward them.”Trans Action Alliance says they have repeatedly approached the UNHCR for help in registering stateless transgender refugees, but received no response.Gulalai’s fears are shared by Sapna, a 22-year-old transgender Afghan who identifies as male, who came to Pakistan with his parents in the 1980s. Sapna is a self-taught tailor and embroiderer, but has struggled to find work in Peshawar.He says that he survives thanks to the close bonds of the trans community, some of whom bring their clothes to him to repair. Like Gulalai, Sapna is stateless – a citizen of neither Pakistan nor Afghanistan.“In other countries, if you were born and lived there for 10 years you could acquire their nationality but not in Pakistan,” he complains. “I don’t want to go back to Afghanistan and get butchered there.

She spoke with The WorldPost in Zurich earlier this week in the wake of Donald Trump’s inauguration and a conference of European nationalist leaders.Last weekend the far-right populist parties in Europe met together for the first time in Koblenz, Germany to coordinate their efforts. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the anti-immigrant National Front in France, said it was Europe’s time to “wake up” and follow President Donald Trump’s example in the United States. Do you see populists gaining power in continental Europe over the coming years, as they have in the U.S. and Britain? Is that a greater danger than in the U.S.?After decades of accelerating globalization, whether we like it or not, we are all deeply, irretrievably interconnected. Amongst other things, this implies that populists in one part of the world will embolden populists in another part of the world. Tribalist demagogues ― who passionately preach that we all belong in our own tribes and that we will be safer if we are surrounded by sameness ― in one country will lift the morale of tribalist demagogues elsewhere.Even so, I am far more concerned about the rise of populism across Europe than the rise of populism in the U.S. Here in the old continent, there is almost a visceral fear of diversity and “the other.” This is all the more noticeable as you travel from major cities into the countryside. The cognitive and cultural gap between Europe’s cities and rural Europe is a subject that oddly escaped the attention of the European bureaucratic elite for a long, long time. This was a big mistake.We must never lose sight of the fact that ultra-nationalism and xenophobia have a longer, darker history on this side of the Atlantic. And we need to bear in mind that this history is still alive in a fractured, fragmented and uneven continent where we do not always encounter the checks and balances that exist in the U.S. Constitution. So, yes, it is a “wake up” call. But not for the tribalists. It is a wake-up call for democrats and liberals and cosmopolitans, for anyone and everyone who holds democracy and pluralism dear. It is a wake-up call for us.Might the considerable benefits of the welfare state on the European continent be a break in the kind of populism we’ve seen in U.S. and Britain? In the U.S. and Britain, there is a big dose of anti-government sentiment. While European populists despise the EU bureaucrats in Brussels, they are not anti-government in their own nations.The welfare state used to be one of the pillars of the post-World War II liberal order and liberal discourse. But today, that, too, is changing. In Scandinavian countries, for instance, the far-right has been presenting itself as the champion of the working classes. Remember how the Sweden Democrats used a striking message in their election campaign: choose between mass migration and welfare! Health care, school system, pensions ― issues that hitherto social democrats were best known for ― are now being voiced by the far-right in Europe. This shift is dangerous and it will have repercussions. It will expand the populists’ electoral base.But Europe is a patchwork, and there are lots of conflicting voices across the continent with regards to the welfare state, even among the populists. This is not surprising given that populism is not and has never been a coherent ideology. It is an eclectic, shifty rhetoric that can appear under different forms depending on the country and the audience it wishes to address. There is also a considerable number of “welfare chauvinists” who want to strictly restrict welfare benefits to a privileged native class or social group and make a point of excluding everyone else. This, too, is a winning argument these days. When we speak of cultural pluralism and diversity today we tend to mean it in a cosmopolitan sense, of multiple identities in a globalized world. Yet, the cultural nationalism we see today in Europe is cast as a defense of diversity of distinct historical cultures against the tide of integration and immigrants from elsewhere. How do you balance belonging with the interdependence of plural identities? In so many ways, the political history of the world can be read as a nonstop swinging pendulum. As humanity we seem to love to swing from one extreme to the other. An absolute universalism was problematic in the way in which it erased cultural, ethnic, linguistic diversity. The opposite, cultural relativism, was also problematic. Many misogynistic practices, such as FGM [female genital mutilation] or child brides, were defended in the name of “cultural relativism.” So I am critical of both extremes.Progressive humanism is something else altogether. It is a system of thought that gives prime importance not to ethnicity or race or sex or class or religion, but to human beings per se. It is a way of connecting with fellow human beings across boundaries by both recognizing diversity, plurality and differences, and at the same time insisting on shared universal values and the need for coexistence. Of course, people need to belong in communities and it is not only understandable, but also beautiful to have a sense of cultural belonging, a love for one’s motherland.The British philosopher Isaiah Berlin was very critical of some liberals who never understood the value of this.

The Egyptian single mother, now 27, was living with her family in the U.S. when her husband Amir raped her. She pressed charges and he spent a month in prison, but he was then released when her family convinced her to drop the charges. After she returned to Egypt to file for a divorce, Amir followed her back to the country and abducted their only son Kareem, then three years old, and kept him hidden in a beach town in Sinai for three months. When Hanna got her son back and continued to push for the divorce, Amir put a knife to her throat.Eventually, in 2014, a judge granted Hanna a divorce, but said that because Amir hadn’t given his consent for the divorce, she had to give up all of her financial rights. Hanna decided she could live with those terms because, even if they had to struggle for money, she and her son could finally feel safe.But a new bill proposed by Egypt’s parliament threatens to take even that sense of security away from her and thousands of other divorced mothers. In December 2016, a group of parliamentarians called for an amendment to the country’s Personal Status Laws, or family laws, which would grant divorced fathers more time with their children and also change custody rights if a woman remarries. The move has provoked an outcry from citizens and activists who say it further punishes Egyptian women, who many claim already hold second-class status.“Being a woman in Egypt is a disaster,” says Hanna.Since 2011, when mass protests centered on Cairo’s Tahrir Square led to the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, the country has seen three presidents, a new constitution and some advancement in women’s rights. The government has increased its efforts to criminalize sexual harassment, for example – a significant move in a country where more than 99 percent of women say they have experienced some form of harassment. But many of the laws regarding women remain resistant to change.The main reason for that, says Nada Nashat, advocacy coordinator at the Center for Egyptian Women’s Legal Assistance (CEWLA), is Egyptian law’s deep religious roots. The group provides social and legal services to women and raises awareness of law and human rights principles among legal bodies and NGOs. “The first problem we face when we talk about amending these laws is they are based on Sharia law,” says Nashat. According to Nashat, the country’s family laws haven’t been amended since 1920.Egypt’s divorce law has long been criticized by women’s rights advocates. Current laws say that if a man no longer wants to be married to his wife, he can divorce her instantly and irrevocably simply by uttering or writing the word “talaq” three times. This is the most common form of divorce in Egypt – the law requires only that the divorce be documented within 30 days of the declaration. “However, a woman has to file a case in the court to be granted a divorce, which is a long process that can take years,” says Nashat.Women whose husbands refuse to grant them a divorce can employ the Khula law, which Egypt passed in 2000. It allows for divorce even if only one party consents, but a woman who takes that route has to pay compensation to her husband. For women who want to escape a violent relationship, Sharia law again proves to be an obstacle, since many interpret the law as giving a husband the right to physically discipline his wife. According to research carried out by Monika Lindbekk, a Norwegian lawyer studying Egyptian divorce law, judges tend to grant divorce for harm only in cases where a third party gives eyewitness testimony of the beatings. “Emotional violence is hard for judges to assess,” says Nashat. “Filing for divorce based on harm can take up to four years.”Current legislation also makes it harder for women to rebuild their lives after divorce. While divorce rates are increasing in Egypt, many women never remarry because they are afraid their children might be taken away from them, says Nashat. Divorced mothers are entitled to custody of their children until the children turn 15, when they can then choose which parent they want to live with. If the woman remarries, custody of her children is handed to her mother. Divorced fathers have visitation rights for three hours a week.Under the proposed amendment, if a divorced woman remarries, custody goes not to her mother, but to her ex-husband, as long as he can provide a female caretaker – his new wife, for example. And visitation rights for the non-custodial parent would increase to entire weekends and up to a month in the summer holidays.“The amendment takes into account what is best for children,” says Soheir El-Hady, one of the parliamentarians behind the amendment. “It’s the father’s right to visit that we want to change, so that children can get to know their father’s family better.” The M.P.s say swapping custody from the woman’s family to her ex-husband’s if the woman remarries is about protecting children from potential abuse by their mother’s new husband.But critics see the potential changes as yet more tools to disempower Egyptian women. “The proposed amendment is driven by a conservative and patriarchal view that denies women the right to divorce and the right to remarry,” says a spokesperson (who asked not to be identified) for the group Nazra for Feminist Studies. “Or that sees these women as bad and thus wants to punish them by taking away custody if they think about divorce and remarriage.”With her pink-streaked pixie cut and her loud, electric energy, Hanna makes an impact simply walking down the street in Cairo – especially when she smokes, in defiance of Egypt’s strict social codes. Every day she experiences the harassment that has become a common occurrence for the country’s women: She’s been the target of vulgar cat calls, she’s been spat at and she once had to dive away from a man who tried to hit her with his car. “This is not harassment; it is violence,” she says. “We [women] are surviving, we are fighting for our lives.”Hanna is angry about the proposed family law amendment, for which parliament has yet to schedule renewed talks and about the treatment of Egyptian women in general. But as she looks for a more stable job to be able to care for her son, who is now five, she says she isn’t afraid to keep breaking taboos. “We need feminism in Egypt,” she says. “Someone needs to fight.”Hanna’s name has been changed to protect her privacy.

If history is any indication, it will result in even more abortions and maternal deaths worldwide.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58890b961c00002d00d94428.jpeg?cache=HSf9Q6sMjx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In keeping with a long-standing Republican policy that began with President Ronald Reagan, President Donald Trump on Monday reinstated the “global gag rule,” an order that bans organizations in other countries from providing information about abortion or offering abortion services if they benefit from U.S. funding. In a bid to mitigate the harmful effects this rule is likely to have in developing countries, Dutch development minister Lilianne Ploumen has announced an international abortion fund for groups that want to continue providing birth control and abortion to women who need it.“This decision has far-reaching consequences,” Ploumen said in a Tuesday statement about Trump’s revival of the rule. “Above all for the women it affects, who should be able to decide for themselves if they want a child, but also for their husbands and children and for society as a whole. Banning abortion does not reduce the number of abortions. What it leads to is dangerous backroom procedures and higher maternal mortality.”Ploumen went on to tout the Dutch government’s achievements in helping prevent more than 6 million unwanted pregnancies and half a million abortions through its support of women’s organizations around the world.To continue the work, Ploumen invited other “governments, companies and civil society organizations” to contribute to the new fund, which aims to make up for any potential cut in U.S. funding that results from the global gag rule. Between 15 and 20 countries, as well as some foundations, have already reached out to Ploumen in support of her idea, The Guardian reported Wednesday.The U.S. Agency for International Development is the world’s largest country-to-country donor in family planning. The global gag rule, also known as the Mexico City policy, was first enacted by Reagan in 1984. Since its inception, every new Democratic administration has overturned it, while every Republican administration has reinstated it. However, it’s important to note that a 1973 law known as the Helms Amendment already bans American funds from being used to pay directly for abortion procedures. What the global gag rule does, essentially, is strip U.S. funding from any clinics that continue to simply educate women about abortion, or that pay for abortion services with other funds ― even if the procedure is legal in that country.The gag rule has life-and-death consequences. Marie Stopes International, a major global organization that will be affected by the rule, estimates that a cut in its funding alone will result in 6.5 million more unwanted pregnancies, 2.2 million more abortions and the deaths of 21,700 young women in the next four years. Research also shows that the gag rule is actually linked to a rise in abortion rates around the world. A 2011 study from Stanford researchers looked at the abortion rates among some 260,000 women in 20 African countries from 1994 to 2008, and found that restricting funding for clinics that provided abortion services led to an uptick in abortion rates.From 1994 to 2001, when Bill Clinton was president and the gag rule was rescinded, the annual rate in the countries under review was 10.4 abortions per 10,000 women. But from 2001 to 2008, when George W. Bush was president and the gag rule was back on the books, the annual rate rose significantly, to 14.5 abortions per 10,000 women. The researchers also calculated that women living in countries that were deeply affected by the gag rule had almost three times the odds of having an abortion during the W. Bush administration as they did during the Clinton years. While the researchers hesitated to draw a definitive conclusion about the rise of abortions in sub-Saharan Africa during the W. Bush administration, they hypothesized that withdrawing money from clinics that provided modern contraception may have led to an increase in the abortion rate. And of course, these clinics often provide preventive health services beyond family planning ― all of which will be affected if U.S. funding is stripped from the organizations.Reports commissioned by the global women’s health organization Engender Health found that in 2006, three-quarters of the way through the W. Bush administration, the global gag rule resulted in the closure of eight clinics in Kenya, several of which were the only source of general health care for their community. In Zambia, the only non-governmental organization that offered reproductive health services lost almost 40 percent of its staff, greatly hindering both family planning and HIV prevention efforts.This reporting is brought to you by HuffPost’s health and science platform, The Scope.

It would also temporarily halt visas for people from the Muslim-majority countries of Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. By issuing this order, Trump would make good on his campaign promise to ban immigration from countries “compromised by terrorism.”Albright acknowledged on a Thursday press call, organized by refugee groups, that a registry of Muslims in the U.S. was not part of the proposed executive order. But, she said, “by targeting Muslim-majority countries, there is no question that this order is biased against Muslims, and when one faith is targeted, it puts us all at risk.” In November 2015, Trump was asked by a reporter if he thought there should be a database that tracks Muslims in this country. Trump’s answer was indirect and focused mainly on building a wall along the Mexican border. When pressed again by the reporter, he said, “I would certainly implement that, absolutely.”Trump later tweeted that he did not suggest a database, yet his post still raised eyebrows: Shortly after Trump was elected, it was reported that his team was considering the possibility of reviving a registry of immigrants and visitors from “higher risk” countries. And Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, sidestepped the question of whether he would support a Muslim registry during his confirmation hearing:Albright is not alone in her public proclamation that she would register as Muslim in protest.Feminist icon Gloria Steinem, speaking at the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, said she would register as Muslim if such a policy were implemented. Actress Mayim Bialik has also tweeted she would register in solidarity:How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers... of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting,” Trump said on Twitter.Even before Trump’s tweet, Peña Nieto faced growing pressure at home to scrap the meeting over objections to the border wall.The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.Trump signed new executive orders, including one authorizing the planned wall, on Wednesday just as a Mexican delegation led by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray arrived at the White House for talks.The timing caused outrage in Mexico, with prominent politicians and many on social media seeing at as a deliberate snub to the government’s efforts to engage with Trump, who has for months used Mexico as a political punching bag.But Mexican Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said minutes after Trump’s tweet, “We’ll have to see what happens, under what terms, what the spaces there are for dialogue, what avenues remain open. We have to wait.”“That’s correct,” Meade said on Mexican radio when asked if a cancellation of the meeting would fuel uncertainty.Mexico’s peso reversed gains immediately after Trump’s message on Twitter.Videgaray, who had spoken positively about his eight-hour meetings with Trump’s closest aides at the White House on Wednesday and who said on Wednesday evening that the summit was on “for now,” was due to meet U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Thursday.His colleague, Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo was due to meet with business leaders.CONGRESS MOVING AHEADOn Thursday, leaders of the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress said they planned to move ahead on funding the border wall, which they projected would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion.“So we intend to address the wall issue ourselves and the president can deal with his relations with other countries,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said at a news conference in Philadelphia, where Republicans were holding a retreat.Trump was due to address the group later in the day, as was British Prime Minister Theresa May.House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, asked if lawmakers were worried about the U.S. relationship with Mexico, said, “I think we’ll be fine.”Trump, who took office last Friday after winning the Nov. 8 election, ruffled feathers with Mexico from the start of his presidential campaign in 2015, saying that the country sent criminals and rapists to the United States and promising to build a wall along the border that he said Mexico would pay for.Mexico has long said it will not pay for such a project.Trump has also threatened to penalize U.S. companies that use Mexican manufacturing plants to produce goods for the United States.Former foreign minister Jorge Castaneda said the Mexican government should have canceled the planned summit earlier in the week, when it became clear that Trump was going to go ahead with measures to build the wall and clamp down on immigration.“There is an atmosphere of crisis in the United States and it is going to last a long time. We are going to have to get used to living like this,” he said on Mexican radio.(Reporting by Roberta Rampton, Doina Chiacu and Susan Heavey in Washington; Anahi Rama and Dave Graham in Mexico City; Editing by Frances Kerry)"

But an explosion in smartphone use in recent years means one can now pay for such a date through a handful of mobile apps, with just a few clicks.“Over 1,000 users on our platform have signed up as dates for hire for the New Year break,” Cao Tiantian, founder of date-for-hire app Hire Me Plz, told Reuters.Subscribers to the app pay from as little as 1 yuan ($0.15) to 1,999 yuan an hour for a dinner date, a chat, a game of mah-jong or even a foot massage.Prices surge around the time of Lunar New Year, with thousands of attractive twenty-somethings like Luoluo commanding fees of 3,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan a day.“I’m still seeking people to fill my time slots,” said the woman from the southwestern province of Sichuan, who has just two half-day slots left to fill over the next seven days.“But only those who stay in the same province as me. I don’t have time to waste on travel,” she added.Apart from Hire Me Plz, there are five major date-hiring apps in China, which make their money by taking a cut from hires, and also from subscription fees.“Our business model is still new, though an increasing number of young people have accepted the idea of selling their time as commodity,” said Beijing-based Cao, who expects date-rental to become a multi-billion dollar market in five years.Since its launch in 2015, Hire Me Plz has garnered a user base of 700,000 and 1.7 million followers on Tencent’s (0700.HK) WeChat, China’s biggest mobile social media network.Date rentals ― offline or online ― have drawn criticism in recent years, with some netizens on social media and legal experts questioning the morality and legality of the business.“There are no clear prohibitions in Chinese laws regarding date rentals. But risks exist among such deals, which may also violate the law to some extent,” state-run China News Services this month cited Li Hongzhao, an official of the Beijing Lawyers Association Criminal Law Committee, as saying.Li said it is sometimes hard to define the boundaries of appropriate intimacy and when an act of intimacy becomes sexual assault.Sex is not part of the services offered on any of the mobile apps. Prostitution is illegal in China.Dating services are also offered by individuals on Baidu’s (BIDU.O) Tieba classifieds and Tencent’s QQ messaging service. But buyers beware - those services provide no identity authentication, unlike the mobile apps.Hire Me Plz’s Cao said the initial aim of her app was to help overcome the problem of loneliness experienced by young people leaving home to work alone in big cities.“I was seeking a more effective way to ask someone out. Who wants to chat for months via social networks and end up with nothing?”Elsewhere in Asia, online date-for-hire services are mostly found on website-only platforms, such as Soulmate in South Korea and Pally Asia in Singapore.Pally Asia, which calls itself a “rent-a-friend” platform, plans to push out an app in the first half of this year.($1=6.8758 Chinese yuan)"

Women are encouraged to submit work to the syllabus on a website dedicated to the project, which will be led by Wake Forest professor and Elle magazine editor-at-large Melissa Harris-Perry.The Saint Heron site reads:Women between the ages of 16-30 are now being asked to share their stories using texts, music, and visual art that speak to their personal experiences. These submissions will contribute to a Solange inspired syllabus. Solange’s album uncovers many truths and speaks freely on issues that directly affect women of color and it is time for all of us to join in on the conversation. In December, Solange opened up to Helga Davis about the conversation that inspired “A Seat at the Table.” When Solange received flack last year for expressing that white journalists covering R&B should know who Brandy is, a white writer went on a New York Times podcast to comment: “I noted who her audience was, and if I were her, I’d be careful of making these statements because I’d be careful not to bite the hand that feeds me.”“I began to think a lot about that conversation and replaying it, and it haunted me,” Solange, who recently gave away hundreds of books to Washington, D.C., fans and Howard University students, said. “And it haunted my mother to hear someone telling her daughter, ‘Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.’ And also the racial subtleties — [that] are not so subtle — of what that encompasses when you say that to a black woman.”It’s unclear whether the works submitted to “A Seat at the Table” syllabus will form the basis of a university course, an open online project, or something else entirely. We also wonder whether the album’s corresponding ebook, which includes Knowles’ lyrics and photography by Carlota Guerrero, will be a part of the project."

The interview had been conducted with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and was posted last week. In it, Botticelli talked about how drug treatment has changed during the course of his long career in the field, and he listed his accomplishments while running the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy. The most controversial aspect seemed to be that Botticelli came from the Obama administration. The agency had heavily promoted the interview on social media. But now links to it go to an error page, and all traces of it appear to have been removed from SAMHSA’s website, sparking concern that the new administration is trying to wipe away its predecessor’s record. “It’s so wrong,” one SAMHSA staffer told The Huffington Post. “You can’t just delete a past administration’s work. It’s part of our history.”Said another source within the administration: “I don’t know what happened to it, but the interview did happen.”When asked about the interview, SAMHSA’s press office first emailed a PDF copy of it, underscoring that no live link currently exists. When asked why it had disappeared from the website, the office said only that it would be placing it back into its archive system.Though the interview may be put back online, its initial deletion comes amid what appears to be a pattern of Obama administration records being removed from public view during the early days of the Trump administration. The White House’s climate change page, for example, was taken down this week. And multiple federal agencies have been told to cease communication with Congress and the public on policies and regulations.Botticelli’s interview is far more benign, politically, than either of those. He is a well-liked figure on both sides of the aisle, praised for his approach to treatment and for his own story: He is the first drug czar to be in recovery. In February 2015, the Senate unanimously confirmed him, and, on his way out, he was able to help secure a billion dollars in funding for drug treatment through the 21st Century Cures Act.In the interview, Botticelli reflected on the state of drug treatment and offered advice to others in recovery.“Part of what is important is for anyone who is in recovery and does advocacy to be grounded and secure in their own recovery before venturing out in other, more public ways,” Botticelli said. “Sometimes I’ve worried when I’ve seen people who are very early in recovery playing a public and prominent role. I’m not saying they shouldn’t talk about it at all, but early recovery is stressful enough.” Do you work in a federal agency?

John Boehner, who was then-House minority leader, was curious how they’d play out, and joined one in Bakersfield, California with Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).What he saw there stunned him, and he immediately knew that if Republicans could harness that energy, he’d become speaker of the House. As he told his staff in his typically salty manner, “They are fucking furious and we’re going to win.”Boehner was right on both points, and he vowed that day to make sure he channeled the rage he was witnessing into campaigns against Democrats the next fall. To ally with his base, he and then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) resolved to engage in all-out obstruction. It worked, until it worked too well, and consumed Boehner himself, as well as his deputy, former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.).Elected Democrats are now facing the same challenge, as a fired-up progressive base is marching far ahead of the party leadership. Democrats are scrambling to keep up.This week, when progressive champions Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) voted in a Senate committee to approve the thoroughly unqualified Ben Carson to head the Housing and Urban Development Department, there was little criticism from established liberal organizations in Washington. But the grassroots lit up ― blasting them on Twitter, Facebook, in calls to their offices, and in countless emails to Huffington Post reporters, asking us what on earth their one-time heroes were doing.Warren clearly felt the backlash. “OK, let’s talk about Dr. Ben Carson,” she began a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday.That the votes came just days after millions poured into the streets in more than 650 women’s marches on Saturday made it that much more jarring. Those marches, after all, had not been sparked by Planned Parenthood, or the Democratic Party, or unions, or MoveOn.org, even if they did pitch in to help once it got going. Instead, they came from regular, angry people ― people who may try to replace the ones in power.“It’s going to motivate a lot of people to activism and to run for office,” said Fran DeBenedictis, a 63-year-old retired New York City cop, as she scanned the crowds at Saturday’s march in D.C. She was one of hundreds of thousands who marched in the city that day, armed with a homemade sign denouncing sexism and homophobia ― amazingly, it had a photo of her on it from a women’s march decades earlier ― and joined by two friends who rode in on a bus from Long Island, New York. This, she said, motioning to the scene, is what brings change.“I’ve been doing this for 40 years,” she said. “It works.”For DeBenedictis and others, the march was the most cathartic and inspiring experience they’d had since the despair of President Donald Trump’s win in November. More than 3 million people flooded the streets in cities and towns across the country, donning pink cat-eared “pussy hats” and vowing resistance to Trump’s anti-woman, anti-environment, anti-immigrant agenda. It was such a high that many went back home fired up and ready to fight, but realized, wait, now what?The organizers of the march provided the platform that an angry electorate demanded, but they didn’t dictate what comes next. Yes, they co-hosted the march with well-established, progressive groups in Washington D.C., like Planned Parenthood and the Natural Resources Defense Council. But they didn’t coordinate with those groups to collect attendees’ names and email addresses to keep them engaged in those groups’ fights around reproductive rights or climate change. Instead, the organizers collected contact information for the local organizers themselves, which may wind up being far more powerful than another giant list of progressives.“I’ve already gotten a follow-up email from the Women’s March in D.C. I think organizers are doing a much better job of ‘absorption’ post-march than anything I’ve ever seen prior to this,” said Micah Sifry, who studies technology and political activism. He recently advised the new grassroots group SwingLeft.org, which connects volunteers with progressive House candidates running in nearby swing districts.Organizers also didn’t try to whittle down, say, the movement’s top three progressive priorities and try to keep attendees focused on those issues in Congress. In spite of this lack of a centralized plan, or perhaps because of it, something remarkable has happened: Democrats desperate for change are going around the establishment and taking action themselves.In the five days since the marches, there’s been a surge of grassroots mobilization online and tens of thousands of people have signed up to get involved. Hundreds of people have signed up to run for local and state offices. Some have volunteered to help Democratic candidates in swing districts. Others, frustrated by the lack of change that they’d like to see, are starting their own campaigns that make fighting Trump as simple as sending a text or downloading an online postcard to send to your member of Congress on a given issue.Laura Moser, a 39-year-old writer and mom of two young kids, had never led any kind of political mobilization effort before December, when she launched Daily Action. It’s perhaps the easiest and most targeted progressive campaign out there: You just text the word DAILY to the number 228466 (or ACTION), and you’ll get a text message about an urgent progressive issue in your area, based on your zip code. If you want to act, you listen to a short recorded explanation on it and from there, you’re routed directly to your member of Congress or senator to weigh in.“In 90 seconds, you can conscientiously object and be done with it,” reads the Daily Action website. “You can make the phone calls when you’re walking to the bus stop, or waiting in line for your morning latte. One touch of the phone and you’re done.”Moser, who leaned on her husband’s tech experience to set up the mechanics of the operation, has tapped into an eager audience. Daily Action already sends 75,000 texts per day ― as many as 20,000 of those came from people who signed up after the march ― and has 30,000 subscribers on Facebook. Moser said she was motivated to create the campaign after seeing so many progressives outraged and depressed about Trump and ready to fight for their ideals, but, per usual, not having any organization around it.“I kept getting all these messages from people like, ‘What are we going to do? We’re going to die,’” Moser said. “This is my solution to the despair. I can’t stop all the horrible things that are happening, but I can react to them.”This newfound energy is driving throngs of people into the political process ― and it’s quickly being turned against Democratic politicians for being soft on Trump, whether it’s by approving his cabinet nominees or signaling a willingness to work with him.“Senate Dems’ response to millions taking to the streets is beyond disappointing,” said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of the women’s online advocacy group Ultra Violet. “It is outright shameful.”“Resistance means resisting,” Markos Moulitsas wrote Thursday on the progressive site Daily Kos. “All those people in the streets last Saturday didn’t march for Democrats to make nice with the GOP. They marched to resist—whether it’s Trump, or his acolytes like Carson. And if even progressive champions like Warren can’t figure that out, we really are in trouble.”In the meantime, new grassroots groups are cropping up by the day. There’s the aforementioned Swing Left, which launched the day before Trump’s inauguration and has more than 220,000 signed up to participate. There’s Justice Democrats, which is raising money to fund challenges to so-called “corporate” Democrats. There’s Run for Something, a group of Hillary for America and Obama for America, which is recruiting young Democrats to run for local and state office. They launched Friday and are seeing an average of 100 people sign up every day. The organizers of the Women’s March just started their own effort: 10 actions for the first 100 days, which calls on its broad base of supporters to take action on a specific issue every 10 days.Brad Bauman, a Democratic consultant and former executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the progressive base doesn’t think its leaders are up to challenging Trump.“What we’re seeing here is a tacit understanding by progressives that establishment Democratic leaders are not equipped to fight Donald Trump the way that Donald Trump needs to be fought,” said Bauman, who works with labor and environmental groups. “Progressives … frankly would have been much happier had [Senate Democrats] said to him, ‘We will not confirm a single one of your picks unless you immediately and publicly renounce breaking up families, the wall, restricting Muslim entry into the country, torture and the rest of the alt-right agenda.’”Some traditional groups are paying attention and following the lead of the masses. MoveOn sponsored the march and kicked in $100,000 to support it. The group held a phone call the day after and 60,000 people joined; another 15,000 turned out for small rallies at Senate and House offices on Tuesday, calling for opposition to Trump’s #SwampCabinet, as it’s been dubbed.“The grassroots progressive base ― and more broadly, the public, which voted decisively against Trump ― is demanding clear, principled, and total opposition to the Trump Administration’s extreme and unprecedented agenda. Mayors, Attorneys General and Governors are showing what real leadership looks like right now” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action.“Senate Democrats should pay attention,” he added. “Doing business as usual or treating Trump as your run-of-the-mill threat will not do.”As of Feb. 1, after more than 10,000 votes cast, the tally is running at 92 percent in favor of full-on opposition, with 8 percent recommending pragmatism."

John Boehner, who was then-House minority leader, was curious how they’d play out, and joined one in Bakersfield, California with Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).What he saw there stunned him, and he immediately knew that if Republicans could harness that energy, he’d become speaker of the House. As he told his staff in his typically salty manner, “They are fucking furious and we’re going to win.”Boehner was right on both points, and he vowed that day to make sure he channeled the rage he was witnessing into campaigns against Democrats the next fall. To ally with his base, he and then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) resolved to engage in all-out obstruction. It worked, until it worked too well, and consumed Boehner himself, as well as his deputy, former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.).Elected Democrats are now facing the same challenge, as a fired-up progressive base is marching far ahead of the party leadership. Democrats are scrambling to keep up.This week, when progressive champions Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) voted in a Senate committee to approve the thoroughly unqualified Ben Carson to head the Housing and Urban Development Department, there was little criticism from established liberal organizations in Washington. But the grassroots lit up ― blasting them on Twitter, Facebook, in calls to their offices, and in countless emails to Huffington Post reporters, asking us what on earth their one-time heroes were doing.Warren clearly felt the backlash. “OK, let’s talk about Dr. Ben Carson,” she began a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday.That the votes came just days after millions poured into the streets in more than 650 women’s marches on Saturday made it that much more jarring. Those marches, after all, had not been sparked by Planned Parenthood, or the Democratic Party, or unions, or MoveOn.org, even if they did pitch in to help once it got going. Instead, they came from regular, angry people ― people who may try to replace the ones in power.“It’s going to motivate a lot of people to activism and to run for office,” said Fran DeBenedictis, a 63-year-old retired New York City cop, as she scanned the crowds at Saturday’s march in D.C. She was one of hundreds of thousands who marched in the city that day, armed with a homemade sign denouncing sexism and homophobia ― amazingly, it had a photo of her on it from a women’s march decades earlier ― and joined by two friends who rode in on a bus from Long Island, New York.

23,MEDIA,How Donald Trump Made The Cable News Chyron Operator A Washington Power Player,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cable-network-news_us_588a109fe4b0737fd5cbc791,"The president is watching, and responding to, what's on air.",2017-01-26,"Donald Trump, seen here giving an interview to Bill O'Reilly of Fox News in December 2015, watches cable news obsessively. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588a1f731200003a14ad9e52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― The cable news chyron operator is a midlevel job, usually staffed by a production assistant in his or her mid-20s. A segment producer is higher up on the food chain, but still labors behind the scenes. In the era of Donald Trump, however, both of these posts have taken on monumental importance, wielding as much influence as your run-of-the-mill House member. The president of the United States is an obsessive cable news watcher, that much is known. But the extent to which his viewing habits are affecting his governing priorities during his first week in office has been shocking to observers. Trump phoned a congressman on Wednesday shortly after he made a direct appeal to the president on MSNBC. And on two occasions, Trump blasted out statements to his 20 million-plus Twitter followers ― and the world ― that mirrored recent Fox News segments. Unlike Barack Obama, who made a point of claiming he ignored the cable chatter, Trump doesn’t hide his consumption (and criticism) of the news media. He rises early, turns on the television, and plows through print copies of The New York Times, New York Post and The Washington Post. An especially avid cable news viewer, Trump often sounded off on Twitter in response to real and perceived slights uttered by pundits and TV hosts. But it’s one thing for Trump, as simply a candidate and celebrity, to comment on cable news. It’s another for Trump, as president, to call for sending federal authorities into America’s third-largest city shortly after a television host suggested doing so. On Tuesday night, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly said that “gang violence in Chicago is getting worse,” and both he and a guest described the situation as “carnage.”O’Reilly asked if Trump would “step in and override local authorities” and the network ran an on-screen graphic with the number of homicides and shootings this year. Just over an hour later, Trump said “carnage” was happening in Chicago, tweeted the same statistics appearing on Fox News, and declared he’d “send in the Feds” if the situation doesn’t improve. On Thursday morning, Fox News reported how Chelsea Manning ― whose sentence for leaking classified information was recently commuted ― had criticized Obama.The network characterized Manning’s view of Obama as that of a “weak leader” and included the text “Ungrateful Traitor” as a chyron running on the lower part of the screen. Fourteen minutes later, Trump tweeted using the same language as Fox News, as caught by CNN’s Brian Stelter. Winning the presidency hasn’t stopped Trump from instantly responding to TV news, even as the office he holds gives enormous weight to his words. In the weeks after the 2016 election, CNN’s Tom Kludt noted a half-dozen times that Trump, then president-elect, tweeted about an issue recently covered on cable news.For instance, Trump tweeted on Nov. 29 that “nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag” without facing consequences. The issue, flag burning, came seemingly out of nowhere. In the 24 hours before the tweet, there were no mentions of “flag burning” on MSNBC and CNN, and just one on Fox News, according to television monitoring service TVEyes.But about a half-hour before Trump’s tweet, Fox News ran a segment on protests at Hampshire College against removing the American flag from campus. In appearing to jump off that segment and into the topic of flag burning, Trump again demonstrated his ability to immediately inject an issue into the news cycle with a tweet. In the 24 hours after Trump’s threat, “flag burning” was mentioned 75 times on CNN, 48 times on MSNBC and 24 times on Fox News.Trump’s advisers have reportedly tried unsuccessfully to limit his tweeting on an Android phone that remains unsecured, according to the Times. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that “those around Trump are trying to get the cable news consumer-in-chief to be near a television less often,” as to prevent hostile reactions to unflattering coverage.The president’s impulsive proclamations on social media have alarmed others outside the White House. The New York Times’ Peter Baker wrote Wednesday that “career government officials and members of Congress alike are left to discern policy from random Twitter posts spurred by whatever happened to be on television when the president grabbed the remote control.”And so, whoever is hosting and producing the broadcast and cable news shows the president is tuned into bears the added responsibility of knowing what appears on air, and on screen, could possibly shape public policy. Joe Scarborough, the co-host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” reportedly tried steering Trump away from picking Rudy Giuliani as secretary of state by arguing against it on air with the expectation Trump may have been watching. Last month, Scarborough told Vanity Fair that he doesn’t know if Trump tunes into “Morning Joe” every day, but it “certainly seems like he watches us a great deal.”“Even when he was tweeting that we were horrible and neurotic and awful human beings and he will never watch the show again,” he said, “I’d always turn to the camera and say, ‘Good morning, Donald.’”Scarborough’s guests are now following his lead. On Wednesday, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) appealed to Trump directly on “Morning Joe.” “I know you’re watching, so I’m looking forward to meeting with you,” Cummings said. It worked. "

Investigators described the incident as “an attempted carjacking.”The distinction between childish prank and violent crime could be a big deal to the kids, ages 10, 14, and 17. Deputies rounded them up after the Sunday highway hooliganism, and said Thursday they confessed to what they thought was a stunt. The kids told investigators they hoped someone would run over the dummy and think it was a real person, the sheriff’s office said.Detectives are consulting with the district attorney’s office on whether charges will be filed against the juveniles, the sheriff’s office said.The motorist told deputies she saw what she thought was a person in the road at 1:30 a.m. and stopped her vehicle. “As she got closer to the person, which turned out to be a dummy, two young white males wearing dark hoodies pulled on the door handles of her locked vehicle,” the sheriff’s office said in a release.The woman drove away, which Chief Detective Jason Wank said was “absolutely the right thing to do.”Responding deputies found the dummy. It was dressed in children’s clothing and had a fake plastic head."

After initially doubting her comedic chops, Van Dyke marveled at the fact he was “on hand” to “watch her grow into the talent she became.” “She was 23 years old, gorgeous of course, and had a kind of mid-Atlantic accent. She sounded a little bit like Katharine Hepburn,” remembered the actor, who presented Moore with her SAG Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012.Although she shared the stage with much more experienced comics, Moore quickly proved herself.“Mary just picked it up so fast. She had us all laughing after a couple of episodes. She just grabbed onto the character and literally turned us into an improv group, it was so well-oiled,” he said.After winning Emmys (despite the show’s cancellation), Moore faced a bright future and later landed her own sitcom, “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” playing a never-married woman working as a TV news producer. But before that, Van Dyke recalled, she had to show television executives that she could play more than just “the woman who brings the coffee.” The actor recalled “cooking up” a special to show off her range ― which, it turned out, was wide enough to include a Best Actress Oscar nod for her role in the drama “Ordinary People.”“Just to watch her grow was such a thrill for me. She left an imprint on television comedy,” he said.Read the whole essay at The Hollywood Reporter."

And she did it all while wearing a hijab.Since graduating three years ago, Adbul-Qaadir has been fighting for professional players to be allowed to wear hijabs so she could pursue her dreams of a pro career. FIBA, basketball’s international governing body, doesn’t allow players to wear religious headgear. That could change this week.On Wednesday, advocacy groups Athlete Ally and Shirzanan published an open letter encouraging FIBA to lift the ban.“So long as the ban on religious headgear remains, millions of Muslim girls and women from the around the world will be denied the access, opportunity, and experience of basketball,” the letter states. “This is discrimination but it can easily be remedied.” FIBA currently prohibits players from wearing “equipment (objects) that may cause injury to other players,” which includes hijabs and other religious headgear. But as The Guardian points out, there isn’t a single recorded incident of a player being injured by a hijab, turban or yarmulke during a game.“One of the things that has become really important to Athlete Ally is to make sure that it’s intersectional,” Executive Director Hudson Taylor told Think Progress. “We can’t fight against one injustice without fighting against all injustices.”Last year, mounting pressure from Muslim basketball players, as well as two U.S. congressmen, pushed FIBA to issue a response saying it would soon decide whether to keep the ban. But in September, the organization postponed the decision. It’s set to finally decide in a meeting this weekend, according to The Guardian.More than 40 athletes and executives signed their names to Athlete Ally’s letter, including Adbul-Qaadir, former NFL players Husain and Hamza Abdullah, and tennis icon Billie Jean King.“It means very much,” Adbul-Qaadir told Think Progress on the number of athletes pledging their support. “We’ve needed this support since day one, but better late than never.” "

(Reuters) - A federal grand jury has indicted on 22 criminal counts a man accused of killing five people in a mass shooting at a Florida airport this month, U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday.Esteban Santiago, 26, is accused of opening fire in the baggage claim area of the Fort Lauderdale airport on Jan. 6. The charges against him include multiple counts of violence at an airport causing death and injury, as well as firearms crimes.If convicted, he could be punished by life imprisonment or death. Prosecutors have not said whether they will seek a death sentence.The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in Broward County, Florida, where the attack occurred, prosecutors in the U.S. Southern District of Florida said in a news release.Authorities said Santiago aimed at victims’ heads and bodies until he ran out of ammunition and was taken into custody. Five people were killed in the attack and six others wounded.The indictment accuses Santiago of “substantial planning and premeditation to cause the death of a person.”An Iraq war veteran, Santiago had a history of erratic behavior.

Instead, they are embracing sweeping new environmental, healthcare and immigration policies that are to be imposed on all states.At the same time Democrats, who over the last half-century have zealously defended sacrosanct federal laws - such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that tackled segregation - against arguments that states should be allowed to chart their own way, are now making plans to employ some of those very states’ rights positions to fend off Trump administration policies they disagree with.“If (EPA nominee Pruitt) is going to argue states can go their own way, then certainly we should be allowed to make the exact same argument,” Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin, a Democrat who opposes Pruitt’s nomination, told Reuters.Pruitt’s office did not return repeated requests for comment.SPRAWLING FLIP-FLOPThe two parties’ switching of sides is evident across a range of issues, including so-called sanctuary cities, the environment and healthcare.Sanctuary cities - an unofficial description of places where local law enforcement refuses to report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities - could be an early test, as Trump moves to beef up federal immigration policies.Trump threatened to cut federal funds for such cities on Wednesday, as part of an executive order clamping down on immigration..Lawyers planning to challenge that action told Reuters they will base part of their legal argument on one successful approach Pruitt and his fellow attorneys general took against Obamacare in the Supreme Court in 2012.In that case, the court held that federal authorities could not take away a state’s Medicaid funding for refusing to expand the program. Although they won that part of the case, Pruitt and his group failed to stop the national rollout of Obamacare.Immigration advocates hope the logic employed by the Supreme Court in that case will protect sanctuary cities against threatened funding cuts.However, Ken Cuccinelli, the former Republican attorney general of Virginia who launched the legal challenge to Obamacare, told Reuters he doubts courts will apply that ruling to protect sanctuary cities. Still, Cuccinelli said the new political dynamic will expose Republican politicians who ran for office on a states’ rights platform because it fit their policy agenda, rather than because they were true believers.“We may find out (which) folks were doing it for legal reasons and purely political reasons,” he said.Another early battle highlighting the reversal of positions on states’ versus federal rights is likely to be the environment.California, as its governor made clear in a speech on Tuesday, will fight any attempts to rein in the state’s sweeping environmental laws, which go far beyond federal mandates. During his confirmation hearings, Pruitt, on the other hand, refused to commit to keeping a decades-old federal waiver that allows California to set stricter emissions standards.The debate over how power should be shared between states and the federal government goes back to the founding of the United States, when Federalists led by John Adams and Alexander Hamilton argued for a strong central government, while Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican Party saw states’ rights as a necessary check against tyranny.Jefferson’s faction eventually morphed into the Democratic Party, which backed states’ rights to allow slavery leading up to the Civil War of 1861-1865. The Democrats moved toward greater reliance on federal powers in the 20th century, as they fought battles over civil rights and regulating industry. Since then, the two parties have been fairly consistent in their stances, though on some issues they have occasionally swapped positions.Tension between states’ rights and federal power played out time and again during Obama’s presidency, with states’ rights supporters achieving a mixed record.Republican-led states challenged Obama’s Clean Power Plan as an example of federal overreach, in a case that is continuing. Republican state attorneys general, including Pruitt, successfully blocked an Obama executive order allowing work permits for millions of undocumented immigrants, known as Expanded DACA.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ultimately struck down the expanded DACA policy, and an evenly divided U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand last year.Harold Koh, a Yale Law School professor and a former adviser to Trump’s presidential challenger Hillary Clinton, said that even though he disagreed with the court’s reasoning in that case, it could now be used to at least slow down new Trump executive orders on immigration and beyond.“The argument against DACA could come back to haunt them,” Koh said.Embracing states’ rights could also end up haunting progressive groups during the next Democratic administration, whenever that might be, said Julia Wilson, chief executive of legal aid organization OneJustice.“That is exactly what’s under conversation right now in the community,” she said."
34,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Building An FCC That May Betray His Populist Campaign Promises,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ajit-pai-fcc_us_58891efce4b061cf898ca98e,"“When you signal to the industry, ‘Totally go to town, do whatever you want, you’re safe with us,’ they will.""",2017-01-26,"Republican Ajit Pai, a former FCC commissioner, was appointed FCC chairman by Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588925e32900002700dd1bad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump ran a populist campaign, but his vision for the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that protects people from predatory telecom and cable companies, is shaping into the opposite, advocates fear. This week, Trump appointed Republican Ajit Pai — a former Verizon lawyer who opposed many consumer protection regulations as an FCC commissioner — as FCC chairman. (Verizon owns AOL, The Huffington Post’s parent company.) An FCC spokesman told HuffPost that the enforcement bureau under Pai “is committed to protecting consumers” and “will be guided by the law and by evidence found during careful investigations.”The spokesman also noted that Pai has cast “numerous votes” to take action against companies who have taken advantage of consumers, particularly through phone cramming and slamming.But advocates point to the many other consumer protection regulations he opposed as commissioner, including open Internet rules, a proposal to help poor people buy broadband and a plan to make prison phone calls more affordable.The prison phone plan Pai opposed affected people like Wandjell Harvey-Robinson, a 20-year-old advocate from Champaign, Illinois. Her parents were incarcerated when she was in third grade, and the phone calls were so expensive, Harvey-Robinson said she got less than a minute to talk to her mom. All she had time for, she said, was “Hey, I hope you’re doing okay, school is going good, pass the phone.”Harvey-Robinson recalled how ecstatic people were when the FCC’s ruling —which is currently being challenged in court — came down in 2015, and she’s worried about the new administration. “By them coming into office ... they’re changing so many things that people are relying on,” she said. The Obama administration took a fairly aggressive approach to policing companies that took advantage of vulnerable populations, which translated into millions of dollars in fines in cases that covered everyone from rural broadband users in Hawaii to immigrants who were sold deceptive prepaid calling cards.“You can’t have rules without enforcement,” former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler told HuffPost last week. “There’s almost an existential question here...if we are an agency that creates rules, then there ought to be the expectation that those rules weren’t just some kind of intellectual exercise, that they were put in place for a reason and they ought to be followed.”Last year, the FCC announced an $11 million fine against several long-distance carriers, in part due to deceptive marketing. In that case, the FCC cited a complaint from a woman known as “Ms. Bingham” who disconnected her grandmother’s phone after the elderly woman passed away in January 2013.The phone company continued to bill Bingham’s grandmother for long distance service, she claimed. Bingham called Central Telecom Long Distance to explain that her grandmother had never bought this service, and she was being mistakenly billed. To prove otherwise, the company played a recording of her grandmother, who “was obviously confused,” Bingham wrote in her complaint.Bingham’s grandmother told the company she did not make long distance calls, and she did not know her own address or phone number. “It was so hard to listen to her confusion,” Bingham said.As a commissioner, Pai did vote in favor of fining that company. But advocates say that the rest of his record speaks for itself. “When you signal to the industry, ‘Totally go to town, do whatever you want, you’re safe with us, they will,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge. Meanwhile, some members of Trump’s transition team support a radical plan that would gut the FCC’s authority to protect consumers.According to Multichannel News, the new administration supports moving the agency’s consumer protection functions to the Federal Trade Commission, which is ill-equipped to take on the FCC’s workload. The FTC can conduct investigations, but does not have the same rulemaking authority.The FTC also does not have legal jurisdiction over the companies the FCC does, like common carriers, so it can’t do things like pass strong net neutrality rules. On top of that, the FTC already has to “worry about everything from computer chips to bleach” Wheeler said. “You get lost in that.”Travis LeBlanc, who was head of the FCC’s Bureau of Enforcement under the Obama administration, also pointed out that generally, “even ... with both the FCC and the FTC on the beat, there’s still more work than both agencies can do right now.”This plan would require congressional approval, but the possibility has advocates worried that it would weaken protections for consumers.Feld said the proposal suggests that members of the Trump team don’t “care about consumers and find[s] them a nuisance.”“That’s fine if you’re a Washington think tank. It’s not a good idea for an actual federal agency,” he added. Susan Grant, director of consumer protection and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, pointed out that the “two agencies are quite different” and said the FTC does not “have the expertise in communications service issues.”But Mark Jamison, a visiting fellow with the American Enterprise Institute who advised the Trump transition team, said it’s his view that he has no preference about whether consumer protection is done at the FTC or the FCC. Moving it to the FTC “would be fine,” he said, adding, “I am skeptical of having two cops on the beat because their rules may conflict.” He noted that he was not as familiar with consumer protection issues.Another former transition team adviser, Roslyn Layton, told HuffPost that she wants the agency to strengthen consumer protection — but incorporate the standard of the FTC. An FCC spokesman declined to comment on whether Pai, the new chairman, supports moving consumer protection to the FTC.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) told Puzder that the committee overseeing his nomination still had not received his ethics paperwork, and that she expected a “detailed account” of what steps he’d take to avoid conflicts related to overtime regulation.“If you are confirmed,” wrote Murray, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, “your participation in any decisions, meetings, or conversations regarding the overtime litigation may put you in violation of legal ethics restrictions and prohibitions against conflicts of interest, raising questions about your ability to manage a key part of the responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor.”Puzder is the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. burger chains. Until recently, he served on the board of the International Franchise Association, an industry group that has opposed workplace regulations pursued by the Obama administration. After former President Barack Obama reformed overtime rules to make them more generous to workers, the IFA joined other groups in suing to stop those rules from going into effect. So far, they have been successful.According to the IFA, Puzder stepped down from the board earlier this month, weeks after Trump nominated him to be the next labor secretary. According to the most recent tax filings available, Puzder’s work for the nonprofit was unpaid.Nothing about having served on IFA’s board should forbid Puzder from becoming labor secretary. But having been a board member of a lobby that sued to stop the overtime changes, Puzder showed a vested interest in whether the reforms survive, said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit ethics watchdog.CREW believes that, if Puzder is confirmed, he should recuse himself from any work on the overtime issue for the duration of the lawsuit. Under the letter of the law, Libowitz said, the recusal should last a year from his board resignation; but under the spirit of the law, it should last as long as the matter is in the courts, he argued.“He was on the board and had a duty to the board to represent their interests,” Libowitz said. “You have to wonder whose interests is he representing. If he really wants to be clear here, he should recuse himself for the entire lifetime of the litigation. Things can take a long time in the courts.”The IFA does not agree there could be a conflict.“This is laughable and complete hyperbole by the Democrats trying to further muddy the waters and delay the process,” said Matt Haller, a spokesman for the group. Puzder’s nomination hearing has been pushed back several times, but the holdup doesn’t appear to be the fault of Democrats. Murray’s office says they still have not received paperwork on Puzder’s potential conflicts from the Office of Government Ethics, and Republicans, who hold the majority and set the Senate’s calendars, have announced numerous delays to Puzder’s hearing. It is now set for Feb. 7; it was originally slated for earlier this month.Regardless of his work for IFA, Puzder’s stance on the overtime reforms has been clear: He has argued publicly that the new system would force employers to cut jobs.Under the reforms pursued by the Obama administration, millions more salaried workers would be entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The changes would have hit the fast-food industry hard, since many restaurant managers work long hours for low salaries, but are currently exempted from overtime pay because they’re classified as managers. Those are just the kind of workers the Obama administration had in mind when it developed the changes. By entitling more salaried workers to overtime pay, the new system would force employers to either limit their workload to 40 hours or start paying a premium for all the overtime. The rules were slated to go into effect on Dec. 1, leading employers around the country to start implementing changes. But a federal judge in Texas agreed with the IFA and its allies that the administration overstepped its bounds with the rule, blocking it from going into effect. That ruling is currently on appeal. It will be up to the new Trump administration to defend the rule in court, leaving backers of the reform with little hope it will survive."

Released this month following a successful Indiegogo campaign, the 200-page book features 15 sinewy models – including gay adult film stars Topher DiMaggio, Sean Zevran and Ryan Rose – photographed in various stages of undress. What little clothing the men are wearing comes from the Christian catalog; the brand’s signature “Trophy Boy” collection, designed for those requiring, ahem, extra room in the front of their swimsuits, is on prominent display.With its S&M iconography and glimpses of male frontal nudity, Sex = Power = Freedom isn’t the type of book you’d be likely to leave on the coffee table when Mom is in town. Shot exclusively in black-and-white, it like a stylistic descendent of Madonna’s Sex, with nods to Playgirl and Bruce Weber’s famed Abercrombie & Fitch catalogs. No doubt Christian wants readers to be aroused by the photos, which find the men shackled in cages, relaxing in saunas and lounging in bed. But ultimately, he’d like the book to “empower” the queer community in the political sphere, too.“Over the years I have been lucky enough to gain a small voice in the LGBTQ community and I have come to appreciate that my words and voice do have meaning,” he told The Huffington Post. “When I first envisioned the book, my vision of it was very simple: it was going to be a book of my half-naked models.” As the concept developed, Christian realized the book “could give [him] a platform to really express [his] views toward promoting LGBTQ empowerment.”Though the book’s scintillating photos dominate, its text reads like a stream-of-consciousness, with plenty of bawdy, if politically charged, innuendo. “We are programmed to take almost everything at face value. Not only is that wrong, it’s boring,” one passage reads. “Touch, taste, go deep.” And another: “Beat me, berate me, my spirit will never be silenced.”Christian’s words can be read as pointed rebuffs of President Donald Trump, whose rise to power has thrust the future of LGBTQ rights into uncertainty. The designer sought to give the book a particularly inclusive, multicultural feel with the casting of models of varying ethnic backgrounds, including Arad Winwin. An Iranian native, Winwin fled his home country, initially seeking refuge in Turkey before immigrating to Texas, where Christian eventually discovered him.In an interview with HuffPost, the model and gay adult film actor called the experience of working of Sex = Power = Freedom “revolutionary” in that it allowed him to explore territory he would have considered taboo in his youth. “If I would have been identified as gay by the Iranian police or government, I would have been killed,” he said. “Most people are unaware of what it is like for those that have to living in countries where they are denied every type of freedom and personal choice… I want to help spread hope to other LGBTQ people who live in oppressive environments.”As much pleasure as readers derive from Sex = Power = Freedom, Christian hopes they are also reminded “sexual orientation isn’t a protected class under federal law in the U.S.,” especially given the prospective threat to LGBTQ rights under Trump. He plans to drive that message home on an international book tour, which kicks off Feb. 11 in Philadelphia. “You are only politically free if you can fuck who you want openly [and] without any negative consequences such as being fired from your job or, even worse in some countries, being jailed, tortured or killed,” he said. “There are many people out there in the world that still believe that sexual orientation is a choice or a disease and would love to rid the world of the LGBTQ community… we need to love ourselves and love each other.”Take a look at a selection of photos from Sex = Power = Freedom below.

She initially felt “so alone” as she opened up, but hours after she posted her message, she never felt more supported. On Nov. 14, Fauver had an ultrasound done so she could see the image she had “been waiting to see for 8 weeks.” In a Facebook post from January 17, she wrote that she knew what the images from the ultrasound would look like, thanks to her scanning Instagram’s #8weeks tag and seeing similar images from friends online. Soon though, she realized the image she saw was different. “[T]hese images were different than the ones I’ve seen on Facebook that all my girlfriends had posted, something was wrong,” she wrote. “I saw nothing because my body was just hours away from miscarrying.”Fauver wrote that she decided to discuss her miscarriage experience months after in hopes that it would help her healing process. In her post, which included an ultrasound photo she found that looked similar to hers, she explained her doctor told her she wasn’t alone, but could have never prepared her for what she went through in the weeks after her miscarriage.“She didn’t tell me I was going to be reminded for weeks to come because my body was going to take that long to ‘clean out,’” she wrote. “She didn’t tell me I was going to have to watch my husband weep. She didn’t tell me how hard it was going to be to tell my mom what had happened.”According to the Mayo Clinic, “10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.” Fauver mentioned in her post how miscarriages are more common than she thought, yet it remains a hushed subject. She told The Huffington Post she thinks most women don’t talk openly about it for fear of being judged.“They don’t know if people will understand their emotional attachment to something that they never met,” she said. “They don’t want to be told it was their fault because they did this or that.”After Fauver discovered that many people close to her, including her sister who had two miscarriages, had been through what she had, she started to feel less alone. She also found comfort on Facebook from people she didn’t know.“The support has been overwhelming and the stories I’ve been told through messages have been heartbreaking,” she said. “But I’ve never felt so inspired in my life because finally women are getting the courage to share their stories and that’s all I wanted to come from this.”When asked if she had anything else she wanted to say to women who had miscarried, Fauver said, “It does get better.”“You might have really bad days and you might have good days,” she said. “But make sure the good outweigh the bad and you do your best to focus on the good ones. It’s OK to talk about it and it’s OK to cry, just never lose hope.”Fauver thanked her husband and her family for helping her through her experience. She’s also proud she added to the conversation about the stigma surrounding miscarriage. “I just want women to feel less alone,” she said. “And I want them to know there is hope after their heartbreak.”"

That are always on the go, always curious, always climbing and jumping. Being trapped in a house with them all day, day after grueling day, can drive the most patient person absolutely insane.Especially if you have what we euphemistically call a “spirited child.” Kids who are neurotypical but who are just MORE — more intense, more perceptive, more persistent, more energetic. These will be excellent qualities when they are adults. If we can all survive that long.My son, whom we have dubbed “Little Dictator,” has always been MORE than other kids. I noticed from an early age that it seemed other kids could be redirected much more easily than he could. I noticed that he seemed to relish and even seek out confrontation, to actively look for ways to be defiant. He loves power struggles and seeks out battles with the eye of a seasoned general. If you tell him “No,” by god you’d better be ready to die on that hill. If there were a Lord of the Flies situation, we fear he would come out on top.As a toddler, he had advanced motor skills and a complete lack of fear. Combine this with his will of steel and you have the perfect recipe to drive any parent absolutely bats**t crazy.At 15 months, he learned to climb out of his crib. Then he scaled the baby gate. We caught him sauntering down the hall, very pleased with himself.I asked a friend, should I put a lock on the outside of his bedroom door? I already had the highest baby gate in existence. That doesn’t sound very safe, she said. But, I said, he’s escaping his room in the middle of the night, sneaking downstairs and letting the (incontinent) dog out of the bathroom, and god knows what else. Never mind, she said. Better put that lock on. Today.Of course the lock didn’t stop him from climbing the kitchen drawer knobs (how do you babyproof the knobs?!) and turning on the coffee pot. Or from climbing the stair rail or anything else he could get his monkey toes on. He even figured out how to open the baby locks on the cabinets.That winter was especially hellish. Quickly bored with anything in the house, I tried taking him to the places available in our small town. But I very soon found that the world is not a welcoming place for a very active toddler boy.At the library, he enjoyed pulling the books off the shelf and running away from me. Our tiny library does not have a changing table, so of course EVERY single time we visited he would poop. Trying to change his diaper in the car was the very battle he had been preparing for all of his short life.Our local science play-space for kids is wonderful, but instead of playing with all of the cool toys, he very often preferred running, darting into the employee’s back room, turning off the lights, knocking down other kids’ toys like a short blonde Godzilla, and generally wreaking havoc.Taking him anywhere was exhausting, frustrating, and embarrassing. I could feel the judgement rolling off of the other parents in waves. And before I had the Little Dictator, I’m sorry to say I would have been one of those judge-y parents. Why can’t she control her kid? She must not be firm enough with him. She must let him have his way all of the time. When I have kids, I’ll NEVER let them behave like that in public.Well, universe, you made your point. I take it all back.So I stayed home. We got him an indoor slide, a mini trampoline, any toys that might possibly keep his interest, let him climb whatever he wanted. None of it held his interest for long. I bundled him up and took him outside, which at least helped him sleep better at night, but his favorite amusement was making mad dashes for the street, and for having such short legs he moved with cheetah-like speed.So winter comes back to what it has traditionally been all about: survival. That’s all we can aim for sometimes. Just do what you need to do to make it through with at least a bit of your sanity intact. They will survive too much TV and mommy yelling a bit more than she’d like. The spring will come again and we can lock the little animals outside.I’m sorry to say I have no better advice. Having the Little Dictator has been the most humbling experience imaginable. I have no idea what the hell I’m doing. I’m winging it just like everyone else. I certainly don’t have the audacity to offer advice.What I offer is solidarity. (And alcohol, if you live nearby.) Because the only advice for parents trying to hold onto a shred of sanity in the dead of winter while the insane little fascists slowly dismantle the house is this: It’s a hell of a lot easier when you’re not alone.Now when I look back on the Winter of Toddler Discontent, I realize what was missing, and it’s the same thing that makes so much of modern life harder for parents: a close community. I have something closer to this now, and parenting is so much easier when we can gather together and let the kids be wild animals together, while parents chat or get a few things done, knowing that there are plenty of adult eyes around in case things get too feral.Gather together, ignore the mess, pour some drinks, and let the kids go all Lord of the Flies for a while. Spring is coming, I promise.Previously published as ‘The Winter of Toddler Discontent’ in Jami’s BEHIND DOMESTIC LINES column in The Wild Word magazine www.thewildword.com.For more great Wild Word essays see:When Being Mom Leads to “Mommy Depression” by Jami IngledueFinding a Way Back from Miscarriage by ExpatMamaWhy Trump Supporters Must Begin America’s Healing by Reverend Rachel Kessler"

The evening I arrived, I was immediately pulled into a heart-breaking scene. I had arrived at 5:30pm on November 20th, 2016, when police violence against water protectors reached a climax. This was the night the world watched as police sprayed peaceful citizens with water cannons for 8 hours in freezing temperatures, fired rubber bullets at point-blank range into people's faces, sent tear gas and concussion grenades to disorient and stun the crowd. Hundreds of people were treated for hypothermia, dozens of others were badly injured by rubber bullets. One young woman had her arm blown off by a concussion grenade; another woman lost sight in her eye from a rubber bullet wound. The events of that night hit me hard and sometimes I am stupefied by what I witnessed. When I first returned home, I struggled to talk about normal things. I couldn’t believe that anyone cared about grocery lists or what dish to bring to Christmas dinner. A few times, I got angry as people chattered to me about college football or what they scored on their recent shopping excursions. I obsessively watched footage from the Nov. 20th conflict on Backwater Bridge. I got cranky with my kids and avoided people, wanting to be left alone with my thoughts. Some nights I couldn’t sleep, so I made lists of people I met and tried to find them in recent Facebook posts of Standing Rock to make sure they were okay. Writing has helped and retelling the story to my inner circle has helped.I can imagine that it is difficult for people who weren’t there to believe what happened. Sometimes I don’t believe it and I saw it all with my own eyes. I stood in shock watching a few officers and then eventually a large brigade of riot police aggressively attack an unarmed group of people. I inhaled pepper spray while trying to care for hypothermic people. I ran from tear gas cans being lobbed into a makeshift medic area. I saw strong, fierce warriors being carried away from the frontlines after being wounded by rubber bullets. I watched police officers aim powerful water hoses at young people as they tried to stand up only to be knocked down again. I felt the loud boom in my chest of concussion grenades and became dizzy enough that I had to sit on the ground to regain my balance. I saw young boys run towards tear gas canisters and throw them in the water to protect those around them. I heard the pop-pop-pop of rubber bullets being fired point blank into a crowd just a few feet from the riot police line. Through it all, I heard the continuous song of prayer.What I keep thinking about is how those born Native American in the United States have no trouble believing it. They are not experiencing PTSD—Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. They are in it every day and there is no “post” about it. They are used to being treated like second-class citizens in their own country. They are used to being treated as an “other” in the land their families have inhabited for generations. They are accustomed to living with this stress and seeing no way out. They don’t get to choose when to stand up for their rights. They don’t get to fly home to their big old funky house in Kalamazoo with their two white kids and their two incomes and two cars and overpriced non-shedding dog. For Native Americans, this fight at Standing Rock against Big Oil is yet another in a long history of tribes getting bullied by the United States government. I have come away from this experience feeling inspired and proud to be a part of it. Through it all, I heard songs and chants and laughter. Somehow people kept their spirits up. The medics near me joked with patients and the youths yelled jokes to one another over the din. One ER doctor used spent tear gas cans to keep her hands warm in between treating ice-covered patients. Groups of teenagers sang as they marched toward the frontlines with the lids from plastic storage bins as their only protection. People sent prayers of forgiveness to the heavily armed police across the river. Cheers erupted with each little victory. When people on the south side of the bridge started sliding logs across the thin layer of ice to feed the bonfires on the north side, there were cheers. When a mini-van arrived bringing warm food and coffee, there were cheers. There were hours and hours of excessive force by those meant to protect us, but there was so much hope on Highway 1806 that night. Hope that we could achieve great things with prayer and song and one another. Update 1/25/2017—This week Donald Trump signed several executive orders to advance the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), pushing aside any victories won under the Obama Administration. Some Native American leaders are calling for Water Protectors to return to the camps to stand up to Trump, while the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council has asked everyone to clean up the debris left behind and then to leave Standing Rock. Legal trials have begun for the hundreds who were arrested. These will be costly and some worry they will not be given a fair trial or quality representation in North Dakota. Supporters of Standing Rock have taken action against other pipelines across the country and around the world. Certainly, much will change over the next few days and weeks, as the consequences of Trump’s presidency unfold. This is just the beginning.Previously published as ‘An Awakening at Standing Rock’ in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:Surviving a Long Winter with Kids by Jami IngledueFinding a Way Back from Miscarriage by ExpatMamaWhy Trump Supporters Must Begin America’s Healing by Reverend Rachel Kessler"

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), during the opening of the 115th U.S. Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington on Jan. 3.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588916fe1200003e0aad9c15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) praised President Donald Trump’s reported decision to order a review of how the U.S. is handling the war on terror ― opening up the door to reinstating banned interrogation techniques previously used by the nation’s intelligence gatherers. As Republicans in both chambers met outside of Washington to discuss their agenda for the year, Cheney told reporters she supports a review, and tore into the Senate’s CIA torture report. Cheney also asserted that waterboarding works, and that it helped in securing crucial information leading to the capture of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden (a debunked theory).“It’s been clear, certainly since we stopped the enhanced interrogation program, we’re not even in a position anymore, frankly, where we’re very often capturing people,” Cheney said. “We have nothing to do with people when we do capture them.” Coming full circle in the debate over whether officials should use enhanced interrogation methods to extract information from prisoners, the freshman congresswoman echoed her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, on Wednesday, arguing that waterboarding is not torture. “What we know is that the enhanced interrogation program provided some of the information, and some of the evidence, that eventually led us to be able to locate, capture and kill bin Laden,” Cheney said. “I do support enhanced interrogation, I think that it’s something that clearly has helped us in the past to save lives, and so I was glad to see President Trump take that step.”Cheney said she expects the review, once finished, to reveal the “usefulness” of interrogation techniques like waterboarding ― a method used in the CIA’s detention and interrogation program for years. That CIA program was investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and found to be more brutal than the CIA originally disclosed and ineffective in producing intelligence. Some details of the investigation were released in a 2014 report. “The use of enhanced interrogation has been ― when it was in use ― very limited,” Cheney said, “limited to only three people who were waterboarded and used in a situation where we had to get information to save American lives.”“It’s the responsibility of any chief executive, any commander in chief to make sure we use every tool at our disposal,” she continued, “understanding that it’s not torture. We don’t torture, we haven’t tortured. What we’re talking about is the ability to get information from people who don’t want to provide information and who have information that could well save American lives and prevent attacks.”Reminded that the Senate torture report refuted those claims, and pressed for evidence that such techniques were, in fact, useful in finding the courier that led intel officials to bin Laden, Cheney lambasted the document. (The full report remains classified.)  “That report was actually put together without interviewing a single person who was involved in the program, and you have people on both sides of political aisle,” Cheney said.

The office put out a statement on Wednesday reminding federal employees that the law includes an anti-gag provision and that agencies “cannot impose nondisclosure agreements and policies that fail to include required language that informs employees that their statutory right to blow the whistle supersedes the terms and conditions of the nondisclosure agreement or policy.”“The federal government must foster an environment where employee disclosures are welcomed. This makes our government work better and protects taxpayer dollars through disclosures of waste, fraud, and abuse,” Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said in the statement. “Nondisclosure agreements and policies can chill would-be whistleblowers from coming forward. These orders must clearly state that federal employees have a right to make disclosures of wrongdoing.”The statement comes ― probably not coincidentally ― after reports from staff at the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Agriculture that they’ve been told they are not to communicate with the public. A memo HuffPost acquired that went to EPA staff said the staff should not issue press releases, update social media or change its website. Officials at HHS sub-agencies were also told not to send “any correspondence to public officials,” according to a memo shared with HuffPost. The USDA’s Agricultural Research Service was first told not to release any public-facing documents, but later said that guidance was issued in error.It’s not entirely clear how wide the prohibitions on communication go, and whether they’re coming directly from President Donald Trump’s new appointees or simply from mid-level career staff worried about doing anything that might upset the new bosses. A number of the federal employees HuffPost has talked to didn’t know either and could speak only to what they had been told.White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the administration is “looking into” reports about gag orders at the agencies. The OSC note lists some examples of things that are protected: “For example, one prohibited personnel practice explicitly shields employees for blowing the whistle on any effort to ‘distort, misrepresent, suppress’ or otherwise censor any government ‘research, analysis, or technical information’ that the employee reasonably believes could, among other things, pose a substantial and significant threat to public health or safety or constitute a violation of law, rule, or regulation.”Do you work in a federal agency?

It appears few Republicans in Congress noticed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5887ff681200003e0aad9935.jpeg?cache=Izi6qt0LuM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After what may have been the largest demonstration in U.S. history, congressional Republicans don’t seem to think they need to do anything differently to address concerns of protesters at the Women’s March, literally shrugging off questions about the rallies and vowing instead to move ahead with their agenda.Republicans picked up this week right where they left off, working to advance an Obamacare repeal, confirming President Donald Trump’s nominees and even passing a bill preventing federal funding from going toward abortions.When The Huffington Post asked Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) whether she thought Republicans were taking the lessons of the march seriously, she said that Republicans had “got the message.” But asked what that message was, Jenkins shrugged before eventually answering that there were “a lot of angry, frustrated people.”Asked what Republicans were going to do to address those frustrations, Jenkins said the GOP would “continue with our agenda.”When we asked Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.) what Republicans might do to address issues associated with the march, he suggested the GOP just needed to continue doing what it’s doing.“If you’re going to tell me the march is about equality, that’s already a foundational principle for Republicans to begin with,” Woodall said. “If you’re going to tell me it’s about standing up for the voiceless, we’ve been committed to giving a voice to the voiceless from day one. If you’re telling me it’s about the sheer numbers of folks who are willing to come together with us to work on solutions, listen, the only things left to work on are hard, they’re not going to get done without a lot of effort, so I’m pleased for all the man and woman power we can get to move an agenda.”Republicans generally struggled to define what the message of the marches was, but they seemed to think if they just pushed ahead with what they were already doing, voters would reward them. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said Republicans were focused on the issues they individually hear in their districts and had developed an agenda based on those priorities. (She ignored us when we asked if some of the frustration the protesters were expressing had been born of that agenda.) Democrats didn’t always have a clear answer on what exactly the message was from protesters either, but they at least had some ideas.“The message was we’re not going backward,” Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. “We’ve come too far on women’s rights, on LBGT equality, and frankly a broader set of progressive values than even that.”Huffman said he had marched in local rallies in his Northern California district, and he thought Democrats could harness some of the energy from the march.“We’re not going down without a fight. These guys will do executive orders, they’ll pass through political theater like what’s happening in the House today,” Huffman said, referring to that abortion bill passed in the House Tuesday. “But the resistance is growing. The country is awake and mobilizing, and we’re not going to let this happen.”For Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), who stayed in D.C. to march with protesters over the weekend, the demonstrations seemed to be the beginning of a political movement. He mentioned that people kept asking him how they could get involved to build on the march’s momentum, and he suggested this was a movement that was just getting started. “They’re not simply going to go home,” Polis said of the protesters. “They are worried, as am I, about the kind of America that Donald Trump’s rhetoric is leading to, and we’re going to stand up and change things.”“I think there will be a whole new generation of activists that will be coming out of the depressing results of the 2016 election,” he added.Again, it was unclear for most members ― Democrats and Republicans ― exactly what people were protesting. Everyone agreed there was an anti-Trump element to it, but there seemed to be a number of alternative issues important to demonstrators: abortion rights, equal pay, racial inequality and many others. But where Democrats looked at a broad array of issues that might motivate voters as a positive, Republicans seemed to see division and a leaderless movement.On CNN on Saturday, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), raised questions about who was leading this movement ― “if this is a movement” ― and he suggested that infighting among Democrats could prevent someone emerging in that role.“Right now it’s very much a soul-search that’s going to create significant problems for the coalition that the Democrats have,” Gardner said.Not every Republican thought the marches were something their party could just dismiss, though, or spin as an internal power struggle. (Who led the tea party again?)Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), one of those Republicans who came to Congress in 2010 with the tea party wave of lawmakers, said the marches were something members of his party needed to take seriously but weren’t.“Not yet, I don’t think so,” Amash said of Republicans heeding the message.As for Amash, he suggested he was different from most of his colleagues because he reaches out to everyone in his district and has the ability to respectfully disagree with his voters. “Whether we agree on every issue or not is not really a problem for me.”In this respect, Amash was like a lot of other Republicans: He believes he can forge ahead with a conservative agenda with impunity. Time and again, members cited conservative constituencies in their carved-out districts and suggested that the conservative agenda they were advocating for was what their voters wanted.Still, there are some members who know the price of Congress and the president getting in front of a moderate district. Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H.), who was a victim of the 2010 wave and now (for a third time) has returned to Congress, suggested Republicans had to determine whether they would press forward with Trump’s agenda or try to differentiate themselves from the president.“They are going to have to make a decision soon,” she said. “I don’t think you can ignore so many people showing up around the country.”"

More than 1 million people are experiencing acute water shortages, Al Jazeera reported on Sunday. And officials warn that the prolonged dry spell is far from over.The country has had warnings for months that a severe drought was impending. There were rainfall shortages across the nation for almost the entirety of 2016; according to Reuters, some districts witnessed a 60 to 70 percent reduction in average annual rainfall.In October, a lack of rain and scorching temperatures caused some local wells and reservoirs to run dry. “We are almost dying of thirst,” Tissa Poddibanda, a villager from North Central province, one of the areas hit hardest by the drought, told Reuters at the time.The nation’s major reservoirs have since succumbed to the dry weather. Lalith Chandrapala, head of Sri Lanka’s Meteorological Department, said last week that the country’s main reservoirs are less than 30 percent full ― which is less than half of what is required to support a normal rice harvest at this time of year. Officials say the rainfall deficit is likely to continue until the next monsoon, not expected until June or July. In the meantime, water shortages are likely to become even more severe and widespread. A rice shortage is also expected to strike later in the year. Due to a lack of irrigation water, only about a third of the country’s rice paddy fields have been planted, according to Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Center. It’s reportedly the country’s worst planting season in 30 years.“All our paddy was destroyed,” Rabanda, a farmer, told Al Jazeera. “We don’t have a way to survive and now we don’t even have water to drink.”The drought has also put pressure on the energy sector in Sri Lanka, a country that relies heavily on hydroelectricity. Due to the dry spell, the government-owned Ceylon Electricity Board has had to purchase over $50 million in electricity from the private sector, according to The Sunday Leader, a Sri Lankan newspaper.“This drought is affecting both the agricultural and the hydro-power generation,” Chandrapala told Al Jazeera this week. “It is one of the worst droughts since the 1970s.” In recent years, severe drought, punctuated by spells of flooding (including last May’s deadly storm), has become a fact of life in Sri Lanka, a tropical island nation that’s been called “highly vulnerable to impacts of climate change.”“It’s getting drier and drier,” Lareef Zubair, one of the country’s leading climate scientists, told The WorldPost on Tuesday from the Maldives, where he’s conducting research. “There are water shortages pretty much every other year.”“Even the farmers perceive it,” Zubair went on. “When we do interviews with them, they are consciously talking about the drought.”Climate change has been linked to more frequent and more intense episodes of extreme weather around the world, including drought and floods. In Sri Lanka, there’s evidence that such changes are already underway.“We see that weather patterns have changed, and unexpected weather-related disasters have increased,” Mahinda Amaraweera, Sri Lanka’s minister for disaster management, said during a United Nations climate event in 2013. The country, he noted, would need to be better prepared for such disasters in the coming years.Zubair said, however, that while Sri Lanka is at risk of “serious climate impacts,” those effects are — for now — “poorly understood.” “The depth and quality of research has been poor [in this area],” he said. “Absolutely more work and more research needs to be done. There will be serious impacts, and they need to be taken seriously.”______Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

53,POLITICS,Trump's Talk On Terror And Iraq Has Experts Worried About A Coming Backlash,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-radical-islam-talk-helps-extremists_us_5888d130e4b0441a8f723026,Post-inauguration talk of stealing Iraqi oil and restricting Muslim entry to the U.S. makes ISIS's job easier.,2017-01-25,Trump's rise has fostered new solidarity among various groups affected by his agenda.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5888d4461c00002d00d942bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s comments about the state of the war on terror, along with the policies his administration is rolling out in his first week in office, have left longtime analysts alarmed over the possibility that the very groups he wants defeated will instead be further emboldened.“It’s not probably enough to dramatically expand their relatively minuscule base of support in the Muslim world, but for a group like [the Islamic State], they don’t have to mobilize 1,000 people,” J.M. Berger, fellow at the International Centre for Counter-terrorism in The Hague, Netherlands, and author of ISIS: The State of Terror, wrote in a Tuesday email. “If they mobilize an extra 10 so-called ‘lone wolf’ attackers in the course of a year, that’s a big deal for them.”Trump has long pledged a more blunt, confrontational approach to militant Islamist groups. But his first few days as president have highlighted the challenge of using campaign-trail rhetoric while actually running the U.S. government. Since Friday, the president has embraced positions that past commanders in chief have long avoided.In his inaugural address, Trump broke with his two predecessors by declaring a war on “radical Islamic terrorism,” thereby conflating the religion of Islam ― practiced by over 1 billion people ― with vicious fringe groups exploiting controversial interpretations of Islamic teachings. The next day, he told an audience of cherry-picked supporters and some CIA staff that previous administrations should have stolen oil from Iraq. The U.S. could still do so, Trump suggested, raising the specter of a renewed confrontation between Iraqi militias, strongly supported by Iran, and the more than 5,000 American troops stationed in Iraq to help the country’s government defeat ISIS.On Wednesday morning, The New York Times reported that Trump is considering reopening secret CIA “black sites” that the Bush administration used to hold and torture primarily Muslim terror suspects. And later this week, the president is expected to impose harsh new measures against refugees, visitors and potential immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries ― justifying the move by implying that those people were likely terrorists. Taken as a whole, these policies and utterances risk straining critical alliances and prompting blowback, terrorism experts argue. Researchers in the field have warned for years against creating the impression of a broad clash of civilizations, with the U.S. as a Christian superpower battling Islam. They note that Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail already showed the risks inherent with such a framework.“When Trump says hateful things about Muslims, it proves that jihadists are right to fight against the West, because the West is against Islam,” one ISIS fighter told researchers writing for Foreign Affairs magazine last summer. Earlier in the year, The Associated Press found that an al Qaeda-affiliated recruitment video featured footage of Trump suggesting a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. And the then-candidate’s constant questioning of Muslims’ place in Western societies has lined up neatly with ISIS’s long-stated goal of destroying “the grayzone” of religious coexistence and convincing more and more Muslims to see violent radicalism as their only chance to assert themselves.Prior to Trump’s inauguration, ISIS had used his image twice in montages showing Western leaders whom Muslims should oppose, according to Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation.After Trump’s election, observers hoped that the gravity of the office would dull his rhetoric. But the first week has only worsened matters, analysts say.Trump has offered renewed hope to terror groups weakened by a two-year U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria, according to Clint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank and veteran of the U.S. Army, FBI and Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. He believes that both al Qaeda and the Islamic State could feel incentivized to attack the West in hopes of provoking an overreaction, drawing the U.S. into unwinnable wars and proving themselves more worthy of fresh support than groups more concerned with local conflicts in the Muslim-majority world. Watts also called Trump’s selection of aides with hard-line views on Islam, like National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a worrying sign.“It creates this clamping down … it confirms al Qaeda and ISIS narratives,” he told The Huffington Post. “The Trump narrative really entices the globalists [in the terror movement who say] you cannot go at this without taking the West out, dismantling and pushing back the West.” Previous administrations have struggled to balance their rhetoric on the terror threat. Shortly after 9/11, former President George W. Bush spoke of confronting an “axis of evil,” for example, while early arguments for going into Iraq stoked Muslim fears that religious hatreds and a greed for oil were motivating factors. Over time, Watts noted, the Bush administration walked back some of its more strident rhetoric, with the president going out of his way to disassociate mainstream Islam from extremists claiming to embody the religion.Trump has been far less precise in his approach. “And that’s the concern here ― making enemies out of people who were not enemies before,” Berger wrote. “That doesn’t mean that Muslims are going to flock to ISIS or al Qaeda as a result of Trump’s rhetoric, but it does complicate our ability to win support and recruit allies in the battle against extremist groups.” As Berger notes, one of the risks Trump runs with his aggressive approach is discouraging Muslim-majority countries from being associated with the United States. Nations like Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain all work closely with the U.S. on combating ISIS and other groups. “The Bush and Obama administrations were able to cajole positive steps from Muslim-majority countries, in terms of cracking down on terrorist financing and travel, and in many other areas,” Berger wrote. “If the United States is not seen as a friendly partner, those gains are at risk.”With less bigotry and bluster, the new president’s approach might have some value. Some Muslim scholars believe it is fair to say there is something “Islamic” about the terror groups the U.S. is fighting in the Middle East and elsewhere. They say peaceful Muslims and their defenders go too far in distancing militants from Islam, and they urge more honesty about the dangers of fundamentalist interpretations of the religion.Rasha Al Aqeedi, a fellow at the Al-Mesbar Studies and Research Center in Dubai, believes using the term “radical Islamic terrorism” could actually encourage stronger internal resistance to terror groups in the Muslim-majority world. “It forces the hundreds of millions of Muslims who wholeheartedly reject ISIS to do some soul-searching. ISIS, al Qaeda, and other groups are hybrid in their nature: political, psychological, and economic reasons contribute to their rise, but so does ideology stemming from radical interpretations of Islamic and calls to politicize faith,” she wrote in a Wednesday email.And Trump could take valuable steps if he sticks to his promise to end ISIS’s control of territory, Watts said, torpedoing the group’s boast of controlling a “caliphate” ― a major source of its recruitment success ― and shoring up U.S.-friendly governments.But there’s a growing sense the new president will not take a nuanced look at the fight against militants or the way the U.S. should treat Muslims. A native of the Iraqi city of Mosul, which the U.S. and Iraq are trying to win back from ISIS, Al Aqeedi slammed Trump’s Iraq comments and condemned rumors of his proposing a ban on visas for Iraqis, which she worried could prevent analysts like her ― and thousands of U.S.-friendly Iraqis and Syrians ― from traveling to the U.S. to offer their expertise.“The statements are very unfortunate,” Al Aqeedi wrote. “It’s clear that Trump doesn’t see Iraq as [an] ally, nor acknowledge that it has been fighting ISIS with all its resources and blood more than any other country in the world. Iraq was supposed to have been ‘liberated’ by the U.S., not ‘conquered.’” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5887d0d51200003e0aad98a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Foreign intervention and the many proxy groups fighting on all sides of the conflict in Syria have further polarized the war and complicated the rules for accountability when it comes to civilian protection.BEIRUT – The faces of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and his three main foreign allies – from Russia, Iran and Lebanon – smiled down at the streets of Aleppo from large portraits draped outside a building in the Azizya neighborhood in December, just after pro-government forces had seized the eastern side of the city from the opposition. “Thank you from the people of Aleppo,” was written beneath their faces. The posters are a not so subtle reminder of the role foreign militaries have in Syria’s battlegrounds today.Six years in, the progressively proxy nature of Syria’s war has left civilians more vulnerable to violence and society more fractured and susceptible to sectarian conflict. Even forces fighting on the same side have competing interests, and the fragmentation of command blurs accountability and threatens cease-fires.“No one has the interest of protecting civilians,” said Dr. Zaidoun al-Zoabi, head of the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organizations (UOSSM). Regardless of whether an area is government- or opposition-held, there is no single chain of command or solitary faction in control, al-Zoabi pointed out, and competing militias obstruct humanitarian aid to civilian populations under their control. “Unfortunately, this has become the norm.”The nationwide cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey on December 30 has done little to stop fighting and protect civilians outside of Damascus, namely in the Wadi Barada region northwest of the capital. The water-rich area is the capital’s main water supply, a critical resource and pressure card for whoever controls the taps. Continued clashes have left nearly 4 million people without drinking water for more than three weeks. Government forces accused rebels of polluting the capital’s water sources while rebels said the government’s airstrikes destroyed the main water plant. Attempts to calm the fighting and fix the water plant have failed; on Sunday, shelling by pro-government forces reportedly killed 12 civilians in a shelter for people displaced by fighting after rebels were accused of assassinating a government negotiator sent to to repair the water infrastructure.To Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, the area between Damascus and the Lebanese border is of more strategic value than the nascent truce, especially with President-elect Donald Trump’s administration heading into the White House, said Dr. Ziad Majed, a professor of Middle East studies at the American University of Paris.“The Iranians would have preferred to avoid the cease-fire now and to maintain military pressure on the opposition at least until January 20 [Trump’s inauguration day],” said Majed. “Trump and his discourse appear to be very pro-Russian in Syria and elsewhere, [but] he is also very hostile and aggressive in the terminology he is using against the Iranians.”Taking control of all areas between Damascus and the Lebanese border would allow the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah freedom of movement in its zones of influence, Majed said, and make Iran the strongest actor in the Damascus region.“Damascus is the capital and where Assad is, and Iran wants to be more present there than any other actor – even an ally like Russia – because this would give them an advantage when it comes to a political decision,” Majed said. “They will keep some cards, and cards around Damascus are the most important to them now.”As a result, civilians throughout the country are suffering and are categorized – even in death – by the groups who control their localities, said Bassam al-Ahmad, cofounder and CEO of the Syrians for Truth and Justice, a nonprofit advocacy group documenting violations in Syria.“The ones living in government-held areas are accused of being shabiha, civilians in opposition-held areas are labelled ‘terrorists,’ civilians in Kurdish-controlled Qamishli are called [Turkish-Kurdish] PKK – there is a terrible stereotyping of civilians by everyone,” al-Ahmad said.Foreign intervention has not only made for competing interests, but has further polarized the conflict, said al-Ahmad, because it “happened on a sectarian basis.” Iranian-backed militias aiding the government have largely come bearing Shiite slogans, while the fragmented, largely Sunni opposition has found support from Sunni Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and the predominantly Sunni AKP party governing Turkey. The so-called Islamic State and former al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (JFS) have also used sectarian rallying cries to bring in foreign recruits.In December, Syrian government forces supported by Russian air raids and Iranian-backed ground troops took complete control of Aleppo following a four-year-battle with rebel forces for Syria’s largest city. Hundreds of civilians were killed by government airstrikes and rebel shelling in the final weeks of the offensive, and tens of thousands of residents from the formerly rebel-held eastern side of the city were forcibly displaced. Iran objected to an initial “evacuation” deal brokered by Russia and Turkey for besieged residents of eastern Aleppo “because the deal was reached without Assad or Iran’s involvement,” according to the Guardian. A new deal was reached that included a simultaneous evacuation of residents besieged by rebels in the two predominantly Shiite towns of Fuaa and Kafraya in Idlib. Located in northwestern Syria, the province is controlled by an assortment of rebel and Islamist factions, with Jabhat Fatah al-Sham at the forefront.“The civilians are essentially being used as bargain chips in sectarian proxy deal-making,” said Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum. The evacuations from Aleppo were again suspended when rebels set fire to buses intended to evacuate residents from Fuaa and Kafraya. The deal was sabotaged, al-Tamimi said, because “many rebels and their supporters clearly saw it as capitulation to Iran and the regime and believed that maintaining the siege with as many civilians inside as possible and perhaps even assaulting the towns would give them leverage.”Druze residents of Idlib in Jabal al-Summaq north of Fuaa and Kafraya, al-Tamimi added, have no international backers for negotiations, and have had to renounce their faith under the administration of JFS.And while civilians across front lines in Syria face daily acts of aggression from the disparate armed groups, the demarcated narratives reinforce prejudices and create a society more prone to recurrent conflict.“It’s always easier to fall back on these lines of religion, when you can create the ‘us’ and the ‘them’ by something definitive that is not political,” said Dragana Kaurin, a Bosnian ethnographer formerly with the U.N. and UNICEF. “You harbor this group memory of this is what happened to ‘our people,’ and you don’t forget.”Despite the sectarian divisions and multitude of foreign actors on the ground, the Syrian government is still primarily and legally responsible for any violations that occur against civilians. “It is on their territory, their civilians – this is not a disputed territory going through a Security Council for a two-thirds majority in the general assembly asking if it is sovereign – no, this is Syrian territory,” Kaurin said.Yet civilian protection has not been an objective for the Syrian government; its security forces targeted unarmed civilian protesters in 2011 long before the conflict escalated into its current war. In an interview with French media, Assad insisted his government’s bombing of Aleppo was justified, adding that “every war is bad.”The fragmentation of territories and military forces in Syria has created a chaotic landscape with unchecked violations of international law and increased civilian vulnerability, Majed said. But, he argued, the government’s attacks on civilians come from its own “ideology of violence,” rather than the introduction of foreign powers and proxies to the war.The lack of accountability for those who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria is an “invitation to kill,” warned Majed, which will continue to encourage different forms of nihilism and radicalization in the region. “There will be no real solution – not to talk about ethics but just even pragmatically – if impunity is there.”This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

56,POLITICS,Donald Trump’s Voter Fraud Fixation Offers Window Into Governing Via Twitter,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-twitter-voter-fraud_us_58890fc6e4b0024605fd8852,The new president’s 140-character habit forces the White House’s spokesman to offer dramatically different messages less than 24 hours apart.,2017-01-25,"President Donald Trump arrives to speak to staff of the Department of Homeland Security in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. He's followed by Vice President Mike Pence and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588910591200003e0aad9c05.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For Americans curious about how government-by-Twitter might look in the coming months and years, the Trump White House’s adventures with a non-existent voter fraud crisis is likely instructive.Not long after he won November’s election, Donald Trump began claiming Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s popular vote victory was due to millions of undocumented immigrants who had illegally cast ballots. He returned to the idea Monday night during a meeting with congressional leaders, saying there were 3 million to 5 million illegal votes, giving Clinton her 2.9-million ballot margin.That led to White House press secretary Sean Spicer explaining at Tuesday’s on-camera briefing that Trump has long believed voter fraud was a problem, but there was no real plan or need for a probe.“I think he was having a discussion with some folks and mentioned something in passing, which has been a long-standing belief that he’s maintained,” Spicer said, adding that while he couldn’t rule out a future probe, there was nothing in the works. “There is no investigation. It’s a ― I said it was possible. Anything is possible. It was a hypothetical question.”Less than 24 hours later, Spicer was explaining about the investigation.“And as you saw from his tweet this morning, the president is looking into various options to address voter fraud,” he said.What options?Spicer could not really say ― possibly because Trump’s two tweets on the issue meant he was limited to a total of 280 characters (he used 274), and he didn’t get into any details:“I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....” and “even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!”The states’ secretaries of state, independent voting experts and even Trump’s own campaign lawyers ― while fighting recounts in three key states that Trump won by narrow margins ― agree there is no extensive voter fraud in the United States.During the campaign, Trump and his staff cited one discredited political science blog post that hypothesized potential illegal voting and a Pew Research report from 2012. That study, though, was not about voter fraud but about the accuracy of the state-maintained voter rolls. It found significant percentages of names who were either dead or registered in more than one state ― a natural consequence of voters who pass away or move. While voting in multiple states is illegal, being registered in more than one state at the same time is not.In Wednesday’s press briefing, Spicer nevertheless referred to dead voters and voters registered in more than one state, and said there was no conflict between what Trump’s lawyers were arguing during the recounts and what Trump is claiming now ― because a lot of the voting fraud could have happened in big states that voted heavily for Clinton, such as California and New York.“I think when you look at where a lot of potential of ― a lot of these issues could have occurred in bigger states, that’s where I think we’re going to look,” Spicer said. “But I think there’ll be more on that as the week goes on and we’ll be able to examine that further.”Trump agreed during the final weeks of the campaign to cut back on his Twitter habit to avoid creating distractions. But he has resumed his practice of sending out controversial messages, particularly early in the mornings, forcing his staff to deal with the inevitable requests for clarification.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

57,ARTS & CULTURE,Roxane Gay Yanks Upcoming Book From Simon & Schuster Imprint,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roxane-gay-simon-schuster-book_us_5888e544e4b061cf898c2654,"Thanks a lot, Milo Yiannopoulos.",2017-01-25,"Roxane Gay's book, slated for 2018, was to be published via a partnership between TED and Simon & Schuster.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5888e6e41c00002e00d94326.jpeg?cache=KJVQ6g9Ibc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Acclaimed novelist and essayist Roxane Gay might term herself a “bad feminist,” but when it comes to registering dissent, she knows exactly how to be heard.Following news several weeks ago that right-wing provocateur and one-time Twitter bully Milo Yiannopoulos would be publishing a book on his controversial political philosophy with Simon & Schuster’s conservative Threshold imprint, many infuriated progressives directed their outrage at the publisher itself. Readers and critics threatened to boycott the entire publishing house, and several writers published by Simon & Schuster publicly challenged the choice. Now Gay, a well-known and influential writer, has come forward to announce that she’s asked her agent to pull a book originally slated for publication with a Simon & Schuster imprint in 2018. “I guess I’m putting my money where my mouth is,” she told Buzzfeed. The book, a nonfiction work entitled How to Be Heard, was to have been published by TED Books, a series by the influential idea-championing TED organization published in partnership with Simon & Schuster.In a statement provided to Buzzfeed News, Gay said:When the announcement about Milo’s book first came out, I was relieved because I thought I didn’t have a book with Simon & Schuster and tweeted something to that effect. Then I remembered my TED Book and that TED is an imprint of Simon & Schuster. I was supposed to turn the book in this month and I kept thinking about how egregious it is to give someone like Milo a platform for his blunt, inelegant hate and provocation.According to the statement, she eventually told her agent to pull the book. She emphasized that she didn’t see this as an act of censorship.Milo has every right to say what he wants to say [...] he doesn’t have a right to have a book published by a major publisher but he has, in some bizarre twist of fate, been afforded that privilege. So be it. I’m not interested in doing business with a publisher willing to grant him that privilege.As of this writing, How to Be Heard still appears on the landing page for TED Books on Simon & Schuster’s website, available for preorder with a publication date in March 2018. On Tuesday, Buzzfeed published a letter sent by Simon & Schuster CEO Carolyn Reidy to authors upset by Yiannopoulos’s book deal, which aimed to reassure writers that “neither Threshold Editions nor any other of our imprints will publish books that we think will incite hatred, discrimination or bullying.” On Twitter, Gay indicated that this reassurance was far from sufficient:Simon & Schuster and TED did not immediately respond to requests for comment. As for How to Be Heard ― will it ever be heard? Gay told Buzzfeed that though she hasn’t yet secured another publisher for the book, “I do hope the book is published someday.” Our bets are on this one getting snapped up in no time. UPDATE: TED released a statement on Wednesday stating, “We’re disappointed that we won’t get to put this important book out into the world, but we respect and accept her decision.”"
58,GREEN,We Know What The Country Looks Like Without The EPA: Filthy,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/america-before-the-epa-documerica_us_5886ebc5e4b070d8cad5211d,"Donald Trump and his administration may trash-talk environmental enforcers, but America looked a lot worse without them.",2017-01-25,"Illegal Dumping Area Off the New Jersey Turnpike, Facing Manhattan Across the Hudson River...03/1973",https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5315/7087491627_0a03aecf7e_b.jpg,"Soon after the Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970, it began a monumental project to photograph the United States, in all its industrial glory.The initiative, dubbed Documerica, employed more than 100 freelance photographers to capture “images relating to environmental problems, EPA activities, and everyday life.” From 1972 to 1977, they took more than 81,000 photos, many before the EPA instituted programs to clean up the country’s fouled landscapes, air and waterways. “By the late 1960s, the American landscape was ravaged by decades of unchecked land development, blighted by urban decay in the big cities, and plagued by seemingly unstoppable air, noise, and water pollution,” C. Jerry Simmons, an archivist and historian at the National Archives in Washington, wrote in 2009. “The project takes rightful credit for the United States’ first serious examination of its rapidly decaying natural environment.”The EPA tasked each of its photographers with documenting a specific environmental problem in certain areas, from noise pollution in Boston to health impacts on coal miners in West Virginia.More than 15,000 images from the Documerica series were published online in 2009. Simmons wrote then that many of the ills shown in the photos continued to plague the country:“When we look at images of today’s environment, we can see that what troubles the environment in the new millennium is what troubled it in the early 1970s, and DOCUMERICA confirms it. Thousands of images of pollution, strip mining, crowded cities, and land abuse could well be photographs taken in recent times. Though a great deal has been done over the past 30 years to correct problems depicted in the photographs, there is a common consensus that there is so much left to accomplish in the race to save America’s natural resources.”Since it was created by President Richard Nixon, the EPA has been in charge of enforcing some of the most important environmental protections in modern history, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the banning of the pesticide DDT and the phaseout of lead in gasoline. More recently, the agency toughened rules for vehicle emissions and readied former President Barack Obama’s controversial Clean Power Plan, since stalled by court challenges.Environmentalists fear many of those efforts may soon come to the fore once again under the presidency of Donald Trump. Trump’s pick as EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, is a climate-change denier who has sued the agency 13 times as Oklahoma attorney general. Pruitt has repeatedly said the environment would be “fine” without the EPA, and has threatened to roll back regulations protecting air and water.Pruitt acknowledged during his confirmation hearing last week he doesn’t believe climate change is a “hoax,” but he refused to agree with 97 percent of scientists who say the phenomenon is caused by human activity.Just this week, the EPA froze all of its grant programs (including funding for research and air quality monitoring) and told employees not to talk to reporters or use social media until further notice. On Tuesday, Trump announced he’ll push forward the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which opponents say will worsen climate change.Below, take a look at some of the images of America as it existed during the EPA’s advent.

The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect in New York City is dedicated to preserving the legacy of the Jewish girl whose powerful diary written during the Holocaust has been read by millions. In 2016, the nonprofit expanded its focus on history and education to include more direct work on civil rights organizing. Trump’s election didn’t motivate the center’s shift, but it has given it plenty of material to address. Executive Director Steven Goldstein said in a statement Wednesday that Trump “is driving our nation off a moral cliff” and using “national security as a guise for racism.” “Donald Trump is retracting the promise of American freedom to an extent we have not seen from a President since Franklin Roosevelt forced Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II,” Goldstein wrote. “Today the Statue of Liberty weeps over President Trump’s discrimination.”Goldstein dashed off the unequivocal response to news of Trump’s actions on immigrants and refugees from a cab Wednesday morning. Standing up for oppressed groups is a Jewish value he holds dear, he told The Huffington Post.“Demonizing refugees and immigrants, and spending billions of taxpayer dollars to keep them out of our nation, will go down in American history as one of the most tragic deviations from our national conscience,” he said in his statement.Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that calls for the immediate construction of a wall on the country’s border with Mexico. The order follows a number of anti-Mexican and anti-immigrant remarks made during his presidential campaign, which he kicked off by suggesting that many Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals. Goldstein told HuffPost it would be hyperbolic and irresponsible to compare Trump’s actions to the Holocaust’s mass murders. “However, it would be equally irresponsible not to point out the similarities between demonizing and isolating groups of people within our country ... and the demonization that Jews suffered during World War II. Unless we speak out now and stop demonization in its tracks, the horrors of history could happen again.”Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week limiting Muslim and refugee entry to the U.S. A draft of the order obtained by HuffPost includes plans to block Syrian refugees indefinitely, temporarily suspend all refugee entrance to the U.S., reduce the number of refugees allowed to enter the country and briefly suspend all immigrant and non-immigrant entry of individuals from several countries with majority Muslim populations. The order is not as sweeping as his campaign vow for “a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” but still appears to target the religious group.Frank’s writings, collected in the book Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, are among the tools used to help people, especially kids, understand the realities of the Holocaust. In the early 1940s, she wrote about her family’s experience hiding from Nazis in Amsterdam before they were discovered and sent to concentration camps, where Frank and most of her family died.  Her father, Otto Frank, survived and published his daughter’s writings. He went on to found the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, a partner of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect and organizations in several other countries.  Goldstein said bringing activism to the forefront of the center’s work was true to Otto Frank’s vision, as well as to its namesake’s legacy.“No one knows what Anne Frank would have done today for sure,” he said, “but if you read her diary, she unmistakably had an activist’s heart and soul.”"
60,POLITICS,Trump's Companies Are Already Violating Their Own Ethics Pledge,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interest_us_588923c3e4b0024605fdaef6,Membership fees at Trump's Mar-A-Lago Club doubled earlier this month.,2017-01-25,Mar-a-Lago is expected to serve as a part-time home to President Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588927dc2900002700dd1bb8.jpeg?ops=crop_34_131_2966_1594%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The cost of a membership to President Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, has doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 since he won the election, CNBC reported Wednesday ― raising new questions about whether Trump’s businesses are profiting from his presidency.Trump has referred to the estate as his “Winter White House,” and it’s safe to assume he will vacation there as president. The membership fee hike had been in the works for some time, sources told CNBC. But even so, the decision to double the fees is difficult to square with the Trump Organization’s pledge to avoid any actions “that even could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.”“Situations like this speak to the larger problem of Trump keeping his stake in his company,” said Brendan Fischer, associate counsel at the Campaign Legal Center. “Which is basically that he’s expecting the public to take his word, and the word of the company, that there won’t be conflicts.”A document by the Trump Organization says that Trump has resigned from 400 corporate entities. But he has so far refused to give up his ownership stake in the multibillion-dollar company. On Wednesday, the Trump Organization appointed a new chief compliance officer and announced that it has retained an outside lawyer to help it eliminate potential conflicts of interest between the company and the presidency.George Sorial, a longtime Trump employee who defended Trump University in court, was named chief compliance officer. Bobby Burchfield, a Republican lawyer with King & Spalding who also chairs the conservative advocacy group Crossroads GPS, was named an “independent ethics adviser” to the company. But even as Trump’s company touts these new positions, ethics experts doubted the integrity of the plan. “Trump is expecting us to trust that the company is going to establish internal procedures to insulate him from financial conflicts of interest,” Fischer said.“But neither Trump nor his company will say what those internal controls actually are. So the question becomes: ‘What is Trump’s company going to allow itself to do? What won’t it allow itself to do?’”Trump’s hotels also appear to have already violated parts of the ethics pledge, specifically a paragraph promising that “no communications of the Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or otherwise be tied to President-Elect Trump’s role as President of the United States or the Office of the Presidency.” As Trump was being inaugurated last week, Trump resorts around the world lauded his ascension to the presidency on their social media accounts.This same week, Trump’s company biography was updated to reflect that he is president. This too seems to be a violation of the company’s pledge not to use Trump’s position to further its interests. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization did not respond to questions from The Huffington Post. Fischer noted that even though Trump has relied on lawyers to advise him on conflicts of interest, Trump’s real estate empire “is not a publicly traded company, so there’s no mechanism, like shareholders, to hold him legally accountable for his promises.”“It’s already clear that these pledges are not being followed through,” Fischer said, “and if a pledge is already being violated publicly, who knows how it is being violated privately.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story initially misstated that the $200,000 fee was an annual charge; it is a one-time fee for joining the club.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

61,POLITICS,Democrats Want To Pick Their Battles With Trump. Their Base Wants All-Out War.,Jennifer Bendery and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-trump_us_588817f3e4b0b481c76be1e5,"Senators get that progressives want a fight, but they want to be pragmatic.",2017-01-25,"Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) voted to advance Ben Carson's nomination as housing secretary, a decision that caught some off guard as Carson has no experience in housing policy or in running a federal agency.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588819612900002700dd189a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Shortly after the November election, a close associate of Dr. Ben Carson conceded the famed pediatric neurosurgeon turned Republican presidential candidate wasn’t right for a position in Donald Trump’s Cabinet since he had no experience running a federal agency.Weeks later, Trump nominated Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Carson accepted.Democrats were both befuddled and appalled at what seemed to be a cavalier decision to hand the keys of an agency with 8,300 employees and a $47 billion budget to someone with no apparent qualifications. And, for a while, the Carson nomination appeared to be fairly solid turf for them to put up a fight. But as the confirmation proceedings played out, something remarkable happened Tuesday. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), two of the most liberal members of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee ― which has primary jurisdiction over HUD ― supported Carson’s nomination.In explaining his decision, Brown, who pointedly drilled into Carson’s views on public housing and the minimum wage during his confirmation hearing last week, said that he warmed to the nominee after finding areas of housing policy they both care about during a private meeting.“I want to work with him on some issues like lead. He said the right things about LGBTQ discrimination. He seems interested in working on helping people whose rent is half their income stay in their apartments,” Brown told The Huffington Post on Tuesday evening. “Whatever he personally believes he has put aside.”But the Ohio senator’s vote also reflects a larger strategy that Hill Democrats are beginning to embrace, not just with respect to Trump’s nominees but to his entire agenda. Less than a week into the new administration, these Democrats are concluding that the best path back to power is not necessarily through steady opposition but through picking specific, fruitful fights.“We can’t very well be at a fever pitch on everything,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). “The door swings both ways in Washington. At some point we’re going to want a Democratic president to stand up a Cabinet. So we’re trying to be reasonable when the nominees are reasonable.”Top Democratic officials say they gave no directive to Brown or Warren to vote for Carson’s nomination simply for the sake of appearance. But both senators are notably up for reelection in 2018. Warren has been criticized back home for being oppositional to Trump, and Brown, like nine other Democrats trying to hang on to their seats in two years, hails from a state that Trump carried in 2016.For those members, there is some political upside to demonstrating willingness to work with Trump when the time and conditions allow it. But those moments, like votes to confirm Carson, also come with a cost. Cooperation with the new president isn’t what millions of progressive voters were demanding from party leaders at women’s marches over the weekend, when they flooded city streets around the country with signs protesting Trump and demanding resistance.By Tuesday afternoon, Warren was being torched by fellow Democrats on Twitter for her Carson vote:Schatz said he understands people’s “totally justified desire” to see all 48 Senate Democrats in lockstep and battling Trump on everything. But the problem with that, he said, is that Trump won and, as such, has a right to build his Cabinet.“I think people out there are feeling terrified and they’re feeling unsupported, and they want us to feel as desperate as the people we’re here to represent,” said the Hawaii senator. “My argument to this is people got persuaded that this administration and these Republicans were going to fight for regular folks. And they’re not. It was a lie.”“I think our argument has to be, ‘They’re screwing you,’” Schatz added.To make that argument stick, Senate Democrats believe, they have to find the right battles first. Sometimes that means separating the substance from the noise, like not reacting to every eyebrow-raising comment from Trump’s Twitter account or to every gaffe by his nominees (like one who said guns are needed in schools to protect students from grizzly bears). While a showdown over Carson may be viscerally satisfying, one top Senate Democratic aide said, the better play is to spotlight instances when a nominee is directly threatening Trump’s supporters. It’s no coincidence that Democratic leaders have been hyper-focused on health and human services secretary nominee Tom Price, treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. Democrats believe these nominees help them make the case that a Trump administration will cut health care, screw over homeowners and gut public education.“We cannot follow every tweet,"" said Matt Canter, a former communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which helps elect Senate Democrats. ""I think we have to figure out what this man is going to do first... Every morning we wake up with our heads spinning and that's exactly how he wants it to be. It's a problem we can't allow to happen. ""James Carville, a longtime Democratic strategist, emphasized that the overarching goal for the party is to stop the Trump agenda. And to do that, the party needs to ensure that “20 percent of congressional Republicans find it in their interest not to be with this guy.” You can’t make that case, Carville said, “if you’re against everything; then you are for nothing. You’ve got to pick and say, ‘This is what [Trump] is’ and drive that home.”Even with a more calculated approach, Democrats will likely end up more uniformly opposed to Trump’s nominees than Republicans were to President Barack Obama’s nominees when he assumed office in 2009. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who is new to the Senate and new to running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, noted that Democrats already singled out eight Cabinet picks that are “especially problematic” and plan to drag out each of their confirmations unless they get access to personal financial data that’s been withheld.“We will continue to fight them tooth and nail to prevent them from rolling back the clock on progress in America,” Van Hollen said.But the thirst for opposition from the Democratic base is arguably greater now than what the Republican Party felt in January 2009. That’s in part because of Trump’s tremendous unpopularity and in part because congressional Republicans paid little price for bucking Obama during his eight years. It’s also because of the massive success of the women’s marches from last weekend. (The tea party hadn’t blossomed at this point in 2009.) Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said he marched with his grandchildren in one of Saturday’s protests and felt just as fired up about stopping Trump’s agenda as other attendees. But as a senator in the minority party, he preached a thoughtful-opposition approach. Democrats, he said, will be most effective if they single out what really matters for them, like preventing Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care Act, and ignore the noise, like Trump’s bizarre obsession with how many people attend his events.“I don’t care about the crowd size at Trump’s inauguration,” said Cardin. “It’s the issues that affect people’s lives. Right now, the big issue is the Affordable Care Act. That’s going to cost people their lives, literally.“Our job is to be fighting for the people who are concerned that there’s no one really fighting for them.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

62,POLITICS,"Republican Leaders Lay Out 200-Day Agenda: Obamacare, Tax Reform, Infrastructure, Border Wall",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-200-day-agenda_us_5888fe89e4b0737fd5cb1d79,Remember when the Obamacare replacement was going to be simultaneous with the repeal?,2017-01-25,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), left, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), right, laid out congressional Republicans' schedule Wednesday at the annual GOP retreat.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588904571c00007404d943f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) privately laid out a busy schedule here at the annual GOP retreat, telling members on Wednesday that in the first 200 days they were aiming to repeal Obamacare by April, pass a tax overhaul by August, and approve funding for a border wall at some point in between.The big news out of Wednesday’s meeting, however, was that Ryan and McConnell seemed to be moving ahead with a speedy Obamacare repeal while there’s no agreement on a real alternative health care plan ― in contradiction to President Donald Trump’s vow that its repeal and replacement would be essentially simultaneous.According to sources in the room for the private meeting, Ryan told members that Trump agreed with their “Better Way” agenda, but had asked to add an infrastructure bill, which has been hyped by the new administration. Ryan said that bill would focus on public-private partnerships rather than just pushing funding toward individual projects, opening up the possibility that much of the money may come in the form of tax cuts.That infrastructure bill may or may not contain funding for a border wall, but Ryan said Congress wouldn’t fund that project through the regular appropriations process. Money to keep the government going runs out on April 28, and Congress will need to pass a funding bill before then to avoid a shutdown, but Ryan indicated they wouldn’t attach border wall funding to that bill.Although Ryan and Trump have said an Affordable Care Act replacement would come at the same time as a repeal, they appear to be playing with some loose definitions of “simultaneous.” Leaders indicated a replacement would come in three different steps. First, some small portions of an alternative plan would be in the repeal bill. Second, Trump and his secretary of health and human services would establish some replacement steps through executive action and HHS guidance. And lastly, the rest of a replacement would come through regular order, which will require 60 votes in the Senate.McConnell spoke about the challenges of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate with just 52 Republican lawmakers in that chamber. He emphasized the difficulty of passing anything beyond reconciliation bills, which require only 50 votes. Members suggested that McConnell was trying to temper expectations on the replacement bill with the realities of the Senate filibuster, a practice McConnell doesn’t seem apt to blow up, one member said.Republicans also told The Huffington Post that leaders spoke about the need for year-to-year deficit reduction.Leadership has emphasized the need for members to use the GOP retreat to get on the same page and emerge with similar ideas on Obamacare. While members still have a two-and-a-half-hour session on an Obamacare replacement, the early agenda doesn’t seem to rely on Republicans agreeing to an alternative at this point. Instead, they will push ahead with a repeal and claim that the replacement process is underway ― even if most of the work of regular bills is left to be done."

He was 69. Trucks’ booking agent confirmed the sad news to Rolling Stone, telling the outlet the cause of death has not been confirmed. The band also shared the news on Facebook with the following statement:  Butch Trucks, a founding member of The Allman Brothers Band, tragically died the night of January 24 in West Palm Beach, Florida. His wife, four children, four grandchildren and all of the Allman Brothers Band, their families and Road Crew survive Butch. The Trucks and Allman Brothers Band families request all of Butch’s friends and fans to please respect our privacy at this time of sadness for our loss. Butch will play on in our hearts forever.Upon hearing the news, fans and fellow musicians shared their condolences on social media.Trucks was born as Claude Hudson Trucks in 1947 in Jacksonville, Florida. He got his start as a drummer in the eighth grade and went on to join his high school band. He also played with local Florida bands like The Vikings, The Echoes and The Bitter Ind, as well as the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra and the Jacksonville Symphonette. Trucks first met Gregg and Duane Allman while playing a gig with Bitter Ind. As Rolling Stone reports, after Duane saw Trucks play, he called and asked Trucks to play a gig with him. From that meeting, Trucks went on to help the Allmans form the Allman Brothers Band in 1969 along with Dickey Betts (guitar), Berry Oakley (bass), and fellow drummer Jai Johanny “Jaimoe” Johanson.Betts once said of Trucks, “When Butch came along, he had that freight train, meat-and-potatoes kind of thing that set Jaimoe up perfectly. He had the power thing we needed.”The group released their debut album in 1969, which featured the track “Whipping Post.” While the album didn’t reach the top of the charts, “Whipping Post” became a “classic rock staple,” as Rolling Stone put it. In 1971, the Allman Brothers Band released the live double-album “At Fillmore East,” which went platinum and helped boost the band’s popularity. They continued to release albums ― studio, live and archival recordings ― through last year, despite announcing a retirement in from touring in 2014. For his accomplishments in music and with the Allman Brothers, Trucks was inducted into the Hall of Fame with the band in 1995. Trucks went on to form other bands as well, including Les Brers, which comprised fellow Allman Brothers Band members Jaimoe, Marc Quiñones and Oteil Burbridge.Most recently, Trucks formed Butch Trucks and the Freight Train Band, and had tour dates scheduled into the fall. However, he would play what would be his last show on Jan. 6 of this year. Trucks was also part of the Roots Rock Revival summer music camp, an all-inclusive intensive for young musicians. It provides “an intimate look at the Southern Blues Rock movement, the Allman Brothers Band and the music that forms the foundation of Rock ‘n’ Roll.” The musician leaves behind his wife, Melinda, their four children and four grandchildren. He will no doubt be greatly missed. "

He performed the Heimlich maneuver and then popped the question.“I thought, ‘I better marry him. What if that happens again?’” Fisher told the Chicago Tribune decades later.Although the couple never married due to Fisher’s reunion with Paul Simon, Aykroyd remembers his former fiancée fondly in a tribute to the actress, who died in December. “I grew up as a simple Catholic kid from a government family in Hull, Quebec, so you can imagine how much of a privilege and honour it was for me to have known this one-off, broke-the-mould woman as a great friend,” the writer and actor began his essay in Empire. The pair met on the set of “Saturday Night Live,” where Aykroyd appeared as part of the original ‘70s cast. Fisher and the late John Belushi “became instant pals,” Aykroyd wrote. “I remember how much she made him laugh.”He recalled the actress’ sense of humor in her offhand comments: “I love tiny babies. When they cry they turn red and look like screaming tomatoes.”Falling in love with her while filming “Blues Brothers,” Aykroyd found himself “contemplating marriage” and gave her a sapphire ring. “[S]ubsequently in the romance she gave me a Donald Roller Wilson oil painting of a monkey in a blue dress next to a tiny floating pencil, which I kept for years until it began to frighten my children,” he wrote. Without revealing the results, Aykroyd states the pair also had blood tests done “for compatibility” from “an East Indian female doctor.”While it may have been shorter than planned, the “Ghostbusters” actor remembered his time with the “Star Wars” actress as a comfortable one, full of Hollywood charm:Carrie embraced my friends and I was embraced in warmly human and Hollywood-glamorous emotional comfort, elegance and excitement. Debbie would cook for us and Carrie’s tech-wizard brother Todd would take me on high-intensity cruises in muscle cars and on motorcycles through Beverly Hills with great young people, José Ferrer and Donna Ebsen. These were the wonderfully inspired and smart sons and daughters of world-famous show-business professionals whom Carrie ran with. But it was also the early ‘80s. In one recollection, the couple’s recreational activities had a certain era-appropriate flair:Having obtained some original Owsley [Stanley, an audio engineer and LSD manufacturer] from our friend Tom Davis, we flew up to Reno, rented a wagon and checked in for three days of full-on weeping to Christmas classics. Certainly one of the planet’s greatest occasions where LSD was a factor.Their romance came to and end after a trip to Martha’s Vineyard, where Aykroyd and Fisher visited a “fixer-upper” of a house recently purchased for him by Belushi’s wife, Judy. It was a “great time,” the actor remembered, even though they didn’t end up together in the end.“She was also in love with Paul Simon,” he wrote. “She married him but I hope she kept my ring.”Read the whole essay at Empire."

The only wideout in the NFL to average over 100 yards receiving per game in the 2016 regular season.One is poised to be the league’s MVP. The other is possibly the best receiver of his generation.When we think about the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, we think about a high octane, explosive offense. Even Las Vegas has set the over/under at 57.5 ― undoubtedly due in large part to Tom Brady and the Patriots’ own offensive prowess ― the highest total in Super Bowl history.But somewhat unexpectedly, it has been Atlanta’s defense that has served as an anchor for the team. To understand why, we must first go back to one of the best coaching moves of the season. Dan Quinn, the second-year Falcons head coach, swallowed his ego and decided that he could no longer strictly employ a Cover 3 defense, the same defense with which he helped the Seattle Seahawks capture Super Bowl XLVIII. While some coaches reject change and believe personnel should adapt to their philosophy, Quinn ― leading from the sidelines with a level of positivity not often seen in this league ― did the opposite. The 46-year-old opted for man coverage, not as the be-all and end-all for his defense, but as a way to complement his Cover 3 zone concepts. Ironically, the change was triggered by Atlanta’s 33-32 Week 8 win over Green Bay. Aaron Rodgers feasted on the zone for most of the game, amassing nearly 250 yards and four touchdown passes. The Falcons failed to get off the field time and time again, particularly on third down, a surefire way to lose games in this league. Interestingly enough, it wasn’t that Quinn’s defense wasn’t capable ― it just wasn’t running the right system. Without question, the Falcons’ defensive strengths are speed and tackling (two of the reasons why I highlighted them as unheralded championship contenders in October). Man coverage is one way to effectively maximize such strengths.Moreover, because the Atlanta pass rush is so dangerous, the secondary has not been tasked with covering as long. Don’t forget that the Falcons rank third in the NFL in quarterback hurries and feature the game’s top sack man, First-Team All-Pro selection Vic Beasley Jr. (another second-year home-run pick by General Manager Thomas Dimitroff), off the edge.Quinn offered these thoughts on his rapidly improving defense, following his club’s 23-point thrashing of Green Bay in the NFC Championship: “The more that you play together, and you gain experience together, the faster you can play.”Click here to watch my latest on the NFL Network discussing the Falcons."

It also plans to suspend refugee admissions from all countries for 120 days and ban all “immigrant and nonimmigrant” entry of individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 30 days.“This decision will mean that many of those who are the most vulnerable, the most at risk of further violence, the least likely to be able to fend for themselves, are now to be left without hope. Such a position does not reflect who we are as a nation, or as a people of faith,” The Rev’d Canon E. Mark Stevenson, director of Episcopal Migration Ministries said.Refugees undergo a stringent, two-year long vetting process once they are recommended by the U.N. refugee agency for resettlement in the U.S. It includes various security and medical clearances as well as cultural orientation.If the U.S. government stops processing or admitting people even for a week, “their exit visa expires or their medical expires, they have to go back and start all over,” Nina Zelic, director for refugee services for Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, told HuffPost.Robert Bank, president and CEO of American Jewish World Service, noted that there was a time when the U.S. “acted with indifference to Jewish and other refugees from Europe during World War II.” He urged the Trump administration not to let history repeat itself.“We object in the strongest terms to the demonization of Muslims by the new American administration,” Bank said in a statement. “We understand what it means for a community to be demonized by authoritarian powers, and we regret that President Trump does not understand this lesson from the darkest chapters in world history.”Leaders from the the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Unitarian Universalist Association, Church World Service, Presbyterian Disaster Assistance, the United Church of Christ and a host of other faith-based organizations also criticized Trump’s actions.“If the president does go through with an executive order to suspend refugee resettlement and to close access to asylum seekers, we know that many lives will be put at risk and hopes for a future will be destroyed,” said Susan Krehbiel, of the Presbyterian Disaster Assistance. Faith organizations and local congregations may need to pick up the slack, she added, “to mitigate the abandonment of the federal government to this cause.”“As people of faith,” she said, “when others choose to act out of fear, we choose welcome.” Trump’s orders could engender a humanitarian crisis that should worry all people of faith, said Linda Hartke, LIRS president and CEO, in a statement. “As Christians, we do not fear our new neighbors who have fled for their very lives – we embrace them. As people of faith, we are called to love and serve our neighbors – and as a result, our churches, our communities and our nation are stronger,” Hartke said. Rev. John C. Dorhauer, who serves as the general minister and president of the United Church of Christ, said: “As a religious leader, I am gravely concerned. I ask myself: when do we stop being America? I think it could begin the moment any refugee thinks of us as a land to fear.”Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith leaders organized a vigil and rally outside the White House Wednesday afternoon to stand in solidarity with immigrants and refugees. In New York, Muslim advocacy group the Council on American–Islamic Relations organized an “emergency rally for Muslim and immigrant rights” to take place Wednesday evening. Nearly 8,000 people said they were going to attend on Facebook.Despite the outcry from many faith leaders, some of Trump’s own religious advisors argued that although the Christian faith commands believers to welcome the stranger, this imperative does not apply to the government.“It’s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come, that’s not a Bible issue,” Rev. Franklin Graham, a prominent evangelical pastor and the president of the international Christian relief organization Samaritan’s Purse, told HuffPost.But Sister Campbell urged senators and representatives to “remember what Pope Francis said when he addressed Congress, ‘We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners.’”“We call on Congress to do all they can to protect the vulnerable in our world, which include refugees, immigrants, and children,” Campbell said."

Sweet Zebro did not resist, and he did not show any signs of aggression.”Animal control brought Zebro to a city-run shelter before ECC took over his care. Since then, he’s been living in Castellanos’ home, where he’s blossomed into a “curious and playful” cat, she said. He’ll be up for adoption to the public in a few days.“He is a mellow and easygoing cat. He enjoys being held and petted, and following humans around to rub against their legs,” she said. “He is also getting along well with the other adoptable cats, and he doesn’t reciprocate if anyone hisses at him.”It’s possible Zebro may continue to need special care — like receiving subcutaneous fluids — indefinitely. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have “years of good quality life” left, said Castellanos.And it really sounds like Zebro is enjoying life these days."
72,POLITICS,Energy Sector And EPA Nominee: Oklahoma Strong,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/energy-sector-and-epa-nominee-oklahoma-strong_us_58891b92e4b0628ad613dddf,Oklahoma is deeply and historically tied to oil and gas.,2017-01-25,<p> Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse’s (D-R.I.) diagram of contributions from the energy sector to Attorney General Scott Pruitt (R-Okla.) presented during the latter’s confirmation hearing. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58891bbd2900001300dd1b77.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Niv SultanScott Pruitt’s confirmation hearing last week involved some pointed visual props. Making the case that Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who is President Trump’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is cozy with the energy sector, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) held up a chart full of boxes and arrows.All the organizations listed on the top half of the chart had contributed to Pruitt’s electoral efforts. At one point, Whitehouse asked Pruitt if the donors had also given to Pruitt’s Oklahoma Strong Leadership PAC. Pruitt’s response: “I’m not sure about that, senator.”Luckily for Pruitt, we at OpenSecrets Blog can help him out. In the 2016 election cycle, among the organizations on the chart that have PACs, none used them to contribute to Pruitt’s Oklahoma Strong. Individually, J. Larry Nichols, a co-founder and the chairman emeritus of Devon Energy, gave the leadership PAC $5,000 in 2015. Other PACs filled in where the groups on Whitehouse’s poster fell short, providing Oklahoma Strong with $40,000 in 2015-2016 — 40 percent of which came from organizations with connections to the energy sector. Alliance Coal kicked in $5,000, for example, and $1,000 came from Cozen O’Connor, a law firm that has an energy, environmental and public utilities practice.(Side note: Pruitt might have preferred to have been nominated to the post by a different president; Oklahoma Strong gave $2,700 to former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) and nothing to the now-sitting chief executive.)The leadership PAC, of course, is just one of the routes by which the industry has shown its affection for Pruitt. Let’s go through some of the others:Pruitt’s campaign committee: Over the course of Pruitt’s 2010 and 2014 campaigns for Oklahoma’s Attorney General seat, his campaign committee, Scott Pruitt for Attorney General, received more than $256,500 from the energy sector, including contributions from Arch Coal and ONEOK, Inc. Pruitt ran unopposed in the 2014 race.Want icing on that cake? A co-chairman of his re-election campaign was Harold Hamm, the founder and CEO of oil and natural gas company Continental Resources — which is based in Pruitt’s state of Oklahoma.Overall, since 2002, Pruitt has directly received more than $350,000 in contributions from individuals and groups in the energy sector. (Before becoming AG, Pruitt had been in the Oklahoma state Senate, and ran an unsuccessful race for lieutenant governor in 2006.)Oklahoma is deeply and historically tied to oil and gas, and Pruitt has repeatedly battled federal regulations that could get in the industry’s way, suing EPA numerous times.“It’s not just a lawyer taking a position; this is someone who really believes in this,” said Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center. Pruitt “believes that environmental laws have become too restrictive on business.”The super PAC: In the 2016 cycle, Jeffrey McDougall, the founder and president of Oklahoma-based JMA Energy Company, contributed $25,000 to Liberty 2.0, a super PAC affiliated with Pruitt. The super PAC also received $50,000 from Murray Energy (one of the organizations on Whitehouse’s chart).The sole PAC contributor to Liberty 2.0 in the cycle was, fittingly, the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. The PAC gave Liberty 2.0 $2,500.Republican Attorneys General: The Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), the 527 advocacy group that Pruitt chaired in 2013 and 2014, received a whopping $425,000 from Pinnacle West Capital, an electric utility company, in the 2014 cycle. More contributions came from Ariel Corp ($300,000) and Koch Industries (over $130,000), among others.Under Pruitt’s leadership, RAGA also received more than $155,000 from the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit of which Pruitt was chairman until November 2016. Because the Rule of Law Defense Fund is a “social welfare” organization, it does not need to disclose its donors, so it’s unknown whether it received financial backing from energy groups.Other striking elements of Pruitt’s relationship with the energy sector include the 2011 letter he sent to EPA’s administrator claiming the agency “may be significantly overestimating methane emissions from natural gas production” — the twist being that the content of the letter was provided by Devon Energy lawyers, as later discovered by the New York Times. The attorney general’s staff sent the message, with Pruitt’s signature, after changing 37 of 1,016 words. And POLITICO reported that a new 501(c)(4) organization, Protecting America Now (not to be confused with Protect Americans Now, a different nonprofit), has formed to support Pruitt’s appointment.Given Pruitt’s proven track record, it’s reasonable to assume EPA under his leadership would be quite a different agency than it was under former President Barack Obama, when it embraced regulation and action to counter climate change.“What we can expect from this is a very weakened EPA that is going to give the energy sector a lot of freedom under environmental laws, and it’s going to do it under the philosophy of ‘leave it up to the states and let’s not hamper business,’” said Noble of the Campaign Legal Center. “But what’s going to suffer is any kind of approach toward national environmental regulation.”Neither Protecting America Now nor Trump’s transition team responded to requests for comment.A committee vote on Pruitt’s confirmation hasn’t yet been scheduled."

Thompson, ProPublicaA new national survey of more than 50,000 teens charts a surge in abusive and hateful behavior among young people since the beginning of the presidential election campaign.“Our biggest takeaway was that 70 percent of all respondents had witnessed bullying, hate speech or harassment since the 2016 election,” said Allison Turner, assistant press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, a prominent LGBT advocacy group that conducted the survey. HRC polled a large, though not demographically representative, sample of the nation’s youth.Race, sexual orientation, and immigration status were the factors most often linked to bullying and social marginalization, according to the survey, which documented the experiences of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18, many of them gay, lesbian, or transgender; some 45 percent of the teens who participated identified as heterosexual.Most of the teens surveyed said hateful incidents have been on the increase since the start of the highly contentious presidential campaign, which culminated with the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20.In recent months, phone calls, texts and instant messages have been pouring into the Trevor Project, a crisis center for LGBT young people, said social worker David W. Bond, a vice president with organization. The day after the election, Bond and his colleagues were deluged with young people seeking help.“The volume has continued to be higher than typical levels for November and December. This is very indicative of a higher level of emotional distress” for LGBT youth throughout the country, he said. “They’re clearly more distressed, so much that they feel the need to reach out for help.”In the survey, high school students described bus rides bristling with homophobic and racist epithets and attacks on student groups like the Gay-Straight Alliance.“The election results and the rhetoric going on in the media are enabling what would otherwise have been latent discrimination,” Bond said. His organization, he said, is now counseling youth confronted by a wave of more “obvious and observable discrimination that is seemingly more welcome in the public eye, unfortunately.”After more than 18 months of political invective aimed at Mexico and Mexican immigrants, Latino young people are, unsurprisingly, rattled. The survey found Latinos were “20 percent more likely than other youth to have been personally bullied.”Hate crimes and bias incidents are a national problem, but there’s no reliable data on their nature or prevalence. We’re collecting reports to create a national database for use by journalists and civil-rights organizations. See the project.An 18-year-old Californian reported a fear of speaking Spanish in public, while a young person in Illinois wrote, “My family and I go shopping and wash clothes at 2 am to avoid seeing and hearing people’s comments.”To conduct the survey, HRC and allied organizations used social-media platforms, including Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram to engage young people during December and January. The technique, called “convenience sampling” by researchers, in this case was likely to draw in participants who have experienced abuse, or are supportive of LGBT equality.Michael S. Pollard, a sociologist with the RAND Corporation who evaluated the survey and its methodology for ProPublica, said the study “was not designed to be representative of all US teens,” but its findings should be considered seriously because of the “very large group of adolescents” who took part.The surveyors acknowledged the limitations of the data, writing that “although the sample’s demographics do not reflect the full racial and ethnic diversity of the nation’s youth, the large number of participants allows us to nonetheless learn first-hand about the experiences” of young people across the nation, particularly those who may feel targeted.“We saw a lot of hateful speech during the election season,” said Turner of HRC. “We can see through our findings that this is affecting young people in a profound way.”"

It made me different,” singer Dyllan Murray told The Huffington Post. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58867f5a1200003e0aad954e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Singer Dyllan Murray wants his new video, “No Wrong Way,” to offer some comfort to members of the LGBTQ community who are concerned about their future under President Donald Trump. Directed by Guy Shalem, “No Wrong Way” explores both a mixed race, young gay couple’s relationship, as well as a budding romance between a transgender girl and a cisgender boy. Both couples appear to navigate some rough waters early on, but fortunately, love wins by the conclusion of the video, which can be viewed above. In 2015, Murray, 18, teamed up with Meghan Trainor and producer Jason “Poo Bear” Boyd with the idea of creating a musical “Christmas gift” to his gay dads. During the collaboration, he decided that the inclusive message of “No Wrong Way,” which features vocals by Kira Kosarin, should resound beyond his own experiences. “I never really thought about having a social rights song ― I never saw myself ever doing anything like that,” Murray told The Huffington Post. Still, he added, “I was always bullied because [having two dads] was not the ‘normal’ of everyone else. It made me different.” Working with Trainor, who has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ community in her own right, inspired Murray to channel his own feelings about queer issues into his music. “It was great to have her in the studio and collaborate, because [equality] is something that she really supports as well,” he said.Citing Justin Timberlake, Maroon 5 and Justin Bieber as influences, the Los Angeles-based singer now “wants to start speaking out, and helping other people talk about themselves in general and be open with others.” To start, he’s decided to donate proceeds from the sales of “No Wrong Way” to GLAAD and The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth advocacy organization. “It’s a scary time right now, and people are really worried about what’s going to happen next. There should be some sort of comfort,” he said. “People should still be able to open and not afraid to show who they really are.” As painful as the next four years may be for the LGBTQ community, America’s young, up-and-coming artists certainly know what’s good.

Many climate scientists say investing in clean energy, such as solar, water and wind power, can help combat climate change. Instead, Trump has called climate change a “hoax” and has pledged to revive the coal industry by stripping environmental regulations ― ignoring pleas from more than 800 science and energy experts.Trump’s “America First Energy Plan” is outlined on the White House website, which featured former President Barack Obama’s robust climate action plan before it was taken down hours after last week’s inauguration.The new president’s energy plan boasts that the Trump administration:... will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans.

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) could not resist asking Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) about it at Mulvaney’s Senate Budget Committee confirmation hearing.Merkley held up enlarged aerial photos of Obama’s 2009 inauguration and Trump’s 2017 inauguration. “Which crowd is larger, the 2009 crowd or the 2017 crowd?” Merkley asked.The photo of Obama’s inauguration was on the left, and Trump’s was on the right. “Senator, if you allow me to give the disclaimer that I’m not really sure how this ties to OMB, I’ll be happy to answer your question, which was from that picture, it does appear that the crowd on the left-hand side is bigger than the crowd on the right-hand side,” Mulvaney responded.Merkley, not yet satisfied, asked Mulvaney to clarify whether he disagreed with White House press secretary Sean Spicer that the press had conspired to distort the size of Trump’s audience and that in fact Trump’s inauguration was the best attended inaugural ceremony in U.S. history. Mulvaney declined to comment on Spicer’s remarks.“Again, I’m happy to comment on the photograph. I’m not familiar with the statements. I do agree that the photographs are as you represented them,” Mulvaney said.Merkley claimed that he was inquiring about the matter so thoroughly because as a top budget adviser to Trump, it would be essential that Mulvaney not share the same aversion to truth as some of Trump’s top advisers.He homed in on Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway’s defense of Spicer’s comments on Sunday as “alternative facts.”“Are you comfortable as you proceed as a key budget adviser presenting falsehoods as simply an alternative fact?” Merkley asked.Here too, Mulvaney managed to reassure Merkley without addressing Conway’s specific remarks.“I have every intent and believe that I have shown up until this point, in my time in Congress, that I am deadly serious about giving you hard numbers and I intend to follow through on that,” Mulvaney answered."
81,THE WORLDPOST,Merkel Calls For A More Open World: 'We Won't Get Anywhere' With Populism,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/germany-angela-merkel-populism_us_588681c2e4b096b4a2341e67,"German chancellor says it's counterproductive to try ""to solve problems with polarization.""",2017-01-24,"In a speech Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the rise of populism wouldn't get the world ""anywhere.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5886840a1c00002d00d93d44.jpeg?cache=KXz7GiKcud&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday said the populist hope to “return to a small world” would not benefit society, instead calling for openness and acceptance during a speech to church leaders in Würzburg, Germany.The address was one of the first Merkel gave this year. While it didn’t specifically address the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, it was a pointed remark about the spread of nationalism in America, Britain and across Europe that’s already begun to undermine international accords and threaten efforts to deal with the ongoing migrant crisis.“We won’t get anywhere by trying to solve problems with polarization and populism,” she said during the speech, according to Reuters. “We’ve got to show that we’re committed to the basic principles of our nation.”Merkel spoke about Germany’s role in shepherding nearly a million refugees from the Middle East into the country, saying society was put to “a hard test” last year, the Münchner Merkur reported.She continued to call on citizens and immigrants to work toward integration, while she acknowledged concerns over the amount and integration of migrants and refugees by saying that those who don’t have the right to stay in the country would have to leave.While Merkel has yet to meet Trump, the president already criticized the U.S. ally this month, saying that Merkel made an “utterly catastrophic mistake” by having an open-door policy on refugees.But despite the jab, Merkel said she’d look forward to exchanging “ideas with respect” with Trump following his darkly worded inaugural address on Friday, Reuters reported.“I say two things with regards to this [speech]: First, I believe firmly that it is best for all of us if we work together based on rules, common values and joint action in the international economic system, in the international trade system, and make our contributions to the military alliances,” she said Saturday.Since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the success of the far right Front National party in France, the chancellor has faced a growing call for Germany to be one of the last bastions of global democracy following Trump’s election. The New York Times said Merkel may be “the liberal west’s last defender,” while Politico said she may have to take up the mantle of “global savior.” “She’s the last one standing, and that makes her both strong and weak at the same time,” Stefan Kornelius, one of her biographers, told The New York Times in November. “She’s a pillar of stability, the last wall, and people want to lean against it.”Eline Gordts contributed reporting."

CEO Rex Tillerson becoming secretary of state. Senators narrowly voted along party lines on Monday to confirm Tillerson’s nomination.On Tuesday, Musk tweeted a December editorial from The Economist arguing that Tillerson had “the integrity to talk sense to his boss,” President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese and threatened to pull out of the Paris climate accord. “This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State,” Musk wrote in the tweet.“Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team,” he added. “His team is now the USA.”He then said: “I share The Economist’s opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise.”Under Tillerson, Exxon Mobil shifted away from its scorched-earth disinformation campaign denying the existence of global warming. During his confirmation hearings this month, Tillerson said he believes in climate change, though he rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions from burning fossil fuels are the chief cause. Still, in 2009, he publicly backed putting a tax on carbon, albeit as his preference to the cap-and-trade system then being debated in Congress. Musk, by contrast, may be one of the strongest advocates for climate science in the Fortune 500. His companies depend on it. In November, shareholders gave Musk the green light to merge Tesla, known for its luxury electric vehicles, with SolarCity, the solar energy firm he ran with his cousins. Musk envisions the combined company as a one-stop shop for zero-emissions vehicles, and home electricity and heating systems. His support for Tillerson may be more political than personal. Musk joined Trump’s economic advisory team last month, along with the chief executives of General Motors, Uber Technologies and other big firms. He met with the newly sworn-in president on Monday to discuss the future of U.S. manufacturing, of which Tesla aims to be a big part. The company is building factories in Nevada and New York. "

According to a plea agreement signed by Majerczyk, he illegally accessed accounts on Apple Inc’s iCloud and Alphabet Inc’s Google Gmail accounts belonging to more than 300 people, using an email “phishing” ploy to obtain their user names and passwords.Through this scheme, Majerczyk was able to access full iCloud backups belonging to numerous victims, including at least 30 celebrities, many of whom reside in the Los Angeles area, the plea agreement stated.Majerczyk, who resides in Chicago and Orland Park, Illinois, was originally charged in Los Angeles, but his case was transferred to Illinois as part of his plea agreement.(Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

Last month, the hospital shared a photo of Groth performing surgery on Facebook. As the picture shows, he had a very special patient.After operating on a 9-year-old boy, Groth performed surgery on the child’s stuffed Mike Wazowski, which he brought to the operating room for comfort and stress relief. Mike needed a little stitching up, and the doctor was more than happy to help him out. “I noticed that it had some tear and rips to one of the arms, so I fixed it for him,” Groth told hospital communications specialist Evan Solochek in an interview shared with The Huffington Post.When the little boy saw his Mike toy again, it “really brightened up his day,” his parents told the doctor. As it turns out, Dr. Groth is a regular Doc McStuffins. He and his colleagues at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin perform this special toy “surgery” fairly often. “Children are very attached to their toys, and surgery is very stressful,” Groth explained. “When they see that their toys have gone through a procedure like they have, it really helps them recover and brightens up their day. But also it allows them to relate to somebody and helps with their recovery.”Groth was surprised by all the attention he received after the hospital posted his photo on Facebook. He emphasized that so many other pediatric surgeons do similar things for their young patients and their stuffed sidekicks.“We just know the importance of trying to relate to children and doing little things like this,” he said. “People will put surgical masks on toys. It just helps the families and the children.”Keep scrolling to see more of Groth’s and his colleagues’ handiwork. "

Two years after the cuts, in 2008, at least 714 people across 46 states were sickened by salmonella traced to peanut paste produced at a Peanut Corporation of America factory in Blakely, Georgia.Nine people died, triggering one of the largest food safety recalls in U.S. history.

State officials said manpower and funding prevented inspections that could have spotted the contamination issues, according to media reports at the time.Perdue responded by restoring some of the money that had been cut from his Agriculture Department’s consumer protection division. In his final state budget, in 2010, funding for the division remained 22 percent below what it was when he took office.“You had to have a situation where you had a bunch of people die before Georgia got its act together,” Jaydee Hanson, senior policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety, told HuffPost. “Sonny Perdue may have helped cause it, and he may have helped correct it.”Perdue took office in 2003. His first budget, for fiscal 2004, provided $39.5 million for the Agriculture Department’s consumer protection division. Georgia, like many states, gets some of its food safety funding from federal government and contracted with the FDA to perform inspections.Two years later, the consumer protection division budget was slashed 29 percent, to $28.2 million. The impact of the cuts on food inspections, compared with other duties of the division, is unclear. Following the peanut factory scandal, Perdue signed legislation in 2009 that gave regulators authority set higher standards for food safety practices, testing and reporting. The state legislature approved funding for a new food processing program. The budget for the Agriculture Department’s consumer protection division increased slightly, though it remained far below what it was before Perdue’s term.The Peanut Corporation of America outbreak wasn’t Georgia’s first indication that its inspections of peanut processing facilities were inadequate.In 2007, at least 625 people were sickened after eating contaminated Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter in a salmonella outbreak traced to a Sylvester, Georgia, facility. ConAgra, Peter Pan’s parent company,  paid $11.2 million in fines for knowingly shipping tainted products that contributed to the outbreak. The Associated Press called it the largest criminal fine ever in a U.S. food safety case.It’s unclear whether Perdue personally had a role in cutting Georgia’s food inspection budget. A state Agriculture Department spokeswoman offered few specifics, but said there “are no direct ties of management” between the governor and the agriculture commissioner.Despite the deadly toll of the contamination, Perdue has his defenders.Bill Marler, a prominent food safety attorney who represented victims in the outbreak, said it would “probably be a stretch” to “put all the onus” on Perdue. The blame, he said, should primarily go to the companies and the regulators themselves.Still, Marler said he’s concerned about Trump administration signals to reverse food safety progress made under President Barack Obama.The FDA, together with the USDA, oversees the nation’s food supply. The FDA is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump’s nominee to lead that department — Rep.
