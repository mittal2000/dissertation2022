What has followed is a medley of genre-hopping roles ― you try going from “About Time” to “Frank” to “Unbroken” ― and a playful charm defined by his floppy red mane and bashful smile. Gleeson’s nice-guy image is part of what makes him effective as the screechy General Hux in the new “Star Wars” movies; we’re scared of him, and amused by him, because we don’t quite know where all that rage comes from. That same dynamic undergirds “A Futile and Stupid Gesture,” a comedic biopic about the satirical magazine National Lampoon that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this week ahead of its Netflix release on Friday. Gleeson plays Henry Beard, the gifted, witty, pipe-smoking misanthrope who co-founded the Lampoon after graduating from Harvard University. This is one of seven movies in the span of five months to feature Gleeson. In a couple of weeks, he’ll also star in a big-screen adaptation of “Peter Rabbit.” As usual, he’s never done anything resembling either project.At Sundance, I gabbed with Gleeson about the polarizing reactions to “mother!” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” which of his movies he knew he’d like before seeing them, and how thrilled he is for his “Goodbye Christopher Robin” co-star Margot Robbie’s Oscar nomination.You had a nice 2017. Between September and December, “American Made,” “mother!” (even if it didn’t do bonanza business), “Goodbye Christopher Robin,” “Crash Pad” and “Star Wars” opened. Now that we’re seeing so much of you, looking back, is there a moment when you felt your career had broken through?Yeah, but it’s all in retrospect. It never feels like it at the moment. These are stories we tell ourselves to make sense of our lives afterward, to put it in some context — and actually it’s not the way things really were at the time. It’s funny. It’s why I think, unless they’re diaries, no autobiography can really sum anybody up.Getting a job with the Coen brothers [in “True Grit”] was massive for me. Even though it was a small part and did not have a big effect on my career per se, working with them, I could have retired. I mean, I would have been stuck for money forever, but that was a high point. Working with Martin McDonagh [in “Six Shooter”] at the very beginning, huge. That was my first job. It was massive. And then doing “Anna Karenina” made me a better actor. Working with Joe Wright made me a better actor. And then, in 2015, I got to do an Alex Garland movie, “Ex Machina,” and there was “The Revenant” and a few things that came out around the same time that felt like, oh man, things came together, and I was in some stuff that mattered to people.And you say “mother!” did not do bonanza business. I don’t know whether they made their money back or anything like that, but more people saw “mother!’ than have seen most films I’ve been in, and I think that’s amazing. I adore that film. To me, that’s a total success, that movie, from top to bottom.In terms of your public profile, I think the shift happened between “Ex Machina” and “Brooklyn.” That’s when people started knowing your name and anticipating what was to come for you.Yeah, which is strange, though. That’s never really been the way I’ve thought of being successful as an actor, or breaking through, or anything like that. All you want is to contribute well to good pieces of work. That’s really the big thing. And I had done that before those films, and I contributed, even though it may have been small, to “True Grit” and to “The Lieutenant of Inishmore,” the Martin McDonagh play. It’s funny the way it’s perceived and the way that it feels.So let’s talk “mother!’ for a bit. Your role is small, and you didn’t do much press for the movie when it was opening. Did you keep up with the polarized reactions that came out of it? I loved it. I think anybody that had a problem with the movie has the right to have a problem with the movie. I understand why people would not enjoy that piece of work, in the same way that, with some of the great artists in a gallery, I will not engage with a painting that’s seen to be a masterpiece, and then I’ll walk up to the next one and maybe not everyone else likes it but I’ll spend an hour in front of it. It’s the same thing.The experience of making it — first of all, I got to make it with my brother, [Brian Gleeson]. We got to walk into a room to rehearse with Darren Aronosky, Jennifer Lawrence, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Harris, Javier Badem ― these giants who operate at such a high level. And me and my brother are nervously standing there before we went in to take this on. Even though it was only for two minutes of screen time, it was as exhilarating as anything else I’ve done in my life when it comes to work. It was a privilege to be a small part of that.Whatever anyone’s opinion of it, there aren’t many movies like “mother!” As you observed it, what was the technique used to create its mounting chaos?Darren explained to us the way he was shooting it, which was on Jen the whole time, and then over her shoulder and POV’d. They were going to be the three angles used in the film. I was like, “Fucking cool! Sign me up.” And then you get him to go about that business, and you concentrate on trying to be good in the scene. All of those actors have different ways of working. They all have different energies, and then I’ve got my own thing going, and so does Brian. So it was more about how we fit into the room, you know? That was the joyful thing. And when you would really feel it sing and you would hit it, it was just brilliant. I knew in the shooting of it that I would like the film, which I never know.You’ve never felt that on anything else?I knew I would like “Anna Karenina.” I knew I would like “Ex Machina.” I didn’t know whether anyone else would like them, but I knew I would. For some reason, those are the three things. Oh, and “Frank,” [directed by] Lenny Abrahamson.You’re in Lenny’s next movie, “The Little Stranger,” based on the Sarah Waters novel. As a horror fan, I can’t wait. Is it terrifying?I don’t know. I think it will mean something — I think that’s more important. And the book is not terrifying. The book is disquieting and odd. There’s an edge to it all the time — it’s just there, and it kind of vibrates. I hope the film has something of that in it.I don’t know if you keep up with what people say about you online —I try not to.The internet —and I include myself in that — likes General Hux a lot. Partly because he’s an interesting character for that universe, but also because he’s just so screamy. He’s teed up at every turn. It’s fun to watch. What were your conversations with J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson about the kind of screen presence you would bring to that role?Well, J.J. needed him to occupy a certain place in the first movie. He needed him to be the Peter Cushing type in that film. But because they cast it so much younger, it didn’t make sense to try to give him all the gravitas that Cushing had. Instead, he gave him a kind of mania about maintaining his position. He wants to succeed Snoke, but he knows Kylo Ren is the favored son. It’s this deep insecurity, and they’re the worst bullies. The guy who gets beaten up at school then goes home and kicks the shit out of his brother, you know what I mean? They’re the worst. And I think that was the kind of thing that we wanted him to have. He knows that he’s always on the edge of losing everything. He’s just desperate to maintain position and to improve, and as a result he’s just a very nasty piece of work.That was with J.J., and then Rian had this thing where he wanted to use that in a different way in the second film. He was really smart. The one thing I didn’t want to lose was the possibility that he could still matter to the story. He could still do something that could change things, not just be a punching bag. And Rian said, “OK, well, if a dog is kicked enough, when he eventually bites, it’s going to be hard.” So that’s what we tried to put in there, to have all the fun with it that he wanted to have but still maintain the [original concept]. We thought, if he had a knife, he would gut you like a fish. I think that’s the place we wanted to go with the second one.I was really happy with it. If J.J. decides to use me in the third one, I just can’t wait to see what he’s got planned, because he’s so smart.Is there a question about whether he’ll use you?I think there’s a question about whether he’ll use anybody. You just don’t know until they send you a script.Are you not contracted for a third movie?Everyone had to sign up for three, as far as I know — or at least that’s what I was told. But you don’t know; it could be that you die in an explosion in a ship that nobody sees and they go, “Hux is dead!” So I’m waiting to see.Did you keep up with the so-called backlash surrounding “The Last Jedi”?Yeah, I’ve heard about it, of course. I respect anybody’s opinion to not be happy with something. If you pay your 10 bucks and you go and watch the movie and you don’t like it, it is your right to express that online. It’s your right to not like somebody, or to not like the whole thing, or whatever. All I know is how I feel about it, and I’m really glad that Rian changed things up and brought some of himself to it, in the same way that J.J. brought himself to it. I really like Rian’s films. I think this is a “Star Wars” film and it’s also a Rian Johnson film. And both of those things excite me equally.Have you seen “Jupiter Ascending,” the Wachowski siblings movie?I’ve not, no, but my friend Eddie Redmayne is in it.Well, funny you say that. There are similarities between Eddie Redmayne’s villain in that movie and General Hux. They both have a loud, manic, bitter energy. I was curious whether you’d ever heard that comparison. No, I have not. I haven’t talked to Eddie for ages, which is a pity because he is the nicest man and the most brilliant actor. I really hope to catch up with him soon. I’ll be sure to bring it up with him next time we talk.Please do. Tell me if you disagree: “A Futile and Stupid Gesture” is your most traditionally comedic role yet. Yeah, well, perhaps in terms of it being an out-and-out comedy, except really Henry Beard in this film functions as a dramatic constituent, as well as having a couple of funny moments. It was a joy to play with these people. Matt Walsh is an absolute genius. Will Forte is just amazing. All of these great people who I got to be around and do scenes with. I loved it. But I’m aware of my weaknesses, and ad-libbing genius one-liners, which is what Henry Beard would do in real life, is not my forte, if you’ll excuse the pun. Luckily, the script took care of all that for me. I loved it. The world was very distinct.Jerry Seinfeld was talking recently about what the best sitcoms have, or the best movies, and it’s a good universe. It’s a world you want to spend time in. It understands itself. They understood the world so well, so I felt I understood it. Fitting into it was lovely.This is one of several movies that uses meta storytelling, with the older version of Will Forte’s character narrating scenes in person without actively participating in them. I’ve seen a couple others at Sundance that break the fourth wall, and “I, Tonya” did it in a big way last year. Oh, that was brilliant. Brilliant. Margot Robbie, fucking hell.I’m glad she got the Oscar nomination. Oh, I know! I just heard about it. Fucking hell! It’s like I’m excited for her, but she deserves it, you know what I mean? It’s amazing.But here’s the thing: The meta thing I have limited patience for a lot of the time. When a genius does it, like Charlie Kaufman, he comments on the way the story is being told. He does it with soul. The whole world understands itself.Like in “Adaptation.”“Adaptation,” yeah. It’s beautiful what he does with that. I think when it’s used cheaply, it feels really cheap. I think “I, Tonya” uses it really, really well, reminding people that just because we’re telling you this story that does not mean that’s exactly what happened. They use it really well. And I think this film used it for all the right reasons and in all the right ways. So that makes me happy. But when a film starts to be happy with itself because it believes itself to be clever, I have very limited patience.“Peter Rabbit” opens in a few weeks. What is the appeal of that role for you as an actor? I haven’t seen it yet, so that’s not meant as a value judgment.Oh, I haven’t either. Rose Byrne was attached.That is a good appeal. That’s a reason to do any job. Will Gluck was directing it, and I really love “Easy A.” The script was really funny, and it was just a different thing for me to try. I’d never done a kids movie, or anything like that. If it makes kids laugh, what’s purer than that?In the same way that some people aren’t crazy about things that happen in “The Last Jedi,” I’m sure there will be people who “Peter Rabbit” means a lot to who’ll be unsure. But I will understand that. I’ve got a feeling that the limited number of young children I know will laugh at it, and if you make a kid laugh, I don’t care how you do it. I think it’s smart and clever, and it has a heart. I hope it’s funny. I want to watch it with a room full of kids. That will tell me whether it works.Do you often have that experience, where your movie is opening in a matter of weeks and you haven’t laid eyes on it yet?You always see bits and pieces in ADR and stuff. With “Peter Rabbit,” it’s different because all the animated stuff is in post-production, so they’re doing their own thing. Yeah, I didn’t see “The Last Jedi” until I was in the theater watching it the first night. The same with “The Force Awakens.” “Mother!” was the same. It often happens. And it’s exciting. Watching it with an audience is the way to do it.And with the others, do you just get a screener and watch it at home?Yeah, and you just hate yourself. It’s better to watch it with a bunch of other people who can tell you whether they hate you or not. It’s the sad reality.The marketing campaign behind “mother!” was so enigmatic. At the press screening at the Toronto Film Festival, at 9 a.m. on a Sunday, everyone was giddy because we knew very little about the movie. It’s a stark contrast to “Star Wars,” which teases its characters and certain plot points months in advance. The “Force Awakens” trailer came out more than a year before the movie opened. That’s blockbuster culture in a nutshell, and I’m curious what you make of that saturation, compared to the mysterious “mother!” rollout, knowing that you didn’t see either until you were with an audience. Well, I think a script is always going to be very different than a movie. I’d only read the script, and I got a sense of what was happening on the set, but no, the escalating madness of “mother!” sat me back in my seat and had me overwhelmed at times. I had felt that way reading the script. I had to put the script down, take a walk, go back to the script, because it was so full-on.But one of the great joys in seeing something that you don’t know much about is not knowing the ending of the thing before you see it. There’s a reason that watching “The Usual Suspects” and knowing the ending is different than watching “The Usual Suspects” for the first time. Those are some of the moments that you live for, like, what the fuck is happening? And when something really takes you with it, that’s a special moment.But when you have a train that is just barreling forward, some people are not going to stay with it. Some people are going to get off. And if it doesn’t stop, they’re not getting off politely — they’re going to be thrown and roll 17 times down the ditch and say, “What the fuck was that?” I think that’s the effect of “mother!,” but I’d rather be in something like that instead of something where you’re like, “Huh, that is lovely.”Your episode of “Black Mirror” is often ranked among the show’s best. Have you watched the new season?“USS Calister,” [the first episode of the season], is the only one I’ve seen. Cristin Milioti is an absolute delight in it. “Delight” sounds cheap, actually. She’s just fucking brilliant. It’s brilliant acting. And Jesse Plemons is wonderful. I thought it was a fantastic piece of work. It’s so cleverly judged as well, because when Jesse starts doing that voice [at the start], you’re like, this is amazing — am I watching this for a whole episode? And then when he walks into that office and he looks so different! Oh man, it’s just absolutely brilliant. And Cristin judged that journey, that arc so well, with such humor, in the middle of it all. When “Black Mirror” gets it right, it gets it so right."
2,MEDIA,NY Daily News Editor Accused Of Harassment Fostered A Culture Of Silence,Andy Campbell and Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daily-news-rob-moore_us_5a68d1c8e4b0e5630075d434,"Managing editor Rob Moore told staffers he would get rid of people who complained about his behavior, sources said.",2018-01-26,New York Daily News managing editor Rob Moore is seen in a photo from April 2017.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a7af62d00001f00942d41.jpeg?cache=bLnPHzOyoH&ops=crop_849_0_862_591%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"At the New York Daily News, the managing editor, Rob Moore, has been heard on more than one occasion offering a piece of advice to those around him: Don’t go to human resources to complain about me, or you’re out of here.“I heard that with my own ears,” said a former female staffer. “It was like his motto.”This wasn’t bluster. This was a tactic. A second former staffer said Moore for years would brag openly about punishing or firing employees who complained about him ― specifically as a warning to other would-be complainants. The message was well understood, and it reverberated around the newsroom. New York Daily News employees warned one another not to get on Moore’s “bad side,” said a third former staffer.When people did complain about Moore’s behavior, he would publicly express his anger, said three staffers. Tabloid newsrooms are known for being crude and volatile places to work, particularly for young reporters ― another top editor at the paper is also currently under investigation ― but Moore’s brand of harassment could be “more cruel” than the tongue-lashings often delivered to young reporters, said a fourth former staffer.“He always seemed like someone who revelled in having power and lording it over the people that he could,” said a fifth former staffer. A sixth added, “He had all the power there, and it wouldn’t be good to be on the receiving end of his fury.”Earlier this week, the Daily News’ new corporate parent, Tronc, launched an investigation into Moore after NPR asked the company about a sexual harassment complaint lodged against him in December, soon after he reportedly interviewed to become the newspaper’s new editor-in-chief.For many people who’ve worked with Moore, the surprise wasn’t that he had come under investigation, but that it had taken so long.“Everyone knew about this ― like, everyone,” said the first staffer.HuffPost has spoken to more than 20 current and former employees of the Daily News, many of whom asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. “He’s an incredibly vengeful guy,” said one of them. The sources described a wide spectrum of inappropriate and threatening behavior ― both in public and in private ― by a man who abused his position of power inside the Daily News’ “frathouse” atmosphere in a way that kept many employees quiet. Moore and Tronc both did not respond to requests for comment for this article.(Note: One of the reporters on this story, Andy Campbell, interviewed for a position under Moore in 2014, when he was offered, but did not accept, a job.)Moore first joined the Daily News as a reporter in 2004. From the start, said several former employees, it was clear he had a big personality and plenty of ambition. He had a knack for editing, too, and soon rose up the masthead.“He had really, really good strengths,” said one former staffer, “and really, really horrible negatives.”In the office, he had a habit of calling employees over to show them photos of women he’d slept with, according to multiple former staffers. “When it came to his sexual harassment, it often consisted of him bragging about his sexual exploits,” one staffer said. “He would often make co-workers uncomfortable with his bragging, sometimes showing pictures — not naked pictures, but certainly suggestive pictures — of women he was with.”One staffer said Moore commented on her appearance on multiple occasions, calling her “hot” and texting her to come out after work. “I was just very uncomfortable each time I went to the office, because I knew I had to pass his desk and then would get a text from him,” the woman said. “Most of the time I’d ignore his text, but at times I’d say I was busy and couldn’t go out because of one thing or another, so I never gave him a chance for anything worse.”At bars, he hit on waitresses, then insulted their looks in front of other employees when he got turned down, according to a former staffer.Most of the behavior was out in the open and witnessed by many. Still, Moore commanded respect in the newsroom, staffers said, and expected people to express their respect for and loyalty to him. “If they didn’t play the game, then they would be frozen out,” said one former staffer.At least six people HuffPost spoke to used the word “bully” to describe Moore. “You’re never supposed to be afraid of your editor, but he was one of those editors who would honestly strike fear into you,” said one former staffer. “He didn’t treat people professionally,” another former staffer said. “He would hold grudges based on stuff that had nothing to do with the office. It didn’t take him long to size you up as someone he liked or didn’t like, and it often had nothing to do with the quality of your work.”Others noted that Moore’s behavior on social media was unprofessional and “thirsty.” He took particular interest in models on Facebook, commenting publicly on their racy photos ― a practice that doesn’t necessarily violate any workplace policies, but that staffers said made them uncomfortable and was “unbecoming” of upper management. Considering Moore’s threats about firing or laying off those who complained about him, some employees worried that any complaint lodged against him would end in their dismissal.“That’s why nobody reported him to HR ― you’d get in trouble,” said one former staffer. “You just kind of kept your head down and tried to keep out of his field of attack.”In part, multiple people said, Moore was a reflection of his environment ― a male-dominated tabloid paper where women were objectified. “The whole newsroom had this really misogynistic undertone,” said one staffer. “They were all running around behaving in terrible ways, creating a sexualized environment and a toxic environment. It took a lot of people in charge to do that.”Moore isn’t alone in being investigated. On Thursday, HuffPost confirmed that Tronc is also looking into allegations of workplace harassment against Alexander “Doc” Jones, the managing editor of the Sunday desk. Six employees HuffPost spoke to said Jones had a “pattern” of behaving creepily toward young women in the newsroom.“As a woman starting a job at the Daily News, you’re given a card key and a warning about Doc,” a current staffer told us.The accusations include multiple incidents of forcible kissing, and five employees told us that Jones had a penchant for bringing young women to his side of the newsroom for the sole purpose of ogling them.“I stopped wearing dresses to work. I stopped wearing makeup, too,” another employee said. “I purposely tried to not look like myself for fear of being summoned to Doc’s desk.”Jones was escorted out of the newsroom on Thursday by a human resources employee, but Tronc confirmed to HuffPost that he was still employed.The paper has new ownership and a freshly minted interim editor-in-chief in Jim Kirk, the former interim editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles Times. What happens next to Jones and Moore is anyone’s guess.“Media, as you know, is a tough enough biz to work in these days,” one staffer said. “It’s even tougher for women, because you have men like Rob and Doc contaminating the culture.”"
3,WEIRD NEWS,This Bar Says It Will Kick You Out If You Use The Word 'Literally',Andy McDonald,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bar-literally-kick-you-out_us_5a6a4031e4b06e253265d6e7,"Will they? Like, literally?",2018-01-26,"A September 2017 photo of the exterior of Continental, a Manhattan bar whose signage about the word ""literally"" caused a stir this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a55e02d00001f00942d30.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Continental is a rather infamous dive bar in New York City’s East Village. There’s a large, hard-to-ignore sign outside promising, in its most recent iteration, “6 shots of anything $12.”Last week, musician Eden Brower noticed a different sign taped in the window of the bar, announcing that the word “literally” had been banned from the establishment.Brower tweeted a photo of the sign, which read, in all caps:Sorry but if you say the word ‘literally’ inside Continental you have 5 minutes to finish your drink and then you must leave. If you actually start a sentence with ‘I literally,’ you must leave immediately!!! This is the most overused, annoying word in the English language and we will not tolerate it.Seems like a rather extreme solution to that “problem,” but OK. The bar updated the sign days later, throwing shade at one of America’s most famous families by stating, “Stop Kardashianism now!”Bar owner Trigger Smith has since told Timeout New York that the sign is just a joke, and that his bar would be empty if he actually enforced the rule. “How could I mean that? How could I be serious?” he said. “I literally feel sorry for anybody who would take this seriously.”But not everyone was laughing. When the sign went viral, some people on Twitter raised the issue of sexism, saying the sign is an example of the continued policing of how (primarily) women speak. The unnecessary mention of the Kardashians certainly helps make that case.Before Smith clarified he was kidding, Art Silverman, senior producer of NPR’s “All Things Considered,” encouraged people to “literally test the waters” at Continental by using the word and seeing if they get thrown out.Even though Smith has clarified the whole thing is a joke, we’d still be interested to see how that experiment ends.So did Smith do it all for publicity? Continental is closing its doors for good on Jan. 30, after 27 years. Smith wrote on the bar’s website that “if we’re very, very busy for the remainder, it’s possible that we’ll have the funds to relocate!” The new sign has certainly gotten people’s attention.And if history has taught us anything, it’s that aggressively telling people not to do something is a pretty surefire way to make them do that thing."

Many accused the “Ridin’” singer of wanting publicity after Detroit Free Press reporter Niraj Warikoo tweeted a screenshot of the email the rapper sent inquiring about how to get in touch with the family.The artist answered with two videos posted Tuesday, lamenting that Warikoo had made the email public and rejecting any notion that he had reached out to the reporter for the sake of attention.“I would like to say thank you to the wonderful people on social media that did more than just criticize, the people who helped me get in touch with Jorge García’s wife, Cindy García,” the rapper said in the first video. “We had a dope conversation. I believe she has and will continue to be an amazing advocate for immigrant rights.”“My parents are immigrants, so I feel some type of way,” he added. He then directed any fans who, like him, believe immigrants are being treated unfairly to Cindy García’s GoFundMe page.In the second video, Chamillionaire addressed those who said they didn’t understand why a black man would help a Mexican-American family. “A lot of people here be saying they don’t understand why a black man would want to help Mexicans and nonsense like, ‘They don’t do nothing for us.

I know a lot of y’all have been misled to believe the toxic narrative that ‘Mexicans are doing this, and Mexicans are doing that,’ like they aren’t valuable contributors to our economy and our society.”The star then explained how it was Mexicans who helped him and his music succeed at the beginning of his career. “Here’s a little history lesson, ‘Ridin’ Dirty’ was produced by two Mexicans; the manager that took it to the top of the charts: Mexican; one of the retailers that sold the most mixed tapes for me was Mexican ― but he didn’t work at the store, he owned it; and guess who showed up at the shows? You guessed it,” he added. “If you don’t have respect for immigrants or you don’t have respect for minorities or you don’t have respect for women ― it’s going to be very difficult for you, yeah I’m talking to you, to understand why the other side needs to treated fairly.”García’s story made headlines after cameras captured his family’s emotional farewell at Detroit’s Metro Airport earlier this month. “Yes, he was brought here at 10 years old and yes, he entered the country illegally, but he has no criminal record and his case needs to be looked at individually because he deserves to be here in a country that he’s known ― not Mexico,” wife Cindy García told CNN at the time.Warikoo was one of the many reporters to write about the case.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6b464a1600004500138e83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Elton John found out that Prince Harry was in love in the unlikeliest of places last year ― during their time together at a camp in Italy. “I spent some time with him at Google camp in Sicily last summer and I could tell that he was totally in love,” the 70-year-old singer, who is a longtime friend of the royal family, said during an interview with ITV’s “Lorraine” show on Thursday. “He didn’t really discuss much personally, but he said ‘I’m in love,’ and I thought, good for you.” he said.Prince Harry and Prince William both “seem to be ecstatically happy, and that’s all you want people to be, no matter who they are,” John added. “When people get married, you want it to last, you want them to be happy. I’m happy for him, I hope they have a wonderful day.”When asked if he would perform at the wedding, the entertainer played coy and said he would be playing in Las Vegas, so he wasn’t sure. John added that he hadn’t even been invited to the wedding yet. “It would be nice” to attend, John said, “because I love him dearly. We’re working very closely on AIDS projects with him. You know, both of those boys are very special to me because of their mother. He’s a good boy, his heart’s in the right place and all you want is for people to be happy.” John also spoke during the interview about his late friend, Princess Diana, and opened up about what it was like losing her some 20 years ago. “I loved her because she did so much for AIDS and she was a great friend to me,” he said. “We had a falling out, but we reconciled in the end.” He added: “It was an extraordinary summer. Gianni Versace was murdered [in July 1997], and then Diana rang me up and we reconciled. And six weeks later, I’m in the same house, and she’s dead. It was extraordinary, and I just couldn’t believe what was going on.” John has been on a press tour lately, after announcing his retirement from touring just a few days ago. The singer said that he’s going on a three-year, 300-date tour, and insisted this will be the only farewell tour he’ll ever do. “I’m 71. I can’t physically do the traveling anymore,” he said during a press conference with moderator Anderson Cooper at New York’s Gotham Hall on Wednesday. “I want to be at home. I really want to spend time with my children at home. I’ve had an incredible life, but life is all about change.”"

Steven Spielberg is gearing up to remake “West Side Story,” and Broadway World reports he’s looking to cast Spanish-speaking Latino actors as the film’s Puerto Rican leads. The original film released in 1961 cast white actors as Shark leader Bernardo (played by Greek-American actor George Chakiris) and his younger sister Maria (played by Natalie Wood, who was of Ukrainian descent). Puerto Rican actress Rita Moreno played Bernardo’s girlfriend, Anita. She and Chakiris both won Oscars for the film.Marci Liroff, a casting director, tweeted out a casting call on Thursday that specified that Maria, Anita and Bernardo are Latino characters. Moreno, 86, gave a candid interview last year about the brownface used in the original “West Side Story.” Anita’s accent “didn’t make any sense at all,” she said on the “In The Thick” podcast, adding that the makeup for the Puerto Rican characters was “extremely dark.” Even Moreno’s skin was darkened for the movie, she said. “We all had the same color makeup, it was a very different time,” she recalled. “I remember saying to the makeup man one day ― because it was like putting mud on my face, it was really dark and I’m a fairly fair Hispanic ― and I said to the makeup man one day, ‘My God! Why do we all have to be the same color? Puerto Ricans are French and Spanish.’ And it’s true, we are very many different colors. We’re Taino Indian; we are black, some of us.”"

Many of them, frustrated with Trump’s policies, decided to run for office in an attempt to energize a disjointed and fractious Democratic Party. Hanif Johnson is one of those Democrats.Johnson won the seat in the general election for the Dauphin County Magisterial District in Pennsylvania on Election Day last year, becoming the youngest Magisterial District Judge in the state at 27 years old. The Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, native began his term in January and will preside over cases within the predominately black state capital. “When you sit back, and you see Donald Trump become president, and you hear about all of these things we are being affected by, it seems like everything happens through the court system,” Johnson told HuffPost, explaining why he decided to run for the seat. “Everybody always says, well, we complain about stuff, but we never get up and do anything. This is me getting up and doing something.”Johnson is no stranger to the other side of the law. He has been to jail three times and ran through the streets as a teenager before he discovered his passion: track and field. “One day, I decided this ain’t the way I want to live my life, so I started running track. Track actually saved my life,” Johnson said, later becoming a state champion. Johnson currently coaches track and field at Harrisburg High School.As a student at Penn State University, Johnson ran afoul of the law again, this time as a member of his fraternity, Omega Psi Phi. While he was president of the fraternity, he was charged in connection with hazing allegations. “I went to jail for two weeks, then I went to trial. Thank God I won,” Johnson recalled. “That was one of the happiest days; I just felt like my life was going to be taken from me.”“It’s crazy because I know how it feels sitting across from that judge and that jury when you’re innocent,” he said. Now, Johnson has an opportunity to make a difference. “Being that I live in that area, they know me, I know the people, I know what’s going on,” the father of one said. “You have single moms that can’t pay a parking ticket; I have the control to make life easier for her, rather than someone from out of town who don’t understand that $100 ticket might be too much for her and she ends up in jail over that ticket.”Johnson said his win provided energy to other young people in the area to run for city council, school board and other local positions. “A lot of people came out the house and voted just because I was running,” he said. “If you want to do something and make a change, then just go out and do it.”A magisterial district judge is a position elected by residents. A law degree isn’t required to take on this role; district judges receive training that prepares them for the legal issues they will face and must pass an examination before taking office. They handle traffic citations, minor criminal cases and determine if cases are either thrown out or go on to the Court of Common Pleas, where major cases are heard.“Essentially, if you receive a traffic citation and you want to plead guilty to it or you want to appeal it, they are the first line for that,” a spokesperson for Pennsylvania’s Unified Judicial System told HuffPost. “They also hear cases for other offenses as well. It is an elected position.” The young judge said people closed the door in his face while he was on the campaign trail. Residents were hesitant to cast their vote for someone so young. “They laughed at me in my face,” Johnson They said, ‘Boy, if you don’t get away from my house saying you want to be a judge. You are too young!’ But after the fourth or fifth conversation, I would ask them who they are voting for, and they would say me.”“I guess I’m not a joke anymore,” he said. "

In Sydney, that multiple was 12.9; Vancouver was 12.6.The study covered housing prices from the third quarter of 2017 for 293 metropolitan housing markets in Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. Comparing median home prices to the median income in each area shows that the world’s most unaffordable housing continues to be in Hong Kong and in Australia. Next on the unaffordable list were San Jose, California, with housing costing 10.3 times the median income, and Melbourne, Australia, at 9.9. They were followed by Los Angeles (9.4), Honolulu (9.2), San Francisco (9.1) and Auckland, New Zealand (8.8).Demographia ranks any score above 5.1 as “severely unaffordable.” “There are no affordable markets in Australia, China (Hong Kong), Japan, New Zealand, Singapore or the United Kingdom,” Demographia reported.The report states 20 of Australia’s 22 markets, all of New Zealand’s eight markets, and 28 of the United Kingdom’s 33 markets ranked as either seriously or severely unaffordable.Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver retained their rankings from the the previous year’s survey, but their median multiples increased in 2018. The 2017 survey showed Hong Kong with a median multiple of 18.1, Sydney 12.2 and Vancouver 11.8. Demographia said Hong Kong recorded its eighth straight year as most unaffordable market, while Sydney hit the highest median multiple outside of Hong Kong.Demographia’s ranking of most-affordable markets is good news for North Americans, with 12 of the top 13 in the U.S. and Canada. Youngstown, Ohio, recorded the lowest median multiple of 1.9, followed by Moncton, New Brunswick, and Utica, New York, at 2.1.In major housing markets, the U.S. had the top 10 most-affordable, with Rochester, New York, at the top (median multiple of 2.5), followed closely by Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; Oklahoma City; Pittsburgh; Detroit and St Louis.“Among the 293 markets, Ireland and the United States have the most affordable housing,” Demographia said. “Among the 76 severely unaffordable markets, 30 are in the United States, 16 in Australia, 15 in Canada, 10 in the United Kingdom, seven in Canada, six in New Zealand and one in China.”Demographia said “there are some signs of progress” by world governments in addressing housing affordability, such as increasing supply of housing stock. But the group said more had to be done to ensure housing remained affordable for all people.“The key to both housing affordability and an affordable standard of living is a competitive market that produces housing (including the cost of associated land) at production costs, including competitive profit margins,” the report said.High housing costs, Demographia said, drain other areas of the economy. “The extraordinarily high house prices have significantly reduced discretionary income in the costly markets that could otherwise be used for other goods and services. Not only would this additional consumption (or savings) increase the standard of living, but it would also lead to higher levels of employment and economic growth,” the report said.“Further, the higher housing prices feed the demand for more low-income affordable housing, which requires public subsidies. The higher prices make the housing market unaffordable for more households.”Read the full report on Demographia’s website."

So (for) the cloning of primate species, including humans, the technical barrier is now broken,” Muming Poo, who helped supervise the program at the institute, told reporters in a conference call.“The reason ... we broke this barrier is to produce animal models that are useful for medicine, for human health. There is no intention to apply this method to humans.”Genetically identical animals are useful in research because confounding factors caused by genetic variability in non-cloned animals can complicate experiments. They could be used to test new drugs for a range of diseases before clinical use.The two newborns are now being bottle fed and are growing normally. The researchers said they expect more macaque clones to be born over the coming months.Since Dolly - cloning’s poster child - was born in Scotland in 1996, scientists have successfully used SCNT to clone more than 20 other species, including cows, pigs, dogs, rabbits, rats and mice.Similar work in primates, however, had always failed, leading some experts to wonder if primates were resistant.The new research, published on Wednesday in the journal Cell, shows that is not the case. The Chinese team succeeded, after many attempts, by using modulators to switch on or off certain genes that were inhibiting embryo development.Even so, their success rate was extremely low and the technique worked only when nuclei were transferred from foetal cells, rather than adult ones, as was the case with Dolly. In all, it took 127 eggs to produce two live macaque births.“It remains a very inefficient and hazardous procedure,” said Robin Lovell-Badge, a cloning expert at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who was not involved in the Chinese work.“The work in this paper is not a stepping-stone to establishing methods for obtaining live born human clones. This clearly remains a very foolish thing to attempt.”The research underscores China’s increasingly important role at the cutting-edge of biosciences, where its scientists have at times pushed ethical boundaries.Three years ago, for example, researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou caused a furor when they reported carrying out the first experiment to edit the DNA of human embryos, although similar work has now been done in the United States.Scientists at the Shanghai institute said they followed international guidelines for animal research set by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, but called for a debate on what should or should not be acceptable practice in primate cloning."

Yet in the months before its opening, the film provoked street protestors to burn effigies of director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and prompted a showdown in India’s Supreme Court over whether state governments can ban the movie. Hundreds of women have threatened to commit suicide, and in some states, theater companies scrapped plans to screen the movie for fear of violence. Watch the trailer for “Padmaavat” below. “Padmaavat” is a dramatic retelling of the story of the Hindu queen Padmavati, wife of the king Ratan Sen, from the Rajput warrior clan. According to tradition, Padmavati was so beautiful that a Muslim ruler, Alauddin Khilji, waged battle against Sen’s entire kingdom in order to capture her. But Padmavati commits suicide by self-immolation before the ruler could claim her. Some Hindu groups in India, particularly those linked to the Rajput clan, are outraged at how they believe Padmavati is portrayed in the new film. The protestors, led by the group Shri Rajput Karni Sena, claim the director distorted history and disrespected their legendary queen by portraying Padmavati in an intimate romantic scene with the Muslim ruler. The producers deny that such a scene is part of the film, the BBC reports. Several reviewers who viewed the movie have confirmed this.The protestors have also complained that the movie cheapens the heroic acts of Padmavati, played by the popular Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone.The uproar puzzles some onlookers. Many protestors have yet to see the film and are basing their fury on hearsay, The New York Times reports. In addition, scholars of Indian history actually are uncertain whether the queen was a real historical figure.The Muslim ruler Alauddin Khilji and his Hindu opponent Ratan Sen are real figures from 14th-century India. Padmavati’s story was immortalized two centuries later, in an epic poem by the mystic Malik Muhammad Jayasi. The filmmakers have said the movie is inspired by that poem.Bollywood films that illustrate historical encounters between Muslims and Hindus, India’s majority religion, are often controversial, Reuters reports. And, as Hindu nationalism rises in the country, the film has become a symbol of growing cultural tensions. Bollywood is a “soft target” that generates “instant publicity” for groups or individuals attacking it, said Anjum Rajabali, an Indian screenwriter. The protests around “Padmaavat” have helped further the myth of Hindu sentiments under siege, Rajabali wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times in December. “Even a fictional queen and a Muslim king have become tools to garner Hindu votes,” Rajabali wrote. “Fabricating a hostile ‘other’ helps retain power. The methodology has been transparent — generate fear and hatred, and use those to legitimate violence.”“Padmaavat” was the subject of protests months before the film was released. Last January, Bhansali was reportedly assaulted on set by a mob of protestors. And in March, Indian media reported that the movie’s sets were vandalized and set on fire, causing extensive damage to costumes. Last year, a leader from India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party called for the beheading of the film’s lead actress and the director.Four Indian states, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, imposed bans on the film. India’s Supreme Court stepped in earlier this month to overturn the bans and clear the way for “Padmavaat’s” release across the country.The protests picked up steam this week, ahead of the movie’s opening.In a letter to India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a group of Rajput women in Rajasthan expressed willingness to commit suicide over the film. Police in the area told Times Now News that they believe the threats were hollow.On Wednesday, a mob of protestors threw rocks at a school bus on the outskirts of Delhi.As the movie debuted on Thursday, protestors vandalized shops in the state of Rajasthan and waved swords and burned tires in Bihar to show their displeasure, Reuters reports.“If you have freedom of writers, freedom of expression, we too have freedom of protest,” Lokendra Singh Kalvi, head of the Shri Rajput Karni Sena, told Reuters.Rituparna Chatterjee, an editor at HuffPost India, pointed out the irony of the protests.“The local groups fighting relentlessly for days now to defend a possibly fictional queen’s honor, have had no qualm in issuing threats to the woman who plays the titular role,” Chatterjee wrote in a blog.Chatterjee also saw the Karni Sena’s protests as signs that the group is seeking greater political clout and wants to become India’s next “foot soldiers of nationalism.”“The Sena has been desperately looking for a cause, apart from Rajput rights, to make their agitations mainstream.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a0ecb2d00004900942cc4.jpeg?cache=S55iJicrEh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After years of LGBTQ social advances, acceptance of the queer community in the United States appears to be on the decline. A new GLAAD survey unveiled Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has found a “swift and alarming” drop in overall acceptance of LGBTQ people. It also recorded a “significant” increase in the number of LGBTQ people who say they’ve experienced discrimination on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. The 2018 Accelerating Acceptance report found that 49 percent of the non-LGBTQ respondents identified themselves as LGBTQ “allies” in 2017, down from 53 percent in 2016. At the same time, 55 percent of the LGBTQ respondents said they experienced anti-queer discrimination last year, compared to 44 percent in 2016. Advocates said it was the first time in the four-year history of the report, which surveyed more than 2,100 Americans over the age of 18, that the results had indicated a drop in LGBTQ acceptance. Among the other troubling findings in the report, which was conducted in November on GLAAD’s behalf by the New York-based research firm Harris Poll: 31 percent said they were very or somewhat uncomfortable seeing a same-sex couple holding hands (up from 29 percent in 2016). Meanwhile, 30 percent said they felt similarly about learning a family member identified as LGBTQ, up from 27 percent the previous year. GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis believes the contrast between the figures found in this year’s report and those of previous years is largely the result of President Donald Trump’s anti-LGBTQ platform and a lack of support for the queer community at the national level. “Year over year, Americans said they were more comfortable with LGBTQ people and more supportive of LGBTQ issues. These results paralleled historic steps in LGBTQ visibility in our culture as well as the passage of marriage equality nationwide and other pro-LGBTQ legal wins,” she wrote in the report. Ellis cited specific legislative moves made under the Trump administration, including the president’s attempts to ban transgender recruits from the U.S. military as well as his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who opposes same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights, as being connected to the decline in acceptance. “This change can be seen as a dangerous repercussion in the tenor of discourse and experience over the past year,” she wrote.

16,POLITICS,Trump's Leaked Infrastructure Plan Suggests A Future Sell-Off Of Public Land,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-zinke-public-lands-infrastructure-plan_us_5a679e51e4b0e56300746c35,The president and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have both said they are against transferring control to states.,2018-01-25,"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke steps from Air Force One as President Donald Trump arrives in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Dec. 4, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a691bed2d00001f00942bb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have repeatedly said they oppose selling off federal lands. “I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do,” Trump told Field & Stream magazine in January 2016. He re-emphasized this in a subsequent interview with the Outdoor Sportsman Group: “We’re not looking to sell off land.”It was over this very issue that Zinke — a former Montana congressman — resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2016. And in a speech one day after arriving at his new post, Zinke promised Interior staffers: “You can hear it from my lips. We will not sell or transfer public land.”But a leaked White House infrastructure plan has many conservation groups concerned that Trump and Zinke could soon be singing a different tune: that of the Republican Party, whose platform calls for transferring control of federal lands to states.The draft plan, which Politico and Axios obtained this week, includes this line: “Disposition of Federal Real Property: would establish through executive order the authority to allow for the disposal of Federal assets to improve the overall allocation of economic resources in infrastructure investment.” To be clear, the document is a draft plan — one Paul Teller, a special assistant to the president for legislative affairs, told Politico this week does not reflect the final proposal. Nonetheless, it is easy to see how one might read “disposal” to mean that the government will look to sell off, trade or transfer federal assets, including land, to help pay for crumbling bridges and highways.White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to say whether this “disposal” would include federal lands. “We are not going to comment on the contents of a leaked document but look forward to presenting our plan in the near future,” she wrote in an email to HuffPost.Politico reported Wednesday that Trump could release his long-anticipated infrastructure plan in as little as two weeks. If it takes aim at public land, Zinke will almost certainly face the brunt of public outrage. After all, it was Zinke who said last month, “No one loves public land more than I. You can love it as much, but you can’t love it any more.”Fearing a looming about-face, conservation groups sent a shot across the administration’s bow this week. “It raises suspicions from everybody that cares about public lands,” Brad Brooks, public lands campaign director at The Wilderness Society, told HuffPost. “And if they are proposing to sell off public lands, the American public is not going to stand for D.C. politicians trying to steal our land.”Brooks added that Zinke needs to explain — one way or another — what’s going on. To his knowledge, there is no precedent for public land being disposed of via executive order. Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement that the draft infrastructure plan is the latest example of Zinke saying one thing and doing another.“This plan calls for the disposal of federal lands, it’s right there in black and white,” she said. “The secretary owes the American public an honest answer: Will he continue to be complicit in President Trump’s attempts to sell off our public lands?”Whit Fosburgh, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, told HuffPost that he too is looking for clarification about what the White House means, but said “it smells like selling off public [lands].”Fosburgh said the leaked plan reminds him of a bill former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) introduced last year to sell off 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 Western states. The proposal included explicit language, calling for the “disposal” of millions of acres of “excess” federal lands that he said had “been deemed to serve no purpose for taxpayers.”The move provoked outrage from conservationists, hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts, who labeled Chaffetz an “anti-public lands congressman.” Chaffetz ultimately pulled the bill, citing concerns from his constituents. “I hear you,” he wrote in an Instagram post that included a photo of him dressed in hunting camouflage, and promised to kill the bill.Public lands advocates celebrated Chaffetz’s move as a major victory — and vowed to stand firmly against anyone who threatens their national heritage. Zinke continues to paint himself a champion of public lands and “a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist.” But the conservation and outdoor sporting groups that once supported his nomination have largely walked away, as the interior secretary has led the administration’s effort to gut national monuments and prioritized energy development over conservation.The Interior Department did not respond a request for comment on the language in the draft infrastructure plan.But in an interview Thursday with conservative radio commentator Josh Tolley, Zinke re-emphasized his commitment to maintaining federal control of public land.“We’re not transferring or selling public land,” he said. “What we’re doing is we’re working with the states to open up recreation opportunities. We don’t want to be in an adversarial role. And that’s been the tension out west, is that the local voice, communities, have been ignored. And that’s not right.”"

This is the second investigation into a top editor at the newspaper to come to light this week.Earlier this week, three former and current employees told HuffPost that Jones displayed a “pattern” of inappropriate behavior toward young women in the newsroom. At least some of the complaints lodged against him were sexual in nature, HuffPost has learned.Jones stands accused of inappropriate conduct both in and out of the office that includes forcible kissing and other allegations involving him and employees, a former staffer confirmed.“He would approach women in a way that was not really appropriate,” a fourth former Daily News employee told HuffPost earlier this week. A spokesperson for Tronc, the newspaper’s parent company, said Thursday, “I can confirm he is still employed.” But two sources close to the situation told HuffPost that Jones was escorted out of the office on Thursday.He and the New York Daily News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Jones has worked at the company since at least 2000, according to his LinkedIn page, where he lists himself as Managing Editor/Sunday. The page says he previously held the positions of Executive News Editor and Night News Editor. News of the investigation comes the same week NPR reported that Tronc had launched a separate investigation into Daily News Managing Editor Rob Moore after the news outlet reached out to ask about a sexual harassment complaint that had been lodged against him in December."

Black women were the ones to make it happen.They out-voted all other demographics that day, with 98 percent of black women casting a vote for Jones. In contrast, 63 percent of white women who voted did so for Moore.“America got one more confirmation that Black women are superheroes who save the day time and time again,” wrote Luvvie Ajayi, author of I’m Judging You: The Do-Better Manual on her blog after the election. “I am tired of the world being run into the ground by white men who prove time and time again that they are ill-equipped.”Ajayi was inspired to find a list of black women politicians she could support. Not finding any, she enlisted the help of three friends to create Black Women in Politics, a living document of black female candidates seeking election in 2018. It’s now an online database that includes more than 400 names. To start, Ajayi, along with friends Sili Recio, Lucrecer Braxton and Candace Jones, searched through Twitter mentions, polls and did some old-fashioned googling, gathering more than 100 names of women seeking election in 2018.The list doubled in under a month, and its creators enlisted the help of a coder to help them turn it into a searchable database. They ultimately moved the database from Ajayi’s personal website to its own domain.Black women vote in higher numbers than any other demographic, yet are underrepresented in political positions of power.The site’s mission statement explains why the database is so crucial.“There are Black women running for political office all over the United States, and we need to know who they are,” it reads. “It is abundantly clear that we need to start following the lead of Black women, because we show up and do what is important, even when we are being disenfranchised and sabotaged from doing the work.”As of Jan. 25, the database has 414 entries. Visitors can filter the candidates by searching for women running for federal seats, state seats and local seats. They can also choose to view candidates running specifically in blue or red states. There’s a section detailing which candidates are incumbents and which are challengers, as well as a page where where users can suggest more politicians to be added.The database includes a disclaimer noting it is not an endorsement of every woman running. “Think about it as a phone book,” the site states.With midterm elections happening this November, it’s especially important for information on black female candidates to be easily accessible for those seeking to support them, Ayaji wrote on her blog.She added that the database is just the first step. People should use the information provided in the list as a starting point for supporting these candidates. “The goal is to make it easier to find the information we need to support those we have got to support,” she wrote."
19,POLITICS,Trump To Offer Citizenship For Dreamers As Part Of Immigration Deal,Elise Foley and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-offers-citizenship-for-dreamers-as-part-of-immigration-deal_us_5a6a5565e4b0ddb658c4e737,The White House will present a full proposal on Monday.,2018-01-25,White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Republican staffers that Trump would accept permanent legal status for current DACA recipients and Dreamers who are eligible for the program but don’t currently hold those protections.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a56001d000027006acd7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump is open to granting a path to citizenship to roughly 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children as part of immigration talks, a top White House aide reportedly told Republican staffers on Thursday. It was the most detail the White House has given on Trump’s goals for legal status for so-called Dreamers, nearly 700,000 of whom are currently at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief after he ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But although Trump is willing to help those Dreamers and some others who don’t already have DACA protections, the White House has indicated it will only do so at a price — and his demands for steep border security increases and a dramatic reshaping of the legal immigration system could end up being poison pills that kill the chances of a deal. White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Republican staffers that Trump would accept permanent legal status for current DACA recipients and Dreamers who are eligible for the program but don’t currently hold those protections, an estimated 1.8 million people, according to reports from NBC News and The Daily Beast. Miller described the plan as offering “extremely generous provisions” and “dramatic concessions” to Democrats, according to The Daily Beast.But in exchange for helping some undocumented young people, Trump wants to enact policies that would affect countless more individuals, including immigrants in the U.S., people seeking to come here and even Americans who want to sponsor certain family members. Democrats would get one win — help for Dreamers — in Trump’s proposed framework; immigration hardliners like Trump would get a slew of them.“They think that by offering up a spoonful of sugar — relief for Dreamers — they can get Congress and the American people to swallow the bitter medicine of radical nativism,” Frank Sharry, who leads the pro-immigration reform group America’s Voice, said in a statement. “We are going to fight this tooth and nail. We are not going to stand by while Trump and Miller take Dreamers hostage in order to keep out and kick out millions.”Trump will request $25 billion for border security measures, including a wall in some areas, according to reports. (During the campaign, Trump said that Mexico would pay for the wall.) He is also seeking an end to the diversity visa lottery system, which allows individuals from countries with low immigration levels to come to the U.S. ― such as those in Africa that the president reportedly called ”shithole countries″ in a meeting with senators. The plan will also call for ending what Trump and his allies refer to derisively as “chain migration” ― the process by which Americans and legal permanent residents can sponsor their family members to legally immigrate to the U.S. The White House will propose restricting family-based immigration to spouses and minor children, excluding adult children, siblings and other relatives, according to reports.Trump also wants the government to close “loopholes” in the immigration system to make it easier to deport people — likely including children and people seeking asylum, given past comments by officials — and detain immigrants for longer periods, according to Axios.Democrats have said they are willing to make certain compromises as part of a Dreamer deal, but that dramatically reshaping the entire immigration system is both too much to ask and something that could easily cause a deal to fall apart under its own weight. Dreamer activists themselves have called for a deal that helps them without hurting other immigrants. The idea of severely restricting legal immigration — a cornerstone of the U.S. — isn’t backed by all Republicans, either.Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), one of the leaders on immigration policy among House Democrats, said the offer didn’t pass the smell test.“It would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards Latin America,” he tweeted. “Both a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective and both would express Trump’s deeply held suspicion of Latinos.”The White House plans to unveil its immigration policy proposals on Monday. A spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports.Last week, the federal government partially shut down after Senate Democrats refused to vote for a funding bill that didn’t include protections for Dreamers. They agreed to reopen the government on Monday after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he’d allow a vote on an immigration bill in February. Trump’s support for an immigration measure is crucial, and not just because he’s the one who would ultimately have to sign the bill. Trump is probably the only person in politics who could convince conservative House Republicans to go along with legislation granting legal status to undocumented immigrants, said Michael Steel, who worked as a spokesman for former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). “A lot of those folks who would be the most upset by an immigration bill that is more generous than they would like are also the closest allies of the president in the House,” Steel told the HuffPost Politics podcast."

At the time Hungary was starting to face a surge in illegal migrants from Africa and the Middle East crossing the EU border from Serbia.The man based his claim on the fact that, as a homosexual, he faced persecution in his home country.The EU court ruled: “The performance of such a test amounts to a disproportionate interference in the private life of the asylum seeker.” The Luxembourg-based judges noted that the EU executive has disputed the reliability of such tests.In the Rorschach test a participant’s perceptions of inkblots are recorded and are then analyzed for clues about his or her personality characteristics and emotional functioning.On the basis of the tests, the Hungarian state-appointed psychologist concluded that the Nigerian man was not homosexual and his claim was rejected, prompting an appeal.In responding to the Hungarian court which referred the case, the ECJ said it was acceptable to seek expert opinion but this must be obtained in ways consistent with human rights and should not be the sole basis of a ruling.Hungary’s right-wing government has been in the forefront of efforts, particularly among ex-communist states in the east, to stiffen the European Union’s frontiers against asylum seekers.It was among the first countries hit by a wave of more than a million people who entered the EU via Greece in 2015 after taking to flimsy boats crossing the Mediterranean from Turkey.That crisis shook the EU’s cohesion, and efforts to reform a common asylum policy remain a source of deep discord."

He's about to get even more.,2018-01-25,"Eugene Ludwig, founder of Promontory Financial Group, at a Senate Banking Subcommittee on Financial Institutions hearing in 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a68b5a02d00001f00942b09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A little over a year ago, American commerce quietly passed a techno-dystopian landmark when IBM ― one of the most prestigious and storied computer companies ― undertook a new project: automating the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. IBM’s acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a consulting firm recognized in Washington as a landing pad for top officials from the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies, went largely overlooked in the news churn surrounding the 2016 election. Promontory’s founder, former bank regulator Eugene Ludwig, pays top dollar to bring in public-sector talent and put it to work on behalf of the banking industry. The company touts its expertise in helping firms navigate a complex regulatory landscape, but the business often has more to do with the mystical intangibles of corporate reputation than the technical precision of regulatory codes. Banks caught laundering money for dictators or illegally foreclosing on families call Ludwig, agree to pay him large amounts of money, and through the magic of Washington emerge with their prestige refreshed. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Promontory has had no shortage of clients. Ludwig reportedly pays himself more than $30 million a year, well ahead of what either JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon or Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein take home. IBM, which has been steadily expanding its corporate consulting business over the past decade, wanted to assimilate Ludwig’s operation into Watson, its flagship artificial intelligence system. “Promontory’s experts are unsurpassed in this field,” IBM’s Bridget van Kralingen, a senior vice president, said when the deal was announced. “They will teach Watson and Watson, in turn, will extend and enhance their expertise.” The good news for American democracy is that IBM made a mistake. Influence peddling is a uniquely robot-proof line of work. It relies not on hard data or generalizable patterns of thought, but on relationships and attitudes that no algorithm can emulate or predict.The bad news is that Congress is already on corruption autopilot, even without machine learning. Beginning in 2015, a bipartisan coalition of ostensibly free-market Republicans, including Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), teamed up with social-justice Democrats, including Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), on legislation that would shower new riches on Ludwig’s influence empire and a few enterprises like it. This year, similar legislation has the support of 10 senators from each party, almost guaranteeing passage. The proposal would override federal regulators on a complex deposit insurance rule, thus bringing more money into a niche market where Ludwig himself is the dominant player. This congressional perk won’t spark the next subprime meltdown or erase anyone’s savings, but it will pad the profits of a prominent Washingtonian by making small banks a little bit riskier. For all the bitter partisan warfare over health care and taxes, Democrats and Republicans can still find common ground on some basic principles of American industry.When Ludwig founded his consulting firm, he set up a side operation sharing key personnel ― the similarly named Promontory Interfinancial Network. The company makes it easier for rich people to take advantage of deposit insurance from the federal government, and harvests a small fee for its service. Deposit insurance is the reason you don’t lose money if your bank fails. Most families don’t have to worry about it, since the government automatically guarantees every penny of bank accounts up to $250,000, and very few Americans have more money than that lying around. More than half of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account, and the average checking account balance is about $3,600. But if you have, say, $1 million that you don’t want tied up in the stock market, and you don’t want to spend your Saturdays working out four or five separate accounts with different banks, Promontory’s Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service lets you deal with a single institution, which can spread your cash across a network of different banks on your behalf, while allowing you to maintain what looks to you like a single omnibus account.There’s nothing inherently devious about the service. But federal regulators see it as a riskier way for banks to fund their operations. Banks can become dependent on the health of a complex deposit network, in which a single customer can instantly drain large accounts at several different institutions.To protect taxpayers who are ultimately on the hook for deposits that disappear in a bank failure, federal regulators apply some restrictions on these so-called reciprocal deposits. Only banks with healthy capital cushions can rely on them, and there are limits to the interest rates banks can offer to attract them.A few other firms exist in the reciprocal deposit space, but it’s really Promontory’s game. The company’s website touts 800,000 “bank-to-bank connections” each year, and more than 2,700 banks participate in its network, according to a company spokesman. Promontory doesn’t like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. discouraging banks with capital troubles from using its product. And it is spending an enormous amount of money on Capitol Hill trying to get around them. In 2016, according to federal lobbying disclosure forms, Promontory spent more than $1.5 million through eight different lobbying firms, followed by over $1.25 million in the first nine months of 2017. To put that in perspective, the National Bankers Association ― a trade group that also supports the bill ― spent a total of $95,000 on lobbying in 2017, on everything from the GOP tax bill to residual issues from the 2008 government bailout.It’s a sophisticated lobbying operation. To woo Republicans, Promontory enlisted former Newt Gingrich aide Daniel Meyer, along with David Schiappa, a former aide to Senate Republican Leaders Bob Dole, Trent Lott, Bill Frist and Mitch McConnell. On the Democratic side, Promontory has enlisted Robert Raben, a former aide to Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) and Christina Weaver, who was previously legislative counsel for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). Promontory insists that all of this energy is going to help community banks and local small businesses. “It’s not just us who are working on the bill,” notes Promontory Interfinancial spokesman Phil Battey. “It is of great importance to community bankers.” In September, National Urban League CEO Marc Morial sent a letter to the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, urging both to support the Promontory legislation, arguing that the measure will help minority-owned banks access funding. The National Bankers Association, which represents banks owned by women and minorities, also argued the legislation would encourage economic growth in “economically distressed communities.”  For their troubles, Warner introduced legislation allowing banks that lose their official “well-capitalized” regulatory status to keep accepting reciprocal deposits, and easing restrictions on what interest rates they can pay. When Warner cut a deal with Republicans in the fall to loosen a slate of other rules on much bigger banks (those with up to $250 billion in assets), they included the Promontory bill in the package. With 10 Democrats and the Trump administration on board, it’s only a matter of time before the bill becomes law and Promontory’s business expands. “This will help colleges and other nonprofits who want to invest in their communities by allowing them to keep more of their money in local community banks and credit unions,” Warner spokeswoman Rachel Cohen told HuffPost. “Smaller financial institutions are lifelines to Main Street businesses and families across rural America, which is the one and only reason Senator Warner is supporting legislation that will make it easier for them to lend while still making sure that big Wall Street banks remain subject to the Dodd-Frank regulations he helped write after the financial crisis.” But increasing deposits at small banks ― particularly at banks with capital problems ― doesn’t do much to increase lending or investment, according to University of Georgia Law professor Mehrsa Baradaran, author of The Color Of Money: Black Banks And The Racial Wealth Gap.“Deposits aren’t really the thing that make or break these communities,” Baradaran told HuffPost. “It’s really common to use community banks, minority owned banks, community development banks as a Trojan Horse for whatever the actual power brokers in Washington want to do.”Moran, Moore and Emmer declined to comment. Promontory spokesman Battey told HuffPost the bill “would improve the ability of community banks to offer reciprocal deposits and thus to fund community-based local lending,” which is why it “has received broad bipartisan support and endorsements from community bankers and organizations across America.” Battey added: “It would be a serious error of fact to say that Promontory Interfinancial Network is about to receive any sort of ‘windfall’ from the reciprocal deposits legislation.” He acknowledged the bill would bring more business Promontory’s way.The Promontory bill isn’t going to destroy the economy or set off the next great American banking panic. At worst, it will accelerate the failure of some smaller, badly managed banks, letting them utilize more expensive and less stable funding whenever their capital base collapses. Compared with the tax bill and the Obamacare repeal effort that dominated Congress in 2017, doing Ludwig a favor is pretty small potatoes. But the fact that it’s on the legislative agenda with bipartisan support says a great deal about who matters on Capitol Hill."
24,POLITICS,San Francisco Gets Its Third Mayor In 6 Weeks After Tumultuous Debate,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-francisco-mayor-london-breed-mark-farrell_us_5a68b48ae4b0dc592a0eab62,People accused the city's Board of Supervisors of racism and sexism in choosing the interim mayor.,2018-01-25,Supervisor London Breed looks on during a memorial for the late Mayor Ed Lee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a68f7591600004500138bc8.jpeg?cache=rYEyONtnyd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO ― An emotionally charged San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday night ended with the naming of the city’s third, albeit interim, mayor in six weeks and set the stage for a chaotic election for a permanent leader in June.By a contentious 6-3 vote, the board elected Supervisor Mark Farrell to serve as interim mayor for the next five months, following Mayor Ed Lee’s sudden death in December. The decision came after a 5-4 vote not to name board President London Breed, who had also been serving as acting mayor since Lee’s death, to the interim role. (Neither Farrell nor Breed voted.)Breed announced her campaign for the June mayoral election earlier this month.The optics of Tuesday’s decision were not good: Breed, who grew up in public housing in the city district she now represents, was serving as San Francisco’s first black female mayor. Farrell is a white male venture capitalist who represented one of the wealthiest enclaves in the city until Tuesday’s vote. The progressive supervisors who led the charge against Breed, who is considered a moderate in left-leaning San Francisco, argued that naming her to the interim slot would give her an unfair advantage in the upcoming election and that the city needed a “caretaker mayor” who wasn’t gunning for the permanent job. “The power of incumbency provides such an unfair advantage that I believe we must take this election out of the hands of the Board of Supervisors and allow San Franciscans to choose the next Mayor on a level playing field,” Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer said in a statement after the vote. Supervisor Aaron Peskin raised the issue that if Breed served as both mayor and president of the board, she would be the sole person in charge of filling several other vacant city government jobs.They had good reason to think Breed might easily win the election from the mayor’s office. Lee, too, first served as interim mayor in 2011 when Mayor Gavin Newsom left mid-term to serve as California’s lieutenant governor. Although he had been the city’s less public-facing chief administrative officer until then and he promised not to run for mayor later that year, Lee campaigned and won. Lee had aspirations of revitalizing the city’s most blighted areas. But critics said he gave too many financial breaks to Bay Area tech companies whose early 2000s’ influx of high-paid workers helped drive up housing prices and displace the city’s diverse residents.With that housing crisis still in full swing, they said, the stakes were too high to give any candidate the advantage of the interim mayor role without challenging that person on affordability issues.“I haven’t endorsed because I’ve yet to hear any of the mayoral candidates answer the questions that matter to the people of my district,” Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who voted for Farrell, said during the meeting. “How are you going to make housing affordable again? Where are the economic opportunities outside of the tech industry? How are you going to help keep teachers stable in our public schools? What are you going to do to solve the homeless crisis?”Giving one candidate the boost of the mayoral post would be an “unethical silencing of the voters of San Francisco,” Ronen said.But members of San Francisco’s black community, many of whom filled City Hall on Tuesday night to speak in support of Breed, said they’ve already been silenced for a long time.“For the first time, I’ve seen somebody ... that actually looks like me and actually has my experience” sitting in the mayor’s office, said Angelique Mahan, a black native San Franciscan, during the public comment period. Another black advocate for Breed, who did not give her name while speaking, suggested that the decision to replace Breed with Farrell was tinged with prejudice.“Send a message to the world and to the national administration that we here in San Francisco will not allow racism and sexism to rear its ugly head, that although African-Americans make up less than 13 percent of the city population, although the school system is failing our African American children here in San Francisco ... and although African-Americans have been disproportionately displaced in this city, we deserve a leader like London,” she said.Several people noted that the board had not removed Lee as incumbent mayor when he announced he was running for the permanent position. Speaking to reporters after the vote, Breed declined to address the concerns of many of her supporters that racism played a role in her loss. “I don’t want to dwell on that particular element because it has sadly brought out the worst in some people,” she said. “And so what I am trying to do as a leader in this city is bring out the best in people.” The tense evening had at least one legislator second-guessing her vote. After an initial 7-2 count in favor of Farrell, Supervisor Katy Tang switched her vote to Breed.Farrell must now name a replacement for his supervisor slot. Breed will face off against seven other mayoral candidates on June 5, including fellow supervisor Jane Kim and former supervisor and ex-state senator Mark Leno."

Jerry Brown (D) touted the state’s bipartisan commitment to working on issues that continue to divide lawmakers in Washington. “Some American governments actually can get stuff done, even in the face of deepening party divisions,” the fourth-term governor said at the state Capitol in Sacramento, citing state lawmakers’ renewal of California’s landmark cap-and-trade program in July as an example. The greenhouse gas-fighting legislation gained the support of eight Republicans ― an achievement former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) said he could have only dreamed of when he signed the original program into place in 2006.Brown, who first first assumed the governorship in 1975 and whose current term ends this year, hasn’t strayed far from the issues he said his administration would focus on, chief among them advancing California’s commitment to renewable energy.President Donald Trump, who’s questioned the existence of man-made climate change, has given Brown a chance to show just how committed he is to keeping California on track with those goals, in spite of the president’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris agreement on combating climate change.“Despite what is widely believed by some of the most powerful people in Washington, the science of climate change is not in doubt,” Brown said.He later added: “All nations agree except one, and that is solely because of one man: our current president.”Brown has volunteered himself as an unofficial ambassador abroad on climate change issues and was one of the first three governors to join the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of states committed to the goals laid out in Paris. It has since grown to comprise 16 governors. Late last year, Brown announced that California and the European Union would consider creating a common carbon market to cut greenhouse gas emissions. And later this year, Brown will host a global climate summit in San Francisco where he hopes to hammer out carbon emissions agreements between international leaders and U.S. states. While he has emerged as an international leader on the issue, local environmental activists continue to clash with Brown on his decision not to entirely ban hydraulic fracking and for provisions in the cap-and-trade bill they say are too friendly to the oil industry. Speaking Thursday, Brown also reaffirmed his belief that California must continue moving forward with its high speed rail plans, despite some legal challenges and mounting criticism of the rising cost.Read Brown’s entire State of the State address.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a69fb312d00001f00942c89.jpeg?cache=pO6v4fBagS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The NAACP is suing the Trump administration, accusing Homeland Security of discriminating against Haiti’s mostly black nationals in violation of the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee.The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Maryland, seeks to overturn the Department of Homeland Security’s November decision to cancel Temporary Protected Status for Haitians next year. TPS protects undocumented immigrants from deportation and allows them to work here legally because conditions in their home country are too dire to send them back. The lawsuit, like other court challenges against Trump immigration policies, uses President Donald Trump’s own reported words against him, including recent comments to senators during an immigration negotiation deriding Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations as “shithole countries.” At the same meeting, Trump reportedly asked: “Why do we need more Haitians?”The complaint, filed by one of the country’s most prestigious civil rights groups, also cites a December New York Times report that Trump said Haitians “all have AIDS.” “In stark contrast, the President stated that immigrants from countries ‘like Norway’ were more desirable and should be admitted,” the complaint says. It adds: “President Trump has made clear that he wishes to reduce the number of immigrants of color to the United States.”Haiti was granted TPS in 2010 after an earthquake that left hundreds of thousands of people dead and devastated the country’s already weak infrastructure. More than 1 million Haitians were left homeless in the immediate aftermath.But DHS Acting Secretary Elaine Duke announced the cancellation of TPS for roughly 60,000 Haitians on Nov. 20, writing in a press statement that that a department review found “those extraordinary but temporary conditions caused by the 2010 earthquake no longer exist.” “With this administration, you have to be skeptical of every decision they make ― especially decisions affecting people of color,” Raymond Audain, lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the NAACP, told HuffPost. Audain, himself Haitian-American, called Trump’s reported comments “appalling.”The lawsuit alleges Homeland Security violated the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection and due process guarantees, and departed from its normal procedure in reviewing Haiti’s inclusion in the TPS program. Then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly asked his staff to review the criminal histories of thousands of Haitians with TPS ahead of the decision to boot them from the program, the lawsuit says. The NAACP’s membership includes Haitians who hold TPS.“The Administration’s efforts to gather this data on Haitian TPS recipients trades on false anti-Black stereotypes about criminality and exploitation of public benefits, and suggests the effort to manufacture a public safety rationale for the planned rescission,” the lawsuit says.While previous decisions to extend TPS for Haitians had been published in the Federal Register within days of their announcement, it took DHS two months to publish its rationale for the cancellation. Duke’s decision didn’t acknowledge ongoing problems that had led previous administrations to extend TPS for Haiti, including gender-based violence or lingering damage from Hurricane Matthew. Kelly cited both issues in May, when he extended TPS for six months. “Instead, DHS’s true motive for terminating TPS for Haitians reflects racial discrimination,” the lawsuit says. The complaint also cites Trump’s negative comments about Mexicans, Central Americans, U.S. Hispanics, Africans and Arabs.DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.Some of Trump’s harshest immigration policies have been halted or delayed by federal judges. The administration faces lawsuits challenging his restrictions on visitors from some Muslim-majority countries, and his abrupt decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA ― the program that provides deportation relief and work authorization to undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. Those lawsuits, like the one filed Wednesday, typically accuse Trump of discrimination. While the White House has vast power under U.S. law to change immigration policy, those changes could be invalidated if courts find the actions intend to discriminate on the basis of race, nationality or religion. Trump may see more legal challenges to his immigration measures in the future. Some immigration lawyers told HuffPost immediately after Trump’s reported “shithole” comment that challenges to the cancellation of TPS for El Salvador and other countries the president slurred were likely.

28,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren Lays Out Plan To Hold Health Insurers Accountable,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-private-insurance-families-usa_us_5a6a0d00e4b01fbbefafbaf0,"“Private insurance companies are failing the American people,” the senator said on Thursday.",2018-01-25,Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a three-part plan to rein in insurance companies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a0d5b1d000026006acd0e.jpeg?cache=glErIAYXpx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In a speech to a liberal health policy conference on Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed new rules to force private insurers to be more responsive to Americans’ health care needs.Warren spoke at the annual gathering of the consumer advocacy group Families USA. She emphasized that she wholeheartedly supports efforts to expand public health insurance programs, including a “single-payer” bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would expand Medicare to the entire population.But in the meantime, Warren said, the federal government needs to impose new standards on private insurers to build on the accomplishments of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.“Private insurance companies are failing the American people. We all know it,” Warren said. “And whatever public alternatives you support, there is no reason on earth for us to continue allowing the health care of the American people to be held hostage by an industry that both attacks any new health care proposals and, at the same time, refuses to do any better.”Warren’s speech laid out a three-part plan to rein in insurance companies: Crack down on the practice of shifting costs onto consumers; force private insurers to provide coverage as affordable as Medicare and Medicaid; and “call their bluff” if they resist complying with the first two planks.For the first component, Warren would forbid insurance practices that she dubbed “cheat[ing] people,” including drawing narrow boundaries for the network of health care providers they cover and rescinding coverage of certain drugs in the middle of the year.In the second part, Warren would subject private insurers to stricter cost and quality guidelines in order to achieve parity with Medicare and Medicaid. The senator noted that Medicare and Medicaid provide better value to consumers, covering 84 cents for every dollar of health costs, compared to private exchange plans, which tend to cover 60 to 70 cents for every dollar of costs.The third plank, which is effectively Warren’s enforcement mechanism, is likely the most innovative idea.Borrowing from a model already in place in New York, Warren proposes requiring private insurers that bid on Medicare Advantage or Medicaid contracts to participate in the ACA exchanges.Private insurers have frequently lost money on their ACA exchange plans, but they’ve profited handsomely from their participation in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage. “If they want to bid on the really juicy federal health care contracts, they should have to offer a basic private insurance plan for individuals as well, even if those exchange plans aren’t quite as juicy for their investors,” Warren said. “And if some insurance companies really, truly aren’t willing to provide high-quality, affordable coverage in exchange for billions of dollars in federal subsidies and access to Medicare and Medicaid ― if they really, truly want to pick up their toys and go home because their bazillion-dollar profits aren’t high enough ― then I say good riddance.”The Families USA conference is frequently the site of important policy announcements by likely presidential contenders. Then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) used his 2007 speech to the group to present his vision for universal health care.Warren is considered a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.Defending the ACA was a priority of progressive lawmakers and activists for much of 2017. Their efforts succeeded in scuttling several Republican attempts to repeal the law’s essential components.But President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have continued to undermine the ACA’s protections, most recently by using their tax legislation to end the individual insurance mandate. And even before the latest sabotage efforts, the landmark health care law had still left 28 million Americans uninsured and millions more underinsured.So the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and the potential presidential candidates who claim its mantle have now set their sights on more ambitious reform ideas that they could implement if the party retakes the White House in 2020. These lawmakers and activists maintain that the ACA’s biggest vulnerabilities are rooted in its relatively conservative attempt to achieve universal coverage within the bounds of the private insurance system.Sanders, whose 2016 presidential bid vaulted single-payer into the political mainstream, held a live digital town hall about “Medicare for all” on Tuesday that drew more than 1 million viewers in real time.Warren, a battle-scarred Wall Street foe widely considered the most progressive sitting senator after Sanders, is evidently trying to make her own mark on health care policy. Her speech to Families USA highlighted her own rhetorical style and policy emphases. She began with a deeply personal anecdote ― the kind Sanders tends to eschew ― about how, when she was a child, her family was permanently set back financially because of expenses related to her father’s heart attack.As a former law professor whose research found that medical bills were a leading cause of household bankruptcies, Warren is more interested in the details of technocratic fixes to the ACA than are many Medicare-for-all warriors like Sanders. On Thursday, she rattled off statistic after statistic demonstrating the success of the Massachusetts health model, such as the fact that it has “the second-lowest premiums in the ACA market of any state in the country.”Warren’s rhetorical balance is likely to please some of the influential policy wonks and liberal leaders uncomfortable with what they see as Medicare-for-all advocates’ vagueness about how to achieve their dream system.At the same time, Warren, like her more populist counterparts, makes clear that she views the profit motive itself as the greatest obstacle to universal coverage.“Why can’t middle class families get good coverage at an affordable price?” Warren asked on Thursday.“The reason is straightforward: profits,” she concluded. “A private insurance company maximizes its profits by bringing in the most money possible from customers and paying out the least money possible for their health care.”"

Or maybe it was just easier than drinking weed killer.Since being elected to the Senate a year ago, Kennedy, previously the longtime state treasurer of Louisiana, has made a name for himself on Capitol Hill with his wit, humor and penchant for folksy expressions ― a notable feat in a place where jargon and arcane procedure tend to reign supreme.At a time when many of his colleagues are using modern forms of media to communicate with their constituents ― e.g., Twitter ― Kennedy has managed to command viral headlines with little more than Southern wisdom and a Pelican State drawl, distilling events of the day into blunt terms regular people can understand.“Our country was founded by geniuses, but it’s being run by idiots,” Kennedy said dismissively last week, as a government shutdown loomed. “I think most Americans are wondering how some folks up here made it through the birth canal.”A former member of the Democratic Party, the Oxford-educated Kennedy ― no relation to those other Kennedys you may have heard about ― worked as a trial lawyer and later served as legal counsel in the 1980s to then-Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer (D). He switched parties in 2008 in order to mount a challenge to then-Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat. But he didn’t win office until scandal-plagued former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) decided not to run for re-election in 2016.Kennedy has acquired a bit of a reputation as an easy mark on Capitol Hill ― at least among the press. He loves talking to reporters, and reporters love talking to him because he’s notoriously quotable. While other senators, like Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), for example, usually shun the Capitol Hill press corps, Kennedy tends to post up in a hallway and dutifully answer question after question on just about any topic.It’s a welcome trend in a legislative body that has grown more cautious and guarded in recent years.“It’s like a circus without a tent,” Kennedy said of the Senate this week.Kennedy’s greatest hits ― like the “weed killer” line ― came during last year’s debates regarding health care and tax cuts. But he’s provided some of his most memorable one-liners in recent weeks as well.When nearly all of Washington seemed to erupt over President Donald Trump reportedly referring to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” earlier this month, Kennedy likened the ensuing nastiness to “The Jerry Springer Show” and even quipped that the drama between his colleagues may be hampering Earth’s chances of contact with extraterrestrial life.“That’s why the aliens won’t talk to us,” Kennedy told reporters, referring to the bipartisan blame game over the president’s comments. “They look at us and say, ‘These people... they’re 13-year-olds.’”He later described a recent meeting at the White House with Trump as “very positive,” adding that “no one called anybody an ignorant slut or anything.” The line was a reference a “Saturday Night Live” catchphrase from the 1970s.Lawmakers often berate the nation’s capital in broad strokes as a way to curry favor with folks back home. But Kennedy ― who ran for Senate twice before finally succeeding in 2016 ― upped the ante when he used some choice language to describe the city last year amid negotiations over the GOP tax plan. “This is Washington, D.C.,” Kennedy said in December. “Politics is in everybody’s blood, kind of like herpes.”Kennedy has directed witticisms at his fellow Republicans, as well. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), for example, is “tougher than a $3 steak,” according to Kennedy, while Sen. John McCain, who is still recovering from cancer surgery in Arizona, is “tough as a boiled owl.”GOP senators said this week that Kennedy is proving to be one of their most effective messengers ― a surprising turn of events, given how little time he has spent in Washington. “Well, when he’s awake, he’s awesome,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) quipped this week. “He has a good way of using humor to make a point. One of the most effective things you can do in politics ― [Ronald] Reagan was really good at this ― is you use humor at the right time.” “In a place not known for being witty, he’s witty,” added Graham, who has a similar reputation and ought to know. “But in the Senate, to be witty the bar is low.” Kennedy isn’t all hat and no cattle, though. Despite his lack of seniority, which determines one’s place in the Senate pecking order, the senator has had several standout performances at committee hearings. In October, Kennedy drew plaudits from both parties when he said the IRS contracting the hacked company Equifax to combat fraud was like giving actress Lindsay Lohan ― who’s had her troubles ― “the keys to the minibar.” And his incisive questioning during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing ― Kennedy spent years working as a corporate and civil trial attorney ― humiliated a Trump district judge nominee in a clip that went viral last month.“Just because you’ve seen [the movie] ‘My Cousin Vinny’ doesn’t qualify you to be a federal judge,” Kennedy said to nominee Matthew Petersen, who admitted during the hearing that he had never tried a case or argued a motion in court. While he is a strong Trump supporter, Kennedy has been one of the few Republicans critical of his judicial nominees, saying at one point that the president is getting some “very, very bad advice” on judicial nominations.“It’s not just talk,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said of Kennedy. “There is substance to what he suggests. There aren’t a lot of people that can do that.”While he is one of the most conservative members of the Senate ― especially on gun control, social issues and the environment ― Kennedy has been known to vote against expectations. He was one of just two Republicans to oppose a bill last year that nullified an Obama-era regulation allowing consumers to band together and sue banks or credit card companies.Earlier this month, Kennedy nearly joined Democrats in blocking a hotly contested surveillance bill that extended powerful spying tools authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. After nearly 30 minutes of drama and debate with his GOP colleagues, Kennedy relented and voted to reauthorize the law, in part, he later said, because the Senate has a hard enough time governing without him rocking the boat.For now, it seems Kennedy is becoming more accustomed to the daily whiplash of Washington, and that he’s dealing with it on his own terms.“I had a friend who always used to say, ‘Here is my advice: Be yourself unless you suck,’” he said in a recent Fox News interview. “So, I’m myself.”"
30,CRIME,Man Claims He's Infamous Alcatraz Escapee In Newly Surfaced Letter,Ed Mazza,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alcatraz-escape-letter_us_5a6993e2e4b0022830095f09,The letter says all three inmates survived the escape.,2018-01-25,"Clarence Anglin, John William Anglin and Frank Morris.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a699ebc2d00004900942c05.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in U.S. law enforcement: What happened to the three inmates who broke out of Alcatraz in 1962?A newly surfaced letter not only claims the trio survived but purports to be from one of them. “My name is John Anglin. I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris,” the letter which was recently obtained by KPIX 5, the CBS station in San Francisco, read. “I’m 83 years old and in bad shape. I have cancer. Yes we all made it that night but barely!” The station said the letter was sent to the San Francisco Police Department’s Richmond station in 2013. The author of the letter claims the other two escapees have died in recent years. He also wrote that he was willing to meet with police if they would state on TV that he would spend no more than a year in jail and offer medical care for his cancer. Experts were skeptical. The U.S. Marshals Service told The Washington Post that based on a handwriting analysis and “other factors” they do not believe there was any merit to the letter. The FBI told KPIX its own tests were inconclusive. On the night of June 11, 1962, three inmates placed dummy heads in their beds and escaped from their cells via vents they had gradually widened using sharpened spoons and other makeshift tools. Once out of the prison compound itself, they slipped into the waters of San Francisco Bay on a raft made of raincoats and were never seen again. Since then, there have been dozens of theories about how they likely died, or how they might have survived. If still alive, the three men would be in their late 80s and early 90s."
31,WOMEN,The Only Type Of Muslim Woman Acceptable For Major Brands Is A Silent One,Rowaida Abdelaziz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslim-women-advertising_us_5a677d38e4b0dc592a0d4f0b,"“White women and men are allowed to apologise and get their career back on track. Minorities on the other hand, one red card and you’re out.""",2018-01-25,"Gal Gadot, right, is hailed as a feminist icon, but Amena Khan, left, was criticized for sharing her views on the same political issue.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a677b521d000026006ac95e.jpeg?cache=Z2yLPV2PI4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When L’Oreal announced it had hired Amena Khan, a British, hijab-wearing model and beauty blogger, for its latest hair care product Elvive, the company was widely applauded for it strides towards inclusion. After all, L’Oreal prides itself on “championing diversity.”However, just four days after the announcement, Khan announced on Instagram that she was stepping down after it emerged that she’d posted a series of critical tweets about Israel four years ago. L’Oreal swiftly released a statement declaring that the company “is committed to tolerance and respect towards all people” and “we agree with her decision to step down from the campaign.”In other words, they were not sad to see her go. This is not the first time L’Oréal has hired and then almost immediately parted ways with a model from an underrepresented community for past social media posts. Five months ago, the company cut ties with Munroe Bergdorf, its first transgender model, over her remarks about white America’s systemic racism.Major brands and corporations have recently been targeting Muslim women, particularly hijab-wearing Muslim women, in recent marketing attempts to showcase their diversity efforts. Nike’s launch of its Pro Hijab for female Muslim athletes and Mattel’s hijab-wearing Barbie inspired by fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad are just small examples of major corporations featuring visibly Muslim women in the name of diversity and female empowerment. But are these efforts really all that empowering when Muslim women have to police their opinions on controversial topics?Amani Al-Khatahtbeh found herself in a similar position just last week. The founder and editor of MuslimGirl.com received Revlon’s Changemaker Award in recognition of her advocacy for Muslim women. But Al-Khatahtbeh declined the award.“It means so much to me when @muslimgirl’s work is recognized and elevated in spaces from which we’ve been traditionally excluded,” she wrote in a caption on her Instagram post. “But that’s what makes it even more important at this moment to elevate and stand up for ALL women and girls.”Al-Khatahtbeh said she could not accept the award because she believes the company is not inclusive. In particular, she said Revlon has given Gal Gadot, a brand ambassador for Revlon’s newest “Live Boldly” campaign, a pass when it comes to the “Wonder Woman” actress’ political beliefs. Gadot has strong opinions about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and is a vocal supporter of the Israel Defense Forces.So why is Gadot rewarded for being an empowered woman with opinions and views of her own, while Khan loses out for sharing hers? There’s a low bar for Muslim representation in mainstream media, which often portrays the Muslim community as politicized and associates its members with war, terrorism and foreign affairs. News stories about Muslims are overwhelmingly negative.Stories about Muslim women, in particular, often focus on oppression or on companies that feature Muslim women to advance an aesthetic of diversity. But purposeful, authentic Muslim representation, in which a Muslim woman can express her opinions freely and without consequence, is desperately missing. When Muslim women like Khan ― who are already vastly underrepresented in the mainstream ― have any sort of visibility, it becomes conditional, and they’re forced to monitor their speech.  Nafisa Bakkar, co-founder of Amaliah.com, a media company that aims to amplify the voices of Muslim women, recently wrote about the superficial marketing of Muslim women.“White women and men are allowed to apologise and get their career back on track. Minorities on the other hand, one red card and you’re out,” Bakkar told HuffPost in an email.Gadot’s outspoken support for Israeli policy has done nothing to discourage companies like Revlon from naming her as their brand ambassador. On the other hand, L’Oreal dropped Khan four days after her critical Israel tweets were uncovered.L’Oreal and Revlon did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Despite this, the push to reach Muslim consumers continues. After all, the Muslim market, comprising an approximate 1.7 billion consumers, is a marketable one. According to Thomson Reuters’ State of the Global Islamic Economy Report, “the global Islamic economy has a potential bigger than every country in the world except China and the United States.” Muslim consumers are estimated to spend $464 billion on fashion and $73 billion on cosmetics alone globally by 2019.Major corporations are well aware of this. Just last year, London held its first Modest Fashion Week to appeal to Muslim fashion designers. Other major brands such as DKNY, Dolce & Gabbana and Uniqlo have all offered modest fashion lines. In 2016, CoverGirl named its first hijab-wearing ambassador, 24-year-old beauty blogger Nura Afia. Halima Aden rose to stardom signing with IMG Models and walking at New York’s fashion week for Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 5. In 2015, H&M, the world’s second-largest retailer, featured a hijab-wearing Muslim model in its recycling campaign. It’s not only profitable for major brands to tap into the Muslim market. Muslims want to see themselves in major advertisements and billboards. Muslims react positively when they see major ads acknowledging their community’s identity and needs, according to a research report by Ogilvy Noor, a division of Ogilvy & Mather that specializes in engaging with Muslim audiences. Over 90 percent of Muslims said their religion affects their consumption habits and that they feel “shortchanged by the quality of marketing and products aimed at them in comparison with other consumer groups.” When L’Oreal and Khan cut ties, the online Muslim community reacted, with some even calling for a boycott of L’Oreal products. Studies have shown that millennial consumers choose brands that feel authentic to them. The Muslim consumer is no different. Showcasing a hijab-wearing model but reprimanding her and other minorities for freely expressing thoughts is not how any brand is going to “champion diversity,” as L’Oreal once claimed.Bakkar agrees. “Too often Muslim women are just used as an aesthetic,” she wrote in an email to HuffPost. “When casting for ‘diversity’ you are looking for more than just someone to sit pretty.” "

Her character works to support her family while coping with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety.The actress spoke with Variety about the importance of the Netflix show tackling mental illness during a screening of its new season on Thursday. “Old school Latinos don’t really believe in depression,” Machado told Variety. “You work through it.” But she said she hopes her character’s journey will help change that attitude. “You don’t need a high power job to have anxiety. Sometimes you just have anxiety so it’s important to talk about those things.”The stigma around mental illness affects hundreds of people within the Latino community. In 2014, 10.3 Hispanic men out of every 100,000 died by suicide, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. That figure has remained consistent going back to 1999. What’s more, according to a 2016 study in the International Journal of Health Services, only 2.3 percent of black or Hispanic young people saw a mental health specialist in a given year between 2006 and 2012, compared to 5.7 percent of white children and young adults.Last season, Machado’s character struggled to take medication and seek help for her anxiety ― and she was particularly hesitant to open up to her mother and her kids.Netflix dropped the trailer for the new season earlier this month, giving fans a taste of what’s to come when the series returns Friday. The two-minute teaser touches on Penelope’s battle with anxiety and depression, an LGBTQ love story arc for her daughter Elena, and her son Alex’s experiences with xenophobia.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Or one of the technical categories.But nope.“I think that you can’t have it all,” Gadot added at the Revlon event in New York. “We’ve done this movie and it was received in such an amazing, wonderful way, and we want to stay humble and grateful, and we’re going to have another movie, so who knows?

34,ENTERTAINMENT,Why Did The Oscars Snub James Franco But Not Gary Oldman?,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-did-the-oscars-snub-james-franco-but-not-gary-oldman_us_5a674f88e4b002283006d5b1,The folly is in thinking Hollywood could ever be anything but selective in its moral judgments.,2018-01-25,James Franco was poised for a Best Actor Oscar nom prior to allegations. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a68a1671d000027006acae5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the same morning James Franco was stiffed by the Academy Awards, almost certainly over allegations of sexual misconduct, a man once accused of hitting his wife in the face with a telephone receiver was nominated for an Oscar for best actor, for which he was quickly reckoned the prohibitive favorite. If you want to believe the depth and sincerity of Hollywood’s commitment to #MeToo and #TimesUp, a question you have to ask yourself is this: Why was James Franco snubbed but not Gary Oldman?Or, more broadly, why are some famous men experiencing career ramifications as a result of the #MeToo movement while others are not?Franco, who won best actor awards at both the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards this month, seemed like a front-runner in this year’s Oscars race for his performance as Tommy Wiseau in “The Disaster Artist.”But on Jan. 11, Franco’s alleged history became a part of his awards season narrative. In a report published by the Los Angeles Times, five women came forward with allegations that Franco had been a sexual tyrant while working with them as an acting teacher and mentor. Franco has disputed these claims and others, but his Oscar snub seemed like a sign of a new age of accountability, when professional honors are withheld on the basis of allegations of misconduct. Well, some honors. Occasionally withheld. And maybe only on the basis of certain kinds of misconduct. Consider Gary Oldman, who was nominated for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour.” In 2001, Oldman’s then wife, Donya Fiorentino, filed papers in L.A. Superior Court alleging that Oldman had assaulted her with a telephone. Per the New York Daily News, she wrote:As I picked up the phone to call the police, Gary put his hand on my neck and squeezed. I backed away, with the phone receiver in my hand. I tried to dial 911. Gary grabbed the phone receiver from my hand, and hit me in the face with the telephone receiver three or four times. Both of the children were crying.Oldman denied the allegations, saying at the time that they were “replete with lies, innuendos and half-truths.” Police investigated the claims. No charges were ever filed.Or consider Kobe Bryant, who secured an Oscar nomination for a short film called “Dear Basketball.” In 2003, Bryant was accused of raping an employee at a hotel in Edwards, Colorado. In the runup to the criminal trial, the woman, 19 years old, was made to walk the Sex Crime Accuser Stations of the Cross. The case was dropped, but the woman sued Bryant. They eventually settled out of court, and Bryant apologized to the accuser without admitting guilt.Or consider Kirk Douglas, who earlier this month got the grand-old-lion treatment at the Golden Globes, when he introduced the nominees for best screenplay. Douglas is long rumored to have raped Natalie Wood when she was 16 years old. How do we reconcile the approbation these men have received with the Academy turning its back on Franco? Is it simply a matter of paying your dues? Oldman and Douglas were famous long before they were accused of any sort of transgression against women. Has Franco simply not garnered enough respect or clout in the industry for us to turn a blind eye to the allegations?Is it reputation? Is Franco’s alleged conduct held to be more offensive because of his self-branding as a sort of sexual maverick? Does Oldman, in a strange way, benefit from the expectations created by his illiberal politics, which will never put him in the position of being a hypocrite on the subject of gender?Or is it just a question of timing? The fresher the allegations, the more likely we are to make an example of the alleged miscreant. Have men like Oldman or Johnny Depp or Casey Affleck, men who were accused of things long before #TimesUp, been “grandfathered” in, as it were? It seems reasonable to think that Oldman, had he found himself in the midst of a fresh round of allegations this awards season, might have also been snubbed.If time were truly up, these questions would be irrelevant. It isn’t, and they’re not, and right-wing commentators want to see the asymmetries in Hollywood’s response as evidence of a disqualifying hypocrisy. But the larger folly is in thinking Hollywood could ever be anything but short-memoried, selective and situational in its moral judgments when the star-making and -breaking machinery around it — the media and the courts, among other institutions — operate in the same way.Gary Oldman is an Oscars favorite because whatever happened in 2001 left no mark on his record, legal or otherwise. Hollywood wasn’t going to make an example of someone whose example was scarcely even known.Kobe Bryant got an Oscar nomination because the dark parts of his past had long ago been boxed out of the public narrative about him. Hollywood wasn’t going to cut against a consensus about Kobe it had no role in creating. There are many Francos and many Oldmans across the country. They are not all glamorous movie star actors, but they are all men who have used their power and professional reputations as currency for getting away with “it,” however heinous or relatively harmless “it” may be. These Francos and Oldmans are tenured professors, CEOs, restaurant owners, construction site supervisors, retail store managers. And like Franco and like Oldman, these men have faced consequences for their actions arbitrarily, unpredictably, and with varying degrees of severity. Maybe “Why Franco and not Oldman?” is the wrong question. Maybe asking Hollywood alone to smooth out these contradictions, to adjudicate solely by way of an awards ballot the cases that neither the courts nor the media were eager to take on in the first place, is a pointless endeavor. Maybe a better question is whether Hollywood is really snubbing Franco at all. As of Jan. 18, he has 14 movie projects in various stages of development, films that he is starring in, producing, directing. Losing an Oscar is one thing. Losing a lucrative career in Hollywood is quite another. "
35,POLITICS,Andrew Anglin's Lawyer Visited The Elusive Nazi’s Hometown And Madness Ensued,Luke O'Brien,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazi-andrew-anglin-lawyer-mark-randazza_us_5a6a3622e4b0ddb658c4a36b,"A zany search for Anglin roped in process servers, raffish locals and lurking TV journalists.",2018-01-25,"Marc Randazza (above) represents Andrew Anglin, the mind behind America’s biggest neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a3aa91d000027006acd58.jpeg?cache=XnAbbGBJLh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was late on Saturday when I learned that Marc Randazza, attorney to the trolls, might be flying to Columbus, Ohio. Randazza would be leaving New York on Monday, I’d heard. On some flight. Any flight. I didn’t know the details. But I was intrigued.For the past few months, I’ve been tracking Randazza’s most notorious client, Andrew Anglin, the deranged mind behind America’s biggest neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer. And Anglin is from Columbus. His Nazi business is based there. He’s registered to vote there. His family lives there. But Anglin himself is in hiding.He had gone on the lam in an attempt to avoid a lawsuit brought against him in Montana federal court by Tanya Gersh, a Jewish real estate agent in Whitefish whom Anglin had attacked on his site last winter after Gersh became embroiled in a property dispute with the mother of Richard Spencer, a leader of the “alt-right” white supremacist movement. For weeks, Anglin’s army of troll readers bombarded Gersh with hateful, threatening messages, many of them referencing the Holocaust. To defend his client, Randazza had gone low, arguing that Anglin shouldn’t be held responsible for any of his followers’ threats because the Nazi doesn’t believe the genocide happened. (“Wow, just wow,” white supremacist attorney Kyle Bristow tweeted in apparent admiration of Randazza’s defense strategy.)But the lawyerin’ didn’t stop there. Randazza is also asserting that the federal court has no jurisdiction over Anglin because, he claims, his client is domiciled overseas in an undisclosed location as a “stateless citizen.” Anglin might be living in Nigeria, Randazza has suggested ― or Russia, or Cambodia, maybe. A week ago, Anglin submitted a sworn declaration — complete with passport stamps — stating that in July 2013 he left Ohio and the greater United States “for the last time,” never to return. That struck me as hooey for several reasons. While reporting on Anglin, I’d interviewed Robert “Azzmador” Ray, one of Anglin’s Nazi flunkies. I asked Ray, who lives in Texas, if he’d ever met Anglin in person. Ray told me he had. “Sometime in 2015,” he said. “He was visiting somebody in Houston and he asked me to drive down and we met in person.”Last February, I’d almost cornered Anglin in a Columbus courthouse after he showed up for a mandatory in-person hearing to expunge a criminal record. A court clerk told me I’d missed him and his local attorney by a few minutes. Anglin later admitted on The Daily Stormer that he’d been at the courthouse.And then there was the Columbus process server who’d been hired to find Anglin. The process server told me that in December he’d spotted Anglin in a Columbus-area grocery store. My report enraged Anglin and he told his readers that I’d fabricated the process server, only to have the man, Jeff Cremeans, come forward and submit a sworn declaration to the court two days later. Randazza dismissed Cremeans’ account as a “fantastic tale.”How curious, then, that the attorney to the trolls was traveling to Anglin’s hometown of Columbus.On Monday, Randazza settled into his seat on Delta 6016 and swiped through his Twitter feed. What a weekend he’d had. On Saturday, he’d partied in Hell’s Kitchen at the “Night for Freedom” bash thrown by another client, the far-right propagandist and PizzaGate pusher Mike Cernovich. Some big pro-Trump “free speech advocates” were there, speechifying about “brown people” and “faggots” and the genitalia of transgender women. The next day, Randazza met up with family members at Professor Thom’s, a sports bar in the East Village, to watch his Patriots win the AFC Championship.Solid weekend. Real solid.From his plane seat, Randazza banged out a few quick tweets, including a response to a friendly white supremacist who wanted to know whether he was in New York. Yes, Randazza told him. “My drone told me your whereabouts,” the white supremacist joked. Randazza didn’t have time to respond again. His plane was leaving.I’d found out which flight the lawyer was on by comparing New York departure times to his Twitter activity. Randazza tweeted until Delta 6016 took off, then stopped. When the plane landed, he started tweeting again, responding to the friendly white supremacist’s drone joke. “Then where am i now?” Randazza tweeted, doing his best Jason Bourne impression.Cremeans was already waiting for him at gate C56.I’d called Cremeans earlier that day to ask if he’d heard anything about Randazza coming to town. He hadn’t, so I told him about Delta 6016. Cremeans decided to post up at the airport in “the hopes of trying to get Andrew Anglin served.” He told me he didn’t bother to hide as Randazza strutted out of the gate. The two made eye contact. “He was pissed,” Cremeans said. He filmed Randazza walking to baggage claim. He filmed Randazza fidgeting.Randazza tried to lose the process server by going into a bathroom. When he emerged, he hid behind a pillar. Then he took a photo of Cremeans, still unsure of who was following him.Randazza made his way to an elevator. Cremeans took an escalator. The escalator, however, went down two levels, and by the time Cremeans had raced back to Randazza’s floor, the attorney had left the airport.Randazza strives to create the appearance of distance between himself and his far-right clients. “I am a pretty far left-wing guy,” he told me in October. “Mr. Anglin and I certainly don’t see eye-to-eye on much.” But there is no little troll in Randazza, and he has more recently written that “those who are sometimes called ‘alt right’ are some of the most open and accepting of diverse views people I’ve met in politics.”Views such as:And:A few hours after Randazza gave Cremeans the slip, he couldn’t resist tweeting a photo of the ceiling of an unnamed Columbus restaurant.I’d already called local hotels and learned that Randazza was staying downtown at the Westin in room 319. When I noticed his ceiling tweet, I looked for a restaurant match nearby and found one: Mitchell’s Steakhouse, a white-tablecloth, leather-booth joint. I called Cremeans. He was 30 minutes away. Randazza had been at Mitchell’s for over an hour by then. Cremeans figured the lawyer would be gone and decided to head home.But an hour later, some locals I know opted to swing by the steakhouse and called me.“He’s here!”“Randazza?” I said.“Anglin! He’s here right now!”The locals had walked past a window of the steakhouse and spotted a small bald man who matched Anglin’s description. The man sat near the window, his back to the street. He wore a blue shirt, a red tie and hipster glasses with black rims, the locals said. He was at a table with another person, a man in his 30s with black hair wearing a blazer. Randazza was nowhere to be seen.The locals held up their phones and tried to get a photo of the bald man through the blinds, but his companion noticed and nodded at the window to warn him. The bald man didn’t turn around to look, according to my sources. He seemingly knew better and twisted his body away from the cameras.I called Cremeans. Aghast, he jumped in his car and gunned it for Mitchell’s, blowing through red lights. A few minutes later, my source outside Mitchell’s told me that the bald man had vanished. My source thought he’d seen the man and his companion rush out of the restaurant, across the street and into a bar attached to the Renaissance hotel.“How certain are you that it was Anglin?” I asked.“I’m 75 percent certain based on appearance, 90 percent certain considering his behavior.”But was it? On Monday, Anglin’s normally prolific posting on Gab, a far-right social media platform, had dipped considerably. Was the Nazi distracted by his legal affairs?By the time Cremeans arrived on the scene, he was too late. The process server searched for Anglin in the bar and the common areas of the Renaissance hotel without luck. There was, however, another surprise: Cremeans had brought a Vice News camera crew with him, the same one that had been in Charlottesville, Virginia, for the white supremacist riot last August. Elle Reeve and her producer, Josh Davis, had been following Cremeans around Columbus, piggybacking off my reporting and hoping to get the million-dollar shot of Anglin being served. On Monday night, the TV journalists stood outside the Renaissance hotel, helpless.I called Randazza at his hotel room. He didn’t answer. I sent him an email and told him I’d be putting up a story about his being in Columbus and wanted to give him a chance to comment. On Tuesday, he emailed back. What follows is a rough transcript of our conversation, with some less-relevant questions and answers omitted:Randazza: “Mitchell’s Steak House is supposed to be the best steakhouse in Columbus. I found it rather uninspired. The bone in filet was fine, but the sides were really bland. I think I’m spoiled after my years in Vegas.”That night, he emailed to tell me he was in Chicago.Trolls will troll.On Wednesday, Anglin himself couldn’t resist chiming in on Gab to announce that he’d spoken to Randazza and was running low on funds to pay him. (Anglin, who has taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin, often cries poor to sucker gullible readers into sending more money.)Then Anglin revealed what might be Randazza’s fee. If accurate, the attorney is raking in the Reichsmarks.And then Anglin posted this:On Thursday, I heard from another set of local Columbus sources. People who had been inside Mitchell’s that night. I’d shown them photos of Randazza and Anglin. Both men, the sources said, had been in the steakhouse on Monday.Do you have information on the whereabouts of Anglin? We’ll safeguard your anonymity.

Since then, she has endured character assassinations from Nassar’s defense attorneys, a constant onslaught of victim-blaming, and the inevitable isolation of being the only woman to publicly accuse him for six months. On Wednesday, she was the last of 169 survivors and family members to give her victim impact statement in court after a week-long sentencing hearing for Nassar. Her words were comprehensive, powerful and full of resilience. “You started the tidal wave. You made all of this happen. You made all of these voices matter. Your sister survivors and I thank you,” Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said in response to Denhollander’s impact statement. Nassar, who is accused of sexually abusing over 140 women, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday afternoon on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. He is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three more counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.Denhollander’s statement is so all-encompassing, HuffPost decided her story should be read in her own words. Below is her powerful statement in full, lightly edited for clarity.****I do want to thank you, first, Judge Aquilina, for giving all of us the chance to reclaim our voices. Our voices were taken from us for so long, and I’m grateful beyond what I can express that you have given us the chance to restore them.There are two major purposes in our criminal justice system, Your Honor: the pursuit of justice and the protection of the innocent. Neither of these purposes can be met if anything less than the maximum available sentence under the plea agreement is imposed upon Larry for his crimes. Not because the federal sentence he will already serve is lacking, but because the sentence rendered today will send a message across this country, a message to every victim and a message to every perpetrator.I realize you have many factors to consider when you fashion your sentence, but I submit to you that the pre-eminent question in this case as you reach a decision about how best to satisfy the dual aims of this court is the same question that I asked Judge Neff to consider: How much is a little girl worth? How much is a young woman worth?Larry is a hardened and determined sexual predator. I know this first-hand. At age 15, when I suffered from chronic back pain, Larry sexually assaulted me repeatedly under the guise of medical treatment for nearly a year. He did this with my own mother in the room, carefully and perfectly obstructing her view so she would not know what he was doing. His ability to gain my trust and the trust of my parents, his grooming and carefully calculated brazen sexual assault, was the result of deliberate, premeditated, intentional and methodological patterns of abuse ― patterns that were rehearsed long before I walked through Larry’s exam room door and which continued to be perpetrated, I believe, on a daily basis for 16 more years, until I filed the police report.Larry’s the most dangerous type of abuser. One who is capable of manipulating his victims through coldly calculated grooming methodologies, presenting the most wholesome, caring external persona as a deliberate means to insure a steady stream of children to assault. And while Larry is unlikely to live past his federal sentence, he is not the only predator out there, and this sentence will send a message about how seriously abuse will be taken.So, I ask, how much is a little girl worth? How much priority should be placed on communicating that the fullest weight of the law will be used to protect another innocent child from the soul-shattering devastation that sexual assault brings? I submit to you that these children are worth everything. Worth every protection the law can offer. Worth the maximum sentence.The second aim of this court and our criminal justice system is to pursue justice for the victims that have already been harmed. And this aim too can only be realized by imposing the maximum sentence under the plea agreement, and in reaching this decision too, we also must answer the question, how much was a little girl worth? How much were these young women worth? This time, however, the little girls in question are not potential victims. They are real women and children, real women and little girls who have names and faces and souls. Real women and children whose abuse and suffering was enjoyed for sexual fulfillment by the defendant.I believe sometimes, your honor, that when we’re embroiled in a legal dispute, the words of our legal system designed to categorize and classify and instruct can inadvertently sterilize the harsh realities of what has taken place. They can serve as a shield against the horror of what we are really discussing. And this must not ever happen. Because the truth about what Larry has done must be realized to its fullest depth if justice is to ever be served.And so, for a moment, your honor, I, like every woman who’s come before you, want to take a moment to drop that shield. Larry meticulously groomed me for the purpose of exploiting me for his sexual gain. He penetrated me, he groped me, he fondled me. And then he whispered questions about how it felt. He engaged in degrading and humiliating sex acts without my consent or permission. And Larry enjoyed it. Larry sought out and took pleasure in little girls and women being sexually injured and violated because he liked it. And as I and so many other women and little girls were being violated, Larry found sexual satisfaction in our suffering. As we were being sexually violated even as very young children, as young as 6 years old, Larry was sexually aroused by our humiliation and our pain. He asked us how it felt because he wanted to know. What was done to myself and these other women and little girls, and the fact that our sexual violation was enjoyed by Larry, matters. It demands justice, and the sentence you impose today will send a message about how much these precious women and children are worth. You have seen our pictures, your honor ― moments in time captured when they were young and vulnerable and violated.I think of the young girl that I was and the little girls and young women all of these survivors were every day. I feel like I see them in the faces of my two precious daughters. When I watch my daughters’ eyes light up as they dance to “The Nutcracker,” I remember the little girl that I and all of these women used to be. The sparkle their eyes must have had, as mine did, before their innocence was taken. I watched my daughters love and trust unreservedly and I remember the long road that it has been to let myself love and be loved without fear. I think of the scars that still remain for all of us.One of the worst parts of this entire process was knowing, as I began to realize what had happened to me, how many other little girls had been left destroyed, too. I was barely 15 when Larry began to abuse me, and as I lay on the table each time and try to reconcile what was happening with the man Larry was held out to be, there were three things I was very sure of. First, it was clear to me this was something Larry did regularly. Second, because this was something Larry did regularly, it was impossible that at least some women and girls had not described what was going on to officials at MSU and USAG. I was confident of this. And third, I was confident that because people at MSU and USAG had to be aware of what Larry was doing and had not stopped him, there could surely be no question about the legitimacy of his treatment. This must be medical treatment. The problem must be me.And because I had friends who were physical therapists who practiced legitimate internal pelvic floor techniques, I also knew at 15 that to practice this, you must have specialized training and certification. Surely anyone who had heard that Larry was penetrating little girls would have demanded to know where he got his training, and if there was any question, he would’ve never been allowed near me.And so, I lay still and on the first two points, I was right. It was something he did often. And others had described Larry’s treatment before. In fact, though I didn’t know it at the time, four girls and women had described in detail to three different athletic departments at MSU what he was doing and his penetration and their belief that they had been sexually assaulted. It was reported to Kathie Klages, MSU’s head gymnastics coach, to a track coach and to multiple athletic trainers and supervisors years before I walked into Larry’s door.But I was wrong in my third belief. I was wrong that surely, if someone had been made aware of what Larry was doing, they would report it and ensure it was legitimate before ever allowing him near another child. I did not know when I was 15 that in 1997, three years before I walked into Larry’s exam room, that MSU’s head gymnastics coach, Kathie Klages, had waved a report form in front of Larissa Boyce after being told by two separate gymnasts of what Larry was doing and told Larissa there would be consequences for her if she reported.I did not know that Tiffany Thomas Lopez had reported the penetration and sexual assault to athletic trainer Destiny Teachnor-Hauk and to other athletic trainers and supervisors two years before I walked into Larry’s door.I did not know that Christie Achenbach had reported the penetration and sexual assault to her track coach and her athletic trainers and had also been silenced a full year before I walked into Larry’s door. I did not know that Jennifer Bedford had also reported to Destiny Teachnor-Hauk and asked if she could file a report that Larry’s treatment made her feel uncomfortable and that she had also been silenced.I believed the adults at MSU surrounding Larry would do the right thing if they were aware of what Larry was doing, and I was terribly wrong. And discovering that I could not only not trust my abuser but I could not trust the people surrounding him has been devastating. It is part of the consequences of sexual assault, and it needs to be taken seriously.I did not know that at the same time Larry was penetrating me, USAG was systematically burying reports of sexual assault against member coaches in a file cabinet instead of reporting them, creating a culture where predators like Larry and so many others in the organization, up to the highest-level coaches, were able to sexually abuse children, including our Olympians, without any fear of being caught.I did not know that, contrary to my belief, the elite gymnasts whose pictures were plastered on Larry’s wall were far from protected. That USAG, rather than supervising Larry, was allowing him to treat these girls in their own beds without even having a medical license in Texas.I did not know any of these things, and so as Larry was abusing me each time, I assured myself it must be fine because I thought I could trust the adults around me. My misplaced trust in my physician and my misplaced trust in the adults around me were wielded like a weapon, and it cost me dearly. And it follows me everywhere.I would like to take a moment now to address both organizations whose failures led to my sexual assault, because it is part of the consequences that I now carry. ... MSU, we have been telling our stories for more than 18 months, and you have yet to answer a single question I have asked. Every time I repeat these facts about the number of women who reported to employees at MSU and were silenced, you respond the exact same way. You issue a press statement saying there is no cover-up because no one who heard the reports of assaults believed that Larry was committing abuse.You play word games saying you didn’t know because no one believed. I know that. And the reason everyone who heard about Larry’s abuse did not believe it is because they did not listen. They did not listen in 1997 or 1998 or 1999 or 2000 or 2004 or 2014. No one knew, according to your definition of know, because no one handled the reports of abuse properly.Victims were silenced, intimidated, repeatedly told it was medical treatment and even forced to go back for continued sexual assault. You have stated in a motion to dismiss our civil suit that, ironically, is being heard right now in court as I am speaking, that the reports that were given in 97, ’98, ’99 and 2000 to track coaches, head gymnastic coaches and athletic trainers and supervisors don’t, quote, count as notice because these teenagers didn’t report it to the right official. The 14-year-old didn’t go to the right person.You have stated that no reports of sexual assault count as notice unless it is reported to a person who is capable of firing the alleged perpetrator. This entirely contradicts the letter that president Simon sent all 11,000 MSU employees in 2012, reminding them that MSU policy requires them to report any suspected child abuse and any allegations of sexual assault against someone at MSU. So, MSU, which is it? Do your employees have a duty to protect children or not?It has been 18 months, and I am still asking the same questions, hoping that the little girls that come after me will have adults that they can trust. And I’ve been getting the same answer for a year, and so I am asking point-blank again, when Kathie Klages humiliated Larissa Boyce and the second gymnast, greatly compounding the trauma of their sexual assault, and waved the report form in front of her telling her there would be consequences if she reported.Is this the right way or the wrong way to handle sexual assault allegations on MSU campus? When Tiffany Thomas Lopez reported her abuse to athletic trainers and supervisors and the trainers used the emotional pain Tiffany was in after her father’s death to convince her it would be too exhausting and painful to bother filing a report, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle a report of sexual assault on MSU campus?When Christie Achenbach reported the sexual assault to her track coach and athletic trainers and was also silenced, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle the report of sexual assault on MSU’s campus?When Kyle Stevens’ parents reported Larry’s sexual abuse of their daughter to a MSU psychiatrist and he brought Larry in to talk to her parents instead of reporting, as he was mandated to do by law, was it the right way or the wrong way to handle a report of sexual assault on MSU’s campus?When Amanda Thomas Shaw reported to the Title IX office, and Larry could hand-pick the four colleagues to be interviewed to determine whether his treatment was legitimate, was that the right way or the wrong way to investigate a claim of sexual assault on MSU’s campus?And after all this, when I came forward in 2016, I brought an entire file of evidence with me. I made a police report and a Title IX report, and I brought with me to those reports my medical records showing that Larry had never tried pelvic floor techniques. I brought medical records from a nurse practitioner documenting my graphic disclosure of abuse way back in 2004. I had my journals showing the mental anguish I had been in since the assault. A catalog of national and international medical articles showing what real pelvic floor treatment looks like. I brought a letter from a neighboring district attorney vouching for my character and truthfulness and urging detectives to take my case seriously.I brought a cover letter going point by point through Michigan law and case law, explaining how every element of first-degree criminal sexual assault was met and could be proven.I brought a witness I had disclosed it to in 2004. I brought evidence of two more women unconnected to me who were also claiming sexual assault. And I have the names of three pelvic floor experts willing to speak on my behalf. And the MSPD handled it beautifully, but MSU officials were a different story, because the response of Dean William Strampel was to send an email to Larry that day and tell him, quote, good luck, I am on your side. And when my video testimony to the IndyStar came out, graphically describing the abuse that Larry perpetrated, disclosing horrific details to the world that no one was ever supposed to know, that I had never told anyone, even my own husband, until that point, Dean Strampel forwarded that video testimony to the MSU provost, and he mocked it.He called it the cherry on the cake of his day. President Simon and board of trustees, is this the right way to handle disclosures of abuse on MSU’s campus?When Brooke Lemmen, one of the doctors Larry was allowed to hand-pick to clear himself in 2014, was interviewed for my investigation, she said I hadn’t really been penetrated ― I only thought I had, because, quote, when I am a 15-year-old girl, I think everything between my legs is my vagina. I only thought Larry had put his fingers in me for up to 40 minutes at a time for a full year. I was just confused. Sounds eerily familiar to what Amanda Thomas Shaw was told in 2014 that she, quote, didn’t understand the nuanced differences between sexual assault and a medical exam.It sounds eerily familiar to what every single woman was told all the way back to 1997. We were all wrong. We were all just confused. Board of trustees, is this the right way to handle disclosures of sexual assault on MSU’s campus? And if that were not bad enough, when I finally joined the civil suit five months later, after waiting for almost half a year for MSU to do the right thing, the vice president of the board of trustees, Joel Ferguson, went on television and gave a press interview in which he claimed those of us who have filed lawsuits were ambulance chasers who were looking for a payday.In fact, I know that at least one other high-ranking MSU official has specifically called me out by name and said I’m in it for the money. This has never been contradicted, retracted or refuted. MSU, you need to realize that you are greatly compounding the damage done to these abuse victims by the way you are responding. This, what it took to get here, what we had to go through for our voices to be heard because of the responses of the adults in authority, has greatly compounded the damage we suffer. And it matters.We have waited 18 months to be told no, this is not how we handle this on MSU’s campus. But instead, everyone has doubled down on the claim that nothing was done wrong and the only conclusion that can be reached is that no one truly sees anything wrong with any of this. And that is terrifying. And it leaves me terrified for the little girls of the future, who we are here to protect. And because of this willful ignorance, victim silencing and mishandling of sexual assault reports against Larry in ’97, ’98 and ’99, I walked through Larry’s door in 2000 and never walked out the same.Not long after I stopped seeing Larry, I transitioned from athlete to coach. And every day that I nurture those baby gymnasts, I wondered if any of them would find their way into his exam room.When one of my little girls was finally referred to him, I took a chance and I spoke up and I was kindly cautioned for my own sake to remain silent. My little baby gymnast was sent to Larry before I even knew a decision had been made to do so. Her family moved away almost immediately thereafter and I wept for that little girl and I prayed to God that she was under the age range that Larry preferred. She was 7. But when I filed my police report, Kyle Stevens came forward, and she was 6 ― a year younger than my little girl. And I cried in my kitchen, and I don’t know yet if that little girl walked out the same that she walked in.I transitioned from coaching to working in public policy, and I fought fear every time I had to commute or work close quarters with my male colleagues. I dreaded working on current event or legislation on sexual assault because I knew the memories that would come with it. I still watched gymnastics, but I looked away whenever the cameras panned to the sidelines in case Larry would be there.I wondered almost daily if there was ever a chance my voice would be heard. I began law school was I was 19. And I wrapped up in blankets every time I studied torts or crimes related to sexual assault and I hoped my face wouldn’t betray me in classroom discussions.I researched internal pelvic floor procedures and I tried to find out what had happened to me, and I watched for any sign that I would ever be believed.I met my future husband and I told him what I never wanted to tell anyone, and I wondered if he would walk away, and he didn’t. But I couldn’t even hold his hand or look up at him, because closeness wasn’t safe and trust wasn’t safe. We got married, and my 25th birthday came and went, and I sat up for nights before, believing my ability to file a police report would end on that birthday. I didn’t know the statute of limitations had been lifted.I woke up the morning I turned 25, and instead of feeling joy at a milestone, I only felt hopelessness and grief, because I thought my chance to stop this man was over. I thought daily about all the little women and girls walking in his office and I wondered if it would ever, ever end.I became a mother three times over, and the fear that hung over each birth, knowing I would be vulnerable in a medical setting, cast a horrific shadow over what should have been an occasion of pure joy.And I watched for a chance to be believed and I waited. I held my firstborn and then my two daughters, and each time I did, Larry, I remember the day you brought [your daughter] into your office so that I could hold her. You knew how much I loved children and you used your own daughter to manipulate me.And every time I held my babies, I prayed to God you would leave your abuse in the exam room and not take it home to the little girl born with black hair just like her daddy. And then the IndyStar story came out about the rampant cover-up at USAG, and I knew this was the chance and I wrote them immediately.But because of what Larry did, the cost of making it end has been incredibly high. And the effects of Larry’s abuse has been redoubled in the effort that I took to stop him.Choosing to live those moments over and over, daily, releasing every shred of privacy that I had, living with the reality that not only didn’t I get to choose what you did, but now I didn’t get to choose who knew about it.Even my status as a sexual assault victim has impacted or did impact my ability to advocate for sexual assault victims, because once it became known that I too had experienced sexual assault, people close to me used it as an excuse to brush off my concerns when I advocated for others who had been abused, saying I was just obsessed because of what I had gone through, that I was imposing my own experience upon other institutions who had massive failures and much worse.My advocacy for sexual assault victims, something I cherished, cost me my church and our closest friends three weeks before I filed my police report. I was left alone and isolated. And far worse, it was impacted because when I came out, my sexual assault was wielded like a weapon against me. Often by those who should have been the first to support and help, and I couldn’t even do what I loved best, which was to reach out to others. I was subjected to lies and attacks on my character, including very publicly by attorney Shannon Smith when I testified under oath.I was being attacked for wanting fame and attention, for making up a story to try to get money. Your Honor, since these attacks were made on my character very publicly on public record, I would like to take an opportunity briefly now to correct them. Out of the two women in question that day, Ms. Smith and I, who were attempting to communicate through either questions or answers, I would like to note that only one of us was taking pictures of the courtroom on her cell phone. Only one of us posed for the press and said, quote, I feel like I should say cheese. And out of the two of us, only one of us was making money off her court appearance that day. I don’t feel the need to say anything else. I think I’ve communicated completely.The cost, emotional and physical, to see this through has been greater than many would ever know. And Larry, I don’t need to tell you what the cost of your abuse has been to me, because you got to read my journals, every word of them. Because those had to go into evidence to make this happen.I want you to understand why I made this choice, knowing full well what it was going to cost to get here and with very little hope of ever succeeding. I did it because it was right. No matter the cost, it was right. And the farthest I can run from what you have become is to daily choose what is right instead of what I want.You have become a man ruled by selfish and perverted desires, a man defined by his daily choices repeatedly to feed that selfishness and perversion. You chose to pursue your wickedness no matter what it cost others, and the opposite of what you have done is for me to choose to love sacrificially, no matter what it costs me.In our early hearings, you brought your Bible into the courtroom and you have spoken of praying for forgiveness. And so it is on that basis that I appeal to you. If you have read the Bible you carry, you know the definition of sacrificial love portrayed is of God himself loving so sacrificially that he gave up everything to pay a penalty for the sin he did not commit. By his grace, I, too, choose to love this way.You spoke of praying for forgiveness. But Larry, if you have read the Bible you carry, you know forgiveness does not come from doing good things, as if good deeds can erase what you have done. It comes from repentance, which requires facing and acknowledging the truth about what you have done in all of its utter depravity and horror, without mitigation, without excuse, without acting as if good deeds can erase what you have seen in this courtroom today.If the Bible you carry says it is better for a stone to be thrown around your neck and you thrown into a lake than for you to make even one child stumble. And you have damaged hundreds.The Bible you speak carries a final judgment where all of God’s wrath and eternal terror is poured out on men like you. Should you ever reach the point of truly facing what you have done, the guilt will be crushing. And that is what makes the gospel of Christ so sweet. Because it extends grace and hope and mercy where none should be found. And it will be there for you.I pray you experience the soul crushing weight of guilt so you may someday experience true repentance and true forgiveness from God, which you need far more than forgiveness from me ― though I extend that to you as well.Throughout this process, I have clung to a quote by C.S. Lewis, where he says, my argument against God was that the universe seems so cruel and unjust. But how did I get this idea of just, unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he first has some idea of straight. What was I comparing the universe to when I called it unjust?Larry, I can call what you did evil and wicked because it was. And I know it was evil and wicked because the straight line exists. The straight line is not measured based on your perception or anyone else’s perception, and this means I can speak the truth about my abuse without minimization or mitigation. And I can call it evil because I know what goodness is. And this is why I pity you. Because when a person loses the ability to define good and evil, when they cannot define evil, they can no longer define and enjoy what is truly good.When a person can harm another human being, especially a child, without true guilt, they have lost the ability to truly love. Larry, you have shut yourself off from every truly beautiful and good thing in this world that could have and should have brought you joy and fulfillment, and I pity you for it. You could have had everything you pretended to be. Every woman who stood up here truly loved you as an innocent child, real genuine love for you, and it did not satisfy.I have experienced the soul satisfying joy of a marriage built on sacrificial love and safety and tenderness and care. I have experienced true intimacy in its deepest joys, and it is beautiful and sacred and glorious. And that is a joy you have cut yourself off from ever experiencing, and I pity you for it.I have been there for young gymnasts and helped them transform from awkward little girls to graceful, beautiful, confident athletes and taken joy in their success because I wanted what was best for them. And this is a joy you have cut yourself off from forever because your desire to help was nothing more than a facade for your desire to harm.I have lived the deep satisfaction of wrapping my small children up in my arms and making them feel safe and secure because I was safe, and this is a rich joy beyond what I can express, and you have cut yourself off from it, because you were not safe. And I pity you for that.In losing the ability to call evil what it is without mitigation, without minimization, you have lost the ability to define and enjoy love and goodness. You have fashioned for yourself a prison that is far, far worse than any I could ever put you in, and I pity you for that.And this is also why in many ways, your honor, the worst part of this process was each name, each number who came forward to the police with each Jane Doe, I saw my little girls and the little girls that were. The little girls who walked into Larry’s office that I could not save because no one wanted to listen. And while that is not my guilt, it is pain I still carry and pain I share with them.I cried for them, and with every tear that fell I wondered who is going to find these little girls, who is going to tell them how much they are worth, how valuable they are, how deserving of justice and protection?Who is going to tell these little girls that what was done to them matters? That they are seen and valued, that they are not alone and they are not unprotected? And I could not do that, but we are here now, and today that message can be sent with the sentence you hand down, you can communicate to all these little girls and to every predator to every little girl or young woman who is watching how much a little girl is worth.I am asking that we leave this courtroom ... knowing that when Larry was sexually aroused and gratified by our violation, when he enjoyed our suffering and took pleasure in our abuse, that it was evil and wrong.I ask that you hand down a sentence that tells us that what was done to us matters, that we are known, we are worth everything, worth the greatest protection the law can offer, the greatest measure of justice available.And to everyone who is watching, I ask that same question: How much is a little girl worth? Larry said in court that he hoped education and learning would happen from this tragedy, and I share that hope, and this is what we need to learn.Look around the courtroom, remember what you have witnessed these past seven days. This is what it looks like when someone chooses to put their selfish desires above the safety and love for those around them, and let it be a warning to us all and moving forward as a society.This is what it looks like when the adults in authority do not respond properly to disclosures of sexual assault.This is what it looks like when institutions create a culture where a predator can flourish unafraid and unabated, and this is what it looks like when people in authority refuse to listen, put friendships in front of the truth, fail to create or enforce proper policy and fail to hold enablers accountable.This is what it looks like. It looks like a courtroom full of survivors who carry deep wounds. Women and girls who have banded together to fight for themselves because no one else would do it. Women and girls who carry scars that will never fully heal but who have made the choice to place the guilt and shame on the only person to whom it belongs, the abuser. But may the horror expressed in this courtroom over the last seven days be motivation for anyone and everyone no matter the context to take responsibility if they have failed in protecting a child, to understand the incredible failures that led to this week and to do it better the next time.Judge Aquilina, I plead with you as you deliberate the sentence to give Larry, send a message that these victims are worth everything. In order to meet both the goals of this court. I plead with you to impose the maximum sentence under the plea agreement because everything is what these survivors are worth. Thank you.Need help?

37,LATINO VOICES,Gina Rodriguez On The Lack Of Latino Representation: It’s ‘Dehumanizing’,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gina-rodriguez-on-the-lack-of-latino-representation-its-dehumanizing_us_5a6a3c18e4b01fbbefb008c1,"The actress wrote that the community's underrepresentation in Hollywood is ""devastating"" in an essay for Variety.",2018-01-25,Gina Rodriguez at the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a4c8c1600004500138d61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Gina Rodriguez refuses to say quiet about the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood. The “Jane the Virgin” actress wrote a poignant essay about the importance of seeing more Latinos on-screen for Variety on Wednesday ― the latest in a series of public remarks she’s made this week on the subject. “To be seen and heard is a simple human need,” the Puerto Rican star wrote. “To be invisible in a world of loud voices is heartbreaking and dehumanizing. The under-representation of Latinos in Hollywood both on and off screen is not just a feeling; it’s a sad reality.”“Latinos are not only prominent and loyal in the consumer market but also make up one of the largest demographics at the box office every opening weekend,” she continued. “The fact that we are not seen on screen despite our vast contributions is devastating.” Rodriguez also pointed out the need to represent the true diversity of the Latino community, including Afro-Latinos. “It is our responsibility as an industry to give this entire generation positive representation so that no one feels invisible,” she added. For years the Chicago-born actress hasn’t just preached about Latino representation in television and film, she’s also been trying to be a part of the solution. Rodriguez spotlights actors of color on social media with her #MovementMonday posts and is working on bringing diverse projects to television with her production company I Can & I Will. “To our beautiful community, let’s unite and use one of our greatest strengths, our buying power to finally be heard,” Rodriguez tweeted on Wednesday with a link to her Variety essay. “They say were a risk - so let’s prove them wrong. It’s up to us to create the Latino presence on screen that reflects our world. It’s time to take back our power.”“Guardians of the Galaxy” star Zoe Saldana responded to the tweet with a message in Spanish: “Thank you @HereIsGina. Your words serve me like a breath after so much evaporated sacrifice in a white and empty desert.” Rodriguez called out Hollywood for the lack of Latino leads in film during a red carpet interview with E! News at Sunday night’s SAG awards, pointing to the community’s consumer power as avid moviegoers and the fact that the Latino population in the U.S. is more than 55 million strong. The actress also expressed disappointment via Twitter after the 2018 Oscar nominations were announced Tuesday, with Latinos missing from all four acting categories. "

Prior to leaving, Jholie had reportedly been Snapchatting with an unknown individual. She told her twin sister, Zhane, that she was stepping out and would be right back.Jholie failed to return home, and no one knows what happened to her after she left.Later that night, at about 8 p.m., Zhane received an unusual text message from her sister saying she was heading to a party in Norfolk, Stewart said. Norfolk is approximately 190 miles from Alexandria. While the teen’s mother said the message was sent from Jholie’s phone, it’s unclear whether it was Jholie or someone else who sent it.When Jholie failed to return home, her mother filed a missing person report with the Fairfax County Police Department. Contacted by HuffPost on Wednesday, officer Kent Bailey said Jholie has been entered into the National Crime Information Center database as a runaway juvenile.Stewart does not agree with that designation.“Just because she voluntarily left her home does not mean she voluntarily left her block,” Stewart said. “Labeling her a runaway takes away a sense of urgency. Basically, we were told to do our own thing, look for her, and if we see anything to let them know.”Bailey declined to share additional information in the case. Stewart said her daughter, a 10th-grader at Mount Vernon High School, does not have a history of running away.“It would be completely out of character for her,” she said. “She’s never broken curfew and is an honor roll student. This week she was supposed to go take the test for her driver’s permit and she was excited about that. It’s just odd that they would consider her a runaway.”Stewart described her daughter as a timid young woman who doesn’t easily take to strangers.“She wouldn’t get into a car with anyone or speak with anyone she doesn’t know,” Stewart said. “She’s quiet and a not a social butterfly. She’s also short and skinny. If you didn’t know her, you wouldn’t think she is 16. She looks to be about 13 or 14.”Zhane was unavailable to talk about her missing twin Wednesday. They look alike and share the same tattoo ― an infinity symbol with their names. Their mother said she can’t recall a single time before now that the twins were apart for more than 24 hours.“Their personalities are different, but they’re extremely close,” said Stewart. “Zhane is taking this very hard ― very hard. We’re trying to make sure she gets up, showers, gets out of bed and eats. She’s having a hard time doing any of those things.”Stewart said the family has received little information from police. However, the department did notify the family that they’ve enlisted the help of the FBI.For now, Jholie’s family has no choice but to wait for the answers they desperately seek.“We have no clue what’s going on,” Stewart said. “Obviously, the detectives can’t tell us everything and we understand that, we just want them to bring her home.”Jholie’s mother also said that no one should be afraid to come forward with information.“I urge whoever knows the whereabouts of Jholie to not be fearful,” Stewart said. “If you have her, please take her to any high school and let her walk in. You can be anonymous. And while I highly doubt Jholie is a runaway, I want her to know that if she decided to leave for whatever reason, she can come home. She’s not in trouble and we will get help and get through this together. We just want her home. That’s it. Whatever it takes, we can work it out.”Jholie Moussa is described as 5 feet, 2 inches tall and approximately 104 pounds. She has brown eyes and black hair, which had blonde braids at the time of her disappearance. She has a tattoo on her right shoulder of an infinity symbol with her name and her sister’s name.The teen was last seen wearing blue jeans that were torn in the front, a black-and-white plaid shirt, a black puffy jacket with brown fur on the collar and black Ugg boots.Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Jholie Moussa is asked to call the Fairfax County Police Department at 703-691-2131 or the FBI at 202-278-2000.

Seems kind of depressing,” Page, a FBI lawyer, wrote in the text to Strzok from her FBI-issued phone. “Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society.”Republican lawmakers seized upon the “secret society” reference this week, claiming to see sinister motives, and it started popping up all over cable news chyrons.

But have you ever thought about where the worn-down stuff actually goes?About 10-30 percent of the rubber from car tires is lost as they wear out, a European Commission review reports. The majority of that material ends up on, or at the side of, the road, but most of us don’t realize that tiny tire wear particles small enough to be inhaled are also mixed into the air we breathe.While a number of scientific studies have found tire dust has adverse health effects, the tire industry ― and studies it has commissioned ― suggests otherwise. Air pollution in the U.S. causes as many as 200,000 premature deaths each year. Motor vehicles are a major source of this pollution. Exposure to pollutants from motor vehicles can cause lung and heart problems and early death, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Although significant work has gone into researching the contribution of emissions from exhaust pipes to air pollution, emissions such as those produced by tire wear have been largely overlooked, professor Frank Kelly, chair in environmental health at King’s College London, told HuffPost.There is much that needs to be investigated, not only when it comes to the potential health effects but also around what actually goes into tires.Since the recipes manufacturers use for their tires are generally kept under wraps, exactly what these tire wear particles contain is “a bit of a black box,” said Kelly, who provides policy support on air pollution to the World Health Organization.The findings of a study co-authored by the academic in 2013 suggest that reducing exposure to tire dust would likely lead to improvements in health. But more research is needed to better understand the health effects of tire wear particles, Kelly said, especially as non-tailpipe emissions ― from brake pads and road surfaces as well as tires ― become increasingly important while exhaust emissions are brought under control.The tire industry, however, has pushed back on suggestions that tire wear particles have health effects. The Tire Industry Project ― an industry body chaired by the three biggest tire manufacturers, Michelin, Bridgestone and Goodyear ― says it is working to develop a better understanding of the possible health and environmental effects of tire and road wear particles (TRWP). As part of this ongoing work, it has commissioned a series of peer-reviewed publications. “The key takeaway from TIP’s research so far has been that the presence of TRWP presents no significant risk to humans and the environment,” Philippe Fonta, the managing director of TIP, told HuffPost by email.Cyrille Roget, global head of scientific and innovations communications at Michelin Group, told HuffPost: “All the studies that we have been looking at indicate that those particles in fact do not present any danger.” Despite repeated requests, Michelin did not provide HuffPost with these studies. Michelin did say it is developing a tire with a biodegradable tread made from material such as hay or beets.Concerns over tire particle pollution also raise questions about frequently cited ideas for tackling vehicle-related pollution, such as electric cars.Electric vehicles (EVs) are being touted as one of the most promising solutions to the air pollution crisis, especially in cities. But while they can significantly reduce tailpipe emissions, they won’t tackle the effects of non-tailpipe emissions from the likes of tire waste.Jonathan Grigg, professor of pediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University London, told HuffPost that cities should go further than just promoting EVs and genuinely rethink urban transport to move away from private car use.“Yes, we can achieve a lot with EVs, but we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that we need to be able to move around our cities in different ways than just individual cars,” said Grigg, whose research focuses on air pollution and health.Cities around the world are experimenting with ways to get vehicles off the streets. Los Angeles is phasing out heavy-duty diesel trucks from its port and overhauling the mass transit system, while Norway is replacing car parking spaces with bike lanes and closing certain streets to private traffic in its capital city, Oslo. Brussels and Ghent in Belgium have also been experimenting with car-free initiatives, with mixed success. In Paris, major intersections are being redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over vehicle traffic.There’s a long way to go, however, not least of all in America. “In the current anti-regulatory political climate of the U.S., government officials are attempting to downplay the health impacts of poor air quality,” Natalie Nava, project leader at the environmental group Greenpeace USA, told HuffPost. “But don’t be fooled ― the air we breathe is important.

44,IMPACT,Air Pollution Exposed: Why You Might Be Breathing In Tire Waste,Tess Riley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/air-pollution-cars-tire-waste_us_5a6896e3e4b0dc592a0e6f8e,It's a little-discussed type of pollution but could be affecting your health.,2018-01-25,Traffic makes its way through Times Square in New York City.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a689bd81d000027006acadc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Most drivers know the importance of checking tires regularly to see how worn down they are ― if you don’t, your car is an accident waiting to happen. But have you ever thought about where the worn-down stuff actually goes?About 10-30 percent of the rubber from car tires is lost as they wear out, a European Commission review reports. The majority of that material ends up on, or at the side of, the road, but most of us don’t realize that tiny tire wear particles small enough to be inhaled are also mixed into the air we breathe.While a number of scientific studies have found tire dust has adverse health effects, the tire industry ― and studies it has commissioned ― suggests otherwise. Air pollution in the U.S. causes as many as 200,000 premature deaths each year. Motor vehicles are a major source of this pollution. Exposure to pollutants from motor vehicles can cause lung and heart problems and early death, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Although significant work has gone into researching the contribution of emissions from exhaust pipes to air pollution, emissions such as those produced by tire wear have been largely overlooked, professor Frank Kelly, chair in environmental health at King’s College London, told HuffPost.There is much that needs to be investigated, not only when it comes to the potential health effects but also around what actually goes into tires.Since the recipes manufacturers use for their tires are generally kept under wraps, exactly what these tire wear particles contain is “a bit of a black box,” said Kelly, who provides policy support on air pollution to the World Health Organization.The findings of a study co-authored by the academic in 2013 suggest that reducing exposure to tire dust would likely lead to improvements in health. But more research is needed to better understand the health effects of tire wear particles, Kelly said, especially as non-tailpipe emissions ― from brake pads and road surfaces as well as tires ― become increasingly important while exhaust emissions are brought under control.The tire industry, however, has pushed back on suggestions that tire wear particles have health effects. The Tire Industry Project ― an industry body chaired by the three biggest tire manufacturers, Michelin, Bridgestone and Goodyear ― says it is working to develop a better understanding of the possible health and environmental effects of tire and road wear particles (TRWP). As part of this ongoing work, it has commissioned a series of peer-reviewed publications. “The key takeaway from TIP’s research so far has been that the presence of TRWP presents no significant risk to humans and the environment,” Philippe Fonta, the managing director of TIP, told HuffPost by email.Cyrille Roget, global head of scientific and innovations communications at Michelin Group, told HuffPost: “All the studies that we have been looking at indicate that those particles in fact do not present any danger.” Despite repeated requests, Michelin did not provide HuffPost with these studies. Michelin did say it is developing a tire with a biodegradable tread made from material such as hay or beets.Concerns over tire particle pollution also raise questions about frequently cited ideas for tackling vehicle-related pollution, such as electric cars.Electric vehicles (EVs) are being touted as one of the most promising solutions to the air pollution crisis, especially in cities. But while they can significantly reduce tailpipe emissions, they won’t tackle the effects of non-tailpipe emissions from the likes of tire waste.Jonathan Grigg, professor of pediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University London, told HuffPost that cities should go further than just promoting EVs and genuinely rethink urban transport to move away from private car use.“Yes, we can achieve a lot with EVs, but we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that we need to be able to move around our cities in different ways than just individual cars,” said Grigg, whose research focuses on air pollution and health.Cities around the world are experimenting with ways to get vehicles off the streets. Los Angeles is phasing out heavy-duty diesel trucks from its port and overhauling the mass transit system, while Norway is replacing car parking spaces with bike lanes and closing certain streets to private traffic in its capital city, Oslo. Brussels and Ghent in Belgium have also been experimenting with car-free initiatives, with mixed success. In Paris, major intersections are being redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over vehicle traffic.There’s a long way to go, however, not least of all in America. “In the current anti-regulatory political climate of the U.S., government officials are attempting to downplay the health impacts of poor air quality,” Natalie Nava, project leader at the environmental group Greenpeace USA, told HuffPost. “But don’t be fooled ― the air we breathe is important. If the government and companies fail to take action to improve our air, we will be dealing with a global health catastrophe.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Los Angeles is phasing out diesel trucks.

Friese added that the party has no issue with Wagner’s decision.It’s unclear what prompted Wagner’s religious conversion. Alternative for Germany, or AfD, rose to prominence beginning in 2015 with the influx of refugees and migrants into Europe. The party worked to appeal to mainstream Germans by stoking fear of a cultural overhaul and a threat to the German lifestyle.“What they’ve done is create this extraordinary newspeak where all of their positions are justified in terms of liberal arguments about right to an identity, right to a separate culture ― arguments about how far a Western culture can absorb a non-Western culture,” Roger Griffin, an expert on fascism and modern history at Oxford Brookes University, told HuffPost last year.The party was voted into Germany’s Bundestag, or parliament, for the first time in last year’s elections.

The PLO leader evaded bombings and military operations ― either through clandestine means or because the Israeli military called the attempts off, citing the possibility of heavy civilian casualties. Arafat finally died in 2004 at age 75.The attempts to kill him often verged on the cinematic, according to the Times.In one instance, Bergman reports that Sharon ordered Israeli agents to plant a “massive set of bombs” under a VIP area at a stadium in Beirut, where the PLO was set to hold a celebration. The explosives were in place, and “with the push of one button, they would achieve the destruction of the entire Palestinian leadership.”But the plan was called off after senior officials voiced their concerns to then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.In another instance, Sharon considered downing commercial flights that Arafat was scheduled to be aboard, according to the article, citing three Israeli officers familiar with the planning:“When Mossad reported that Arafat was flying more commercial flights, with the PLO often buying the entire first-class or business-class cabin for him and his aides, Sharon decided that such flights would be legitimate targets. The plane would have to be shot down over the open sea, far from the coast, so that it would take investigators a long time to find the wreckage and establish whether it had been hit by a missile or had crashed because of engine failure.In 1982, Sharon, then defense minister, ordered a military operation to shoot down an aircraft he believed Arafat was aboard. The air force, acting on information from the Mossad intelligence service, hesitated and soon realized the plane was not carrying Arafat, but his younger brother, Fathi. The passengers also included 30 injured Palestinian children.“Since World War II, Israel has used assassination and targeted-killing more than any other country in the West, in many cases endangering the lives of civilians,” Bergman wrote. He also said he “discovered a long history of profound ― and often rancorous ― internal debates over how the state should be preserved.”“Can a nation use the methods of terrorism? Can it harm innocent civilians in the process? What are the costs? Where is the line?”Read the entire New York Times Magazine article here."

49,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare For All’ Online Town Hall Draws Over 1 Million Live Viewers,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-town-hall_us_5a680274e4b0dc592a0dbcf6,The Vermont senator delighted in circumventing the television networks.,2018-01-24,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) relished making his case that the United States should follow other countries that treat health care as a right.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6804971d000027006aca06.jpeg?cache=WuPT53be2R&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders’ televised town hall on Tuesday night to promote single-payer health care, or “Medicare for all,” drew a live audience of about 1.1 million people ― all but a few hundred of whom viewed the event online.For Sanders, whose single-payer health care legislation elicited the support of over one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus, the 90-minute broadcast at the U.S. Capitol visitors center was an opportunity to promote a top policy priority while thumbing his nose at the “corporate media.”“This is the first Medicare for all town meeting held in our nation’s capital. This is the first nationally televised town meeting on Medicare for all,” Sanders said in his introductory remarks. “And very importantly, this is the first nationally televised Senate town meeting that is taking place outside of corporate media.”The Vermont senator is a frequent critic of mainstream news outlets for their alleged focus on superficial political matters and failure to entertain narratives that threaten their corporate owners. Although Sanders has participated in more than one live health care debate on CNN, he told The Washington Post earlier this month that a large media network failed to respond to his inquiries about a broadcast solely on the topic of government-provided health care coverage.But Sanders’ town hall, which was co-hosted by the left-leaning online video news outlets The Young Turks, NowThis and ATTN, demonstrated that a lengthy seminar on the complicated topic of single-payer health care can draw a crowd as large as many primetime cable news shows.The auditorium itself was packed to capacity with some 450 attendees. And together, the live audiences on the senator’s Facebook and YouTube pages, the the three news sites and some other outlets that picked up the stream added up to about 1.1 million people.The event consisted of three expert panel discussions moderated by Sanders: the first discussing problems with the current American health care system; the second on the potential economic impact of a “Medicare for all” program; and the third comparing the American health care system with those in other countries. Each of the three segments also featured questions from the live audience and video queries submitted online.Since revealing his new single-payer bill in September, Sanders has doggedly promoted it. In October, he even toured top-flight health care facilities in Toronto to showcase the achievements of the single-payer system in Canada.Some of Sanders’ guests on Tuesday, including Richard Masters, the pro-single payer CEO of MCS, a Pennsylvania-based picture frame maker, and Dr. Claudia Fegan, chief medical officer for the Cook County Health and Hospital System in Chicago, were veterans of his legislative rollout and his Canada trip, respectively.Other guests were new ― like Dr. Donald Berwick, a Harvard medical school professor who led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration ― reflecting the steady progress of Sanders’ cause into the mainstream. As one of the Democratic Party’s premier health policy experts and technocrats, Berwick’s imprimatur is a major asset.When Sanders asked whether there was any good reason not to expand Medicare, Berwick replied, “No, there’s no reason. It’s just will.”Berwick described how Medicare’s public mission and centralized bargaining power, as the insurer for some 55 million Americans, allowed him to easily troubleshoot problems like the over-sedation of nursing home patients.“You can stand up for people,” Berwick recalled of his position at Medicare’s helm. “Why wouldn’t we do that for all Americans, not just people over 65?”Sanders relished the opportunity to tee panelists up with knowing questions that knocked down conservative straw man arguments against single-payer health care.The exercise was likely most useful for hardened single-payer advocates looking for a pep rally and for center-left Americans concerned about health care affordability who haven’t settled on a policy framework to explain the system’s problems. It is less predictable how Sanders’ pitch would fare with more skeptical health care consumers.As Sanders is fond of noting, polling shows that a majority of Americans support single-payer health care.But nearly half of Americans get health coverage from an employer, and they’d be forced to give up what they have and pay higher taxes for an expanded version of Medicare that might not produce promised cost savings overnight. The passage of the Affordable Care Act provoked hysteria through its cancellation of some 400,000 individuals’ health care plans; there is no telling how people would react to a forced transition of much greater proportions.But Sanders, who has been campaigning for single-payer health care since he first entered Congress in 1991, is betting that the movement is finally accelerating. What makes the current moment different, he argued, is that the same digital revolution that made his campaign possible also allows progressives to communicate directly with the public.“The reason we’re doing this program tonight is you don’t see this stuff,” he said in his concluding remarks. “It ain’t gonna be on CBS. It ain’t gonna be on NBC.”“What astounds me is we already have a pretty good majority of the American people who already believe in universal health care, believe that it is the government’s responsibility to make sure that health care is a right,” Sanders added. “And we have reached that stage with media not talking about the issue at all.”"

In the months since the incident, the federal government hasn’t offered any explanation as to what led unnamed federal law enforcement officers to shoot and kill 25-year-old Bijan Ghaisar. But local authorities on Wednesday released a disturbing dashcam video that sheds new light on the shooting and could put pressure on the federal government to bring charges against the agents involved.The dashcam video shows the fatal encounter that was a culmination of a police chase of Ghaisar’s Jeep. An unidentified federal officer hops out of the passenger seat of his police vehicle and points his gun at Ghaisar’s stopped vehicle. As the officer stands near the driver’s side of the Jeep pointing his weapon, the car slowly moves forward. The officer fires once. He fires four more times. His partner comes up behind him. More shots are fired, and the vehicle abruptly stops. Officers with the U.S. Park Police shot Ghaisar in the head four times on Nov. 17. Ghaisar, who by all accounts was unarmed and alone on George Washington Memorial Parkway, died 10 days later due to brain damage. Since then, the Ghaisar family has been seeking answers from the federal government about what happened to the football-loving young man from suburban Virginia who worked at his dad’s accounting firm and was looking forward to becoming an uncle.“Not only did we lose Bijan, on top of it [all] but ... we have no information,” Ghaisar’s mother, Kelly, told HuffPost. “The total silence of this case makes us, our whole family, feel even worse, because we have to deal with Bijan’s loss and the way that he was taken.”In shootings involving federal officers, like the U.S. Park Police which are under the U.S. Interior Department’s National Park Service, there’s often little information available upfront, while shootings involving local officers typically provide more.The FBI is now investigating the case, but they initially opposed releasing the video. Federal authorities still haven’t named the two officers who killed Ghaisar, though the Interior Department has said they’re both on administrative leave. The lack of public information on the investigation has garnered criticism. The Washington Post’s editorial board criticized the dearth of information about the shooting last December, calling it “a mockery of the open society that distinguishes the United States from autocracies and dictatorships.”But the veil of secrecy surrounding Ghaisar’s death was lifted a bit on Wednesday, when Fairfax County Chief of Police Edwin Roessler issued a press release for the dashcam video. While Fairfax officers weren’t involved in Ghaisar’s shooting, they did assist the U.S. Park Police in chasing Ghaisar’s vehicle. Roessler said he was releasing the video as a “matter of transparency to all in our community, especially the Ghaisar family.” He added he was confident in the FBI’s investigation.U.S Park Police say they pursued Ghaisar’s vehicle after his SUV was involved in a collision on southbound George Washington Memorial Parkway at Slaters Lane in Alexandria, Virginia. Ghaisar reportedly was hit by an Uber driver in a Toyota Corolla before driving off. The Uber driver told FOX 5 that he and his passenger got Ghaisar’s license plate tag and called police. The Uber driver and his passenger did not report any injuries. The Uber driver was ticketed for failing to maintain proper control, according to the police report HuffPost obtained.Fairfax Police later joined U.S. Park Police in their pursuit of Ghaisar, which initially began around 7:30 p.m. EST. Ghaisar is seen in the video being stopped twice by U.S. Park Police before coming to a full stop the third time at Fort Hunt and Alexandria. During the previous stops, police are seen pulling up alongside Ghaisar’s car, and drawing their weapons. Ghaisar’s family has speculated that the officer’s weapons frightened Ghaisar and caused him to drive off again.The video “shows the senseless killing of a young man at the hands of those charged” with protecting the public, said Roy Austin Jr., an attorney for the family who previously served in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division before joining former President Barack Obama’s White House.“Bijan Ghaisar was repeatedly threatened by over-aggressive and out-of-control law enforcement officers, after he drove away from a minor traffic incident in which he was the victim and in which there was little property damage and no known injuries,” Austin said in a Wednesday statement. “No one was even close to being in harm’s way until a pair of U.S. Park Police officers repeatedly shot Bijan at close range as he sat, unarmed, in his Jeep on a residential street. We don’t know why the U.S. Park Police officers shot Bijan multiple times, or whether those officers are still patrolling the area’s parkways. What we do know is that justice demands that those responsible for taking Bijan’s life answer for this illegal and unconstitutional killing.”Ghaisar’s family and friends want to know how a minor fender bender escalated into a police chase that ultimately ended in the young man’s death. Ghaisar graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2015 and worked for his father’s firm Caesar & Associates in McLean, Virginia. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.Friends and family who knew Ghaisar described him as being very upbeat and positive and as an avid New England Patriots fan. A first-generation Iranian-American, Ghaisar and sister were born in Virginia. His parents immigrated to the United States decades ago.“I believe that the people who shot and killed Bijan should be held accountable. Doesn’t matter if they are police officers or civilians. Once you kill someone in this heinous way, you should be held accountable and that’s what I want to see,” said Kelly Ghaisar. “This whole thing, it’s such an out of body experience ... but we are trying to cope because we want to get justice for Bijan. It’s what drives us to get out of bed and do something.”Abdelaziz reported from New York, Reilly reported from Washington."

In a time when many are worried about the negative impact fake news has had on democracies around the world, the 81-year-old pope said it was the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth. “If responsibility is the answer to the spread of fake news, then a weighty responsibility rests on the shoulders of those whose job is to provide information, namely, journalists, the protectors of news,” he wrote.In the message, Francis said fake news grabs people’s attentions by appealing to stereotypes and prejudices and exploiting their anxieties and frustrations. In the United States, the proliferation of fake news stories, especially on social media sites, caused concern during and after Donald Trump’s election. A BuzzFeed analysis found that in the final months of the presidential campaign, fake news stories drew more shares and engagement on Facebook than real news from major outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post.Last September, The New York Times found that Russian hackers had created fake accounts on social media sites to promote fake news stories during the election. Some public figures, like Trump, have capitalized on fears about fake news to attack the media and discredit news sources he disagrees with. Francis did not mention any specific, modern-day examples of fake news in his message. However, he did refer to what he believes is the first instance of fake news ― the story of the “crafty serpent” who tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden.The pope recounted the Biblical story in his message, which says the serpent asked Eve if God had instructed her not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. God had never told Adam not to eat from any tree, Francis said, but only from one tree, the tree of knowledge. This opens the door to more misinformation and enticement, which ultimately had disastrous effects for Adam, Eve, and the rest of humanity, the pope said.“We need to unmask what could be called the ‘snake-tactics’ used by those who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place.” The best antidote to fake news is not strategy, Francis wrote, but people who are ready to engage in sincere dialogue and take responsibility for how they use language. He invited people to promote a “journalism of peace” that is opposed to lies and “sensational headlines,” and that serves people who have no voice. “We can recognize the truth of statements from their fruits: whether they provoke quarrels, foment division, encourage resignation; or, on the other hand, they promote informed and mature reflection leading to constructive dialogue and fruitful results,” Francis wrote.

In the United States, the proliferation of fake news stories, especially on social media sites, caused concern during and after Donald Trump’s election. A BuzzFeed analysis found that in the final months of the presidential campaign, fake news stories drew more shares and engagement on Facebook than real news from major outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post.Last September, The New York Times found that Russian hackers had created fake accounts on social media sites to promote fake news stories during the election. Some public figures, like Trump, have capitalized on fears about fake news to attack the media and discredit news sources he disagrees with. Francis did not mention any specific, modern-day examples of fake news in his message. However, he did refer to what he believes is the first instance of fake news ― the story of the “crafty serpent” who tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden.The pope recounted the Biblical story in his message, which says the serpent asked Eve if God had instructed her not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. God had never told Adam not to eat from any tree, Francis said, but only from one tree, the tree of knowledge. This opens the door to more misinformation and enticement, which ultimately had disastrous effects for Adam, Eve, and the rest of humanity, the pope said.“We need to unmask what could be called the ‘snake-tactics’ used by those who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place.” The best antidote to fake news is not strategy, Francis wrote, but people who are ready to engage in sincere dialogue and take responsibility for how they use language. He invited people to promote a “journalism of peace” that is opposed to lies and “sensational headlines,” and that serves people who have no voice. “We can recognize the truth of statements from their fruits: whether they provoke quarrels, foment division, encourage resignation; or, on the other hand, they promote informed and mature reflection leading to constructive dialogue and fruitful results,” Francis wrote.

Bill Clinton is president, Nirvana is one of the biggest bands in the world and high schooler Bradley Cooper is a senior at Pennsylvania’s Germantown Academy, writing a steamy editorial about hooking up with his best friend. Tommy Rowan, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, uncovered Cooper’s first piece for The Philadelphia Daily News and tweeted it out on Tuesday. The headline, “When best friends cross the line,” says it all. Rowan tweeted a photo of the article, and a larger version can be seen here. He also confirmed its authenticity in an email to HuffPost.According to Rowan, Cooper wrote the piece as an 18-year-old intern at the newspaper. He quoted Cooper’s introductory paragraph, “Can best friends who are of the opposite sex hook up with each other without destroying their friendship? In my case, yes . . . so far.”The reporter called that declaration “bold.” “Bold” is one of many words that can be used to describe Cooper’s piece. The article goes on to talk about the progression of his relationship with his “best friend,” Deborah Landes. “I know once you take that step over the platonic line everything is supposed to change,” Cooper wrote. “Suddenly you start to hate that guy she always told you was hot. But that’s not really true in my case.”His article also includes such gems as: There has always been an underlying attraction between the two of us; however, it was never confronted until this year. Before, we could never fathom the idea of being more than just friends, especially because she was involved in a relationship with a friend of mine. After they broke up, things began to change.This sweet bit about prom: We never even thought twice about going to the prom with anyone else.And a reference to the sun setting on their relationship once summer begins:It is somewhat easy to say everything is cool now, because we are still in school. The real test will probably come when I have to hear about how much fun she’s having at the shore this summer.Just for fun, here’s another photo of Cooper from his high school days: Needless to say, people had a lot of thoughts about the article after Rowan tweeted it out.It’s safe to say we all know what happened to Cooper after the article’s publication. He went to Villanova University for a year, graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in English, picked up some French at some point and ultimately became an A-list actor. He’s now in a relationship with model Irina Shayk and the two have one child, a daughter born in 2017. Deborah Landes and a representative for Cooper did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost."
54,POLITICS,Wisconsin Republicans Abruptly Decide To Oust Top State Elections And Ethics Officials,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wisconsin-election-officials_us_5a68f253e4b002283009199e,The head of a watchdog group called it “one of the most grotesque abuses of power that has occurred in Wisconsin in its history.”,2018-01-24,Republicans in Wisconsin voted not to confirm the heads of the state's election and ethics commission on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a693cd61600004500138bfd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wisconsin Republicans voted Tuesday to remove the state’s top election and ethics officials, despite looming state and federal elections.Led by Republicans in a vote along party lines, the state Senate voted to oust Ethics Administrator Brian Bell and Elections Administrator Michael Haas from their respective roles by denying to confirm them on a permanent basis. Both men did not get a customary public hearing before the vote.Haas and Bell previously worked for the state’s Government Accountability Board when it was probing whether the campaign of Gov. Scott Walker (R) illegally coordinated with outside conservative groups. The probe was shut down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2015, but The Guardian obtained information from the investigation and published an article on its contents. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel (R) conducted an investigation into the leak and recommended charges against nine people who worked on the probe, but not Bell and Haas. Despite that, House Speaker Robin Vos (R) and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R) both called on Haas and Bell to resign.The Government Accountability Board was disbanded in 2015 and replaced with the state ethics commission and election commission. In 2016, the members of the elections commission, which is bipartisan, unanimously picked Haas to lead it. The six-member body is charged with overseeing and implementing Wisconsin’s election laws. Haas’ removal comes just weeks before a Feb. 20 primary in the state and a little under three months before the first day when candidates can begin circulating petitions for the 2018 fall election. As Wisconsin’s chief election official, Haas is responsible for administering those elections, ensuring compliance with federal law and overseeing investigation and enforcement of the state’s election code. He is also charged with overseeing the state’s election equipment, a role with increased importance this year because Wisconsin was one of 21 states targeted by Russian hackers ahead of the 2016 presidential election.Mark Thomsen, a Democrat and the election commission’s chairman, noted during a meeting Wednesday that Haas was the only person in the agency with the required clearance to work with the Department of Homeland Security to secure the state’s election system.Haas only had a peripheral role in the Walker probe, where he was responsible for legal documents, but not the core part of the investigation into the governor’s campaign, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.Meanwhile, the members of the state’s ethics commission unanimously picked Bell to serve as their administrator in 2016. The six-member panel is charged with overseeing the state’s campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws. An investigation by the ethics commission into Bell found there was “not a scintilla of evidence” he was partisan in his duties at the Government Accountability Board. Earlier this month, Bell said he left the board because it was too partisan.Fitzgerald, the Republican Senate leader, said Tuesday the fact that neither men had been linked to wrongdoing didn’t really matter to him.“I can’t have confidence in an agency that still is employing some of the individuals that were there [the Government Accountability Board],” he told the Wisconsin State Journal on Tuesday.Chris Ott, the executive director of the Wisconsin ACLU, said the timing of Haas’ dismissal was suspicious and said the sudden push to oust the officials was out of the blue.“The Wisconsin Senate’s vote yesterday along party lines to try ousting the head of our Elections Commission looks like political interference in a nonpartisan agency that helps and protects Wisconsin voters, just a few weeks before important statewide elections start,” he said in a statement.Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, called the vote not to confirm Haas and Bell “one of the most grotesque abuses of power that has occurred in Wisconsin in its history.”“No evidence, no charges, no specific examples of misconduct, nothing. Just secret agreement among the members of the majority party in the State Senate to get rid of them both, right before important elections, and replace them, presumably, with sycophants and pawns that the Republicans will dictate what they decide and what the result of their work on elections and ethics will be,” Heck said in a statement.Wisconsin law says both the election and ethics commissions ”shall be under the direction and supervision of an administrator, who shall be appointed by a majority of the members of the commission, with the advice and consent of the senate” to a four-year term. While the law says the administrator will only serve on an interim basis until approved by the state Senate, it also says the administrator can only be removed “by the affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the commission voting at a meeting of the commission called for that purpose.” The Walker administration said Wednesday it does not believe the commission can legally appoint Haas to lead it. “Because the Senate voted against confirmation of the potential Administrator who was serving as the interim, there was no way for the statutory requirement of ‘consent of the Senate’ to be met and thus the appointment had to end. This is not a removal of an administrator because the administrator serves as interim until consented to,” Steven Michels, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Department of Administration, said in an email to HuffPost.A legal fight is expected over Haas’ future at the election commission.Thomsen, the commission’s chairman, believes only the commissioners can vote to fire Haas despite the Senate vote. The panel met Wednesday afternoon and split along party lines about keeping Haas, with Republicans saying they believed the law made the administrator position vacant after the Senate vote on Tuesday. The election panel eventually voted 4-2 to keep Haas as administrator through April 30 to oversee some of the state’s elections.Fitzgerald told reporters Tuesday he hoped the Republicans on the commission would decline to support Haas. He said he also wants lawmakers to get rid of the positions of two civil servant lawyers at the ethics and elections commission who worked at the Government Accountability Board.“It’s just hard to develop any type of cooperative relationship or establish credibility as long as some of those people are over there,” he said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel."
55,MEDIA,Garrison Keillor's Former Station Reports He Was Fired For More Than Touching A Woman's Back,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/garrison-keillor-misconduct-mpr-news_us_5a67be98e4b002283007ab54,An investigation reveals allegations of misconduct going back to 1998.,2018-01-24,"Humorist and longtime radio personality Garrison Keillor performs at City Winery in New York City on Oct. 4, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a67ccd81600004500138a03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Garrison Keillor, the former Minnesota Public Radio host who was fired for harassment, may have done far more than “accidentally” place his hand on a female colleague’s bare back, as he claimed in November.MPR News published an investigative report Tuesday on 75-year-old Keillor, revealing allegations of inappropriate behavior going back as far as 1998.The report claims Keillor, a humorist who created the MPR variety show “A Prairie Home Companion,” wrote and displayed a suggestive poem about an employee in his bookstore, sent $16,000 and a confidentiality agreement to a subordinate he was romantically involved with, and told a 21-year-old student in his writing class that he was intensely attracted to her.MPR’s report comes nearly two months after a colleague accused Keillor of acting inappropriately with her. MPR responded to the accusation by cutting business ties with and firing Keillor.In a statement to the Minneapolis Star Tribune in November, Keillor defended himself by saying that he was trying to console a colleague by patting her on the back, but that his hand had moved up her bare back:I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it. We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.In the report published Tuesday, MPR News interviewed former staff members who worked with Keillor on shows including “The Writer’s Almanac” and “A Prairie Home Companion,” and his bookstore in St. Paul, Common Good Books.While some of Keillor’s former colleagues described the radio host as a reserved and respectful man, others claimed he treated women unfairly, made sexist remarks and could be cruel.Keillor was romantically involved with two former female colleagues who weren’t named in MPR News’ piece. Their colleagues told the news organization that while those relationships were consensual, they also had a harmful power dynamic.Through his Prairie Home Productions company, Keillor gave one of the women a $16,000 check, a confidentiality agreement and a new work contract, but she didn’t sign or use them.Patricia McFadden, who worked for “The Writer’s Almanac” in 1998, filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Keillor and MPR, and claimed that Keillor had a “pattern and practice of abusive conduct” that included “hostile and demeaning” emails and memos. McFadden said MPR had told her she was being fired due to “restructuring,” but she was instead replaced with a younger woman.Molly Hilgenberg, who worked at Common Good Books, told MPR News that Keillor had once written a sexually suggestive poem about her on the whiteboard behind the store’s cash register. She showed MPR News a photo of the poem on the white board ― and another with employees’ attempts to cover it up.The poem, which Hilgenberg said Keillor later apologized for, reads:A beauty who goes to Macalester ―In addition to its investigative report on Keillor, MPR News published an editor’s note on Tuesday saying its editorial staff members were working “independently of their parent company’s senior leadership.” MPR operates under the nonprofit public radio organization American Public Media Group, which is headquartered in the same building in Minnesota.MPR noted that its newsroom and APMG’s offices are on separate floors, and that the journalists who covered Keillor’s harassment did so “as they would if covering some other company.” Before Keillor’s alleged misbehavior was made public, he wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post, published Nov. 28, defending Al Franken after sportscaster Leeann Tweeden accused the former senator of kissing and grabbing her without her consent.“This is pure absurdity, and the atrocity it leads to is a code of public deadliness,” Keillor wrote. The Washington Post later added a note to Keillor’s op-ed: “Knowing he was under investigation for his workplace behavior, [Keillor] should not have written a column on that subject; or, if he was going to write, he should have told his editors and readers that he was under investigation.”Days after publishing the op-ed, and after his alleged abuse was made public, Keillor defended his own reputation in a statement to the Star Tribune, calling himself “the least physically affectionate person in the building.”“If If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the belt line, I’d have at least a hundred dollars,” he added. “So this is poetic irony of a high order.”Keillor did not return HuffPost’s request for comment on the latest allegations against him.Read MPR News’ full report on Keillor here.Clarification: Headline has been amended to reflect MPR News did not cite Keillor’s touching his colleague’s back as the principle reason for his termination."

She has even been pitching ideas.“Lauren wants to be something very specific,” Sherman-Palladino said. “She has it all figured out.”Sherman-Palladino didn’t give details about Graham’s potential character (will she play a role similar to Lorelai? Or a cheeseburger? Or a cheeseburger with a side of cheeseburger?) But she did offer a few tidbits about the second season of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) and Suzie (Alex Borstein) are taking their comedy act on the road, according to Sherman-Palladino. And by “road,” she means the Catskills, where comedians such as Joan Rivers, Billy Crystal and Rodney Dangerfield honed their acts.“I want to see those two girls stay some nights in shitty hotels and playing some dumpy clubs,” Sherman-Palladino said.So, places that are nothing like the Dragonfly Inn, then."

Modi’s remarks came just hours after Trump slapped tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines ― a move decried by Asian nations as the “America First” leader’s trade battle with China escalates.“Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalization,” Modi cautioned. “The negative impact of this kind of mindset cannot be considered less dangerous than climate change or terrorism.”The prime minister delved further into climate change, which has become a contentious issue between Trump and other world leaders since he pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Trump once dismissed global warming as a “concept” that was “created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” (Yes, really.)Next up to take a swing at Trump was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who vowed on Tuesday to “push back against the anti-trade tendency in globalization that will leave us all worse off.” “We’re working very hard to make sure that our neighbor to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and [how it] has benefited not just our economy, but his economy and the world’s economy,” Trudeau added, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has repeatedly slammed the trade pact between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico as “the worst deal ever” and threatened to upend it.Then, in a direct blow to Trump and the U.S., Trudeau announced that Canada would join a massive Pacific trade deal with 10 other countries, not including the U.S.The newly established Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership is a revised version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which collapsed as a result of Trump’s withdrawal last year.Trump has dedicated much of his year-old presidency to trying to erase his predecessor’s legacy and curb U.S. leadership on global trade. The TPP was President Barack Obama’s signature trade achievement. Obama also spent years renegotiating and reaffirming NAFTA.On Wednesday morning, German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed Modi’s warnings about rising protectionist tendencies among major economic powers.“If we are of the opinion that things are simply not fair, that there is no reciprocity, then we have to seek multilateral answers, and not pursue a unilateral protectionist course where we isolate ourselves,” she said.Without directly mentioning Trump’s influence, Merkel also lamented Europe’s passive approach to foreign policy.“We need to take more responsibility,” she said. “We need to take our destiny into our own hands.” Merkel’s words were reminiscent of earlier remarks, made some months after Trump’s inauguration, in which she suggested the long-standing Western alliance was threatened by his presidency.“The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over,” she said in May. “We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands.”In English, French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a snide comment clearly directed at Trump in absentia on Wednesday.“When you look at the snow outside, it could be hard to believe in global warming,” Macron said. “Obviously and fortunately, you didn’t invite anybody skeptical of global warming this year.” Touché."

Hours later, the media advocacy group sent out a press release stating it would hold two demonstrations against this year’s Academy Awards. NHMC is seeking to raise awareness about the lack of Latino representation, both in front and behind the camera.“For years the success of the major film studios has been won on the backs of U.S. Latinos who represent 23 percent of all movie ticket buyers and 18 percent of the U.S. population,” NHMC president and CEO Alex Nogales said in the statement. “Yet, on- and off-screen and in the narratives Hollywood’s movies tell, Latinos remain the most underrepresented minority in the industry. Enough is enough. It’s time to end the whitewashing and put Latinos in front of and behind the camera.”Latino actors and actresses have been underrepresented throughout Oscar history, with only 16 nominations and six wins over a period of 90 years.Representation in the film industry in general is similarly bleak. Only 3.1 percent of speaking characters were Latino in 2016′s top 100 films, according to a report by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. The media coalition said its first demonstration will be on Feb. 5 at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ honoree luncheon. The second demonstration will be held on March 3. The time and location of both events have not yet been announced. “Hollywood continues to be challenged by gender and ethnic diversity,” Nogales said. “Our upcoming demonstrations are only the first of what will become increasingly aggressive wake-up calls to Hollywood studios to end institutionalized racism against Latinos. By targeting the Academy Awards, we’re serving notice to the motion picture industry that we’re not asking for equity anymore. We’re demanding it.”"

The Human Rights Campaign announced Tuesday it would honor Tony-, Grammy- and Emmy-winning singer-actress Audra McDonald with this year’s National Equality Award, in recognition of her “outstanding efforts in standing up” for queer rights, at the 2018 HRC Greater New York Gala. HRC’s President Chad Griffin praised McDonald for not only “captivating and inspiring audiences around the globe in a truly profound way,” but also using “her incredible talent to help make the world a better place by speaking out for the vulnerable and the oppressed.” Slated to speak at the Feb. 3 event in New York is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). The organization chose the senator as a speaker, Griffin said, because she has been “on the front lines” in terms of resisting the Trump administration’s anti-LGBTQ agenda.“From fighting back against Trump’s transgender military ban to pushing for LGBTQ non-discrimination protections, Sen. Gillibrand stands shoulder to shoulder with the LGBTQ community as a champion of equality,” he added. McDonald has been an outspoken LGBTQ rights advocate for years. In 2015, the Broadway icon railed against then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allowed business owners to cite religious beliefs as a reason to discriminate against customers. “Some of the closest people to me ... are LGBTQ. I have family members that are LGBTQ. That they don’t have the same rights that I do is heartbreaking to me, and wrong,” she told Variety last year. “I just feel it in the very core of my being, the injustice ... I can’t be silent. These are my friends. These are my family.”The 2018 HRC Greater New York Gala will be held Feb. 3. "

The suit contends that Pruitt’s directive violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act, a 1972 law that requires such committees to be fairly balanced and “not be inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest.”“I am committed to serving on federal advisory committees because I believe this is one of the most effective ways for me to use my scientific expertise to promote public health,” Sheppard said in a statement Wednesday. “This directive forces me to choose between my own work and my commitment to the public.”In order to keep her seat on an advisory committee, Sheppard told HuffPost, she chose to walk away from a $3 million grant her university recently received from the EPA. The funding would have allowed her to continue studying how air pollution affects the cardiovascular system.“I’ve been working on the study for over 10 years,” Sheppard said. “So, yeah, I would like to continue to work on that study ― absolutely. ... The EPA already has good processes in place to review and manage conflicts of interest, and I don’t think this directive contributes to that.”For many scientists, funding from the EPA or other government agencies is one of the few financial resources available. While Pruitt claimed the ban would “strengthen member independence,” critics said the move would clear a path for industry-friendly advisers to gain more influence within the agency. In a statement Wednesday, Joshua Goldman, senior legal analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, called the directive “an abuse of power and an affront to the scientific integrity of the EPA and the federal government.”The nonpartisan legal advocacy nonprofit Protect Democracy and the law firm Jenner & Block filed the suit for the plaintiffs in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.“Anti-democratic governments thrive on obfuscating truth and seeking to suppress scientists and other authoritative voices that offer accurate information,” said Protect Democracy counsel Jamila Benkato. “The EPA’s directive is one more example of the administration’s assault on facts.”Under Pruitt, a Trump appointee and longtime fossil fuel proponent, the EPA has taken a more industry-friendly approach to regulations and rolled back a number of environmental protections. Several veteran EPA officials have quit since Pruitt came on board, while dozens of other people have been booted from their positions on the agency’s scientific advisory boards. Michael Abboud, press secretary for the EPA, told HuffPost he could not comment on pending litigation. But Liz Bowman, associate administrator for the agency’s Office of Public Affairs, said Pruitt’s statement from an October press release about the directive spoke “directly” to the claims in the lawsuit.Read the scientists’ full complaint below:"

NASA is calling it a “lunar trifecta,” since it’s a combination of three distinct events. First, the moon that morning will be a “supermoon,” since it’s occurring near a perigee, or a time in the moon’s orbit when it is closest to the Earth. This means that the moon will be about 14 percent brighter than usual, according to NASA.Secondly, it is the second full moon of the month. Full moons are typically separated by 29 days. Usually, every calendar month only has one full moon, but sometimes, a second one squeezes in. When this happens, as it will on Jan. 31, the event is commonly referred to as a “blue” moon. But what will really make the Jan. 31 moon spectacular for some viewers is the fact that it will be happening during a total lunar eclipse. That means the moon will pass through the Earth’s shadow and take on a reddish glow ― which gives it the nickname “blood moon.”This is the second supermoon to light up the sky this January. The first occurred on Jan. 1, and was the biggest Americans will see year. The last time people in North America were treated to a blue moon occurring simultaneously with a total lunar eclipse was over 150 years ago, according to Space.com.The “super blue blood moon” will be most visible to people on western part of North America, Alaska, and the Hawaiian islands, according to Gordon Johnston, program executive and lunar blogger at NASA. People on the East Coast will not have as great a view, since the eclipse begins just as the moon is about to set and the sky is getting lighter.Johnston advises East Coasters who want to give moon viewing a chance to be outside at about 6:45 a.m. EST. It’s best to head to a viewing point at a higher elevation, with a clear line of sight to the horizon toward the west.Americans living in the Central time zone will have a better view. The Earth’s reddish shadow will be noticeable on the moon by about 6:15 a.m. CST. The best viewing will be on the West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska. The eclipse begins at 3:48 a.m. PST and will reach a peak between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.“Weather permitting, the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii will have a spectacular view of totality [the eclipse] from start to finish,” said Johnston. While the Jan. 31 lunar eclipse will be tough to see from some parts of the United States, there are other spectacular heavenly displays in store for Americans in the future. Johnston said another lunar eclipse will occur on Jan. 21, 2019, that will be visible throughout the country. Although that one will be a supermoon, it won’t be a blue moon. So if you’re on the West Coast, the “super blue blood moon” may be worth waking up early for. “Set your alarm early and go out and take a look,” Johnston said.

65,BLACK VOICES,Erica Garner Secretly Filmed A DOJ Meeting. It’s The Companion To Video Of Her Dad's Killing.,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/erica-garner-secretly-filmed-doj-meeting-video-twitter_us_5a68e266e4b0dc592a0f04f3,"A June 2017 meeting with Justice Department officials left Garner, who died in December, feeling frustrated.",2018-01-24,"Erica Garner, who passed on Dec. 30, had grown tired of dealing with the bureaucracy surrounding her father's death. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a68e5221d000026006acb9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The video is a sort of bookend to the one captured three years earlier, showing officer Daniel Pantaleo killing Eric Garner using an illegal chokehold.If the 2014 footage of Garner’s death shows a shocking episode of police aggression, this video shows the bureaucratic end of state violence ― with officials in suits giving earnest assurances to family members that an investigation is proceeding “expeditiously” and that they will soon reach a “decisional point.”The footage, shot in secret by Garner’s daughter, Erica, shows a June 21, 2017, meeting of DOJ representatives talking with Erica Garner, along with her mother Esaw Snipes, grandmother Gwen Carr and the Rev. Al Sharpton.It emerged Tuesday on her Twitter feed, which is run by her close friend, nearly a month after the 27-year-old’s untimely death due to heart failure.The video begins with unidentified officials giving the family only vague responses to pointed questions about exactly when federal investigators would release information, reiterating that they’ll know something soon.“I think that we’ll be at a decisional point within the next several months,” an official tells the family, adding: “We’re not talking about no decisions being made on this case in 2018. That is not where we’re at.”Sharpton apparently mentioned the case against North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed Walter Scott in 2015, most likely commenting on the Slager’s indictment and subsequent guilty plea to a federal civil rights offense. DOJ officials are heard responding to this case in the recording.“You reference Slager’s case and why did that one move faster than this particular case,” one unidentified man says, addressing Sharpton. “Each case is dealt with on its own individual merits.” He goes on to say that the “most important thing” is that investigation is even active.The Justice Department declined to comment to HuffPost on the video.Erica Garner, according to Rolling Stone, was planning to release the video. She died Dec. 30. In one of the last essays she wrote before her passing, Erica Garner expressed her frustration with the meeting and the pace of the investigation. She described her family’s desire for answers and how the officials involved were willing to use her father’s life for political gain while leaving justice out to dry. “Many elected officials have said my dad’s name but aren’t fighting tooth and nail as I’ve done in the last three years for justice,” wrote Erica Garner. “Our city’s mayor initially blocked the Right To Know Act, the release of Daniel Panteleo’s complaint records and refused to stand with the family during this year’s anniversary commemoration of my father’s death. In previous years, he stood in a black church in Staten Island and said my father’s life mattered and that a full investigation into his death will be done.”“Not only did he not stand with my family this year on the day of my dad’s death, but, to add insult to injury, he helped open a new police precinct on Staten Island,” she added.Erica Garner recalled a small glimmer of hope, back in 2015, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that a special prosecutor would be assigned to Eric Garner’s case. But to her dismay, the special prosecutor was temporary, and Erica Garner, tired of broken promises, couldn’t muster much hope when new federal investigators were called in.“I, personally, thought it would be a waste of time,” she wrote of the meeting captured on video. “And surely it was a waste. During the hour long meeting, answers to our questions were avoided or simply told they weren’t at liberty to discuss the case with us. I wasn’t enthused at all. They kept talking in circles, and not answering questions, until my son, who I was carrying in my arms at the time, told me that he would rather eat lunch than waste any more time watching our conversation go nowhere.” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6621d12100003c007c75ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor who treated some of America’s best athletes, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison Wednesday for sex crimes that have shaken the sport’s governing body.Nassar, 54, will spend the rest of his life behind bars as a result of Michigan Circuit Judge Rosemarie Aquilina’s sentence on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. “I’ve just signed your death warrant,” Aquilina said after handing down the sentence. The judge gave a lengthy and powerful explanation of how she viewed Nassar’s apology and calculated his sentence. “It was not treatment what you did. It was not medical,” she told Nassar. “You do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again.” She also called on federal authorities to investigate how Nassar’s abuse was allowed to go on for so long. “Justice requires more than what I can do on this bench,” Aquilina said. Michigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis called Nassar a “master manipulator” in her closing argument. “The breadth and ripple of this defendant’s abuse and destruction is nearly infinite,” Povilaitis told the court. “The defendant is a twisted, beloved, renowned doctor who used his prestige to gain trust of these girls and exploit them.”Nassar, in his statement to the court, said he will carry his victims’ words “for the rest of my days.” “Your words these past several days have had a significant emotional effect on myself and has shaken me to my core,” Nassar said, turning to face survivors in the courtroom. “I also recognize what I’m feeling pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotional destruction you are all feeling.”Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to the crimes on Nov. 22, and admitted that he sexually assaulted young girls under the guise of medical treatment. He’s already serving a 60-year sentence on federal child pornography charges, and still faces sentencing for three additional criminal sexual conduct crimes in Michigan. Prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Nassar to 40 to 125 years.The judge allowed Nassar’s victims to deliver or read impact statements in her Lansing, Michigan, courtroom. For seven days, Nassar was forced to listen as 169 survivors and family members read statements that were emotional, cathartic and powerful.“Little girls don’t stay little forever. They turn into strong women that return to destroy your world,” Nassar family friend Kyle Stephens said in her impact statement last week. Stephens, who said Nassar began molesting her when she was 6, was the first woman to read her statement in court. Over 140 women have accused the now-disgraced doctor of sexual abuse, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. According to court documents, Nassar gained the trust of girls and their families, which then gave him cover for exams that allowed him to fondle and digitally penetrate the girls as team doctor for USA Gymnastics and various Michigan State University sports teams. “Larry, you do realize now that we ― this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time ― are now a force and you are nothing,” Raisman said in her victim impact statement. “The tables have turned, Larry. We are here and we are not going anywhere.”Raisman revealed in November that Nassar sexually abused her during her time on the USA Gymnastics Olympic team. The first public allegation against Nassar came in September 2016, a year before the #MeToo movement took off. He was let go by USA Gymnastics in 2015, and was subsequently fired from his faculty position at MSU. He was arrested for possessing at least 37,000 images of child pornography in December 2016, and in July pleaded guilty to three federal counts relating to child pornography. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December.Many of Nassar’s victims said they told coaches, parents and trainers about the abuse, but it continued. The Detroit News reported that at least 14 Michigan State University staffers and representatives were warned about Nassar’s abuse over the course of two decades, and failed to stop it. Dozens of victims called out the university and USA Gymnastics.“A simple fact is this: If Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee had paid attention to any of the red flags in Larry Nassar’s behavior, I never would have met him, I never would have been ‘treated’ by him, I never would have been abused by him,” Maroney said in her impact statement. MSU doctor Brooke Lemmen and MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages have both resigned in the face of mounting accusations. The dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, William D. Strampel, took a medical leave from his position in December.The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March. Three of the organization’s directors resigned this week, and John Geddert, who coached the American 2012 Olympic team and reportedly was close with Nassar, was suspended.“I knew that he abused me. I reported it,” Nassar victim Amanda Thomashow said in her impact statement. “Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure.”Emma Ann Miller, 15, in an emotional impact statement this week, said that after Nassar’s case, she and other survivors will be coming for the school. “The best part of my story, titled Miller vs. MSU, is I know I’m not alone,” Miller told the judge. “You see, Your Honor, we are just getting started.”CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this story said Kyle Stephens was a gymnast. In fact, she was a Nassar family friend."

Cory Booker (D-N.J.).“Do you think implicit racial bias exists in our criminal justice system?” asked Booker, one of three black members to ever serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee.“I would indicate only that I would do my very best as a judge to ensure that no biases came in,” said Brennan, who was a trial judge on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court for nine years.“You’re aware that African-Americans are stopped more than whites for drug searches in this country?” Booker continued. “That there’s no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or dealing drugs, but [blacks] are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for it? You’re aware of the data, I imagine, that says African-Americans are more likely to get mandatory minimum sentences for the same crime. You’re probably aware of the data that African-Americans are more likely to serve more time for similar crimes.”The senator asked again, “Do you think implicit racial bias exists in the criminal justice system as you know it?”“One of the things I can say, senator, is that I want to put my pro bono efforts into …,” Brennan began.“I’m not asking about you specifically, sir,” Booker interrupted. “I’m asking do you think racial bias exists in the criminal justice system.”Federally collected data is clear on the racial divide in the justice system. Black drivers, for example, are more likely to be pulled over than white drivers. White drivers involved in traffic stops are searched at lower rates than black drivers. Black people spend more time behind bars than white people for the same crimes, and black people are three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people ― even though the two groups use cannabis at roughly the same rates.Booker kept asking the question of Brennan, who then said he couldn’t take a position because of the “canons of ethics” for judges and tried to pivot to talking about his volunteer work. He suggested he might give an opinion if he could have a look at the data that Booker was referencing. The senator was incredulous.“You haven’t? You’re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal justice system?” Booker asked. “I find this astonishing.”Watch their exchange above."

She wasn’t a casualty of Mother Nature. She was, according to police, a victim of a cold and calculating individual who took advantage of the chaos caused by the storm.The hurricane, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached Tupelo, left no permanent mark on the city, which is best known as the birthplace of Elvis Presley. However, the disappearance of 13-year-old Leigh Marine Occhi did, and it still hangs like a thick cloud over the city.For more than two decades, authorities have dissected and combed through the evidence. Theories and suspicions abound, but the teenager has yet to be found.Still, there is hope for resolution. The case is now being analyzed in a new podcast, titled “13: The Search for Leigh Occhi,” which is being released episodically by local NBC affiliate WTVA News. “There’s a lot of apparent coincidence in this tale,” WTVA’s Jason Lee Usry says in the preview episode of the podcast, which can be found on iTunes or SoundCloud. “A lot of coincidence, a great deal of mysterious behavior, and somewhere within one of the players in this story, a terrifying level of cruelty.”The case, which this author first covered on the Criminal Report Daily blog nine years ago, began on Aug. 27, 1992. As torrential rains and gusting winds began to hit Tupelo, the alarm clock at the Yarbrough home went off at about 6:45 a.m.According to Vickie Yarborough, she and her daughter, Leigh Occhi, had slept in the same bed the previous night because the girl was afraid of storms. The blond-haired, bright-eyed Leigh had recently celebrated her thirteenth birthday and was supposed to go to an open house at Tupelo Middle School with her grandmother that afternoon.Yarborough had recently separated from Leigh’s stepfather, Barney, and she told detectives it was just her and her daughter on that rainy Thursday morning. According to the police report, Yarborough said her daughter had been alive and well when she left for work at about 7:40 a.m. that morning.Yarborough later said she’d heard there were tornado watches in the area and decided to call from work and check on Leigh at about 8:30 a.m. Nobody answered. Concern turned to worry, prompting Yarborough to drive home, according to the report.“The door was unlocked, and I opened the house and it was all dark, so I didn’t see Leigh anywhere,” Yarborough told detectives. “I said, ‘Leigh,’ like that, and nobody answered me, and then I went in.”She added, “I saw blood right there splattered on the walls and then I screamed ... and dialed 911.”At about 9:00 a.m., Yarborough made a frantic 911 call to the Tupelo Police Department. She requested immediate assistance at her home on a cul-de-sac on the city’s west side, telling the dispatcher that her daughter was missing and that she’d found traces of blood inside the house. When police arrived on the scene, they observed blood stains in the hallway and bathroom, and a bloody stain containing strands of hair on a door frame facing the kitchen area. Authorities said there were indications that someone had attempted to clean up the blood in the bathroom. In Leigh’s room, a bloody blue nightgown and bra were discovered. The only items missing were the teen’s shoes, reading glasses and underclothes.There was no sign of forced entry into the house, police said. Based on the evidence, authorities surmised Leigh had been killed inside.The next day, the leading headline in The Daily Journal read, “Federal Troops Ordered to Fla.” A much smaller headline, within a subsection of the paper, read, “13-year-old Tupelo Girl Reported Missing.”Police conducted multiple ground and aerial searches, but found no sign of Leigh. The case was coming to an abrupt standstill when, on Sept. 9, 1992, Yarborough contacted police and told them she’d received a package in the mail containing Leigh’s missing eyeglasses. They’d been delivered in an 8-inch envelope, addressed in block letters to “B Yarborough.” The return address was the same as the mailing address.Authorities determined the package had been mailed from Booneville, a small city located roughly 30 miles north of Tupelo. The envelope was sent to the state crime lab in Jackson for handwriting analysis and DNA testing, but nothing of evidentiary value was found.According to Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre, investigators became suspicious and asked Yarborough to take a lie detector test. She was polygraphed three different times ― once by a local polygraph examiner and twice by the FBI – and “failed it three times,” the chief said in a 2009 interview with this author.Yarborough was named a person of interest at the time, but no charges were ever filed against her.In 2009, the same year the police chief revealed the alleged results of the lie detector tests to this author, Yarborough said she was well aware they’d considered her a person of interest.“That has never been a bother to me,” she told this author.“It’s never been about me. It’s about finding Leigh, and I didn’t care and I [still] don’t care what anyone says about any of it ... I have never not cooperated with anybody [and] I am not fazed by what they say.”Detectives investigated Leigh’s step-father, but ultimately cleared him, police said. Other suspicions ― directed at a man who was known to Leigh’s family and later incarcerated for similar crimes ― failed to pan out.Despite the police department’s belief that Leigh was murdered, her mother was unwilling, in 2009, to give up the hope that her daughter was still alive.“I am not going to accept anything for sure,” she said. “I am not going to do that ... I have to keep focused on factual things ... or I wouldn’t be able to cope very well.”It’s unclear if she still holds that belief. Attempts by HuffPost to reach her were unsuccessful.Leigh’s father, Donald Occhi, says he believes his daughter is dead. A master sergeant in the Army, he and Yarborough had met and married while serving together in the military. Leigh was their only child. When the marriage ended, Yarborough left the service and made her way to Mississippi, while Donald Occhi was transferred to another base.“I want to live to see her body located, so that I can see that she is properly buried,” he said. “Then I will smile when the son of a bitch who did this dies in the Mississippi state death chamber.”In the last two decades, there have been plenty of “maybes” and “what ifs,” but the complete portrait of the crime has remained blurred. Now, 25 years after the fact, WTVA News promises to “reveal new twists, turns and developments” in the long-dormant case, though it’s unclear whether there will be any answers.Anyone with information in the disappearance of Leigh Occhi is asked to contact the Tupelo Police Department at 662-841-6491.Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

The refugees were living at the Manus Island facilities, which house only men, and had been detained by Australia for several years after trying to reach the mainland by boat.The refugees will be flown to Manila in the Philippines before the group is set to be split in two, with some people reportedly flying to Los Angeles and others to New York. Ian Rintoul, of the Refugee Action Coalition, told HuffPost he believed the men ― among them Rohingyas, Afghans and Pakistanis ― would be settled in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and unspecified parts of North Carolina.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.This is the second contingent of refugees to be transferred to the U.S. under a resettlement agreement between the Obama administration and the Australian government in 2016. Last September, 50 people being held on Manus and Nauru islands were also moved.Australia’s hard-line immigration policies include sending people seeking asylum by boat to offshore detention camps for processing, with successive governments pledging that nobody arriving by boat can ever be resettled in Australia. Refugees are permitted to resettle in either Papua New Guinea or Nauru, but have no prospect of being admitted to Australia. The U.S. resettlement deal was seen as a way to get refugees off the poor and under-resourced Pacific islands without allowing them into Australia.“It was a bittersweet moment for the refugees who, on the one hand, are happy to be gaining the freedom that Australia denied them more than four years ago, but on the other, they remain extremely concerned for those that are being left behind,” Rintoul said.The Refugee Action Coalition shared a statement from one of the refugees, who said he was “very happy to be free of the hell that the Australian government made for us on Manus.”“But we are sad for those who are still waiting so long. We can’t stop thinking of everyone who are still on Manus. We all need freedom,” the unidentified man added.The resettlement arrangement was the subject of an early, infamous phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last January, where Trump called the arrangement under his predecessor “an embarrassment,” “rotten” and “stupid.” Referring to the refugees, Trump asked, “Are they going to become the Boston bomber in five years?” according to a transcript of the conversation published by The Washington Post. In the conversation and a later tweet, Trump appeared to be unaware of the scope of the deal, claiming he had “heard five thousand” people were to be involved. Turnbull stated that the deal was for up to 1,250 refugees.Refugees from Australia’s other offshore facility, on the Pacific island of Nauru, are also involved in the resettlement deal. On Monday, around 500 of them ― men, women and children who had not yet been allowed to leave ― signed a letter to the Australian government asking for more information on their status.Rintoul said U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials were currently on Nauru assessing claims, but were not providing any updates.“We have no answers about what will happen to our future. Our lives are in limbo,” the letter read.“We are getting more helpless and hopeless. More people are becoming mentally sick. More people are self-harming from despair ... we demand [the government] provides us with full information about the US deal and when the next group of people will go to the US.”Rintoul said he expected another group of people from Nauru, up to 130 refugees, to be transferred to the U.S. sometime next month, but said they had received no concrete information about their status. He also said the Trump administration’s controversial travel ban on people from largely Muslim-majority countries was affecting the deal. Many of the families on Nauru are from Iran or Somalia, two countries named in the travel ban, meaning they will almost certainly not be eligible for U.S. resettlement.“The consequence of the ban is that the vast majority of families will be left behind,” Rintoul said.“They’re not being told what’s going on. The Iranians and Somalis protested on Nauru yesterday in an effort to get information, but as of now, the request for more information has been stalled.”"

Two were critically injured and three seriously, national broadcaster NHK said.One person was trapped in the avalanche for some time before being dug out by rescuers, who included SDF members.Kusatsu-Shirane, a 2,160-meter (7,090 ft) volcano, erupted on Tuesday morning, the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. The agency warned that further eruptions could not be ruled out and that rocks could be thrown as far as 2 km (1 mile) from the peak.Video footage from the top of the resort’s gondola showed skiers gliding down the slopes as black rocks plummeted from the skies and snow billowed up as they struck the ground, sometimes just missing skiers. A cloud of black smoke later drifted in.“There was this huge boom, and a big plume of totally black smoke rose up,” one skier told NHK. “I had absolutely no idea what had happened.”A photograph taken at the site and shown on NHK depicted a gondola with a shattered window. At least several of the injuries were due to broken glass.“Other people appeared to be hurt by the stones, which appeared to be around 10 to 20 cm in size,” another skier told NHK.The resort temporarily lost power, leaving a number of skiers suspended in gondolas for around half an hour until they resumed moving. Around 80 skiers at a hut at the top of the mountain were awaiting rescue, which began by helicopter on Tuesday afternoon.It was unclear whether the avalanche was caused by the volcanic activity but they occurred nearly simultaneously.The warning level for the peak was raised to 3, meaning that people should not climb the mountain, the JMA said.Japan has 110 active volcanoes and monitors 47 of them around the clock. In September 2014, 63 people were killed on Mount Ontake, the worst volcanic disaster in Japan for nearly 90 years."

As part of a new series, mayors from some of the world’s major metropolises told HuffPost about the unique challenges of reducing smog, soot and other pollutants that threaten the safety of their cities, calling on everyone to do more to protect the air we breathe. Although the challenges are immense, the mayors argue that there’s no time to waste. As major cities have become frontline spaces in the fight against climate change and air pollution, mayors and city officials have become some of the most prominent advocates for environmental protections.“We know we have a lot more to do. It’s going to take a lot of resources. It’s going to take public education. It’s going to take community organizing. But this is the way of the future if we’re going to save our Earth,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.The growing research highlighting the deadly and debilitating risks of living with air pollution has spurred many city leaders around the world to launch initiatives and push for new laws to reduce dangerous emissions. Breathing in air pollutants can lead to heart disease, respiratory problems, stroke and a range of other fatal illnesses, as well as greatly reduce the quality of life for people living without clean air. Air pollution is linked to millions of premature deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization, including tens of thousands in the United States alone. “The battle against climate change is a challenge that concerns every one of us: It is a matter of public health and preservation of the planet,” said Manuela Carmena, the mayor of Madrid. It’s a problem that especially hurts the world’s most vulnerable groups, including children in developing countries like Bangladesh and Somalia, where air pollution is linked to over one in four deaths. But air pollution is also a universal issue that every country must address as an environmental and public health risk, and in recent years scenes like the Eiffel Tower being shrouded in smog have shown that no city is immune to its effects. “In London – one of the richest and most well-resourced cities on earth – it’s shameful this problem has been ignored for so long,” said London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan. “It is a scandal that air pollution claims the lives of thousands every year and that children have been allowed to grow up in our capital with stunted lungs, while no meaningful action has been taken to safeguard their health.”Together, the mayors featured in HuffPost’s series are calling for a wide range of measures to address the problem of air pollution, an issue which they argue can only be tackled through collective action.

Cape,2018-01-23,Cape Town is overlaying all the decisions it makes on a daily basis by taking the effects of climate change into consideration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a593f211e00003d00c97183.jpeg?cache=f3nwzQ92V6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The effects of climate change and specifically air pollution are very real and are being harshly felt across the world. Cape Town, South Africa, and many other leading cities around the world have risen to the task of tackling the problem head-on. A key action is our efforts to clamp down on air pollution.In Cape Town, we are experiencing what scientists call the worst drought in a hundred years due to the effects of climate change.For this reason, the city of Cape Town is overlaying all the decisions we make on a daily basis by taking the effects of climate change into consideration. It has the ability to compound existing challenges in urban environments.We cannot plan anything without factoring in climate change.This is also true in our efforts to ensure generations of Capetonians have access to clean air and other natural resources.Cities such as Cape Town cannot wait for national governments and large corporations to act. We are responsible for addressing urbanization and ensuring the well-being of our local economies and our residents.We therefore need to see the opportunities presented by climate change and in specific air pollution and factor it into all the work we do so we can build more resilient cities.Cape Town’s work to drive down air pollution in our city includes:Reducing the city’s reliance on coal as a source of energy and favoring renewable energy,Cape Town’s Climate Change Policy focuses on both climate change mitigation and adaptation and aims to address these both in an integrated and innovative way. Cape Town is a member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. As such, the city is committed to reporting its energy and climate data to the Carbon Disclosure Project annually. In 2016, Cape Town was named one of the top five reporting cities out of the 533 participating cities globally.Also that year, I was invited to become a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. Among other things, this initiative has a strong emphasis on encouraging compact, connected and coordinated development, which aligns well with the new strategic priority of the city of working to achieve dense and transit-oriented growth and development. A key part of our climate change action is our energy goals, which model a more resilient, resource-efficient and equitable future for Cape Town and commit the city to diversifying its energy supply and reducing carbon emissions. Central to this will be the ability to source 20 percent of Cape Town’s energy from renewable sources by 2020. This requires a significant shift in the city’s approach and control over energy supply sources.We will no longer merely just be distributors of electricity but we will also generate our own clean energy.We want Capetonians to have a greater choice over how they consume energy and the price they pay for it.We have taken South Africa’s national minister of energy to court to fight for our right to purchase renewable energy directly from independent power producers as we are currently not allowed to do this.We are promoting the responsible installation of grid-tied, small-scale, embedded generation, particularly in the form of rooftop photovoltaic panels. Cape Town has also made substantial gains in energy efficiency and now, relative to other South African cities, uses significantly less electricity per unit of production and per person.But it is not just about big plans, the city is taking the lead on the ground.We have retrofitted thousands of ceilings in poorer households with thermal insulation to improve the air quality and temperatures in these homes, which were built by national government without proper ceilings and insulation giving rise to damp conditions and poor air quality. Due to the city’s retrofitting project, these residents also spend significantly less on electricity to heat or cool their homes, which also assists in reducing emissions. Our education and awareness projects focus on our next generation of clean air warriors with young preschool and primary school students learning and advocating for clean air.All 1,500 traffic lights now have efficient LED bulbs and more than 25,000 streetlights have been retrofitted. Our Air Quality Management Unit is doing crucial work to ensure residents and visitors to Cape Town enjoy the right to clean air.In the past 12 months, the city tested nearly 8,000 diesel vehicles for dark smoke emissions, with only 68 failures.Our dedicated Air Quality Practitioners conduct regular inspections to assess and hold industries accountable for their atmospheric emissions.Cape Town also promotes a tall stack policy for industrial emission sources to reduce the ground level concentration of air pollutants.The city has a network of 13 ambient air quality monitoring stations to measure ambient air quality. We are building a new air quality monitoring laboratory for our scientific services.The city has introduced flexi-time and encourages all sectors to enable staff to work from home when possible, to start lift clubs or commute outside peak hours.Through this we are reducing congestion and the number of private cars on our roads and cutting down on air pollution.We are also investing in clean transport with the procurement of our first fleet of electric buses for our bus rapid transit system, making us the first city in Africa to use electric vehicles for our public transport system. Cape Town is drawing advice and best practices from like-minded cities and partners from around the world, Africa and locally to provide the best future for its residents.We also firmly support American cities for their action in effectively addressing climate change despite President Donald Trump’s stance on this global challenge. We remain resolute in our commitment to tackle climate change and take bold actions to protect our planet for future generations. "

Rome has some particular characteristics that need to be addressed specifically: It has one of the most extensive historical city centers in the world, arising from being an ancient city with a very large number of architectural and monumental assets. It has over 2,770 years of history that have changed and molded the city’s design, buildings, roads and infrastructure.It is a magnificent urban conglomerate that has barely been touched by the previous century’s great revolution of public transport. Some facts might help to appreciate how Rome stands out in this regard: It has one of the largest urban surface areas among Europe’s capitals, a minimal metro network, and one of the highest ratios of cars to inhabitants in the world.In fact, in Rome there are, on average, more than 70 cars per 100 inhabitants. This number does not tally with other large European cities: Paris has 46, Barcelona 41, London stands at 36, Berlin at 35, and Madrid at 32. Several systems have been tried out over the years, such as alternate-day driving restrictions based on license plate numbering (only odd or even numbers could circulate on restricted days) and complete restrictions based on vehicle type (the highest pollutants were banned). All these actions did not actually solve the problem; planning is required.However, there are some hopeful facts. This year’s data from monitoring units highlights that air pollution has loosened its stranglehold on the city. Good news for Roman lungs and most of all for our children, who are more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.Particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide continue to be the most hazardous and insidious air pollutants for the capital. In both cases, the number of occasions on which target limits have been exceeded have been under the number allowed by law. As of Dec. 14, levels in particulate matter had exceeded target limits on 21 of the 35 occasions allowed per year. Nitrogen dioxide measurements showed concentrations above target levels for 12 hours of the maximum 18 per year permitted by anti-pollution regulations. These are better figures compared to last year, and we want to continue improving them.The latest air quality report released by the European Environment Agency delivers an alarming fact: In Europe, nitrogen dioxide air pollution is responsible for 78,000 premature deaths every year. Italy holds first place in the tragic league of air pollution deaths, with over 17,000 per year. Air pollution is responsible for respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer.In Rome, there is a permanent driving ban on the oldest and highest-polluting vehicles within the so-called Anello Ferroviario (Railway Ring), a wide city area extending to the suburbs on the periphery of the city. During the year, there have been Sunday driving bans within the so-called Fascia Verde (Green Belt), an area of 154 square kilometers (about 95 square miles). Also, emergency driving restrictions on the highest-polluting vehicles have been put in place during peaks in pollution levels flagged by the city’s monitoring system.But we cannot settle for day-to-day management. We need a view for the city’s future. We need to plan it and implement it while we go on tackling actual day-to-day issues. The biggest particulate and nitrogen dioxide emitters are car traffic and heating systems. They are the sources of pollution that need to be countered immediately.On Sept. 18 we launched PUMS, Piano Urbano della Mobilità Sostenibile (Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility), to work on vehicular traffic. Providing for electric rail mobility, replacing high-polluting public transport, and developing bicycle lanes are some of the directions we will be moving in the following years to help Rome transition into a new sustainable mobility model.This vision is already leading to concrete decisions. Planning for the GRAB, Grande Raccordo Anulare delle Biciclette (Great Bicycle Link Ring), project is already underway: 44 kilometers (about 27 miles) of bicycle lanes throughout the city for cross-city travel, with tourism in mind as well, as the lanes are included in the most beautiful parts of Rome. A new plan has been put in place limiting tourist bus access to the historic city center, which will mean less bus transit and less traffic.We have approved a plan to install at least 700 electric car recharging stations throughout the city by 2021; we are working on projects for new bicycle paths and lanes and pinpointing pedestrian areas, even provisional ones.On Nov. 14, the Council Assembly approved Rome signing up to the Covenant of Mayors for renewable energy and climate. We have signed up for a major, ambitious commitment with the first citizens of Europe: a 40 percent reduction in emissions responsible for global warming and climate change by 2030.We are aiming for a reduction in fossil fuel burning, which releases both climate-damaging carbon dioxide as well as pollutants that are hazardous to people’s health. Increased building energy efficiency, beginning with public buildings, and more use of renewable energy, such as photo-voltaic, mean cleaner air to breathe.Finally, to help Rome breathe clean air, we have begun planting new trees, launching a participatory forest program that started on Nov. 19, National Tree Day. It has been scientifically proved that trees are able to capture polluting dust and other pollutants from the air, thus also contributing to atmospheric pollution mitigation.Some of our decisions are not and will not be popular ones, but I ask myself, how much is one more vote worth when compared to the health of a child?"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a60ea191e000028005adb90.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The fight against climate change is no longer a matter of grand strategies, a matter of the agendas of large and seemingly impersonal international agencies. The battle against climate change is a challenge that concerns every one of us: It is a matter of public health and preservation of the planet. For this reason (and here is where hope takes root), we have begun to see how the concept of sustainability has made its way onto the agendas of every administration, organization and social agency, and is also permeating the consciousness of citizens.Pollution and global warming are everyone’s problems, and their solutions have to come with everyone’s involvement. The role of supranational institutions and agencies will only be strengthened by national and local policies. These are within the geographical and managerial scope where municipal governments are of indisputable importance. Their actions have a more immediate impact in cities’ current situations and are determining factors in their future design. This is a task that Madrid shares with the world’s major cities through the C40 network and the Global Network of Cities that accepted the commitments adopted at the Climate Change Conference held in Paris in October 2015.Madrid’s City Council, which I preside over, has made sustainability the focus of its strategy. It isn’t by chance that we’ve linked environment and mobility together into a single area of focus. From the moment of its creation, work began on the development of a Plan A for Air Quality and Climate Change that, with a cross-sectional and integral view, frames every action that summarizes that bet for the future. It’s a Plan A because, as I have said many times, there is no good Plan B. As with every major challenge, courageous and determined actions that establish a before and an after will be needed. Resignation has no place in politics. It has been two years now since we adopted a new Protocol for Episodes of High Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Pollution. The traffic restrictions that this guideline involves have been applied eight times for varying lengths of time, the last of which happened this past December.I spoke of courage before. Now I add imagination, the search for new formulas, and a commitment to innovation. They are prerequisites to a much bigger challenge: changing the model of a city that in the last few decades has dedicated 70 percent of its public space to 30 percent of its citizens: those who use private vehicles. This proportion had to be reversed because it was unsustainable. We established a goal: to ensure that all EMT buses have low emissions by 2020. For the time being, 77 percent of them are already part of this green fleet. Soon we will see 18 electric minibuses and 15 electric buses in our streets, and we want to increase this number to almost a hundred by that 2020 horizon. Late last year, we introduced five of these electric buses, which shows our commitment to innovation. They are the only ones in Spain with an induction system that allows them to charge their batteries while they are waiting at the beginning of a line, via electromagnetic plates installed in the pavement.During the search for new alternatives, we have improved other forms of mobility. For example, Madrid now has an electric bicycle rental service (BiciMad), recently taken over by the Municipal Transport Company, which offers 2,500 vehicles at some 200 stations spread across the city. Our city also has electric cars for rent, with three companies operating more than 1,600 cars, which are used by about 357,000 people a year. This green fleet has recently added four electric motorbike rental companies, which offers another innovative way of getting around the city.The remodeling of Gran Via will also mark a before and after. This remodeling will reduce the number of lanes for vehicles and prevent some of them from going through this artery in the heart of the city, which translates to giving more space and more importance to the citizen. Madrid is perfect for walking, appreciating the beauty of its streets and monuments, shopping, or going to the movies. And walking, in addition to its personal health benefits, facilitates friendships and meeting neighbors. We want to give citizens their deserved and necessary importance. Deserved, because they are the ultimate recipients of any political decision. Necessary, because the fight against climate change will never succeed if we do not have an aware and involved citizenry to provide the small, daily gestures that make up great actions.Madrid’s sky must get its bright blue color back.

This results in the mushrooming of dense, low-income, informal settlements –– which are mostly under-resourced and do not have access to basic amenities, including electricity supply.The city completed a baseline assessment of its air quality, which identified that the city’s air pollution emanates from domestic fuel burning, vehicle emissions, industries, biomass burning and mine storage facilities.The city has a network of nine ambient air-quality monitoring stations that include stations in Alexandra, Ivory Park, Diepsloot, Jabavu, Orange Farm, Buccleuch, Davidsonville, Delta Park and Newtown. Seven of the stations are in residential areas, and two are traffic-emission stations. The data from these monitoring stations is compared to the national applicable standards, which are set to protect the public’s health and well-being.Unfortunately, the city’s poorest communities often bear the brunt of higher levels of poor air quality. Over time, the monitoring stations located in the city’s residential areas have observed record pollution levels higher than the national standard, especially during the cold winter months, when most people still use fossil fuel for heating.It is the city of Johannesburg’s priority to improve the city’s air quality –– to ensure pro-poor development that addresses inequality and poverty, and provides meaningful redress. Unfortunately, air pollution affects more of our poor communities in the city because of inequality and years of poor infrastructure planning.To improve the city’s air quality, we have completed a review of our air quality management plan and our air pollution control bylaws. The plan provides the city’s vision and goals for the next five years. A regulatory framework has been developed to manage other sources of air pollution in the city. The two documents are in the final stage of completion, and public consultations will take place prior to their finalization. In terms of the national Air Quality Act 39 of 2004, the city is responsible for air quality management ― both in terms of regulations and compliance enforcement. In terms of the city’s regulatory function, all the industrial activities that are identified in the act as significant emitters that contribute to poor air quality are licensed, and a total of 37 such facilities exist in the city. These facilities are issued with atmospheric emission licenses, which set out emission limits that are regularly monitored for compliance. Those that are found to be noncompliant are subject to enforcement actions.The interventions that deal with emissions from domestic fuel burning are complex and require a multifaceted approach. Materials used for domestic fuel are often not by choice, since in many cases people don’t have access to electricity –– and even when it is available, they can’t afford it. To mitigate against this, the city has prioritized the upgrade of informal settlements, which includes the provision of electricity and other amenities for those registered on the city’s indigent register. The interventions are aimed at improving our communities, while simultaneously improving the quality of air. Additionally, the city has allocated budget for new housing units that are insulated and require less energy for interior heating, and are fitted with solar water heaters.The city’s approach to dealing with air pollution involves programs that respond to specific pollution sources. Small industries and vehicles are included in our draft bylaws to ensure control, and they set out appropriate operational conditions to ensure the reduction of emissions in these sectors over time. These measures include permits and the creation of smoke-free zones in an attempt to reduce the city’s air pollution. The city is also collaborating with other spheres of government to deal with issues such as dust from mine storage facilities.Domestic waste burning is a result of illegal waste dumping. Although the city has various programs and interventions to resolve illegal dumping, our most significant intervention is the city-wide A Re Sebetseng monthly cleanup campaign. This monthly campaign is a ward-based cleaning initiative on the last Saturday of every month that encourages residents and communities to reduce their communal carbon footprint.The project enhances the city’s investment of 50 million rand into Pikitup for a third cleaning shift within the city. This investment is expected to grow to 82 million rand in the medium term. A Re Sebetseng is modeled on the Rwanda Umuganda, which is also a monthly campaign where all residents come together to clean Kigali. Through this campaign, the city of Kigali is now known as the cleanest city in Africa.On Sept. 30, Johannesburg held its first city-wide cleanup campaign supported by councilors and ward committees and businesses. Plastic bags and gloves were distributed at walk-in centers, clinics, libraries and participating businesses.As part of the A Re Sebetseng campaign, Pikitup will also initiate a program of engaging with schools and private stakeholders to involve learners in preserving the environment for their future. We believe the reduction of illegal dumping contributes to a reduced level of waste burning, which will improve air quality.The A Re Sebetseng campaign is the city’s initiative to make residents more environmentally aware, and a conscientious intervention to create behavioral change and an environment in which people police their own interactions with their natural environment.Furthermore, the city is further prioritizing the monitoring air pollution by reviving the monitoring network, which involves financing both the procurement of new monitoring instruments and facilitating adequate maintenance, to ensure that the monitoring stations are in optimal operational condition. The monitoring stations’ data is used for planning and decision-making, and assists in identifying those areas that experience poor air quality and the related sources that contribute to the poor state of air.It is incumbent on the city of Johannesburg to be uncompromising on our air quality, since in addition to our political and social responsibility, we are compelled to ensure we take the guardianship of our planet seriously.

This statistic is devastating, but it should not deter us. In fact, it should motivate us all more than ever to take bold action to clean the air we breathe. The good news is that mayors of the world’s cities have the power to drastically reduce that number.By 2050, more than two-thirds of the world population will live in cities. As mayors, it is our responsibility to protect the health, safety and well-being of all our citizens ― with public health a top priority. As dangerous fossil fuel emissions from cars, trucks, trains and buses accelerate climate change and create a dire public health crisis, cities around the world are taking a stand to implement policies to create a greener and healthier future for all citizens.It is critical that leaders take initiative to face these complex issues with innovative policy solutions, especially as new research continues to show the measurable negative effects of air pollution and fossil fuel emissions on human health.That’s why we ― alongside mayors from 11 powerful and global cities around the world ― have come together to sign the C40 Green & Healthy Streets Declaration, a commitment to reduce the number of fossil fuel-powered vehicles on the streets, and most importantly, put people at the center of our city planning policies by making walking, biking and use of public transportation the most convenient and desirable option for all citizens.Twelve C40 cities have already risen to the challenge: London; Los Angeles; Mexico City; Milan; Paris; Seattle; Auckland, New Zealand; Barcelona, Spain; Cape Town, South Africa; Copenhagen, Denmark; Quito, Ecuador; and Vancouver, Canada. If all C40 cities were to meet the commitments outlined in the declaration, we could potentially prevent more than 45,000 premature deaths globally per year.In Paris alone, C40 research shows that our commitments to the Green & Healthy Streets Declaration will literally save lives. Taking the concrete and measurable actions outlined in the declaration ― including only procuring zero emissions buses starting in 2025 and ensuring that at least a major area of the city is zero emission by 2030 ― will avoid an estimated 400 premature deaths per year and add 21 days to the average life expectancy of every Parisian. And while reducing air pollution alone can have far-reaching effects on the health and well-being of city dwellers, we must also encourage and incentivize people to actively commute to work or school. By creating public spaces and streets that are friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists, city leaders will help improve health outcomes for their fellow citizens, reducing risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and various types of cancer by up to 23 percent.This is a new and groundbreaking vision for public health in the 21st century. Protecting public health means not only addressing the health of the individual citizen, but also addressing our collective health as a city ― including our environment.And cities are wholeheartedly seizing the opportunity to tackle climate change and public health hand in hand. Electric buses are becoming the norm rather than the exception, city planners are creating more green spaces and making the roads safer for cyclists, and entire sections of cities are being designated as off-limits to fossil fuel-burning vehicles, creating green, pedestrian-friendly islands of the natural world in the middle of our busy cities.Policies already implemented in C40 cities such as Seattle, London, Vancouver, Mexico City, Milan and the other signatories of the Green & Healthy Streets Declaration offer an important blueprint for the rest of the world to follow as we grapple with the challenges of global climate change, air pollution and the effect of fossil fuel emissions on public health. These cities have demonstrated the importance of thinking outside the box and refusing to accept the status quo. They’ve dared to imagine urban spaces without noisy traffic, congestion, smog and dirty air, devoting time, effort and resources to develop policies with the power to make their dreams into reality. I know that these unique, impactful solutions will make our cities better places to live, save many lives and provide a stable and comfortable environment in which people can live up to their greatest potential.Everyone deserves a clean, healthy environment, and it’s time to take concrete steps to foster urban communities that openly, emphatically and tangibly affirm healthy lifestyles. Cleaning the air we breathe in our streets is the first step."

The good news is that mayors of the world’s cities have the power to drastically reduce that number.By 2050, more than two-thirds of the world population will live in cities. As mayors, it is our responsibility to protect the health, safety and well-being of all our citizens ― with public health a top priority. As dangerous fossil fuel emissions from cars, trucks, trains and buses accelerate climate change and create a dire public health crisis, cities around the world are taking a stand to implement policies to create a greener and healthier future for all citizens.It is critical that leaders take initiative to face these complex issues with innovative policy solutions, especially as new research continues to show the measurable negative effects of air pollution and fossil fuel emissions on human health.That’s why we ― alongside mayors from 11 powerful and global cities around the world ― have come together to sign the C40 Green & Healthy Streets Declaration, a commitment to reduce the number of fossil fuel-powered vehicles on the streets, and most importantly, put people at the center of our city planning policies by making walking, biking and use of public transportation the most convenient and desirable option for all citizens.Twelve C40 cities have already risen to the challenge: London; Los Angeles; Mexico City; Milan; Paris; Seattle; Auckland, New Zealand; Barcelona, Spain; Cape Town, South Africa; Copenhagen, Denmark; Quito, Ecuador; and Vancouver, Canada. If all C40 cities were to meet the commitments outlined in the declaration, we could potentially prevent more than 45,000 premature deaths globally per year.In Paris alone, C40 research shows that our commitments to the Green & Healthy Streets Declaration will literally save lives. Taking the concrete and measurable actions outlined in the declaration ― including only procuring zero emissions buses starting in 2025 and ensuring that at least a major area of the city is zero emission by 2030 ― will avoid an estimated 400 premature deaths per year and add 21 days to the average life expectancy of every Parisian. And while reducing air pollution alone can have far-reaching effects on the health and well-being of city dwellers, we must also encourage and incentivize people to actively commute to work or school. By creating public spaces and streets that are friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists, city leaders will help improve health outcomes for their fellow citizens, reducing risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and various types of cancer by up to 23 percent.This is a new and groundbreaking vision for public health in the 21st century. Protecting public health means not only addressing the health of the individual citizen, but also addressing our collective health as a city ― including our environment.And cities are wholeheartedly seizing the opportunity to tackle climate change and public health hand in hand. Electric buses are becoming the norm rather than the exception, city planners are creating more green spaces and making the roads safer for cyclists, and entire sections of cities are being designated as off-limits to fossil fuel-burning vehicles, creating green, pedestrian-friendly islands of the natural world in the middle of our busy cities.Policies already implemented in C40 cities such as Seattle, London, Vancouver, Mexico City, Milan and the other signatories of the Green & Healthy Streets Declaration offer an important blueprint for the rest of the world to follow as we grapple with the challenges of global climate change, air pollution and the effect of fossil fuel emissions on public health. These cities have demonstrated the importance of thinking outside the box and refusing to accept the status quo. They’ve dared to imagine urban spaces without noisy traffic, congestion, smog and dirty air, devoting time, effort and resources to develop policies with the power to make their dreams into reality. I know that these unique, impactful solutions will make our cities better places to live, save many lives and provide a stable and comfortable environment in which people can live up to their greatest potential.Everyone deserves a clean, healthy environment, and it’s time to take concrete steps to foster urban communities that openly, emphatically and tangibly affirm healthy lifestyles. Cleaning the air we breathe in our streets is the first step."
83,WORLD NEWS,Suspect Arrested In Killing Of 7-Year-Old Zainab Ansari,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zainab-ansari-suspect-arrested_us_5a6789e0e4b0e5630074542d,The child's rape and murder sparked protests across Pakistan.,2018-01-23,"Pakistani activists hold signs demanding ""Justice for Zainab"" after the 7-year-old was raped and murdered in Kasur.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a678adf160000450013898e.jpeg?cache=u5Bt0jsaqb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Police in Lahore, Pakistan, have arrested a man for the rape and murder of 7-year-old Zainab Ansari, officials said on Tuesday. Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif identified the suspect as 24-year-old Mohammed Imran, who confessed to killing Ansari and at least seven other children, according to The Associated Press. Local news outlets reported the suspect was known to Ansari’s family.Sharif said at a news conference that a forensics lab had processed over 1,000 DNA samples linking Imran to a string of child slayings before making the arrest.“The beast has confessed to have committed the past such crimes,” the official told reporters. “His DNA was matched 100 percent with samples collected from crime scenes.”Ansari was reported missing in early January after leaving her aunt’s house to walk to a Quran class in Kasur, a city in the Pakistani province of Punjab on the border with India. Police recovered her body from a garbage dumpster several days later.The child’s murder sparked protests around Pakistan, forcing schools and stores in Kasur to close for several days as outraged residents took to the streets. Two people were killed in the fray when police fired at the crowd.Pictures of Ansari, smiling and dressed in a pink jacket, circulated in news reports and on social media, contrasting with the particularly gruesome details of her rape and death. The tragedy attracted international attention and incited calls for the government to take action.Her death also brought renewed attention to the abductions and rapes of seven other children in Kasur. Only one of the victims, a 6-year-old girl, was not killed, and all of them were found to have Imran’s DNA on them.But Ansari’s father, Mohammed Amin Ansari, suggested it’s not enough to point the finger at one serial predator, saying police should have done more to warn the public.“People don’t talk about sexual abuse,” he told the AP.There have been at least 20 cases of children abducted, raped and killed in the Kasur district in the last year, according to local lawyer and activist Waqas Abid. Pakistan’s Senate committee tasked with overseeing policing recently launched an inquiry into the sexual assaults in Kasur.But activists say a larger culture of shaming rape victims is partly to blame. In Pakistan, rape victims are sometimes punished for their own assaults and jailed for adultery. Tribal councils, a traditional justice system, have sentenced women and girls to be raped as punishment for crimes committed by their male relatives.Pakistani fashion designer Maheen Khan, who has spoken openly about her own sexual abuse as a child, said she hoped Ansari’s death would effect a change in culture.“What disturbs me the most is the silence when a little girl gets raped,” Khan told the AP. “It has to do with the honor of family. Parents tell their daughters: ‘Don’t talk about it. Don’t tell anyone.’ Our silence is saying it is all right to sexually molest a child.”But, she added: “We are now saying enough is enough. We should have woken up long ago.”"

Already by 1872, when coal combustion was at its peak and black smoke shrouded the city, Montréal had adopted a bylaw aiming to reduce air pollution, thus becoming the first Canadian city to regulate on the matter.Since then, the black smoke subsided, giving way to hydroelectricity, and air quality improved in our metropolis. However, we are far from having won the battle, and today’s issues are more complex than ever before. This is why my administration is firmly committed to fighting greenhouse gas emissions, a battle we will fight on every front.Mobility is not only at the heart of my preoccupations, but will also be at the very heart of our fight against air pollution. Transportation alone produces nearly 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Montréal. If we want to reach our 30 percent reduction objective by 2020, compared with the greenhouse gas emission levels in 1990, we must improve mobility in Montréal. Several options must be considered to fulfill our commitment. Thus, we must offer a more effective, more comfortable and quicker public transit system, to encourage Montrealers to use it. Active transportation will also have to be put forth, namely by offering safe biking and pedestrian infrastructures, thus converting more people to biking and walking. We will also have to make solo driving less attractive, namely by promoting carpooling, so as to reduce the number of vehicles on our city’s streets. Our program is an ambitious one, but we have the willpower to reach our goals. But that’s not all. To reduce the population’s needs in terms of mobility, we must take a look at urban planning on our territory. Urban sprawl has generated considerable transportation needs, too often met by solo driving. Over the course of the next few years, we will have to revise how we build our neighborhoods and our city, so as to densify our territory but also to offer all of our city’s households access to local services within their own neighborhoods, thus reducing the cost of their mobility needs.Greenhouse gas emissions produced by the vehicles on our streets will also have to be reduced. Renewable energy sources will have to be introduced, and the efficiency of freight transportation will have to be improved, so the air we breathe no longer bears the brunt of our transportation habits. These goals are not just wishful thinking on our part. Shortly after being sworn in, I, like so many other North American mayors, signed the Chicago Climate Charter. Under this agreement, all participating cities must offer safe and accessible active transportation and public transit to their citizens. Moreover, the charter requires that municipal administrations invest in their public transit networks and in their vehicle fleet, so as to reduce their carbon footprint. We are deeply committed to keeping our promises, to remaining proactive and to providing future generations with improved air quality.Our work is actually already in progress. For more than 50 years now, Montréal has been measuring air quality through 15 different monitoring stations strategically located on the island. This allowed us to record a steady improvement in air quality since the year 2000. Thus, the carbon monoxide present in the air was reduced by 53 percent, hydrogen sulfide was reduced by 75 percent, benzene levels went down 90 percent, nitrogen dioxide is 77 percent lower, and sulfur dioxide was reduced by 81 percent from 2000 to 2016. In addition, fine particle concentrations in the air were also 38 percent lower in 2016 than they were in 2009. Since 2014, the average yearly fine particle concentration is even lower than the norm suggested by the World Health Organization. However, we are still far from having won the battle. This is why the city has decided to adopt the bylaw concerning solid-fuel-burning devices and fireplaces. These devices are responsible for 39 percent of fine particle emissions, second only to transportation, responsible for 45 percent of those emissions. Our administration also wishes to invest in the greening of our city, by increasing the number of trees on its territory. This will not only improve air quality, but also fight against heat islands.A few days ago, we also launched a call for tenders that will allow the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) to purchase 300 new hybrid buses, whereby we will considerably increase the quality of the network’s services, all while reducing our carbon footprint. Furthermore, 40 electric buses will be added to the STM’s fleet over the next few years. Our objective is clear, and we will not lose sight of it. In the short term, Montréal has earmarked an additional contribution of about 28 million Canadian dollars ($22.5 million) for the STM in 2018. This amount will allow the STM to increase metro frequency outside of rush hour, and to add buses to less-serviced neighborhoods, such as Griffintown and Rivière-des-Prairies, for instance.Air quality is every Montrealer’s business. Although the situation is improving across the island, every neighborhood and every household still plays a role in reducing air pollution, if only by their chosen method of transportation or the greening of their streets. The past few years have allowed us to significantly improve air quality in Montréal, but we still have a long road ahead before we can say we’ve won the battle. I am convinced that, together, we will reach our goals."

An employee with the Department of Homeland Security, Phifer had second thoughts about her dream of pursuing a career in public service. She was in the process of buying her first house when the shutdown hit, and she didn’t know how long it would continue ― and when she would finally get paid again. She had to retract her mortgage application and lost the house that she really wanted. When HuffPost spoke to her at that time, she was frustrated and seriously thinking about changing her plans. “I have student loans to pay back. I want to buy a house. I want a life that doesn’t include biannual panic attacks over arbitrarily losing my job. So you asked if I’m considering leaving public service,” she said. “In this climate, I ask you: How could I consider staying?”Phifer did stick it out in government a few years, moving on to a job at the FBI. But in May, three days after President Donald Trump fired her boss, FBI Director James Comey, she quit. Now, Phifer is hoping to be part of the solution to the dysfunction. Phifer, 33, is running for Congress in Minnesota’s 8th District, challenging Rep. Rick Nolan (D) for their party’s nomination. On Monday, she said it was disappointing that so many federal workers were once again stuck in the middle of Congress’ problems. “It really takes a huge toll on our public servants and people’s willingness to go into public service when their livelihood is treated as expendable,” Phifer said.Part of the wave of Democratic women who rose up after Trump’s election to run for office, Phifer was recently featured on the cover of Time magazine with others in the movement.“Sometimes you feel alone in your district. You’re one of 435 races across the nation. It can sometimes feel like you’re going up against this machine,” Phifer told HuffPost. “But when you see yourself amongst a sea of other first-time female candidates, you don’t feel so alone. And you know that you’re in amazing company. So it was really, really inspiring.”“I firmly believe that I wouldn’t be running right now if it had gone a different way. If Hillary Clinton had been elected president, I would still be with the FBI,” she added. “But I feel so strongly that the policies that President Trump is pushing, like travel bans and border walls, are not what keeps us safe.”The most recent government shutdown lasted just three days, far shorter than the one Phifer went through in 2013. But the measure Congress approved provides funding only until Feb. 8, so there’s a chance the government could shut down again, especially if Democrats don’t believe that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has kept his end of the deal by holding a vote on an immigration bill to protect the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. For many federal workers, this ongoing uncertainty over whether the government may shut down is the new normal. While Trump and his administration are part of the problem, Phifer said they’re not completely to blame. “They’re just a symptom of the overall problem, which has been occurring for many years now,” she said. “And that is just general gridlock and dysfunction in Congress. I do believe that the next generation of leaders will be able to overcome that.” "
87,POLITICS,Florida Takes Big Step Toward Expanding Voting Rights To Over 1.5 Million People,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-felony-disenfranchisement_us_5a62060fe4b074ce7a07ab01,The state has some of the country's harshest laws disenfranchising felons. That could change in November.,2018-01-23,"Voting instructions in both English and Spanish are seen on a booth before voters arrived at a polling station in Christmas, Florida, on Nov. 8, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a620aef220000251ab4f2cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Floridians will get to decide in November whether they want to amend the state constitution to automatically restore voting rights to felons once they complete their sentences, a move that could significantly expand the franchise to over 1.5 million people.Florida election officials verified Tuesday that organizers had gathered enough petitions to put the referendum on the ballot this year. Just gathering those signatures was a herculean task for the grassroots effort ― Florida law required the organizers to gather 766,200 signatures, equal to 8 percent of the votes cast in the last presidential election. Within that amount, organizers also had to collect 8 percent of the presidential vote totals from 14 of the state’s 27 congressional districts.“Through the hard work of Florida voters and unwavering dedication of a truly grassroots movement, we have reached a historic milestone and have officially placed the Second Chances Voting Restoration Amendment on the ballot,” Desmond Meade, chair of Floridians for a Fair Democracy and spokesperson for Second Chances Florida Campaign, said in a statement. “Voters took matters in their own hands to ensure that their fellow Floridians, family members, and friends who’ve made past mistakes, served their time and paid their debts to society are given a second chance and the opportunity to earn back their ability to vote.”To pass in November, the referendum will need to get the support of 60 percent of voters.Florida has some of the most restrictive laws when it comes to restoring rights to felons. The state is one of four that permanently strips people with a felony conviction of the right to vote. Once they complete their sentences, felons can apply to have their rights restored. To do so, they have to appeal to the state’s executive clemency board, which consists of the governor, attorney general, chief financial officer and commissioner of agriculture. The board meets once every three months to hear fewer than 100 cases ― but there are tens of thousands of petitions, meaning it can take years for people to get a hearing. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) also implemented new rules in 2011 making it so that felons must wait at least five years after completing their parole and paying all fines and fees before they can apply to have their rights restored. If approved by Florida voters, the ballot initiative would eliminate that process by automatically restoring voting rights to people who complete all terms of their sentence. The amendment would not restore voting rights to people convicted of murder or sexual offenses.Kerri Wyland, a spokeswoman for Scott, said it was up to Floridians to decide whether to restore voting rights to former felons.“This is a decision for each voter to decide on,” she said in an email. “The Governor has been clear that the most important thing to him is that felons can show that they can lead a life free of crime and be accountable to their victims and our communities.”Nationally, about 6.1 million people are disenfranchised because of a felony conviction, according to the Sentencing Project, meaning the people disenfranchised in Florida make up about one-quarter of that population. The analysis found African-American voting-age adults are four times more likely than non-African-Americans to be disenfranchised; in Florida about 1 in every 5 eligible African-American voter is disenfranchised.Florida’s disenfranchisement policies have roots in the Jim Crow South. After the Civil War, Congress forced Florida and other southern states to ratify the 13th and 14th amendments and to write new state constitutions guaranteeing universal male suffrage. Florida lawmakers did so, but also created criminal codes targeting black voters and then stripped people convicted of certain crimes of their right to vote.

Wuco has a long history of making anti-Muslim remarks.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6774011600002000138946.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A White House senior adviser at the Department of Homeland Security once said that “true” Muslims can’t peacefully “coexist” or “mingle with other faiths,” it was revealed in a report this week.The strikingly Islamophobic remarks were made by Frank Wuco, a former radio host and veteran naval intelligence officer who frequently appeared as a pundit on far-right radio and TV shows before being appointed to the White House by President Donald Trump in 2017.During an August 2010 appearance on “The Willie Lawson Show” on Blog Talk Radio, Wuco presented himself as an expert on “true” Islam, according to audio unearthed Monday by the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America.“[There’s] a critical misunderstanding of the true nature of Islam, which was never intended to coexist, to complement, to mingle with other faiths,” Wuco said during that appearance. “It is clearly stated in the law, in the traditions, in the Quran, that Islam is here to abrogate all faiths that came before, was sent to abrogate and cleanse the corruption of the Jews and the Christians that are found in the previous scriptures.”During a July 2012 appearance on a radio program called “Erskine Overnight,” also unearthed this week by Media Matters, Wuco can be heard arguing that “so many have bought in hook, line, and sinker into the Muslim propaganda, particularly generated by the Muslim Brotherhood, that this is a — yeah, it’s a religion that seeks cohabitation and tolerance and peace with non-Muslim faith groups and nationalities and it just simply is not true.”“To say that Islam is willing to coexist peacefully with other religions and other sort of nationalities, if you can have such a thing in Islam, is really antithetical to what the Quran and what Sharia law teaches,” he added.As a senior White House adviser, Wuco has a role in developing national security policy, and has been charged with helping enforce Trump’s constitutionally dubious Muslim ban. Wuco, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on this story.In statements to HuffPost, Muslim scholars and civil rights groups roundly condemned Wuco’s remarks.“First of all, we would need ask him whether he still believes bigoted and Islamophobic things about Muslims and Islam,” said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “My assumption is that he still believes these things. Anyone who believes that an entire faith or religious minority in America is incompatible with our society should not be serving anywhere in our government or be advising our government.”John Esposito, a professor and founding director of Georgetown University’s Bridge Initiative, noted that Wuco’s remarks demonstrate “an ignorance of the faith and history.” A majority of Muslims, he said, according to “findings of major polls conducted by Gallup, PEW and other polling organizations in Muslim-majority countries and in the US and Europe... reveal consistency in the values held by Muslims and mainstream followers of other religions.” Scott Simpson, public advocacy director for the civil rights group Muslim Advocates, said Wuco “is the kind of bigoted, hostile, conspiracy-theory pushing official who is simply incapable of governing our diverse nation.”“DHS is one of the key agencies implementing the Muslim ban and anyone who still doubts that anti-Muslim animus is a driving force behind the ban should take a look at Wuco’s record,” Simpson said.The Trump administration, which last week marked its first anniversary, has been flush with anti-Muslim bigots. Former chief strategist Steve Bannon, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, former national security adviser Sebastian Gorka, White House aide Katharine Gorka, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, White House counsel Kellyanne Conway and former national security adviser Michael Flynn all have close ties to anti-Muslim organizations listed as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center. These groups propagate debunked conspiracy theories about American Muslims plotting to take over the West and implement a distorted and brutal version of Sharia, or Islamic law. Last year, Media Matters released a report on Wuco’s history of parroting these theories. In 2010, writing on the website of “Need To Know” ― a radio show hosted by Wuco that is now off the air ― Wuco insisted that Muslims around the world are “perfectly happy to subjugate and humiliate non-Muslim members of their societies.”As recently as 2016, during an appearance on the radio show “The Dougherty Report,” Wuco falsely claimed that Sweden is being overrun with violent Muslims. “The assertiveness of Muslim communities in Western nations is becoming so pronounced... you don’t even need ISIS in Sweden,” he said.“You’ve got everyday run-of-the-mill Muslims in massive communities protesting and becoming violent with the Swedish government, saying that they’re going to take over the country,” he continued. “This isn’t even ISIS. These are just peace-loving Muslims who have been allowed to immigrate into these countries.”Wuco also worked as a “security consultant” prior to his time in the White House, delivering bizarre lectures to the American military. Wuco, who is from Florida, frequently affected an Arabic accent during these lectures, role-playing as a fictional character named Fuad Wasul ― a “committed jihadist” who’d supposedly escaped from an American prison.“If you think you’re winning this war, if you think that you’re defeating jihad, you’re wrong, dead wrong,” Wuco once told a group of civilian intelligence analysts at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida.At various points during his career as a pundit, Wuco called for a mosque surveillance program, described a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. as a “great idea,” and said he would have dropped nuclear bombs on Iraq and Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks.In July 2011, according to audio obtained by CNN’s KFile, Wuco ― like many other anti-Muslim bigots at the time ― speculated that a terror attack in Norway that had left 77 people dead was almost certainly the work of Muslims.A short time later, however, the murderer was revealed to be Anders Breivik, a white supremacist enamored with American anti-Muslim extremists like Robert Spencer, Frank Gaffney and Brigitte Gabriel — all of whom, incidentally, have appeared as guests on radio shows hosted by Wuco.In audio clips recently obtained by KFile, Wuco can be heard advancing other forms of bigotry: promoting the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born in another country, denouncing the supposed “Zimbabwe-ficiation” of America, and mocking the LGBTQ community.Wuco, according to another Media Matters report, once claimed that “societies and nations for millennia have suffered greatly” for accepting LGBTQ people.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6778151600004500138955.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Oscars may not be so white anymore, but they’re certainly not diverse. The film industry has been forced to re-evaluate itself since April Reign first tweeted out #OscarsSoWhite in 2015, and we’ve begun to see more black actors be recognized at major awards ceremonies. But the Oscars So White movement was never meant to be black and white. Latino actors have been historically overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences despite making up nearly 18 percent of the U.S. population. In 90 years of Oscars history, Latino actors and actresses have been nominated 16 times, and only six have won. It has been 17 years since a Latino actor or actress won an Oscar and six years since one was even nominated. Asian actors, LGBTQ actors, First Nation actors and actors with disabilities fare similarly or worse. Sadly, those figures all remained the same when the 2018 Oscar nominations were announced Tuesday. The Academy recognized Latino stories, but our actors remained forgotten.Pixar’s “Coco,” set in Mexico, received nods in the Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song categories; Guillermo del Toro was recognized for directing and writing the aquatic love story “The Shape of Water” (which overall earned an impressive 13 nominations); and Chile’s “A Fantastic Woman,” about a transgender woman dealing with discrimination after the death of her boyfriend, picked up a nod in the Best Foreign Language Film category. A nomination for Best Animated Feature also went to “Ferdinand,” a film that was set in Spain but had Brazilian director Carlos Saldanha at the helm and cast many Latinos in voice-acting roles.All four acting categories, however, failed to include Latinos ― even with the buzz around Salma Hayek’s nuanced role in “Beatriz at Dinner” and Daniela Vega’s lead role in “A Fantastic Woman.” Vega also could have been the first openly transgender performer recognized by the Academy. Sure, “Coco” has been repeatedly lauded for championing Latino representation with its authentic portrayal of the Day of the Dead holiday and its largely all-Latino voice cast. But true on-screen representation is not achieved if Latino recognition doesn’t go beyond animated characters. The Academy isn’t solely to blame. The issue is far more insidious within Hollywood, as studio executives and talent agency rosters remain largely white. After all, Latino talent can’t be recognized if Latinos aren’t being cast in lead roles or if real-life Latino characters continue to be whitewashed and not portrayed by people of color (we’re looking at you, Catherine Zeta-Jones).There’s a particular lack of Latino speaking roles. Only 3.1 percent of speaking characters were Latino in 2016′s top 100 films, according to a report by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Yet Latinos are the film industry’s most profitable demographic, buying 21 percent of movie tickets sold in 2016, according to the Motion Picture Association of America’s Theatrical Market Statistics.Actress Gina Rodriguez rightfully brought this up Sunday while on the red carpet for the SAG Awards.“I mean, we do make [up] 55 million plus in the country — no big deal — you should throw us in a movie or two, it would make sense,” Rodriguez said, looking straight into the camera. “We do buy 1 in every 4 tickets every single weekend and make sure that your movies do well. So it would do you a service. And not only service, it would be — I don’t know — integrity.” The “Jane the Virgin” star also tweeted on Tuesday about the importance of Latino actors being given on-screen opportunities. Latinos will proudly celebrate the strides in representation made by “Coco” when the 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony airs in March, even as our actors and actresses remain forgotten. And perhaps as the film’s song “Remember Me” is performed on the Oscars stage, the Academy will listen and not leave us to fade into oblivion. "
90,LATINO VOICES,Guillermo Del Toro Dedicates Oscar Nods To Young Latino Filmmakers,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/guillermo-del-toro-dedicates-oscar-nods-to-young-latino-filmmakers_us_5a679347e4b0e5630074664b,"The Mexican director's ""The Shape of Water"" earned 13 nominations on Tuesday.",2018-01-23,"The Mexican director's ""The Shape of Water"" earned 13 nominations on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a679f911d000026006ac9cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Guillermo del Toro is poised to sweep the 2018 Academy Awards with his fantasy thriller “The Shape of Water.” The Mexican director’s film led the list of Oscar nominees announced Tuesday morning, with an impressive 13 nods ― including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Del Toro reacted to the nominations in a press statement, dedicating the recognition to young Latino filmmakers. “It is a great honor and joy to be here today, with a picture that remains faithful to all my convictions and the images I have loved since infancy,” he said in the statement, which was sent to HuffPost. “I want to thank the Academy and my professional colleagues for their kind disposition towards ‘The Shape of Water.’ I share these nominations with all the young filmmakers in Mexico and Latin America who put their hopes in our craft and the intimate stories of their imagination.”Del Toro also spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the Oscar nominations. The director remarked on what a landmark moment it was see two fantastical, frightening films ― “The Shape of Water” and Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” ― be recognized by the Academy.“I say this because Jordan Peele and myself, through different alchemies, have taken the genre and each brought a very different, very personal take,” he said. “I have always been interested in the dark poetics of the genre. And Jordan has evidently been incredibly compelled to tell the story from a different point of view and has elevated it to a parable of social power that I think is unrivaled.”“This is the year in which the genre takes its place on the stage without being backed by a best-selling book or a literary classic,” he added. If del Toro takes home the Oscar for Best Director in March, he will be the third Mexican director to win the category in the last five years. Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro G. Iñárritu won the coveted prize in 2014, 2015 and 2016.Del Toro told the Los Angeles Times that Cuarón and Iñárritu gave him pointers about possibly being nominated over dinner on Monday night. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that if del Toro wins the Oscar for Best Director, he will be the fourth Mexican director in five years to do so. In fact, he would be the third."
