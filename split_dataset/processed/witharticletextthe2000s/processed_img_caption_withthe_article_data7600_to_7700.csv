0,RELIGION,Why Hillary Clinton Is The Faithful Choice,"Brandan Robertson, ContributorCultural Commentator, Activist, Pastor, and Author of ""Our Wit...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-hillary-clinton-is-the-faithful-choice_us_580e2af1e4b0b1bd89fdb5bc,It is vitally important that we think beyond the fear-mongering.,2016-10-24,"U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a Sunday service at Union Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina, U.S., October 23, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5810a13e1900002700c2f0c9.jpeg?cache=TvMZSjCyP8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As we near Election Day, the stakes of this election are becoming increasingly clear. For too long, many Americans have stood by the sidelines, watching and waiting, thinking that there was no possible way that a man with the views and policies of Donald Trump, views that many in his own party find deplorable, could stand this close to winning the office of the presidency. But what is more disturbing is how many people of faith who began this election initially opposed to Trump and the ways in which he opposed fundamental American and Christian values have now moved to a place of unwavering support for this candidate, drawn in by vain promises of repealing Roe v. Wade, overturning marriage equality, and appointing conservative justices to the Supreme Court.What is so stunning to me is that for far too long, people of faith have been convinced they should decide on which candidate they support based on one or two political positions that the candidate holds ― namely whether or not they oppose abortion and LGBT+ rights. This overly simplistic perspective on voting, which was dreamed up by conservative religious power brokers decades ago to gain access and influence in the White House, not only fails to understand the complexity of the issues which a president faces, but also naively perpetuates the us versus them mentality which tears our nation apart.Some conservative candidates play into this division, using fear tactics to mortify their bases and convince them that if they do not win the election, babies will be massacred and pastors will be thrown in jail for opposing gay marriage. Yet, we know both legally and from experience, nothing could be further from the truth.In the final presidential debate last week, Trump attempted to use these same tactics to lure conservative voters back into this one-issue voting mentality. Trump essentially said that if Hillary Clinton became president, we would be “ripping babies out of the womb,” a gruesome statement that in no way reflects Clinton’s perspective on abortion nor understands the current laws that our nation has in place which would prevent, except in unusually extreme circumstances, late-term abortions. Trump, more than any other candidate in recent history, has played to the fears of the one-issue, conservative evangelical voting base. He comes up with pithy catch phrases and exaggerated examples in order to stoke the fears of Christian voters and convince them that if he loses, the great tribulation would ensue.Nothing could be further from the truth. I happen to believe that people of faith across this nation are much more intelligent than what Donald Trump or conservative power brokers think. I believe they can make well-informed choices and critically examine the issues facing our nation and decide who they support based on clear, rational thinking. But I also believe that at this stage in the game, both sides of the ticket tend to get so dramatic, so worked up, triggering the collective amygdala of the nation, which literally prevent us from thinking clearly and drives us toward irrational and outrageous behaviors. We’ve seen this happen on small scales, like at some Trump rallies and among some Bernie supporters. But now, just weeks before the election, it is vitally important that we refuse to be manipulated and actually take a step back to think clearly, beyond the fear-mongering, about what lays before us in this election. And I strongly believe that when people of faith across this nation consider the objective truth of the candidates values and policies, there will be no question at all in who they will vote for.Hillary Clinton’s policies and perspectives represent those of the most realistic, generally centrist, and well-informed candidate ever to run for the Office of president in the history of our nation. Clinton is a woman who has a proven track record of working with both sides of the aisle to accomplish major tasks for the common good of our nation. She is a person of faith and yet also a candidate who will not (unconstitutionally) favor her religious tradition over all of the others when she is in office. She embodies a reasonable, sharp and intelligent politician, who is well equipped to guide our nation, not by some radical left-wing vision of utopia, but by the principles that our founding fathers outlined to guide the experiment of American democracy. She is the most educated, most prepared and most balanced candidate to run for the office of the president in modern history.And though it is true that Hillary Clinton will not be working to repeal Roe v. Wade or marriage equality, she will continue her work to reduce the number of abortions across our nation and defend the rights of communities of faith to practice their beliefs without fear of government intervention. And the truth is, if Donald Trump wins, he likely could not and would not ban abortions or retract marriage equality. These are campaign promises that are nearly impossible to accomplish and they should not be the deciding factors for how we cast our vote. As people of faith, we are called to a much higher standard. Our traditions call us to value life, yes, but also to value personal liberty and to respect and even bless those with whom we disagree the most. Our traditions call us to embody love and equality and in doing so, to preserve the sacred principles that both our faith and nation rests upon.And when we take time to objectively consider which candidate embodies these values ― both of our faith and our nations founding principles ― there is absolutely no question who we should vote for on November 8. Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who has demonstrated her ability to guide our nation towards those most fundamental principles that our faith calls us to embody and that our founding fathers set forth as the ideals which have made America the greatest nation on earth.The views expressed in this article are the authors alone, and do no represent the views of any of the organizations he is affiliated with.

Can either one of them bridge the divide?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e54851a0000bc275bb721.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump took the stage in Gettysburg on Saturday for what was billed by his campaign aides as his “closing argument” to the American people. The speech was to be his case for why America should go in a different direction and vote for the outsider businessman with a brash personality that has made him a magnet for scandal over the career politician who brings experience to the table but comes with a lot of baggage. With this speech, given at the site of the bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil in which there were over 50,000 casualties, Trump sought to connect the divisiveness under which Lincoln gave his address in 1863 to the divisiveness America is facing today.“President Lincoln served in a time of division like we’ve never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now,” Trump said. He made the case that it is now or never to change the way Washington works and to stick it to the establishment. “Our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime,” he said.The divisions in America today hearkens back to the divisions that existed during the Civil War. Civility is lost in in America, and people on both sides of the political spectrum find themselves in conflict with each other, mostly verbally, but sometimes physically, as political arguments turn into fist fights.Abraham Lincoln famously declared in an 1858 speech that “a house divided against itself cannot stand.” Lincoln saw deep divisions in the country and predicted that America would unify again – but it would not be easy. He saw only two ways out: either the entire country would abolish slavery, or the entire country would legalize it. Lincoln took America to war with itself to decide the question of slavery once and for all and to unify the country again.Lincoln was a strong leader who had deeply held convictions, and that was just what the country needed and turned to at the time. This was Donald Trump’s best chance of getting elected – to sell himself as a strong leader that can lead from a position of strength and stability. He has shown strength, but has fallen short on the stability metric, to say the least.Many people criticize Trump’s temperament, judgement, and discipline. He has shown a constant inability to stay on message even when it is most critical, choosing instead to allow himself to be distracted and baited by Alicia Machado and others who have spoken out against him – including members of his own party.Trump had a lot of things on his side. He had name recognition, a ton of free press, a message of change, and a lot of charisma. If Trump had focused on the issues and presented an air of strength and stability, a calming force in a very unstable world, then it is likely he would be handily defeating Hillary Clinton, a candidate mired in scandal, highly distrusted by the American people, and deeply entrenched in establishment politics.Trump thinks he is the candidate that can bring the country together, just as Lincoln did back during the Civil War, but that seems unlikely given the number of people that vehemently oppose him and his rhetoric, and the number of minority groups and women that he attacks on a daily basis.Hillary Clinton argues that she has what it takes to unify the country. She held a rally in Pittsburgh on Saturday afternoon where she had a message for her supporters to share with Trump supporters in Pennsylvania.“You probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump,” she said. “I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them…and I want to be their president, too.” Clinton may want to be their president, but whether she truly cares about them is quite another matter. Clinton has declared Republicans to be the enemy she is proudest of. Clinton has been caught on tape at a fundraiser placing half of Trump’s supporters into a “basket of deplorables” and labeling them as “irredeemable”. Bernie Sanders’ supporters were dismissed by Clinton as basement-dwellers that seek out a “political revolution.”A President Clinton that wants to be a unifying president who truly cares about all Americans needs to take the concerns of the populist movements of Trump and Sanders into account and not dismiss them out of hand. She would need to reach across the aisle and be willing to work with the Republicans who will likely still control at least one house of Congress.She has in fact adopted many of the most popular policy points of the Sanders campaign, and even shown a shift to a tougher stance on border security at the most recent debate in what appears to be an effort to appease millennials and so-called “Never Trump” Republicans who have been hesitant to support her in the past. It is still unclear whether either candidate will be able to unify the country post-election. Both candidates have massive unfavorable numbers and both candidates have extremely forceful detractors. Whoever wins in November, the immediate aftermath of the election will decide whether the country will come together or if it will remain divided. This election season has been one of the most divisive and contentious in the nation’s history. All Americans need to accept the results of the election – no matter who wins. Americans need to get past their differences and come together as a nation to ensure that, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.Follow Jamie on Twitter: www.twitter.com/welchjamesk"

4,THE WORLDPOST,Hillary Clinton's Khizr Khan Campaign Ad Finally Gives American Muslims the Humanity They Deserve,"Dean Obeidallah, ContributorPolitical comedian, SiriusXM radio show host and commentator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-khizr-khan-ad_us_580e5cbde4b0a03911ee26e1,"As an American Muslim, I shed tears while watching this video because for once my community isn’t being equated with terrorism.",2016-10-24,"Khizr Khan holds up a booklet of the U.S. Constitution and offers to lend his copy to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump at the Democratic National Convention on July 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e7faf1800002e00dc3e4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No campaign ad has ever made me cry before. That was until Friday when Hillary Clinton released a video featuring Khizr Khan discussing his late son, U.S. Capt. Humayun S.M. Khan. I challenge anyone to watch this and not get at least misty-eyed.As most recall, Mr. Khan, along with his wife Ghazala, made headlines for a speech in July at the U.S. Democratic National Convention. There Khan challenged Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric and posed this powerful question to the GOP presidential nominee: “Have you even read the United States Constitution?”Trump responded by mocking Mrs. Khan for being silent during the speech, suggesting that as a Muslim woman she was not permitted to speak. Trump then added gasoline to the media firestorm that ensued by equating his creating “thousands and thousands of jobs” as being on some level equivalent to the sacrifice of the Khan family.As of Monday evening, the Clinton commercial featuring the Khan family has already been viewed over 1 million times and is still trending on YouTube. The tears that rolled down my face watching it were triggered for a few reasons. The video opens with Khan looking at the U.S. Army uniform of his late son who was killed in Iraq in 2004 while protecting the men in his unit from a suicide bomber. On its own, a parent reflecting on the death of his or her child is both deeply heartbreaking and painfully unjust. But in this case it’s even more moving when this Gold Star father, while fighting back tears himself, holds a photo of his late son while commenting, “he was 27 years old and he was a Muslim American.” Khan then recounts his son’s heroism and concludes, as his voice breaks with emotion, “I want to ask Mr. Trump, ‘would my son have a place in your America?’”I was also rendered teary-eyed by the historic nature of this commercial. Here we are seeing for the first time ever an American Muslim family prominently featured in an ad for a major party’s presidential nominee just weeks before Election Day. To be blunt, there’s little upside for a national politician to take such a risk, and Clinton truly needs to be praised for her political courage in doing just that.Don’t get me wrong, Trump has also included images of “Muslims” in his campaign ads. But, of course, those were all terrorists, and most American Muslims ― myself included ― would not consider them part of our faith. In one of Trump’s campaign commercials, for example, the presidential nominee used the San Bernardino attack for political gain. This video opens with a narrator stating, “The politicians can pretend it’s something else, but Donald Trump calls it ‘radical Islamic terrorism.’” Images of the couple associated with the terror attack fill the screen, including an image of the wife wearing a hijab. Then the ad notes that Trump has called for, “a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States,” and as the word “Muslims” is heard, we see images of what appear to be terrorists brandishing their flag. The Trump ad ― in stark contrast to the Hillary Clinton Khan ad ― presents Muslims not just as scary, but as the enemy of America. This is a message that we American Muslims have sadly grown far too accustomed to seeing in the years since 9/11.And the emotional reaction to the ad was made more acute by the fact that this presidential election cycle has been marred by openly anti-Muslim rhetoric by several GOP presidential candidates. It’s truly been bone-chilling to see major politicians ginning up hate of a religious faith.There was former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson last September declaring his opposition to any American of Muslim faith serving as president of the United States. And worse, after making that comment, Carson was apparently rewarded with a fundraising bonanza by people who agreed with him. Then there was Ted Cruz, another candidate for the GOP presidential nomination and a U.S. senator, calling for American Muslims to be placed under surveillance simply because of our faith, meaning we would have less constitutional rights.But Trump truly has been the Muslim basher-in-chief this campaign. In March he stunningly declared that “Islam hates us.” He had earlier called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” as well as for surveillance of Muslims. (Yes, Trump has back peddled on his total Muslim ban but the damage has been done.) And even at the second presidential debate when Trump was asked about Islamophobia, he shockingly responded by drumming up more anti-Muslim hate by claiming that Muslims are in essence hiding terrorists in our midst, which is a bald-faced lie.Given this hate spewed by Trump towards Muslims, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride that perhaps a Muslim family could play a role in defeating the man.Adding to my sentiments was the realization that the Khan family was effectively making a powerful point that is often not seen by our fellow Americans ― namely that you can both be proudly American and proudly Muslim. That is the very same point U.S. President Barack Obama made in February during his first visit to a United States mosque while in office when he declared, “You’re not Muslim or American. You’re Muslim and American.” The Khan family is the living embodiment of those words for all Americans to see. Apart from the emotional impact of this video, it may have a political impact as well. While American Muslims overwhelmingly oppose Trump – a recent poll with data compiled by the Council on American Islamic Relations found only 4 percent of Muslims supporting Trump – only 72 percent support Clinton. This ad could change those numbers, increasing support for the Democratic nominee from Muslims living in key swing states like Florida and Ohio. At least I hope it does.Clinton has been criticized by some in the Muslim community for only speaking of us in the context of national security, as though we are on the front line of countering extremism. But this ad shows an American Muslim family in a light we rarely see in American media: as human beings. Indeed, the real message of the ad is our humanity ― and that is a concept often lost in discussions about Muslims in our current political climate. Just look at how Donald Trump Jr., the GOP nominee’s own son, recently described Syrian refugees seeking to flee the horrors of war ― not as regular people, but as poisonous Skittles. Hillary Clinton has called Captain Khan, “the best of America.” She is 100 percent correct. And while Election Day will come and go, the message sent by Khan’s sacrifice will endure long thereafter. On some level, the captain, through his family, is still fighting for the values that make America great. And thinking of that moves me to tears every time.The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. Take a stand against hate."

And he likened Trump’s entire candidacy to “a bet from a 1980s movie,” almost certainly referencing the Eddie Murphy comedy “Trading Places.”“It’s like the movie would start with two old billionaires going, ‘I bet I can choose the worst person and make him president within a year,’” Gervais said in the piece, published online Saturday. “And then someone goes, ‘You’re on!’ and that’s how the film starts.”Read Ricky Gervais’ full interview with Business Insider here.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Her team has been increasingly attentive to arguments that blockbuster mergers between mega-corporations hamper market competition, force consumers to pay higher prices for lousier service and enhance the political power of big firms. But it has largely been Washington gossip. In an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine gave a public airing of the Clinton campaign’s views.When asked about whether the administration would support telecom giant AT&T’s bid to acquire media conglomerate Time Warner, Kaine didn’t close the door on supporting the deal. But he did throw far more shade at the arrangement than political campaigns typically do.“Some Democrats, including Al Franken, are very skeptical of the merger, including Donald Trump as well,” NBC host Chuck Todd said. “But Al Franken said, ‘I’m skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices, and even worse service for consumers.’ Are you a skeptic of this merger as well?”“I share those concerns and questions,” Kaine replied. “We’ve got to get to the bottom of them. [We are] generally pro-competition. And less concentration I think is generally helpful, especially in the media. But this has just been announced, and I haven’t had a chance to dig into the details. But those are the kinds of questions that we need to be asking.”Addressing news of the merger Saturday, Trump said he would block it if he wins the White House in November.“It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said during a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The GOP presidential nominee, who has stepped up his attacks against the media in recent weeks, added that his administration would also look at breaking up the 2011 merger of Comcast and NBC Universal. For the past three decades, both political parties have been sympathetic to increasing concentrations of corporate power. That consensus now appears to be changing.

Warren wants to stop it.",2016-10-23,Elizabeth Warren shows company documents to Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf during his testimony before a Senate Banking Committee hearing. Warren argues corporations should pay their fair share of taxes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580bcf171a000074285bb306.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is gearing up for a major tax battle next year, warning Democrats not to cave to corporate pressure in a coming push for comprehensive tax reform. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who will become majority leader if Democrats take the upper chamber, have been in talks to reform the tax code in 2017.Multinational companies are under increasing pressure from tax authorities around the globe, with signs that the era of easy access to tax havens may be coming to an end. With few places left to turn, U.S. companies want to bring their cash home ― but they want to do it without paying the tax they avoided by stashing it offshore to begin with. The pro-corporate narrative in Washington warns that if taxes aren’t cut, companies will go elsewhere. Warren said it’s a bluff, and recent activity around the globe suggests she’s right. “Developed countries are cracking down on the tax dodgers. You saw what just happened with the European Commission ordering Ireland to collect $14 billion in back taxes from Apple,” she said. “Corporations are running out of places to hide, with the G20 and the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] working together to end international tax avoidance. So I just think that argument no longer holds much weight. Instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to repair our broken tax code.”Instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to repair our broken tax code.One way to bring pressure on Congress, she told The Huffington Post in an interview, is for state ballot measures to show politicians where the people stand on that issue. One in particular she’s watching is Oregon’s Measure 97, a provision that would raise $3 billion a year by taxing companies with revenue of $25 million or more. Vermont’s independent Sen. Bernie Sanders recently threw his weight behind it.“State ballot initiatives are sending a giant message to Congress that the American people want to see change,” she said. “I think this proposal is a good step to help make the system fairer.”She was skeptical of claims that the true cost would be passed down to consumers to the tune of $600 per year per Oregon household. “I want to dig a lot deeper into those data because I worry about numbers that always seem to align with the interests of the billion-dollar corporations that want to escape paying their taxes,” she said.For years, the bipartisan consensus around tax reform has agreed that any effort should be “revenue neutral,” meaning that the tax code would be rewritten, some companies would pay more, some would pay less, but the government would get the same revenue that it’s getting today.But from the perspective of the Warren wing of the party, corporations pay far too little as it is, so making any reform revenue-neutral is a loser. Before companies managed to start gaming the system, Warren noted, three of every 10 dollars of federal revenue came from corporate taxes. Today it’s only 1 in 10. “At a time when corporate profits are near record highs, corporate tax revenue is near a record low,” she said. And so Democrats need to fight to push it higher. “These giant companies haven’t just taken advantage of the tax breaks that have been offered to them, they haven’t just lobbied for better and better tax breaks, they’ve laid out the whole narrative about how America should think about corporate taxes,” she said. “The first priority to fix our broken tax code is to raise more revenue from big corporations.”"

The third victim was a 14 year-old school boy, NHK said. Witnesses told the broadcaster they heard a series of loud explosions.Suicide rates have declined in Japan in recent years, but remain among the highest in the world, with around 30,000 people a year taking their own lives. Experts have pointed to the financial stress of surviving on small pensions for pushing some retired people to end their lives.In 2015, a 71 year-old man set himself on fire on a bullet train in an incident that also claimed the life of a 52 year-old woman traveling in the same carriage.(Reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by Richard Pullin)If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

All depends on the contents. If it doesn’t change enough, we will maintain our opposition.”European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs the collective body of the EU’s leaders, will speak to Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel by late on Monday, EU sources said, before informing Trudeau’s government of the state of play.“If Michel says he is not in a position to confirm that Belgium will be able to sign on Thursday, then we won’t have the summit,” a source said.If postponed, no new summit date will be set, although the source said neither the EU nor Canada is willing to give up on a free trade pact that has been years in the making.Deadlock over what would be the EU’s first with a Group of Seven country, overshadows prospects of completing similar deals with the United States or Japan and undermines a bloc already battered by Britain’s vote to leave.German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel blamed the deadlock on a failure by the EU executive and Belgian federal government to allay the fears of some regions.“Canada, Germany, and France had sought more contact with the Walloon government than those supposedly responsible in Brussels,” he told Handelsblatt newspaper. “The reasons for the Walloon protest lie in Brussels and not in Berlin.”Supporters say CETA could boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada’s by C$12 billion ($9 billion)."

[ID:far-right lawmakerThe U.K. government has prioritized children and youths who can claim family ties in Britain and on Friday a French Interior Ministry official said they were still negotiating over hundreds more with no such connections.“All this should have been done a long time ago,” Francois Guennoc from the charity Auberge des Migrants told Reuters.Allaodil, a Sudanese boy who says he is 14, was wandering on Sunday through the Jungle’s garbage-strewn mud alleyways, shivering underneath a blanket.“My brother has been in the United Kingdom, in Glasgow, for three years and has a job there,” said Allaodil in faltering English, adding that he wanted to join his elder sibling.He said the British authorities were aware of his case but still did not know whether he would be granted asylum in Britain or forced to relocate in France.With its makeshift shacks and poor sanitation, the Jungle has become a symbol of Europe’s failure to solve the migration crisis and a sore point in relations between Britain and France.France’s Socialist government will begin demolishing the camp on Monday on humanitarian grounds, it says. Most migrants in the camp want to cross the narrow stretch of sea to Britain.The Jungle and immigration more broadly are a divisive theme in campaigning before France’s presidential election in April, with leading conservative candidates pledging to move the border with Britain from Calais to southern England.Some conservative politicians say Britain should take in all the Jungle’s 6,500 inhabitants.“This is an insult for those (French people) ... who live here below the poverty line,” said far-right lawmaker Marion Marechal-Le Pen, a niece of the National Front leader Marine Le Pen, speaking in a rural town in southeastern France.Aid workers say hundreds of migrants may refuse France’s plan to resettle them in reception centers across the country while their asylum requests are considered. France says those who refuse to move on from the Jungle face arrest.“I’ll stay here, whatever they say,” said 24-year old Ali Ahmed, from Sudan, refusing to give up on getting to Britain. “I have seen worse than this. And prison wouldn’t be so very different from the Jungle.”"

When the 16-year-old student, named Shakara, resisted the teacher and a school administrator’s instructions, the adults called on a school cop for assistance. What happened next became the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, two arrests and several cell phone videos that received millions of views online. The cop flipped Shakara and her desk to the ground, violently dragged her across the floor and put her in handcuffs.Unlike her classmates, Kenny was unwilling to stand idly by. She encouraged her peers to film the incident and yelled at the cop for using so much force on a child. When the dust settled, Kenny and Shakara were arrested under a vague South Carolina law that makes it illegal for students to “disturb” schools. A year later, the incident has become one of the highest-profile examples of the dangers of stationing cops in school. And Kenny, now a high school graduate living in Brooklyn, doesn’t want anyone to forget its lesson. Kenny is currently interning at the nonprofit African American Policy Forum, working alongside Kimberlé Crenshaw, the organization’s co-founder and a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles and Columbia. Together, they have been working to raise awareness about how the school-to-prison-pipeline impacts all students, but especially students like Kenny ― that is, black girls. The school-to-prison pipeline is the idea that harsh school discipline policies help push students out of school and into the criminal justice system. Activists say cops are part of this problem. In recent decades, the number of cops placed in schools has risen dramatically. With this increase, more teenage misbehavior is being met with arrest records and court dates as opposed to detention and trips to the principal’s office. Crenshaw believes that girls of color are overlooked in conversations about justice and discipline in schools. The focus tends to be on boys. But girls face the double bind of both racist and sexist stereotypes. Indeed, research from Crenshaw shows that black girls were suspended at six times the rate of white girls during the 2011-2012 school year. Black boys ― while still disproportionately disciplined ― were suspended at three times the rate of their white counterparts. “Niya’s case alone is simply a powerful example about how leadership skills and courage and the ability to reason right from wrong ... get turned into a justification for bringing them into the juvenile justice system,” said Crenshaw. “[Black] girls in particular tend to run into trouble because they’re seen as defiant, they’re seen as having an attitude or being in need of discipline rather than being rewarded and recognized for exercising leadership.”Kenny is proud of her role in trying to stop police abuse at Spring Valley High School that day. She wasn’t always so sure, though. After getting arrested, she was led out to a paddy wagon in front of her classmates. She spent hours in jail. “That day everything was going down, I felt like I did the wrong thing. I kept telling myself, ‘You should have just sat down and just been quiet,’” said Kenny, whose charges were later dropped. “But speaking up and being arrested and everything, it just brought so much awareness to the school-to prison-pipeline. Honestly, if I could go back, I wouldn’t change anything. It was like the universe brought me there that day.”After the incident, Kenny decided to leave Spring Valley High School. She spent time in a local charter school before withdrawing and opting to get her GED, said her mother, Doris Ballard. Kenny is now thinking about applying to college.“The incident, it was very embarrassing. She was arrested, she was handcuffed in front of her peers. She was walked out of school in handcuffs like a criminal,” said Ballard. “The only thing she did was speak up for another student who she didn’t feel was treated right.”Ballard and Kenny hope the suffering has not been in vain. In August, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Kenny’s behalf challenging the South Carolina law that allows the state to prosecute students for disrupting school. The cop involved in the incident was ultimately fired from his job, although he did not face criminal charges. Although Kenny faced a traumatizing scenario, she has poured her trauma into activism. Similarly, Ballard has gotten involved with Every Black Girl, a campaign inspired by the Spring Valley incident that aims to empower young girls. “It just opened up a whole new world for us. It introduced us to a lot more things going on in the community and heightened our awareness. We were living an ordinary life before this happened. Day to day, going to work, going to school, life. But now that this happened it just made us aware of all the issues dealing with the school-to-prison-pipeline,” said Ballard. Kenny never expected to become part of a larger movement. She just wanted to stand up when she saw a classmate in harm’s way. But in the year since, she has become a powerful voice in making sure girls of color are treated equitably in schools. “I feel like people are more aware of the issues that young black females face now, because its actually caught on camera this time. It wasn’t just a he-said, she-said, situation,” said Kenny. “Before I was involved in that situation I had never heard of the school-to-prison pipeline. That’s actually come to the light now. It’s not a conversation that’s overlooked.”This story was also published as part of an investigation of police in schools.______Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

David Mueller initially filed a lawsuit against Swift, claiming he lost his job after being accused of inappropriately touching the singer during a meet-and-greet session at Denver’s Pepsi Center in 2013. Swift countersued, alleging Mueller “intentionally reached under her skirt, and groped with his hand an intimate part of her body in an inappropriate manner, against her will, and without her permission.”In the transcript from her July 26 deposition, Swift described the incident in detail.“Right as the moment came for us to pose for the photo, he took his hand and put it up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek, and no matter how much I scooted over it was still there,” she said. “It was not an accident, it was completely intentional, and I have never been so sure of anything in my life.”The “Blank Space” singer recalled feeling “violated in a way I had never experienced before.”“I remember saying how a meet-and-greet is supposed to be a situation where you’re thanking people for coming, you’re supposed to be welcoming people into your home, which is the arena for that day, and for someone to violate that hospitality in that way, I was completely stunned,” she said.The singer gained a small victory in the case last Friday when a judge decided to seal a photo of her and Mueller from the meet-and-greet that allegedly supports her claims.The photo will remain unavailable to the public until the case goes to trial.According to court documents, the judge ruled, “The widespread dissemination of this image might significantly complicate jury selection.”The judge denied Swift’s request to withhold other pieces of evidence in the case, calling them “entirely ordinary and mundane.” Swift stated in her countersuit that any winnings she received in the case would be donated to charities “dedicated to protecting women from similar acts of sexual assault and personal disregard,” according to NME. The Huffington Post has reached out to a representative for Swift for comment and will update this post accordingly. Need help?

The website states that both Kardashian and Odom have signed the papers, which they filed on Friday, and are now just waiting for a judge’s signature to make the whole thing final. The two also reportedly reached a property settlement. Kardashian first filed for divorce in December 2013 after four years of marriage. In October 2015, after Odom was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel and left in a coma, Kardashian called off the divorce and withdrew the legal papers. At the time, since she was still legally married to the basketball player, Kardashian was left to make medical decisions for Odom. The reality TV star and denim designer refiled for divorce in May of this year, but according to California law has to wait six months from the filing date to get a judge’s signature, TMZ notes. That means, if all goes as planned, the two should be legally single by December. The Huffington Post has reached out to reps for Kardashian and Odom for comment and will update this post accordingly. "

I had to shield myself with my jacket to even attempt to grab her,” he said. Once he pulled away the cats and placed them in a cardboard box, he brought them to Fargo’s Cat’s Cradle Shelter. Both kittens arrived “in shock,” according to the shelter.“All four of her paws are burned and blistered and her fur and whiskers are singed,” the shelter wrote of one of the cats in an Oct. 15 Facebook post. “Her brother has no outward signs of injury, however he is in worse shape due to smoke inhalation.”“We thought we were going to lose him,” the shelter’s executive director, Gail Adams-Ventzle, told The Huffington Post Sunday, speaking of the little boy kitten since named Manni.Though Manni suffered the least visible injuries, he had extreme smoke inhalation. Later tests also revealed that he had a heart murmur, Adams-Ventzle said. “We don’t know if it had anything to do with the fire or not.”As for the little female, since named Pyro, Adams-Ventzle said she suffered what appeared to be third-degree burns to her feet.Fortunately, the two cats have begun to heal nicely.“They are doing GREAT!!!” the rescue group wrote on Facebook Thursday with photos showing Pyro’s little paws wrapped up in bandages.Once the kittens are fully healed they’ll be up for adoption, though it likely won’t take long for them to find a forever home. Adams-Ventzle said that Pacheco told the shelter he may once again offer the kittens his protection and care ― this time permanently.“Either way, we’re not splitting them up,” she added. “They’ve been through so much together.”"

It has been years since we’ve caught up.In that time, he has come out and gotten married.Over vegetable samosas and naan bread, he shares with me that his family has been accepting and supportive. “But I can’t come out to my grandparents,” he says. “That would kill them.”“They’re so old. They’re from a different generation. They wouldn’t understand.”He wears a silver wedding band on the ring finger of his left hand. Somehow, he is still able to pass his partner off as “a really good friend” to his grandparents.But I get where he’s coming from. For many years, I feared that coming out to my grandmother would kill her.This was one of the many homophobic, fear-based fallacies I was told after coming out.“Grandma will die if you tell her,” my mother would say. “She can’t handle it. You don’t have to do this to her.”These messages played like recordings in my head, and I internalized them.Why do I have to be so selfish? She’s 88. She doesn’t have the capacity to deal with this.In recent years, she started suffering from dementia issues. She is still sharp and remembers all the important stuff. But she often forgets a conversation from one minute to the next.This only added to the fears and anxieties I had about sharing this part of myself with her. She might not even remember, so what’s the use in telling her?I had made up my mind. I will never tell Grandma I’m gay.On a Sunday in the middle of April 2013, five years after coming out to my parents at eighteen, I am sitting on a bench in Prospect Park with her.It’s chilly. But the sun is shining. We sit close and hold hands. My mother is busy driving around looking for parking.After the standard “How’s work?” and “Advertising, right?” came the question I always dreaded.“So honey... you got a girlfriend?Over the years, I had a few typical responses to this one.“No Grandma, no girlfriends.” “Not yet, I’m just having fun.” “I’m focusing on work right now.”Without fail, she would fish.“You go out though, right? You go to dances?” I always loved how “dances” was still how she referred to being social.“Yeah, Grandma, I go to dances.” I never added that the dances I went to were at gay bars with done-up drag queens onstage matching their lip movements to Madonna’s “Into the Groove.”“So honey... you got a girlfriend?” Something about her voice sounded different this time.Come on Grandma, you know I don’t have a girlfriend, I thought.“Nope,” I said.And then came a new question.“Why honey… you don’t like girls?”My mind raced from, “What if she dies right now?” to, “There is no way in hell she is going to pass away from knowing this truth.”I took in a deep breath of fresh, Prospect Park air. On my exhale, I said, “Not like that. But I have a boyfriend!”We looked at each other and neither of us said anything. She did not appear uncomfortable. Our eyes were locked and filled with tears. Then she reached over, grabbed my shoulder, and pulled me in close for a hug.“Is he Jewish? What’s his name? What’s he up to today?” I answered her questions and we chatted for a while, connecting in a way we never had.“Hey guys!” my mother called out as she made her way toward us waving. The topic turned to the weather. The color of trees in spring. The bright-eyed beagle that jumped up on my grandmother’s lap in search of affection.Soon my mom got up with my grandmother and went to look for the bathroom. I remained on the bench and called a close friend in Florida.“Sup Shloim?”Hearing his voice gave me the permission I needed to let go of tears I had been holding back.“I just came out to my grandma!” I blurted out as soon as he answered. “And it went very well.”He said he was proud of me and happy that I found the courage to tell her.I ended the call right before my mom and grandmother returned.“Want some ice cream, Grandma?” I bought two cones. We sat in the sun and enjoyed cold licks of vanilla and chocolate.Later, we stood by the water, arms around each other, and fed bread to ducks.Over the next hour, my mom fielded several phone calls from matchmakers for my younger sister. Each time she answered and walked away, my grandmother and I spoke more.The next day, I am responding to an email from my older sister. She had sent me a link to a moving article about a father’s reaction to his son’s coming out.I write to her about how cathartic is was for me to connect with Grandma in this way. And how relieved I was to see that she remained very much alive, even after I told her.“WOW. I am ELATED that you chose to tell Grandma and how it turned out,” my sister immediately responds. “Just goes to show, always follow the truth and your soul.”I’m smiling, reading.“‘Is he Jewish?’ That’s so awesome. I always hated how Ma gave you that impression about Grandma, I knew Grandma could ‘take’ it. And you will forever remember that moment, and when she is no longer with us you will take solace in it. That she knew you.”I take a deep breath. My sister totally gets it.“WOW. My brave brother Shloim. Love you.”Another breath.“And BY THE WAY... you realize you’re going to have to come out to her again and again... and again, right?”—You can follow @shloimynotik on Instagram."

In fact, people write comments or even whole articles on places like LifeNews that say, “I’m a nurse and I’ve seen it on labor and delivery” or “my cousin’s friend had one.” Sometimes a purple or orange egg tweets to tell me these procedures exist because they saw it on YouTube.First of all, one can’t be partially born. In obstetrics, you are pregnant or you aren’t, and you are delivered or you are not. For example, there is an obstetrical emergency called shoulder dystocia where the fetal head delivers but the shoulders get stuck. It’s an emergency and if you don’t act appropriately and promptly, the outcome can be horrendous. Even in this situation, the pregnancy is not delivered until every part is delivered. Using the term “partial birth abortion” is like saying “cutting out half the guts” when you really mean a hemicolectomy. The former is a very imprecise and poor descriptor for the latter.As an OB/GYN, I can come up with hundreds of scenarios where a D & X is the medically preferred procedure. Every timeI think something is just too catastrophic to happen, the human body surprises me. With the “partial birth” abortion ban, the government took the safest medical option off the table in most states. According to ACOG “the safety advantages of intact dilatation and evacuation (intact D&E) procedures are widely recognized—in medical texts, peer-reviewed studies, clinical practice, and in mainstream, medical care in the United States.”"

William Fugazy, a politically well-connected businessman who later pleaded guilty to perjury, gave the awards to Trump and 79 other people, most of them white, to protest the awarding of “medals of liberty” to a group of 12 recent immigrants that included a Chinese-born architect, a Costa Rica-born astronaut, a leading expert on the psychology of race, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, but no “Irish, Italian, or Polish” people.Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime attorney, adviser and campaign surrogate, posted the photo on Twitter earlier this week of Trump, Parks and Ali, “receiving NAACP medals for helping America’s inner cities. A man for ALL people!” The NAACP has not awarded any medals to Trump for “helping America’s inner cities,” the group told HuffPost. Nor have any other civil rights groups, according to Trump’s biographers. Here’s the real story. In 1986, as preparations began for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty, a civic committee selected a group of 12 naturalized citizens to receive “medals of liberty” from President Ronald Reagan. The final list, announced that March, included composer Irving Berlin, who emigrated from Russia; Franklin Chang Diaz, an astronaut from Costa Rica; I.M. Pei, an architect born in China; and entertainment legend Bob Hope, who was born in England.There was an immediate outcry. Fugazy, then Trump’s real estate broker and head of the Coalition of Italo-American Associations, was angry that there were no native-born citizens among the 12 liberty medal winners (which was inevitable, since the award was for naturalized citizens) and that the list excluded certain ethnicities, “like the Irish, Italians and Poles.”Fugazy’s Coalition of Italo-American Associations helped lead the campaign against the selections. “We think it’s an insult to ― on the one hand ― ask for donations to restore the foremost international symbol of freedom for immigrants and ― on the other hand ― to exclude most of them from the Medal of Liberty list,” Joseph Martorana, the group’s executive director, told the Miami Herald, before claiming that “the ethnic groups excluded account for 76 percent of the nation’s population.”Fugazy had plenty of support. New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, called the selections “idiotic” and announced plans to hand out his own awards. “It’s almost like denying some of the building blocks of the nation. It’s an historical betrayal,” New York City Council majority leader Peter Vallone told the Herald.Six of the 12 recipients of the medals, including Berlin, Kissinger, violinist Itzhak Perlman, polio vaccine inventor Albert Sabin, author Elie Wiesel and University of Chicago president Hanna Holborn Gray, were of Jewish descent.”These are shameful concessions to a Hollywood producer who lives in the world of fantasy,” Paul O’Dwyer, a former New York City Council president, told the Herald, presumably referring to “Roots” producer David Wolper, also Jewish, who had organized the centennial festivities. “I don’t know what some of these people have done for history ― although Kissinger and Bob Hope have certainly done well for themselves,” he added. “All in all, it shows an abysmal ignorance of the history of our country.”Some people tried to defend the awards. “The great wave of Irish and Italian immigration took place before the First World War. It is therefore hardly surprising that most Irish Americans and Italian Americans are Americans by birth, not naturalization,” historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a member of the committee that selected the 12 winners, noted in a letter to The New York Times. But Schlesinger’s letter didn’t put the matter to rest. That the committee had included Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was of Irish descent, as well as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New Jersey Rep. Peter Rodino, both of Italian descent, didn’t seem to absolve the committee, either.Instead, the controversy continued into the summer. That June, Fugazy created a new organization, the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, or NECO, and a new award, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Trump, Ali and Parks were among 80 people honored at NECO’s first awards ceremony on Ellis Island on Oct. 27, 1986. Only four of the 80 winners were black.In the original, uncropped version of the photo that Cohen shared, there are six people: baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, humorist Victor Borge, singer and anti-gay activist Anita Bryant, Ali, Parks and Trump.Since 1986, more than 2,000 people have been awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, including then-first lady Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Officially, the medal criteria are broad and inclusive: Winners should “uphold the ideals and spirit of America,” while “maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage.” In practice, the winners are mostly white Americans of European descent. NECO maintains a database of past medal honorees, which in many cases cites their “ethnic heritage.” Below is McCain’s listing, which notes his heritage is “Scottish/Irish.” It’s not clear precisely why Fugazy selected Trump to receive the medal in its inaugural year, save for their friendship and Trump’s success in business. Fugazy died in 2015. Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about the award or about Cohen’s tweet. But Fugazy was working as a broker for Trump in 1986, helping him to purchase two new properties, a 1987 government ethics report revealed.

William Fugazy, a politically well-connected businessman who later pleaded guilty to perjury, gave the awards to Trump and 79 other people, most of them white, to protest the awarding of “medals of liberty” to a group of 12 recent immigrants that included a Chinese-born architect, a Costa Rica-born astronaut, a leading expert on the psychology of race, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, but no “Irish, Italian, or Polish” people.Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime attorney, adviser and campaign surrogate, posted the photo on Twitter earlier this week of Trump, Parks and Ali, “receiving NAACP medals for helping America’s inner cities. A man for ALL people!” The NAACP has not awarded any medals to Trump for “helping America’s inner cities,” the group told HuffPost. Nor have any other civil rights groups, according to Trump’s biographers. Here’s the real story. In 1986, as preparations began for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty, a civic committee selected a group of 12 naturalized citizens to receive “medals of liberty” from President Ronald Reagan. The final list, announced that March, included composer Irving Berlin, who emigrated from Russia; Franklin Chang Diaz, an astronaut from Costa Rica; I.M. Pei, an architect born in China; and entertainment legend Bob Hope, who was born in England.There was an immediate outcry. Fugazy, then Trump’s real estate broker and head of the Coalition of Italo-American Associations, was angry that there were no native-born citizens among the 12 liberty medal winners (which was inevitable, since the award was for naturalized citizens) and that the list excluded certain ethnicities, “like the Irish, Italians and Poles.”Fugazy’s Coalition of Italo-American Associations helped lead the campaign against the selections. “We think it’s an insult to ― on the one hand ― ask for donations to restore the foremost international symbol of freedom for immigrants and ― on the other hand ― to exclude most of them from the Medal of Liberty list,” Joseph Martorana, the group’s executive director, told the Miami Herald, before claiming that “the ethnic groups excluded account for 76 percent of the nation’s population.”Fugazy had plenty of support. New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, called the selections “idiotic” and announced plans to hand out his own awards. “It’s almost like denying some of the building blocks of the nation. It’s an historical betrayal,” New York City Council majority leader Peter Vallone told the Herald.Six of the 12 recipients of the medals, including Berlin, Kissinger, violinist Itzhak Perlman, polio vaccine inventor Albert Sabin, author Elie Wiesel and University of Chicago president Hanna Holborn Gray, were of Jewish descent.”These are shameful concessions to a Hollywood producer who lives in the world of fantasy,” Paul O’Dwyer, a former New York City Council president, told the Herald, presumably referring to “Roots” producer David Wolper, also Jewish, who had organized the centennial festivities. “I don’t know what some of these people have done for history ― although Kissinger and Bob Hope have certainly done well for themselves,” he added. “All in all, it shows an abysmal ignorance of the history of our country.”Some people tried to defend the awards. “The great wave of Irish and Italian immigration took place before the First World War. It is therefore hardly surprising that most Irish Americans and Italian Americans are Americans by birth, not naturalization,” historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a member of the committee that selected the 12 winners, noted in a letter to The New York Times. But Schlesinger’s letter didn’t put the matter to rest. That the committee had included Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was of Irish descent, as well as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New Jersey Rep. Peter Rodino, both of Italian descent, didn’t seem to absolve the committee, either.Instead, the controversy continued into the summer. That June, Fugazy created a new organization, the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, or NECO, and a new award, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Trump, Ali and Parks were among 80 people honored at NECO’s first awards ceremony on Ellis Island on Oct. 27, 1986. Only four of the 80 winners were black.In the original, uncropped version of the photo that Cohen shared, there are six people: baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, humorist Victor Borge, singer and anti-gay activist Anita Bryant, Ali, Parks and Trump.Since 1986, more than 2,000 people have been awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, including then-first lady Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Officially, the medal criteria are broad and inclusive: Winners should “uphold the ideals and spirit of America,” while “maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage.” In practice, the winners are mostly white Americans of European descent. NECO maintains a database of past medal honorees, which in many cases cites their “ethnic heritage.” Below is McCain’s listing, which notes his heritage is “Scottish/Irish.” It’s not clear precisely why Fugazy selected Trump to receive the medal in its inaugural year, save for their friendship and Trump’s success in business. Fugazy died in 2015. Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about the award or about Cohen’s tweet. But Fugazy was working as a broker for Trump in 1986, helping him to purchase two new properties, a 1987 government ethics report revealed. Trump ultimately paid Fugazy more than $500,000 in fees.In addition to brokering the purchases, Fugazy helped arrange a deal that year between Trump and auto executive Lee Iacocca, one of his closest friends, to buy a condo building in Florida. In the photo below (from left) Iacocca, Fugazy and Trump are attending the 1987 wedding of their pal George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees.Despite his rich and powerful friends, Fugazy was in deep financial trouble in 1986, and declared personal bankruptcy that summer.

Recently, Tokyo metropolitan government and International Olympic Committee have reportedly agreed that some Tokyo 2020 Olympic events should be held in Japan's earthquake-hit areas . IOC President Thomas Bach met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday and suggested staging some Olympic events in Fukushima, hit by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. After the talks with Abe, Bach met with reporters and told them the affected areas are ""one of the options."" He said, ""This will send a message of confidence and hope to the people there.""He said that Abe also welcomed the idea. Since Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, who wants to reduce the cost of Olympics, also agrees with the idea, the good mood for rapprochement is building up after a while. Once decided upon, some of the baseball and softball games would be held in the affected areas. The venues for the rowing and canoe sprint events are not decided yet. As Tokyo governor repeatedly emphasized of moving the events outside the capital, there were even suggestions of moving them to an existing site in South Korea. Although there were many other candidates such as Miyagi Prefecture and Saitama Prefecture, Tokyo have decided to either build permanent facilities in Tokyo, build temporary ones, or move the events to Miyagi Prefecture. When Tokyo metropolitan government proposes the final venue by the end of this month, working-level talks between IOC, Tokyo Government, Japanese government, and Tokyo Organizing Committee will be held next month to make final decision. Conflicts over venue construction began when Koike revealed that she will make best efforts to reduce the burden on Tokyo residents. Since Ms. Koike won the election last August, she is becoming increasingly popular. 78 percent of respondents were in favor of moving some proposed Olympic events while only 12 percent disagreed, according to an Asahi Shimbun survey held on Oct. 15-16. Tokyo metropolitan government proposed changing the venue for rowing and canoe sprint competitions to the Miyagi Naganuma Boat Race Course in the city of Tome, Miyagi Prefecture. But this proposal is opposed by the Organizing Committee for being ineffective as the venue is too far from the capital. It seems that the situation is getting better after IOC President Bach came to reach agreement. After meeting with Tokyo governor Koike, he said that the rules should not be changed, however he vowed to produce a very significant reduction in costs for the Olympics. The controversial venue plan for the 2020 Games seems to be making progress to a certain extent."

The reached accord, after years of negotiating back and forth, established a nine-member Presidential Council (PC) headed by a little known and colorless member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Fayez Al Sarraj. All nine Presidential Council members, including Al Sarraj, were named and directly appointed by Leon, albeit after some consultation with political groups.This action was seen in Libya as ""imposed,"" favoring the Muslim Brotherhood, and soon led to the withdrawal of two Presidential Council members representing the eastern region (Barqa). The reached political agreement also called for the House of Representatives to continue as the sole legislative body, while another consultative body called ""The Higher National Council"" (HNC) was to be formed mainly from the representatives of the General National Congress that continued to operate even after a new House of Representatives was duly elected by popular vote in 2014. An ad hoc group of General National Council members met in Tripoli in August, declaring themselves the new Higher National Council, electing Abdurahman Swehli, from the powerful city of Misrata, as its president. He had also been elected as a member of the House of Representatives but never reported. The agreement was widely criticized in Libya, and was seen by many as an attempt to bribe the main factions (General National Congress and the House of Representatives) by continuing their huge salaries and benefits, a very sensitive issue among ordinary Libyans who often stand in lines for hours in front of banks to withdraw their salaries or savings, trying to meet their daily needs. Others who joined the political dialogue received positions in the Presidential Guard and high positions within the Government of National Accord to be formed by the Presidential Council, where Al-Sarraj serves in double capacity, both as a head of the NOC and the Government. Since the political accord was signed, this government was rejected twice by the House of Representatives, yet it continues to operate from Tripoli under self-granted authority but with the blessing of the UN and Western powers. A formal approval from the House of Representatives looks unlikely after a second round of voting by the House. Libyans' lack of confidence in the UN brokered political accord grew even stronger after Aref Ali Nayed, Libyan Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates who just yesterday tendered his resignation, allegedly influenced the accord by arranging for UN representative Leon a lucrative $40,000-plus monthly pay within a UAE institution after his UN mandate was over. The bottom line: with all good intentions and efforts, the brokered agreement cannot work as it stands now. The accord failed to include real forces on the ground, and allowed for two months to remove militias from Tripoli and establish an independent Presidential Guard, something that did not happen. Also, an important sticky point is Article 8, which gives the Presidential Council full authority to make major appointments, including the general commander of the armed forces. The target was General Haftar, who led the fight against ISIS and its affiliates in Benghazi and is fighting militia leaders in the Western region of Libya. The Eastern region vehemently opposes this Article and wants to have it removed. Libya Is Confusing, To Say The LeastThe Presidential Council had to operate from neighboring Tunisia for several months, due to a lack of security in Tripoli. Finally, it dared to enter Tripoli by sea last March, allegedly on an Italian frigate, occupying a naval base east of Tripoli where it languishes to this day, more than six months later, unable to take control over government offices. Rather than forming a National Guard (as the accord called for), the Presidential Council started and continues to be under the protection and control of militias, mainly from Misrata, who had taken over Tripoli in an infamous attack during August 2014, destroying the international airport and most of its airplanes. That is not to say that all militias from Misrata supported the Presidential Council. There is a split even within the city's leaders and its militias regarding the issue. The Presidential Council, initially welcomed by most Libyans, seen as the unifying force for the country with two parliaments and two governments, and enjoyed full international support and backing, has been a dismal failure. Yet its government, not yet confirmed by the House of Representatives, continues to operate under an assumed mandate, adding a third government to the mix and a new layer of bureaucracy and expenses to the seriously strained financial situation in Libya. Two of these three governments are in Tripoli. This creates more confusion to the administrative offices, whose orders are expected to be followed. By all accounts, the Presidential Council and the Government of National Accord failed to provide solutions to the mounting problems in Libya, and their credibility has deteriorated sharply with ordinary Libyans. As this article is published, there is another serious military standoff in Tripoli between Al-Sarraj's Government of National Accord and Khalifa Al-Ghawil, former prime minister and head of the Government of National Salvation.  In addition to the acute shortage of liquidity, crime rates have increased, with certain militia groups using force for ransom kidnappings, even murders. Inflation has soared, where the Libyan Dinar has fallen sharply against foreign currencies from an official exchange rate of 1.39 to the U.S. dollar to over 5 on the street. Health care is deteriorating with shortages of medicines, supplies and poor hospital services. Corruption and increasing salaries paid to militia members, along with the drop in oil export from 1.6 million bbls per day (in 2010) to fewer than 400,000 bbls per day in 2016, are causes for serious concern. (PHOTO: AFP/Getty Images) General Haftar - Possible Fixer of Libya?Last month, the forces of General Haftar, leader of the ""National Army,"" swept quickly through the oil region in central Libya, forcing out the so-called ""Oil Facilities Guards,"" gangs that have shut down oil terminals for two and a half years. The shutdown deprived the Libyan treasury of an estimated 100 billion dollars of much needed revenue, in a country where oil revenue represents 95 percent of the country's income. The central region produces over 70 percent of Libya's oil from Al-Mabruk, Al-Bahi, Al-Waha, Intisar, Amal Abu Altifl and other oil fields. While Libyans hailed the expulsion of the gangs guarding the oil facilities (who seemed to have cut a lucrative deal with the Presidential Council in exchange for their backing), the U.S. and its Western allies inexplicably condemned it and ordered the forces of General Haftar to leave immediately without any conditions. However, General Haftar aptly turned over control of the oil fields to the (now united) National Oil Company, thus preempting Western powers to interfere. Revenues from oil exports will now go to the Libyan Foreign Bank, as they did before, and from there to the Central Bank. General Haftar led a brutal two-year fight in Benghazi against Ansar Al-Sharia, a group the United States declared to be a terrorist organization and blamed for the assassination of the former U.S. ambassador in 2012. The group was forced out of Benghazi, except for a few pockets. As a result, he has solid support in the eastern region of Libya, the former State of Baqa in the period when Libya was under the federal system after its independence in 1951. He also has considerable and growing support in many cities in the west. Many Libyans believe that General Haftar, with support from Egypt and UAE, will soon move to the western region of the country to unify it under his military control. To many in Libya this is a suitable scenario, after five years of suffering, a lack of security and the arbitrary and often violent rule of over hundreds of militias since the fall of the Gaddafi regime. However, General Haftar would have to face a strong and well-armed militia forces from Misrata along with the other strong militias in Tripoli, mainly under leaders such as Haitham Altajuri, Ghenew ِAlkikkli, Salah Badi, Mustafa Kara and others. These leaders emerged as the strongest and best funded in the greater Tripoli area. Altajuri, for instance, was responsible for the kidnapping of the former Prime Minister Ali Zaidan. Alkikkli commands a powerful militia in control of a heavily populated section of Tripoli called Abu Sleim. The Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda offshoots, and ISIS supporters in the West would also oppose General Haftar, who they declared to be their archenemy.  Over 200,000 militia members are paid government salaries, often forced at gunpoint. The government's annual payroll in 2010, under Gaddafi, was at 8 billion Libyan dinars, and now, in 2016, stands at 28 billion dinars, virtually robbing the state budget. (PHOTO: AFP) The freeing of oil terminals and the near-complete defeat of ISIS in the central coastal city of Sirte is the only bright news in Libya in nearly three years. The fight against ISIS was mainly carried out by forces from Misrata, at a heavy cost in life and serious injuries. U.S. warplanes provided support by bombing some targets in the city. With over 600 deaths and more than 2,000 seriously injured, the still ongoing battle of Sirte left Misrata with no remaining appetite to challenge General Haftar's forces' move into the oil region they previously overtook. Non-Governmental Talks in Geneva - A Possible New Reconciliation Platform?It is clear that the UN accord has not united Libya, but has rather reached a dead end. Perhaps the high level and inclusive dialogue with all relevant forces and tribes in Libya could offer possible solutions. Such efforts were held in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 7 and 8, organized by the Center for Humanitarian Dialogue. The dialogue included most factions on the Libyan political scene in an amiable atmosphere, although with modest results. The participants agreed that the format and sponsorship by the neutral organization was a positive way forward and a platform to build on, enlarging the dialogue to include more influential forces on the ground. The model of 1951 is a goal to strive for. During the period that led to the independence of Libya in 1961, opposing factions from eastern and western regions in Libya overcame their differences and agreed to form a united country under a federal kingdom with three states (the third from the southwest). The federal system was abolished in 1963 and a united Libya emerged.  In the west, other militias shut down pipelines to the two main oil fields (Al-Feel and Al-Sharara) ousting revenues of another 27 billion dollars. According to the World Bank, Libya is now virtually bankrupt and has to dip into its dwindling reserves left over from the Gaddafi era. In 2011 estimated around 145 billion dollars, they are reportedly down to under 50 billion dollars today. (PHOTO: REUTERS/Ismail Zitouny)The U.S. has largely stayed out of the Libyan fray, leaving the task to its divided European allies, each pursuing their own interests and adding to the divisions in Libya rather than providing solutions. This is also true for the regional powers, pouring arms and money to support different factions. Egypt and the UAE support General Haftar while Turkey and Qatar support Misrata and the Muslim Brotherhood.The new U.S. administration will have to engage more actively and lead efforts in Libya, through serious and forceful leadership to unite its European allies, exercise pressure on regional countries and warring factions within Libya into concessions for a more meaningful accord. A final agreement needs to pass the acceptance benchmark of everyone, and bring peace to Libyans and stability for the Mediterranean Basin and beyond."

To which the religious leader replied: ""Since you know he's the God of all, not just of Muslims, why do you believe those who sow sedition, tarnish non-Muslims as atheists, and act as if the God of all is yours alone?""The point was made and rang a bell with participants of different faiths.The tips I provided included reporting accurately about religious groups and matters, not assuming anything, being fair and balanced, familiarizing oneself with religious laws where they apply, providing the necessary context to any story and adding the economic, political, social and cultural dimensions to reports.I also cautioned them about politicians' use of religious verses to further political and possibly nefarious agendas.In a second session I focused on media ethics in the religious context with countless caveats on pitfalls that could sink journalists like inciting hate, misusing social media, and disseminating rumors. Terminology exercise (Abu-Fadil)One exercise required the journalists to define loaded terms such as terrorist, martyr, resistance, suicide bomber, fundamentalist, extremist, war on terror, war on Islam, Crusades, failed states, us versus them, and more.There were the inevitable case studies of media fanning the flames, distorted uses of visuals and infographics and an exercise requiring participants to view and critique part of a BBC Arabic documentary on sedition. They were advised to see the whole film in their spare time and assess how it could be turned into a straight news story.In parting comments, the participants were shown the Ethical Journalism Network's video on the five core values of journalism.Their comments and tweets during and after the workshop were most gratifying. I'm confident I made a bit of a dent."
29,POLITICS,Former Arizona Governor Dismisses Hispanics: 'They Don't Vote',Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jan-brewer-hispanics_us_580b828ee4b02444efa3bd2f,“They don’t get out and vote. They don’t vote.”,2016-10-22,Former Arizona Gov. Jen Brewer (R) isn't too concerned about the growing Hispanic vote in her state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580b85461a000074285bb26a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) dismissed the suggestion that Hillary Clinton could win her state in the presidential election, claiming that Hispanics there wouldn’t vote.GOP nominee Donald Trump narrowly leads Clinton in Arizona ― a state that has traditionally voted for Republicans ― according to HuffPost Pollster. (One recent poll this week even showed her leading Trump in the state.) But there has been rapid growth in the number of eligible Hispanic voters in the state, which could be a problem for Trump, who launched his presidential campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and criminals.Still, Brewer, who has endorsed Trump, said she wasn’t concerned with the Hispanic vote.“Nah,” she told the Boston Globe. “They don’t get out and vote. They don’t vote.”In 2012, just 48 percent of Hispanic voters turned out to vote nationally ― a percentage that lagged significantly behind black Americans (66.6 percent) and whites (64.1 percent). This year, according to Pew, the number of eligible Hispanic voters is projected to be 40 percent higher than it was in 2008, making it one of the fastest-growing groups of eligible voters.Clinton’s campaign has recently dispatched first lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), two high-profile surrogates, to campaign for her in Arizona.As governor, Brewer signed into law controversial legislation that allowed law enforcement to question the immigration status of people they suspected of being in the country illegally. Critics said it encouraged racial profiling, and in 2012, the Supreme Court struck down several key provisions of the law.In its autopsy of the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee wrote that it needed “to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them, too.”Jose Aristimuño, a Democratic National Committee spokesman, said Brewer “effectively hammered the final nail in the coffin of that report.” “Today, she said in no uncertain terms that the Latino vote doesn’t matter, that it’s not going to make a difference this November,” he said in a statement. “Her words are an incredibly offensive slap in the face to the Latino community.”In a statement, Clinton campaign spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the campaign was already confident in high turnout among Latino voters.“Latino voters will stand up and make their voice heard in this election. We’re already seeing this with record voter registration in key states, positive early vote numbers, and an increase in ballot requests in Latino communities. Donald Trump has attacked Latino and immigrant communities throughout his campaign and they will refuse to be silenced in this election,” Hinojosa said.This article has been updated with a statement from Clinton’s campaign."

They would not elaborate.(Reporting by Emily Stephenson and Roberta Rampton)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
31,POLITICS,Donald Trump Jr. Says Leaked Boasts Of Assault Are 'A Fact Of Life',Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-jr-assault-fact-of-life_us_580bd253e4b0a03911ed4d01,Not doing his dad any favors.,2016-10-22,"Donald Trump Jr. speaks on the second day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 19, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580bde4e1b0000582cef8c39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump Jr. told a conservative talk radio host on Friday night that his father’s leaked comments about groping women are a “fact of life.”Dori Monson, host of Seattle’s “Dori Monson Show” on KIRO, told Trump Jr. that Donald Trump’s 2005 remarks on a hot microphone made him hesitate about voting for the GOP presidential nominee.“If I heard somebody talking around my girls like we heard on the ‘Access Hollywood’ [tape], it’d be done for me,” Monson said, in audio first flagged by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski.“I understand that,” Trump Jr. responded. “Obviously, he’s not happy about that.”But the younger Trump, who has been among the most visible surrogates for his father’s presidential campaign, quickly pivoted to downplaying the comments’ significance.“We all probably know guys who have had conversations with other guys that go a little bit in that direction,” he said. “That’s a fact of life.”He even argued that it was a positive characteristic, contrasting his father’s comments with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s highly managed public persona.“He hasn’t spent his whole life sitting there polishing every statement he’s ever made, every conversation he’s ever had,” Trump Jr. added. “He doesn’t run a focus group so he can tell you what he’s thinking. He speaks from the heart.”The latest explanation coming from Trump’s oldest son is a variation of the “locker room talk” dismissals the nominee himself has made. Earlier this month, Trump Jr. offered a similar excuse, claiming his father’s remarks made him “a normal person not a political robot.”Trump Jr. has also claimed ― in 2013 ― that women who cannot “handle” sexual harassment “don’t belong in the workforce.” In 2011, he also tweeted that a celebrity like Marc McGrath “can sexually harass the hell out of anyone.”There is likely no explanation comprehensive enough to undo the damage that Trump’s 2005 comments have inflicted on his campaign. In the weeks following the release of the leaked video, a growing number of women have stepped forward with allegations of assault at Trump’s hands, seemingly contradicting the claims that the businessman’s comments were “just words.”As of Saturday, HuffPost Pollster’s election forecast predicted that Clinton had a 96.1 percent chance of winning the presidency.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Varoga said the Oct. 4 police action prevented the group from registering 5,000 to 10,000 additional voters ahead of Indiana’s Oct. 11 voter registration deadline. He’s worried that clerks won’t count some of the 45,000 applications the group had already collected.So why did state officials take such a dramatic step in interrupting the IVRP’s work just days ahead of the voter registration deadline?From what we’ve gathered, it’s not because there’s any mass “voter fraud” scheme to steal an election. Instead, it seems the extraordinary investigation is likely to find no more than potential technical violations of obscure regulations for third-party voter registration groups. This all seems to have started after a county clerk’s office received 10 potentially problematic forms allegedly submitted by IVRP canvassers. In mid-September, Lawson issued a press release accusing IVRP of turning in “forged voter registration applications,” even though the evidence wasn’t clear that those forms were actually forged.Lawson’s office and the Indiana State Police insist that their investigations are separate. Valerie Warycha, deputy chief of staff and communications director for Lawson, said the office had no prior knowledge of the police action on Oct. 4.“At the onset of the state police investigation they told her they were going to conduct an investigation. They will not brief us on the details of their investigation until the end,” Warycha said. She also said that despite Lawson’s talk of “nefarious” actors, she never directly accused the group of voter fraud. “She never said fraud or accused anyone of fraud ― including the Indiana Voter Registration Project,” Warycha said. “I am not sure why they are so defensive. Have they done something wrong?”Despite the public shaming from state officials, IVRP was following the law when it turned in the forms ― even if they were fraudulent.Individuals conducting voter registration drives are required to turn in each and every voter registration application they receive, even those they believe may not be legitimate. Many states have similar protections in place to make sure organizations are not filtering out voters based on their political party. Bill Buck, a spokesman for Patriot Majority USA, said that IVRP canvassers worked with officials and “flagged applications it thought might have omissions or other problems and asked the clerks to examine them as part of their standard review.”Sounds responsible, right? But here’s where it gets tricky. Indiana law requires that a person who receives a voter registration application they have “reason to believe” is false, fictitious or fraudulent submit the application “with a statement sworn or affirmed to under the penalties for perjury, setting forth the reasons why the person believes the application may be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent.”That requirement isn’t mentioned in the voter registration drive flyer published on the Indiana secretary of state’s website, but it is mentioned in a voter registration drive guide published by one Indiana county. A state police official said that part of the investigation is looking at whether IVRP canvassers submitted affidavits when they believed an application was fraudulent. “You’ve got to comply with all aspects of the law ― not just the part of the law that you like,” Capt. David Bursten, a spokesman for the Indiana State Police, said when he pointed The Huffington Post to that statute.Asked if IVRP had failed to submit affidavits, Bursten said that’s one piece of the investigation. “We would have no reason for doing this investigation unless there were indications that there are potential violations of state law,” he said.The Indiana State Police said they have more than two dozen officers working on this case. But it doesn’t take too much effort to figure out that IVRP didn’t submit any affidavits.“To my knowledge, we did not submit any affidavits,” says Buck, the Patriot Majority USA spokesman. “Canvassers did not know with certainty that the information on any forms was false or fraudulent.”And it gets more complicated. Under the law, the state police don’t seem to have a role in an investigation into a potential fraudulent voter registration form. Instead, it is up to the county election board to investigate before turning any findings over to a prosecutor.What makes a form fraudulent depends on who you ask. To the county officials who initially called in the state police, it was missing or inaccurate information. But IVRP could not determine whether those inaccuracies were an attempt at fraud or simple human error. Lawson, it seems, is now leaning toward the latter.“It’s very possible that because of heightened activity this year that many of those changes are changes that the individual made,” Lawson told the Associated Press on Thursday, walking back her initial comments. “That should give Indiana voters the comfort that we are vigilant and we are protecting their rights and the elections here are not rigged.”State Democrats condemned Lawson’s earlier language as “inflammatory” since she claimed thousands of fraudulent applications had been found but did not release an exact number. But Varoga thinks that comments from other Republicans in an IndyStar story caused her to soften her language.“The only reason she would walk it back is because members of her own party must have told her she was being reckless,” he said.The idea that police officers could target a voter registration drive aimed at black voters doesn’t look too good for the state. One registration worker told The New Republic that state police were repeatedly trying to get her to say that the voter registration group set quotas for canvassers and paid them per voter registration received, an allegation the group says is simply untrue.Voter fraud is incredibly rare. In fact, there’s a greater chance of someone getting struck by lightning than of in-person fraud occurring. A 2014 study from Loyola University analyzed 14 years of voting and found 241 fraudulent ballots out of one billion cast, and just 31 that were potential instances of in-person voter fraud. But claims of voter fraud and demonization of black voter registration drives have been a component of election cycles long before Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump started warning about “rigged” elections.Doug Carter, the head of the state police, said the investigation will likely go past Election Day. He denied that Gov. Mike Pence (R) ― the man who appointed him to his job and Trump’s running mate ― had any involvement in an investigation that Pence has mentioned on the campaign trail. (Bursten, the police spokesman, told HuffPost that Carter did not make the decision to launch an investigation into IVRP). “I wish people could know Mike Pence like I do,” Carter, a Republican donor, said.The Justice Department, which does not typically say whether it has opened up a voting rights investigation into a particular jurisdiction, declined to comment.

But it doesn’t take too much effort to figure out that IVRP didn’t submit any affidavits.“To my knowledge, we did not submit any affidavits,” says Buck, the Patriot Majority USA spokesman. “Canvassers did not know with certainty that the information on any forms was false or fraudulent.”And it gets more complicated. Under the law, the state police don’t seem to have a role in an investigation into a potential fraudulent voter registration form. Instead, it is up to the county election board to investigate before turning any findings over to a prosecutor.What makes a form fraudulent depends on who you ask. To the county officials who initially called in the state police, it was missing or inaccurate information. But IVRP could not determine whether those inaccuracies were an attempt at fraud or simple human error. Lawson, it seems, is now leaning toward the latter.“It’s very possible that because of heightened activity this year that many of those changes are changes that the individual made,” Lawson told the Associated Press on Thursday, walking back her initial comments. “That should give Indiana voters the comfort that we are vigilant and we are protecting their rights and the elections here are not rigged.”State Democrats condemned Lawson’s earlier language as “inflammatory” since she claimed thousands of fraudulent applications had been found but did not release an exact number. But Varoga thinks that comments from other Republicans in an IndyStar story caused her to soften her language.“The only reason she would walk it back is because members of her own party must have told her she was being reckless,” he said.The idea that police officers could target a voter registration drive aimed at black voters doesn’t look too good for the state. One registration worker told The New Republic that state police were repeatedly trying to get her to say that the voter registration group set quotas for canvassers and paid them per voter registration received, an allegation the group says is simply untrue.Voter fraud is incredibly rare. In fact, there’s a greater chance of someone getting struck by lightning than of in-person fraud occurring. A 2014 study from Loyola University analyzed 14 years of voting and found 241 fraudulent ballots out of one billion cast, and just 31 that were potential instances of in-person voter fraud. But claims of voter fraud and demonization of black voter registration drives have been a component of election cycles long before Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump started warning about “rigged” elections.Doug Carter, the head of the state police, said the investigation will likely go past Election Day. He denied that Gov. Mike Pence (R) ― the man who appointed him to his job and Trump’s running mate ― had any involvement in an investigation that Pence has mentioned on the campaign trail. (Bursten, the police spokesman, told HuffPost that Carter did not make the decision to launch an investigation into IVRP). “I wish people could know Mike Pence like I do,” Carter, a Republican donor, said.The Justice Department, which does not typically say whether it has opened up a voting rights investigation into a particular jurisdiction, declined to comment.

But if you’re an adolescent writing for readers who are kids, it’s even more troubling. Esther Appelstein, 12, found herself in this predicament after a 2005 video emerged of GOP nominee Donald Trump making the lewd comments became one of the biggest news stories of the election.The St. Louis student had been writing for the Scholastic News Kids Press Corps and classroom magazines for several months before she was assigned to cover the second presidential debate, where the video became a key talking point. CNN’s Anderson Cooper, the debate moderator, said to Trump, “You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?”Appelstein knew she had to cover the topic, but she was also aware that she had to be careful when writing for a young audience. In her story, Appelstein described a “controversial video of Trump” and “a huge backlash against Trump for his vulgar comments,” instead of directly repeating his lewd language. It was a decision with which the sixth-grader struggled. “At first, I was a little unsure about how to put that in my article since I am writing for kids,” Appelstein told The Huffington Post. “I didn’t call it like a scandalous video about ‘sexual blah blah blah,’ I just called it a controversial video ... I feel like that kind of lets my readers know what it is, but it doesn’t go too much into detail so it doesn’t seem confusing or inappropriate.”In an election cycle filled with allegations of sexual assault, rehashed accusations of infidelities and racially charged remarks about immigrants and inner-city residents, talking to kids about recent current events can be tough. Young writers with Scholastic have had to assess the best way to make their reporting child-friendly, while still remaining accurate. The company has about 20 kid reporters closely covering the final stretch of the campaign.“This is such an unusual election. There’s been a lot of talk about it,” said Appelstein, referring to conversations that have taken place in classrooms and school cafeterias. “One of my friends, she has very strong views about strong women and things like that. She is very concerned about what Donald trump has said about women.”Another Scholastic reporter, 15-year-old Gabe Ferris said his “classmates are a lot more involved than I thought they would be.” He can’t yet glean if their involvement is unique to this election, though. Ferris doesn’t have “a typical election to compare the 2016 campaign to” because he’s so young.When writing about the campaign, Ferris likes to use his reporting to provoke a student-led conversation about important issues. He tries not to repeat the explicit language used by candidates. “This language from both candidates, both of their stories, and accusations against both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is interesting. When I’m talking about it in a story ... it’s language that’s maybe not appropriate for a grade school student,” the Maine student said. “I like to maybe write something that provokes a question or a thought, that will maybe get the student reading or thinking and then they can ask their teacher or parents.” For Maxwell Surprenant, a 13-year-old student from Massachusetts, it has “been challenging trying to find a way to write accurately and keep in mind I’m writing for kids.” So instead of writing about specific incidents, he tries to focus on people’s reactions to events.“If there’s a quote with bad words or something inappropriate, I’m not going to write the exact wording but I can write about what people are thinking about that,” Surprenant said.He isn’t sure if this election season is particularly graphic or if it’s par for the course. Still, if Surprenant had an opportunity to meet with the presidential nominees, he would remind them to remember the kids. “What is their message for young people in our country?” Surprenant said he would ask the nominees. “I think it’s important to let them know that kids are listening and they need to be role models for kids who are watching the election, listening to what they say, and looking up to them as leaders.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is overwhelmingly favored to win the presidency, which would make her running mate Tim Kaine the tie-breaking vote as vice president.This is a big shift for the HuffPost model. As of Friday, it was showing that Republicans had a nearly 60 percent chance of keeping the majority. The flip was caused by new data in the Indiana race, moving it from a 50 percent chance for each candidate to a 99 percent likelihood of flipping toward the Democratic side.Our model requires at least five polls on any given race in order to run. There was a dearth of information on Indiana until Friday, so we were using the race’s rating from Cook Political Report to produce a probability. The Cook rating is a “tossup,” indicating that without polling information, we’d give each candidate a 50 percent chance.We got that fifth poll in, and all of the polls have indicated that Democratic candidate Evan Bayh has a considerable lead. In the HuffPost Pollster aggregate, Bayh is 9 points ahead of Republican candidate Todd Young. That wide lead with just over two weeks until Election Day translates into a 99 percent chance of Bayh winning. Moving Indiana from 50 percent to 99 percent likely to go over to the Democrats was critical. The most likely outcome before the move was 51 Republican seats and 49 Democratic Senate seats. Pushing a single seat to an almost-certain flip made the most common outcome a 50-50 split.But that doesn’t mean Democrats have the majority sewn up. A 61 percent chance of getting to 50-50 with a Democratic vice president is not that much better than the chance of getting heads on a single random coin flip. If Republicans’ numbers improve even a little, they could reach 51 seats and control the chamber regardless of who is vice president. The critical seats are in New Hampshire, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Democrat Maggie Hassan is favored over Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) in New Hampshire at the moment, but the race has been back and forth. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D) and Joe Heck (R) are essentially tied in Nevada, as are Katie McGinty (D) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R) in Pennsylvania.

They’re liars,"" said the man in Newtown, Pennsylvania.",2016-10-22,"A Donald Trump supporter outside a campaign rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania, bats away NDTV reporter Namrata Brar's microphone.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580b7cc01700009c2aacd90c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Donald Trump supporter got into a scuffle with a journalist in Newtown, Pennsylvania, immediately after a rally where the GOP presidential nominee had denounced the media as “dishonest.”Namrata Brar, a New York-based correspondent for India’s NDTV, was trying to capture an exchange between Trump backers and anti-Trump protesters outside the athletic center where the rally had just taken place. But a Trump supporter in a black T-shirt did not appreciate having a microphone nearby. Brar’s camera operator caught the belligerent response to her overtures on tape.“I don’t want to talk to the media. They’re liars. No thank you,” said the man in the black shirt.“We’re not talking. We haven’t even asked you anything,” Brar insisted.“I decline with regret,” the man replied, his tone growing angrier.Then he swatted at Brar’s microphone with a rolled-up Trump placard.“I will knock that out of your hand,” he said, pushing the microphone with increasing force. “I decline with regret. Who even knows you?”Seeing the clash, local police officers dispersed the group, including the man who was acting aggressively.The incident nonetheless reflects the potential dangers of Trump’s anti-journalist rhetoric.Trump has escalated his denunciations of the media as his electoral chances have faded ― and his supporters have responded with growing aggression. Earlier this month, CNN’s Jim Acosta found a sign with a swastika on the media table at a Trump campaign speech.At the Newtown rally preceding the scuffle, Trump issued one of his trademark attacks on the news media, as he warned attendees about an ominous crime wave supposedly sweeping American cities.“Murder is up more than at any time over 45 years,” Trump said. “You don’t hear that from these dishonest people back there, meaning the media,” he went on. “Look at ‘em! Look at ‘em!”The crowd turned toward the press pen and booed for several seconds, then broke into a chant of “CNN sucks.”“We are living in a rigged system,” Trump said. “And believe me, they’re a big part of the rigging ― those people.”Trump is correct that the national murder rate rose in 2015 by 11 percent nationwide ― a higher percentage growth than has existed “in nearly half a century,” according to the New York Times. But homicide rates overall remain well below what they were in the 1990s.The irony, of course, is that the supposedly liberal Times covered precisely the facts that Trump accused the media of suppressing.Brar told The Huffington Post that her altercation with the Trump supporter was “actually unsettling.”“I wasn’t expecting it because through the day I was covering the event,” Brar recalled. “If people didn’t want to give me a bite on camera, they politely declined, but nothing like that.”“Even when I have been the only brown person in the crowd of only white people, I haven’t been uncomfortable,” she said.Brar, who covered the Republican National Convention in July and Trump rallies in Iowa and New Hampshire during the primary campaign, has a lot of appreciation for the many factors motivating Trump’s supporter base.“There is a huge amount of complexity in why this faction feels disenfranchised and why they feel they are being shunned by Washington,” she said, citing the loss of many jobs to globalization and immigration in some parts of the country.“They desperately want an outsider in place,” she said. “A lot of people even said, they do not like what he says, but he is an outsider, so you have to give him a shot.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

The region’s population fled in the summer of 2014, when Islamic State swept in.Earlier this week, Iraqi special units also captured Bartella, a Christian village north of Qaraqosh.A U.S. military official estimated there were fewer than a couple of hundred Islamic State fighters in Qaraqosh.“I’ve seen berms in Qaraqosh. I anticipate there’ll be trenches, there’ll be passageways between different buildings,” the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.BIGGEST BATTLE SINCE 2003The offensive on Mosul is expected to become the biggest battle fought in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.The army is also trying to advance from the south and the east while Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are holding fronts in the east and north.U.S. forces at Iraq’s Qayyara West airfield, south of Mosul, put on protective masks after winds brought fumes from a nearby sulfur plant set alight by Islamic State fighters, U.S. military officials said.A Reuters reporter in Qayyara saw Iraqi soldiers wearing gas masks on top of their heads, ready to pull them down. A cloud of white smoke blanketed the region to the north, where the factory is located, mingling with black fumes from oil wells that the militants torched to cover their moves.The Iraqi army’s media office said about 50 villages had been taken from the militants since Monday in operations to prepare the main thrust into Mosul itself, where 5,000 to 6,000 IS fighters are dug in, according to Iraqi estimates.Islamic State also controls parts of Syria.“It’s the beginning of the campaign. We do feel positively about how things have started off, particularly with the complicated nature of this operation,” said a U.S. official who briefed reporters ahead of Carter’s trip to Baghdad.Carter signaled during a visit to Ankara on Friday his support for a possible Turkish role in the campaign and said there was an agreement in principle between Baghdad and Ankara ― potentially ending a source of tension.Officials said the details on any Turkish participation still needed to be worked out.OIL-RICH KIRKUK RETAKENRoughly 5,000 U.S. personnel are in Iraq. More than 100 of them are embedded with Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces involved with the Mosul offensive, advising commanders and helping ensure coalition air power hits the right targets.U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer Jason Finan was killed on Thursday by a roadside bomb in northern Iraq as he was accompanying Iraqi forces, in the first U.S. casualty of the Mosul campaign.The militants retaliated to the advance of the Iraqi forces and the Kurdish fighters in Mosul by attacking on Friday Kirkuk, an oil city that lies east Hawija, a pocket they continue to control between Baghdad and Mosul.Authorities in Kirkuk regained control of the city on Saturday and partially lifted a curfew declared after the militants stormed police stations and other buildings. The region’s oil producing facilities were not damaged.At least 50 people have been killed and 80 others wounded in clashes between security forces and the militants in Kirkuk, according to a hospital sources.Four Iranian technicians doing maintenance work at a power station north of the city are among the dead, they said. The toll does not include the jihadists who were killed or who blew themselves up during the fighting.Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took control of Kirkuk in 2014, after the Iraqi army withdrew from the region, fleeing an Islamic State advance through northern and western Iraq.Kurdish leaders say they will never give up the ethnically mixed city, to which they, as well as Turkmen and Arabs, lay claim. Arabs complain that Kurds have since flooded to Kirkuk to tilt the demographic balance the other way.(With additional reporter by Saif Hameed in Baghdad, Mahmoud Mustafa in Kirkuk; Writing by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Helen Popper)"

They will arrive in (the Kenyan capital) Nairobi at 1830 local time tomorrow,” said John Steed, East Africa region manager for the Oceans Beyond Piracy group.The mayor of Galkayo in northern Somalia had earlier said the crew was set to arrive in Kenya on Saturday afternoon.“The crew did not say if ransom was paid,” mayor Hirsi Yusuf Barre told Reuters.Their period of captivity is one of the longest among hostages seized by pirates in the anarchic Horn of Africa nation.Steed said one member of the crew had died during the hijacking while two succumbed to illness. Among those released, one was being treated for a gunshot wound on his foot and three were diabetic.The sailors were held in Dabagala near the town of Harardheere some 400 km (250 miles) northeast of the capital Mogadishu. Harardheere became known as Somalia’s main pirate base at the height of the crisis.The Oceans Beyond Piracy group said the crew were brought ashore by pirates when their ship sank more than a year after its hijacking.Piracy off Somalia’s coast has subsided in the past three years, mainly due to shipping firms hiring private security details and the presence of international warships.The wave of attacks had cost the world’s shipping industry billions of dollars as pirates paralyzed shipping lanes, kidnapped hundreds of seafarers and seized vessels more than 1,000 miles fromSomalia’s coastline.(Writing by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Andrew Roche)"

Yet she walked into the Chastain Recreation Center gym in the upscale Buckhead neighborhood this week and cast her presidential ballot for Democrat Hillary Clinton rather than Republican Donald Trump.“There’s been nothing. He’s presented me with nothing. And what he has presented me has been so offensive,” Jones said, adding that she actually considered supporting Trump back when he first secured the nomination. But she said the more she heard from him, the more disgusted she became. His recorded boast of being able to sexually assault women because of his celebrity was the last straw. “I’m embarrassed to be a Republican and have this nominee.”It would be one thing if Jones, who supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries, were an anomaly.

Just over 28 percent of Georgia adults have at least a bachelor’s degree ― barely above the level in North Carolina ― and Georgia’s $49,300 median household income is nearly $3,000 higher than North Carolina’s. (In contrast to both, the bachelor’s degree attainment rate in Alabama is only 23 percent, while the median household income is $43,500.)Significantly, Georgia’s black population share is a full 10 percentage points higher than North Carolina’s. In theory, that should make it easier for Democrats to win there.Instead, though, Georgia Democrats watched then-Sen.

Obama managed to eke out a 0.5 percentage point win in North Carolina over Republican John McCain, while losing Georgia by 5 points.In 2012, neither side paid much attention to Georgia, and Romney won it by 8 points ― proof, to state Democrats, that even a small investment could have made a difference.Four years later, thanks to Trump, Georgia Democrats are getting their wish.

Yet she walked into the Chastain Recreation Center gym in the upscale Buckhead neighborhood this week and cast her presidential ballot for Democrat Hillary Clinton rather than Republican Donald Trump.“There’s been nothing.

But she said the more she heard from him, the more disgusted she became. His recorded boast of being able to sexually assault women because of his celebrity was the last straw. “I’m embarrassed to be a Republican and have this nominee.”It would be one thing if Jones, who supported former Florida Gov.

It derailed at around 11 a.m. local time (1000 GMT) near the station in the town of Eseka, 120 km (75 miles) west of the capital, causing carriages to overturn.“My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families of the Camrail train derailment in Eseka. Over 70 passengers died and 600 wounded in the accident,” President Paul Biya, who is traveling abroad, wrote on his official Facebook page.“I instructed the government to provide full assistance to the survivors, while investigations will be made to determine the cause of the derailment.”The death toll, put at 55 late on Friday, rose after some injured victims later died, Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said.Biya decreed that Monday would be a national day of mourning with flags flown at half-mast.Witnesses, including a Reuters reporter traveling on the train, said rail workers had added additional carriages to accommodate extra passengers before its departure, though it is not clear if that decision contributed to the accident.Camrail, a unit of French industrial group Bollore, said in a statement it was working withCameroonian authorities to ensure care for the injured and support for victims’ families.“Technical investigations are under way currently to determine the causes of this dreadful accident and the conclusions, as soon as they are known, will be communicated,” the emailed statement said.Work began during the night to remove the derailed wagons from the line - one of the main routes for goods and passengers between the main port and the interior.“The train with wounded and the bodies of victims has arrived at Yaounde station in the presence of government and Camrail officials,” Camrail posted on its official Facebook page earlier on Saturday.“Buses drove passengers who escaped yesterday’s incident to Douala.”A Bollore official based in the region, who was not authorized to speak with the press and asked not to be named, said the company was cooperating with authorities examining thecrash.“Camrail has made the train’s conductor and its mechanic available to the judicial police, because in these kinds of circumstances that is the procedure. That will allow for an understanding of what happened,” the official said.He added that traffic along the Yaounde to Douala line, which was halted following thecrash, was expected to resume soon and engineers were at the site of the accident to evaluate the damage.The collapse of a section of the main highway between Yaounde and Douala amid heavy rain earlier on Friday had blocked hundreds of vehicles on the road and prompted increased numbers of passengers to make the journey by rail.The two incidents on the same day cut the main transport axis in the central African nation of over 22 million people."
48,EDUCATION,Campus Sexual Assault Investigations Continue,"Jenna Pratt, ContributorSecondary English Educator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campus-sexual-assault-investigations-continue_us_580b8debe4b0f8715789fb63,This is part two in a series where I examine sexual assaults on university campuses across the country. I advocate strongly,2016-10-22,"Tim Fader, left, was forced to resign after reporting a sexual assault to the police at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580b940e1b0000c32bef8bb5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“The school can receive notice in several ways. Some examples of notice include: a student filing a grievance, an individual (student, parent, or friend) reporting an incident, or a responsible employee witnessing the event. It also can indirectly receive notice from a member of the local community, on a social networking site, or from the media.”The above quote comes from the official Title IX website and details how a university is notified of a potential sexual assault taking place either on campus or involving a student and/or faculty member. Why is this so important to highlight first? It’s important because the growing trend in America seems to be public and private universities are subtly silencing victims of sexual assault at the expense of keeping up a university’s image. In late 2014 former head wrestling coach Timothy Fader was fired from his position for reporting a sexual assault to the police at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. The perpetrator in question was a wrestling student and the outrage that ensued showed community-wide support for Fader commenting that “He’s being punished for doing the right thing. He’s being punished for what parents would want a coach to do and what common sense would have you do.” The university put pressure on the coach in the months after eventually leading to his resignation. This is just one instance of universities staying hush hush on sexual assaults. In May 2015 the Department of Education (DOE) released a list of 55 universities who are “under investigation for possible Title IX violations for mishandling sexual-assault cases.” When news broke major media outlets were quick to bring attention to the report. The 55 universities being investigated quickly jumped to 106 just a month later in April. As part of their investigation the DOE and the Department of Justice (DOJ) noted that they had received several reports of sexually hostile environments and a lack of quick response to assault and rape reports made my victims. The Title IX website defines a hostile environment as one that consists of “harassing conduct that was sufficiently serious- that is, sufficiently severe or pervasive-to deny or limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program based on sex.” The website goes on further to explain that the DOE also examines how a victim feels in a hostile situation and how one instance of rape is defined as a hostile environment. Outside of the issues already stated, the problem seems to stem from the legal ways a university is to handle a sexual assault case.In some instances, a university is able to handle the case internally through a university conduct board. In light of the DOE investigation the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) “issued new guidelines for schools to follow” that would prevent too many universities from moving cases into the courtroom. Even more so the OCR has made improvements to the 1990 Jeanne Clery Act which has raised awareness of sexual assault and how cases are handled on campus. In essence, the Clery Act requires universities to share information on crime and sexual assaults on campus, provide survivors of this violence with accommodations for classwork and traveling or working situations, as well as specifically outlining procedures and policies in annual school reports. While this act is incredibly important it is often overshadowed by members of the college administrative community.So, while universities―including my own―are investigated the statistic remains and the sexual assaults continue. Just take a moment to pursue the news section of a Google search on campus sexual assault and you will find four different cases taking place in universities across the country. However, the voices of the survivors are not being silenced as some university’s hope they would.One such example is Columbia graduate Emma Sulkowicz who made headlines in September of 2014 for her powerful take on a senior thesis assignment. Emma explains how she was raped in her dorm bed and why she decided to carry her mattress with her everywhere “it’s become fraught and I feel like I’ve carried the weight with me everywhere since then.” USA Today detailed how Emma was rape the first day of her sophomore year and that when she made complaints against the student “he was found ‘not responsible’ by Columbia University administration.” Yet on graduation day in May 2015 Emma walked across the stage with her mattress despite her rapist filing a lawsuit against the university because his “‘day-to-day life is unbearably stressful, as Emma and her mattress parade around campus each and every day.’” Emma’s voice was not silenced and continues to be heard.A final example comes from an anonymous student at the University of Southern California who recently wrote an article for millennial based writing site Oddysey entitled “Life After Rape.” In the article, the survivor mentions how she struggled emotionally and mentally after being raped by four guys. Even stating that “another thing I’ve learned is that anyone who works for a university is very sensitive about the girl who cried “rape” so they treat you like a lost puppy, make you feel like there’s no reason to keep coming in for therapy, they even encouraged me to get a medical clearance on my classes so I didn’t have to finish off the year.” It is why writing platforms such as Odyssey and media, such as USA Today, are so vital in giving a voice to survivors of college sexual assaults.The investigations continue with Baylor University and University of Kansas cases currently taking place as of this month alone. However, many public and political figures are stepping out to speak against the incredulous events taking place on campuses across the country. A major proponent of ending college sexual assaults is Vice President Joe Biden who in June wrote a letter to the survivor of the Stanford rape case. Biden penned a powerful response to an already powerful victim statement made by the anonymous survivor saying, “I am filled with furious anger — both that this happened to you and that our culture is still so broken that you were ever put in the position of defending your own worth.” We need to end this as a society and as administrators in positions of power in universities across the country.  This is part two in a series where I examine sexual assaults on university campuses across the country. I advocate strongly for the rights of the survivors and want to provide a place for their voices to be heard.

Wild animals run the streets, and makeshift shacks are what many children and their families call home until flood season.So how on earth can a place like this produce a young girl who would become a chess Master?

Nair described filming as a “complete marriage of art and life” as she cast local Ugandans from Katwe to provide added authenticity to the project.A Global InspirationQueen of Katwe also comes with a universal message of faith and resilience to youth across the globe. “It’s an anthem for the younger generation of how valuable it is to find out what you are passionate about and put your mind and heart to that — because then you are of use in the world,” said Nyong’o at a special preview screening and Q&A broadcast online and across theaters nationwide from Los Angeles, CA. “Phiona couldn’t have known that when she was pursuing this chess that it would one day pull her family out of poverty. She also couldn’t have known that one day her story would become a larger story, in Hollywood, on a global platform, and that one day she would be an icon for her country…and a symbol of pride for her country.” I took my daughter (15) to the Q&A and later took my father (77) for his birthday just after the film opened in Los Angeles. He grew up in extreme poverty – with racially segregated schools and public spaces in rural Arkansas in the 1940s. Like Phiona, he too was unable to attend school regularly, instead working seasonally for a sharecropper alongside his mother, brother and sister from the age of nine just to eat. (Often times they didn’t.) Watching Phiona struggle with the newfound exposure of a life better and beyond what her mother can provide her in Katwe prove to be some of the most heart-wrenching scenes within the film.

51,POLITICS,The 2016 Election is Over!  Trump won. Hamilton did not design the Electoral College for Grand Theft Electoral,"Douglas W. Kmiec, ContributorAmbassador",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/both-candidates-unfit-or-unworthy-what-the-constitution_us_580b2e1ce4b0b1bd89fdb2da,The election is over and the suggestion that the electors can simply disregard the majority of electoral votes pledged to,2016-10-22,<p>Hamilton would not have approved the electoral college as a means of stealing the presidency</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580b300d1b0000522bef8b45.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The election is over and the suggestion that the electors can simply disregard the majority of electoral votes pledged to Mr. Trump and give them to Mrs. Clinton is ridiculous. Prior to the election before anyone achieved a winning majority, it might have been possible for state legislatures to pick new electors who would, in turn, be authorized to pick a third person — neither Trump nor Clinton. Even that proposition is a stretch, since it would call for an acceptance by both houses of Congress of a massive number of so-called “faithless electors” of which there have been only about a dozen in the entire history of the United States. Yes, some people disliked both candidates, but there was ample opportunity to add candidates in the primaries, at the convention, and possibly even during the general election, but after an election? Talk about disrespecting democracy! I doubt very much whether Mrs. Clinton would accept the office under this cloudy scheme. To avoid needless shouting and deception, it would be prudent for her to denounce this effort for what it is: grand theft electoral. As a matter of theory, one can argue that the electoral college is no longer needed because of modern communications. A direct democracy would concentrate campaigns in a few population centers in a few states. Is that good for democracy? All voters on the internet can see for themselves what the founders, and notably Hamilton, thought was necessary to assign to an elite group of electors; that is,ensuring “that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man [or woman] who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.”But the question of reform cannot be a license to use the electoral college to change an already conducted election. The point of the Electoral College is to preserve “the sense of the people,” not subvert it. Moreover, in this time of expanding franchise, do we really want to argue that only a handful of the elite are “capable of analyzing the qualities adopted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice.”It is simply too late in this election to argue that “we the people” are incompetent, or even undecided. The way to indicate indecision is not to hold a national election in which one of the candidates achieves a decisive victory. There is perhaps merit to asking — apart from the concluded 2016 election — whether the electoral college ought to be eliminated by constitutional amendment. There are plenty of academics who can ponder the matter and report to Congress. As a people, we have enough to do, and the new President needs our prayers and constructive thoughts and assistance getting the needs of all Americans, but especially working class Americans, met."
52,POLITICS,Gary Johnson Is Unqualified. Here's Why I Just Voted For Him,"Michael Sitver, Contributor21-year-old writer, developer, and entrepreneur.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-johnson-is-unqualified-heres-why-i-just-voted_us_580be340e4b099c434319745,A lot of friends and family have asked me who I’m supporting this cycle. Today I cast my ballot for Governor Gary Johnson,2016-10-22,<p>Governor Johnson holding a wonderfully hand-made sign.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580be3fa1b0000202cef8c3d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A lot of friends and family have asked me who I’m supporting this cycle.Today I cast my ballot for Governor Gary Johnson. As I filled in the bubble of my yellow absentee ballot, even I was a bit surprised by my choice. I’ve never been much of a fan of Governor Johnson. I don’t see him as a particularly appealing commander-in-chief. I’m 100 percent confident I made the right choice though. To paraphrase Ted Cruz, I voted my conscience.This wasn’t a matter of voting against corruption. This wasn’t about my distrust of Hillary Clinton, or my disgust with the rhetoric of this cycle. This was a matter of deciding what I believe the best path for our country is, what we need, and which candidate’s policies best represents that vision.When the government approaches a problem, it approaches it with a very singular mindset. “Who do we give tax dollars to to temporarily solve this problem?”. It’s the “give-a-man-a-fish” approach, except that giving the man a fish requires collecting 30-40 percent of the fishes from all the other men with fish. Working in government this summer, I saw this fish-giving up close.Temporary solutions become permanent, and spending on entitlements ends up growing 9 percent a year, while the problems they’ve set out to solve get worse.When private industry approaches the same problems, they find real, sustainable solutions. If they don’t, they go out of business.The government’s solution to affordable housing is to use taxpayer dollars to build government-owned housing and pay people’s rent. Public housing spending is inefficient, the waiting lists are long, and they don’t come close to meeting the demand for housing assistance. And yet, when private sector companies like AirBnb help hundreds of thousands of Americans pay their rent, without using taxpayer dollars, Democratic administrations try to run them into the ground.Government’s answer to transportation is the taxi and the bus. Taxis are low-quality, expensive, and corrupt. Buses and trains are more affordable, but only because they’re heavily subsidized by your tax dollars. And the experience still sucks.Uber, Lyft, and dozens of companies have addressed this problem. They’ve made transportation more affordable, more comfortable, and more equitable (Ubers go places where taxi drivers won’t).They’ve provided thousands of college students, teachers, and immigrants with well-paying work on their own schedule. They’ve lowered pollution by taking wasteful cars off the road, and subsidized car purchases for many who couldn’t otherwise afford one. They’ve even lowered drunk-driving deaths. Ridesharing companies have done everything that Democrats aspire to do, without taxpayer dollars. And yet, Hillary Clinton’s answer, and the Democratic party’s answer to ridesharing has been to attack these companies, and to sue and regulate them out of existence.Even as cybersecurity becomes as pressing a threat as terrorism, candidates from both major parties demand that private-sector companies compromise the security of their users.We have seen in the last 10 years just how much private-sector innovation can make life better. The “gig” economy can provide for flexible, well-paying work. Driverless cars can prevent up to 90 percent of traffic fatalities, and make transportation more affordable. New medical procedures can restore senses and motion, and cure diseases that humans have fought unsuccessfully for thousands of years, but under either of the two major candidates, I worry that the cumbersome regulations they will enact will stop these innovators in their tracks.Democratic candidates love to lecture on “clean energy”, but the way in which the government uses tax dollars and regulations to pick winners and losers in the energy industry has set us back years and years.The reality that we as a country need to come to grips with is that government cannot solve problems, no matter how much tax money they take from the American people in income taxes, sales taxes, and random single-purpose taxes. This is not just a conservative position. In many of his talks, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, one of the most well-known “social entrepreneurs” in the world, says just that. We need to fix the broken, corrupt “tax code”, but we also need to let Americans decide where more of their earnings go. The amount of your money government spends right now is neither normal, nor just.In education, we need serious unfunded mandate reform. We need to restore power to administrators and teachers at the local level. One of the reasons that American schools are struggling is that, in order to qualify for the government funding that they rely on, they’re forced to comply with ridiculous, cumbersome and costly regulations. We need to empower schools to spend more time thinking about their students, and less time thinking about whether they comply with federal guidelines for funding.In other areas of life, we need to protect or restore choice to the individual. How you use the internet, what sort of insurance you buy, what you write, or who you marry should be your business, not government’s.Governor Johnson calls for a very different approach to all of these issues than his opponents. He supports individual liberties, free trade, removing burdensome regulatory gobbledygoop, and getting big-government out of your life. He calls for significant spending cuts across the board, and lower taxes for all Americans.I disagree significantly with Governor Johnson on foreign policy. I think that our strong role in foreign affairs has served us well, and that the United States needs to continue to lead abroad. When our allies are threatened, we need to defend them. These are fundamental values of our nation.That said, we’ve tried 80 years of managed bureaucracy, and it hasn’t worked. We’ve tried and failed to solve our country’s problems by taxing more and spending more. Now, it’s imperative that we learn from our mistakes, move on, and restore the liberties that our forefathers demanded, a “government of the people, by the people, and for the people”.This election will not yield the change I think we so desperately need, but I hope that by the collective vote of every disgruntled American out there, we can start a conversation about what is really, truly broken in this amazing country, and the path to recovery."
53,LATINO VOICES,Jorge Ramos Exposes Hate Groups' Rise In The Age Of Trump,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-jorge-ramos-found-after-talking-to-hate-groups-in-the-age-of-trump_us_580ad634e4b000d0b156e8f4,The journalist finds in a new film that the GOP nominee has emboldened racists -- and warns it'll take years to repair the damage.,2016-10-22,The moment security began attempting to remove Jorge Ramos from Donald Trump's Iowa press conference in August 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580b0d401b0000582cef8b30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Go back to Univision.” That’s how Donald Trump answered award-winning journalist Jorge Ramos’ question on the specifics of how the GOP presidential hopeful planned to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants from the U.S.Shortly after Trump’s outburst, security physically removed the Mexican-American anchor for Univision and Fusion from the August 2015 event.The incident sparked the idea for Ramos’ upcoming documentary “Hate Rising,” for which he traveled across the U.S. to speak with white supremacy groups, including Neo Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members, as well as Muslims, Latinos and children who have been victims of what The Southern Poverty Law Center calls “the Trump effect.”Trump used his “Go back to Univision” remarks as code for “Go back to Mexico” or “Go back to your country of origin,” Ramos told The Huffington Post. “And just a few seconds later, one of his followers told me, ‘Get out of my country,’” the journalist recalled. “To which I responded, ‘Well, this is also my country, I’m also a U.S. citizen.’ And that’s when I realized that hate is contagious.”Ramos then spent nine months “following hate” across the country. He found people “who are afraid and angry about what is happening in the United States,” he said. “And what’s happening is that white will eventually be a minority in this country in 2044, and they hate that,” Ramos added.The Catherine Tambini-directed documentary will premiere in a dual-broadcast on Univision and Fusion Sunday. Ahead of its debut, Ramos spoke to HuffPost about his views on hate in America and how this election has shaped this country for years to come. How would you define “the Trump effect?”“The Trump effect” is full of negative connotations and it’s twofold. On one hand, it has given permission to white supremacists and Neo-Nazi groups to express their biases and prejudices. And on the other hand, it has created a lot of fear and anxiety among children. It may surprise many Americans that these hate groups exist in the U.S. and that there can be such a disconnect between living in a diverse city and elsewhere in the United States. It can feel like two different countries. You’re right. Prejudice and hate is all over the place, if you live in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago you might not notice. Just travel a few minutes away from major airports ― which is exactly what I did ― in Texas or in Ohio or in Minneapolis and it’s there. Hate is right there.It’s surprising that these white supremacist groups would let a Latino immigrant, and a prominent one at that, into their space. How did you get them to agree to speak to you? You know, they didn’t ― and that’s an interesting fact. If we had told them that it was going to be me doing the interview they wouldn’t have accepted. However, what happened is that I was working with the director of the documentary, Catherine Tambini. She’s an American and many of the white supremacist groups thought that they were going to meet with her, not with me. And right at the end, I ended up sitting down and doing the interview. But they didn’t know they were going to be talking to me, otherwise it would have been impossible.Was there something specific that shocked you or made you feel unsafe while working on “Hate Rising”?I met one person in Texas, he’s an imperial wizard of the KKK in Texas, and he told me that he was superior to me simply because of the color of his skin. Simply because he’s white and I’m Latino. I had never experienced anything like that. And he didn’t want to touch me. He made the move to shake my hand, then he pulled back his hand.In Ohio, I went to a meeting of Neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and I didn’t feel comfortable saying a single word for almost three hours because it was not a safe space to be an immigrant.Now that you’ve delved into that world, what are your thoughts on how Trump has affected the rise of hate groups across the country? Everybody has prejudices and biases, and those biases and prejudices were only expressed in their homes. And then suddenly came Donald Trump on June 16, 2015, and he has emboldened all those groups and he has allowed all those prejudices to come and be expressed under the excuse that they were politically incorrect. And they were politically incorrect for a reason ― because they hurt, because they damage the core of the country, because they are against the possibility of dialogue.How do you see this rise in hate affecting the country, far beyond the election? Honestly, I think this is one of the most important elections of our generation and regardless of who wins, the damage has been done already ― and it’ll take years to repair what has happened when you have a candidate who attacks immigrants, Muslims, people with disabilities, veterans, women. It’s really damaging, it affects the core of the country.It is a very dangerous moment that we are living right now. Everybody is going to remember that and I think we ― you and me and all the journalists and all the voters and politicians ― will be judged by how we reacted to Donald Trump. “Hate Rising” airs Sunday, October 23 at 10 p.m. EST on Fusion and Univision. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Donate to support Muslims, refugees, women, Latinos and other groups Donald Trump has insulted.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

At least two civilians died from exposure to sulfur dioxide released by the fire, south of Mosul, according to Ahmed Younis, a 29-year-old medical assistant in nearby Qayyarah. More than 100 people sought medical attention over the incident on Friday, Younis added.American and Iraqi officials voiced concern last week over the hardliners using chemical weapons during the battle for Mosul, Iraqi’s second largest city. The U.S.-backed, Iraqi-led operation ― the largest such operation since 2003 ― could see ISIS driven out of their last main stronghold in Iraq. The battle could take months, U.S. military officials estimate.Iraqi forces drove ISIS fighters out of the area on Friday, but the militants are destroying as much as possible on their retreat, as part of a brutal scorched earth campaign. The group routinely detonates explosives, rigs booby traps and sets alight oil wells, buildings and farmland as it withdraws from areas.“There was a big cloud [of smoke] even in Qayyarah,” 30-year-old Hossam, a civilian living in the nearby town of Qayyarah, told The WorldPost late Friday. “We couldn’t breathe well.” U.S. troops based at Qayyarah Airfield West, next to the town of Qayyarah roughly 18 miles from Mishraq, are wearing gas masks at their own discretion, according to a U.S. military source there reached by phone. The U.S.-led coalition has targeted key Islamic State chemical weapons sites over the past year in an attempt to curb their chemical capabilities. The United States military and other coalition countries have trained partner forces in the event of such attacks, though Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have said that they don’t have enough gas masks. ISIS still has only rudimentary chemical weapons capabilities, despite recent casualties in places like Taza, just south of Kirkuk, where some civilians are still physically and emotionally scarred from a mustard attack in March, military and chemical experts say.Such weapons pose a “dreaded risk,” Gregory Koblentz, associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University, told The WorldPost last week. It’s a “risk that people instinctively react to with a high degree of fear and panic because it is invisible, insidious, and indiscriminate.” “Even if they only kill a few, they will terrify large numbers,” he added. Chemical experts have reportedly been dispatched to Mishraq sulfur plant and firefighters were still trying to contain the blaze as of Saturday afternoon.

At least two civilians died from exposure to sulfur dioxide released by the fire, south of Mosul, according to Ahmed Younis, a 29-year-old medical assistant in nearby Qayyarah. More than 100 people sought medical attention over the incident on Friday, Younis added.American and Iraqi officials voiced concern last week over the hardliners using chemical weapons during the battle for Mosul, Iraqi’s second largest city. The U.S.-backed, Iraqi-led operation ― the largest such operation since 2003 ― could see ISIS driven out of their last main stronghold in Iraq. The battle could take months, U.S. military officials estimate.Iraqi forces drove ISIS fighters out of the area on Friday, but the militants are destroying as much as possible on their retreat, as part of a brutal scorched earth campaign. The group routinely detonates explosives, rigs booby traps and sets alight oil wells, buildings and farmland as it withdraws from areas.“There was a big cloud [of smoke] even in Qayyarah,” 30-year-old Hossam, a civilian living in the nearby town of Qayyarah, told The WorldPost late Friday. “We couldn’t breathe well.” U.S. troops based at Qayyarah Airfield West, next to the town of Qayyarah roughly 18 miles from Mishraq, are wearing gas masks at their own discretion, according to a U.S. military source there reached by phone. The U.S.-led coalition has targeted key Islamic State chemical weapons sites over the past year in an attempt to curb their chemical capabilities. The United States military and other coalition countries have trained partner forces in the event of such attacks, though Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have said that they don’t have enough gas masks. ISIS still has only rudimentary chemical weapons capabilities, despite recent casualties in places like Taza, just south of Kirkuk, where some civilians are still physically and emotionally scarred from a mustard attack in March, military and chemical experts say.Such weapons pose a “dreaded risk,” Gregory Koblentz, associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University, told The WorldPost last week. It’s a “risk that people instinctively react to with a high degree of fear and panic because it is invisible, insidious, and indiscriminate.” “Even if they only kill a few, they will terrify large numbers,” he added. Chemical experts have reportedly been dispatched to Mishraq sulfur plant and firefighters were still trying to contain the blaze as of Saturday afternoon. It could be days until the fire is under control.Civilians in Qayyarah are covering their mouths and noses with wet cloths and trying to seal their homes, according to locals.

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner at Waldorf Astoria October 20, 2016 in New York, New York. / AFP / Brendan Smialowski (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8314e2500008b013a1dcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So we had the final presidential debate this week, and Donald Trump went right on being Donald Trump, which should have surprised precisely no one by now. Our subtitle today, of course, refers to the two most amusing (or horrifying, take your pick...) things Trump said during the debate. Since then, both ""bad hombres"" and ""nasty women"" are trending online. Hey, when bad hombres and nasty women unite, anything could happen, right?Maybe this, together with all the dark talk of ""rigged elections"" from Trump will finally provide a dash of enthusiasm for Clinton, here at the homestretch -- it'd certainly be a fitting end to the most bizarre presidential campaign of everyone's lifetimes. From the New York Times:""Nasty Woman"" T-shirts began selling on the internet. Naral Pro-Choice America advertised ""NastyWoman"" stickers.... Streams of Janet Jackson's 1986 hit ""Nasty"" increased 250 percent on Spotify after the debate, according to a Spotify spokesman. More than 8,000 people had taken up the phrase on Twitter by midafternoon, wielding it as a badge of honor.Nastiness aside, last week had to be divided into ""pre-debate"" and ""post-debate."" The most prophetic article of the week came from Aaron Blake at the Washington Post, who -- before the debate, mind you -- was already noticing all of Trump's ""rigged"" talk. In an article titled ""The GOP Is Trying To Put Out A Rigged Election Fire That It Helped Start,"" Blake placed the blame for this phenomenon exactly where it belongs: at the feet of the entire Republican Party.A big problem for Republicans in all of this, though, is that they are fighting against the very same perceptions they have spent years promoting.Blake then discusses the charges of media bias, concluding: ""Trump's argument today is merely taking that idea to its logical extreme."" The piece finishes with:But they've done such a great job pressing claims of voter fraud and a biased media that many of them aren't just pushing back against Trump but, in a very real sense, against themselves.We wrote more than a week ago on a similar theme (although using different examples). Republicans truly have no one to blame but themselves for Trump and all he stands for.But to get back to the pre-debate wrap-up, last week the Post ran a story about possible voter intimidation (and even suppression) happening under the guise of a voter fraud investigation in Mike Pence's home state of Indiana:The voter registration applications flagged by election officials in Marion and Hendricks counties ""contained minor inaccuracies like missing Zip codes and area codes,"" [Patriot Majority USA Director Craig] Varoga said. ""Based on the fact that they found (problems in) 10 forms out of tens of thousands... to launch a statewide investigation into a voter registration program is a political agenda.""Astoundingly, Pence then made the round of all the Sunday morning talk shows -- mere days after this article ran, and none of the hosts asked him a single question about it. Want to know why people think the mainstream media is pathetic? Exhibit A. This wasn't a story from some fringe website or even from a biased news source -- it was from the Washington-freakin'-Post, and yet nobody brought it up when they had the chance. Pathetic.Trump, out on the campaign trail before the debate, spent his time calling for Hillary Clinton to be drug tested before debating, and tearing up a TelePrompTer for fun and exercise. We are truly through the looking glass, folks. More and more women keep publicly accusing Trump of sexual misconduct, as well. Trump supporters, though, are still confident, perhaps dangerously so.Let's see, how is Trump's campaign team doing? Well, they just lost their political director, who is going to ""step back"" from the campaign ""for personal reasons."" His job ""was to focus on Trump's efforts on the ground in those battleground states,"" so that's probably going to hurt.How is Trump's campaign team doing out in those battleground states? Well, they just severed ties with the state Republican Party chairman in Ohio, and they had to get rid of one of their own in Virginia as well. So, the battleground states seem to be going swimmingly for Trump.Let's see, what else? Hillary Clinton has a huge cash advantage, heading into the homestretch. So she's going to spend some of it in Arizona, where Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders just appeared for her. She's got dozens of offices in the state already, the polls show her in the lead in this very red state, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio is polling down 15 points against his Democratic opponent. So Team Clinton smells a possible pickup, which would be historic.Senator John McCain, already seeing ""Madam President Clinton"" on the horizon, casually admitted this week that of course Republicans would be united against any Clinton Supreme Court pick. This will make it so much easier for Chuck Schumer to get rid of the filibuster for such appointments next January, should the Democrats take the Senate back.President Obama has decided what he's going to focus on after he leaves office, and it's a pretty worthy idea. He and Eric Holder are going to fight gerrymandering. This includes such things as pushing for redistricting reform and improving Democrats' position in statehouses across the country in anticipation of the 2020 Census and House of Representatives reapportionment. Democrats got their clocks cleaned in 2010, which is a big reason why Republicans have such a stranglehold on the House. Don't believe this is true? From the article: ""In 2014, Republicans got 52 percent of the votes but won 57 percent of the seats."" In many states that voted for Obama, the majority of the House delegation is Republicans, as well. Fighting such gerrymandering will be Obama's main political objective for the next few years, with an organization dedicated solely to redistricting reform. As noted, a worthy cause indeed.OK, enough of that. On to the debate. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump debated for the final time in Las Vegas Wednesday night, and it was simultaneously the best night for Clinton and the best night for Trump. However, because Clinton's best is so obviously far, far beyond anything Trump could manage, she emerged the clear winner. Other than the ""hombre/nasty woman"" quotable lines from Trump, the debate boiled down to one simple statement Trump made: he was taking back his commitment (given in a previous debate with Clinton) that he'd abide by the election results. So, looks like no entertaining concession speech will be forthcoming late on the night of November 8th!Condemnation of Trump's comments was swift, and came from all corners. Leading the pack are Republicans worried about their election chances, naturally, including Senators John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, and Ron Johnson. McCain had the most pertinent experience to draw upon, of course, and his voice was the clearest: ""A concession isn't just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader's first responsibility."" Also important: keeping Sarah Palin away from the microphone during the concession speech, of course.Notably absent in this chorus was either GOP congressional leader, as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell went into bunker mode, and kept their heads down all week. For Ryan it was probably a wise choice, as he had already been booed (with a ""Paul Ryan sucks!"" chant, no less) at a campaign event he did recently with Trump in Green Bay.But perhaps the most stunning voice to denounce Trump was Maine's governor, Paul LePage. This is a guy who, previous to Trump's arrival on the Republican political scene, had been in the running for ""craziest GOP elected official in the country"" -- in fact, he almost seems to be proud of this dubious honor. LePage, after seeing the debate, said:It's a stupid comment. I mean, come on, get over yourself. Donald, take your licks, and let's move on four years.Wow. When you've lost Paul LePage -- when even he's saying ""get over yourself"" -- then your campaign is in a world of trouble.Also bailing on Donald Trump was Michael Steele, who told an audience celebrating (!) the 40th anniversary of Mother Jones magazine: ""I will not be voting for Trump."" He becomes the third ex-GOP chairman to refuse to support Trump. As well as all their living ex-presidents. But inquiring minds want to know, what the heck was Michael Steele doing at a Mother Jones celebration? Doesn't seem like his type of bash, if you've ever read the magazine.Steele didn't mince any words, either, saying that Trump had ""captured that racist underbelly, that frustration, that angry underbelly of American life and gave voice to that,"" and admitting ""I was damn near puking during the debates."" Boy, with party-members like these, who needs Democratic enemies?OK, let's check in with the experts. Steve Schmidt, one of the most savvy Republican Party strategists around, is predicting Trump won't have a leg to stand on if he decides to call the election rigged. Why not? Because:The question is, how close will Clinton get to 400 electoral votes? She'll be north of 350, and she's trending towards 400 -- and the trend line is taking place in very red states like Georgia, Texas and Arizona.Hoo boy. This is a Republican strategist saying this, with two whole weeks to go. Non-partisan election-watchers are predicting pretty much the same thing. The well-respected Stu Rothenberg just wrote an opinion piece titled: ""Trump's Path To An Electoral College Victory Isn't Narrow. It's Non-Existent.""The mocking has even begun, from the left. Want to bet who Trump's going to blame his epic loss on? Keep this link handy, because it has a dandy little chart of all of Trump's conspiracies (and this was drawn before the debate, mind you) to pick from. Why, it could be anybody! Because as we all know, Trump's not going to take one iota of the blame himself.Is the election depressing you? You certainly aren't alone. So here are two final items to cheer everyone up. First, legalization of recreational marijuana has hit the highest point in public opinion polling that it ever has -- a full 6 out of 10 Americans think the War On Weed should end now, totally and completely. This is an election issue, the article helpfully explains, for a big reason. Full legalization is on the ballot in California (with 40 million residents) as well as four other states:If the Golden State, Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada all vote ""yes"" next month, almost one-quarter of the U.S. population will soon be living in a state where recreational marijuana is legal -- up dramatically from the current 5 percent of the population that now does.So get out and vote, stoners!Finally, for everyone depressed at the depth of nastiness this election has sunk to, we have a cheerful and uplifting message from our neighbors to the north. Check out the video Canadians just sent us all, to convince us that America is already great. We think we speak for all Americans in saying: ""Thanks, eh? That was just what we needed!""There was one grim piece of news this week, as a Republican campaign office in North Carolina got firebombed this week. Anyone -- from any political persuasion -- needs to condemn such acts of political terrorism strongly, of course, and you can add our voice to that chorus. Violence is simply unacceptable in the political arena, no matter how nasty it gets.But we did want to give an Honorable Mention to a group of Democrats who took it upon themselves to raise some money to help pay for repairs. They set a goal of $10,000, which they reached within a few hours, and turned off the donations after hitting $13,000. This is Democrats helping Republicans in the spirit of condemning violence, so it was a silver lining to a very ugly incident.But the rest of this section is going to be pretty short and sweet, because we are handing Hillary Clinton our Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week for her debate performance, which was superb. The reason this section's going to be short is that the entire talking points section is a recap of the debate, so there's not much else to say about it here.[It is our standing policy not to provide links to candidate web pages, so you'll have to search Hillary Clinton's site on your own to let her know you appreciate her efforts.]Hillary Clinton deserves at least a (Dis-)Honorable Mention this week as well, if the WikiLeaked account of her talking about environmentalists (whom she snarkily told: ""Get a life"") and Bernie Sanders supporters turns out to be accurate.We really don't think all the leaks have damaged Clinton with the voters so far, and our best guess why this is so is either that Trump is sucking all the oxygen from the room (as he's been doing all along) with scandals that are much juicier and more prurient, or that opinions about Clinton are already ""baked in the cake"" and aren't going to change anyone's vote at this point. Clinton-lovers will discount the stories as Russian lies, Clinton-haters weren't going to vote for her anyway, and the Bernie Sanders supporters already suspected Clinton has held this attitude all along -- the emails are nothing more than confirmation of these long-held suspicions. With no evidence to back this claim up, though, we think that the Bernie people who are ready to vote for Hillary went through the process of accepting Clinton for who she is during and just after the national convention.Of course, if Donald Trump weren't being such a clown on a daily basis, the email leaks might have hurt Hillary more -- if they were the only thing the press had to talk about, in other words. But again, that's just speculation.But our true winners of the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week are Scott Foval and Robert Creamer. Nope, we had never heard of them, either. Here's the story about how they got stung:Scott Foval and Robert Creamer, two little-known but influential Democratic political operatives, have left their jobs after video investigations by James O'Keefe's Project Veritas Action found Foval entertaining dark notions about how to win elections. Foval was laid off Monday by Americans United for Change, where he had been national field director; Creamer announced Tuesday night that he was ""stepping back"" from the work he was doing for the unified Democratic campaign for Hillary Clinton.For getting caught talking about dirty tricks, both men deserve this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award, at the very least.[Since they just got fired and are now private citizens, our policy is not to provide contact information for such persons, sorry.]Volume 413 (10/21/16)Before we dig in to the talking points, we have a program note for everyone. This column will not appear next weekend, because even though we're deep into election season, it will also be the last calendar day I'll be posting before Hallowe'en. Since Mondays are now ""Electoral Math"" column days, I can't actually post my yearly spooky column on Hallowe'en itself, so that's what you've got to look forward to next Friday. Fair warning, and prepare to be scared silly by next week's column. And I've already done last year's Hallowe'en column on Trump and Hillary, so I'm going to have to get extra-creative this year. Stay tuned! Since it's Hallowe'en and all, I can ironically say: ""Same bat time, same bat channel!""Speaking of amusing slogans from television shows, we do have one note to add to the excerpts from Clinton's debate performance, simply because we have a rather juvenile sense of humor. Clinton, talking about the economy, said the following: ""So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down."" This immediately brought to mind the scene from The Simpsons ""Treehouse of Horror VII"" where one of the aliens (Kang and Kodos), disguised as Hillary's husband Bill, during a presidential debate, uttered the immortal line: ""I say, we must move forward, not backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!"" Hey, we warned you we were about to get juvenile....With that out of the way (ahem), let's get to the more serious parts of the debate. Hillary Clinton brought her chef's knives to this debate, and promptly filleted Trump up one side and down the other, which is why we're running such an extended amount of the transcript today. Hillary had her best debate night yet this week, and it's worth taking a look back at all the different ways she sliced Trump up.Hillary Clinton's Best Debate MomentsClinton started off with an excellent answer on what she'd look for in a Supreme Court justice, which is certainly worth reading for anyone who intends to vote for her for that very reason. But we've already got a ton of material here to work with, so you'll have to look it up yourself on the debate transcript (which takes far less time to read than watching the whole debate).The first truly notable moment was when Hillary made a case she should have been strongly making from the start: Donald Trump uses undocumented workers, so how can anyone believe anything he says on the issue? Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.Trump, tellingly, didn't even attempt to answer this charge, likely because he knows it is both true and easily provable.In the segment on the economy, Chris Wallace tossed both candidates a softball, essentially asking them why their economic plan would create more jobs than their opponent's. Now, for some context, for the past week or so, a certain groupthink had been emerging from the punditocracy. All the inside-the-Beltway types decided that what Clinton needed to do during this debate was to ""make the case"" for why she wanted to be president. This is rather jaw-dropping, because that's exactly what she's been doing for months, out on the campaign trail, but whatever. In any case, I thought her answer to the jobs question was her best summation of why she wants to be president, and (hopefully) will shut up all those loose lips at the Georgetown cocktail parties. [This was just previous to the amusing Simpsons-like quote, we should mention.]Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.At the end of the back-and-forth on the economy, Clinton scored a great shot, in a line she should have been using prominently in all the debates. Make it personal!There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald. He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.Once again, Trump had no answer to any of these charges, because he knows they are true. Instead, his argument devolved into: ""You should have stopped me by changing all the laws!"" He fundamentally misunderstands the role of First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State, and insisted that Hillary Clinton should have singlehandedly revamped the tax laws during her ""30 years"" in public life. Clinton was ready for this, and pounced. This was one of the best moments in the entire debate for her, in fact.HILLARY CLINTON: He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.Hillary Clinton obviously watched the recent PBS documentary, which presented both her life and Donald Trump's in exactly the same format -- switching back and forth on the timeline to show what each was doing during each decade. The documentary was well worth watching, but Clinton's answer distilled it into a few paragraphs. Nicely done!Wallace then asked Trump directly about all those women who had been making sexual misconduct and sexual assault charges against him. Trump insisted that they had all been ""debunked,"" despite having no evidence whatsoever to back this claim up.Clinton was obviously ready for this exchange, too. Once again, the most effective weapon to use against Trump is his own words, quoted back to him.CLINTON: At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.This led to the most-mocked moment of the night, when Donald Trump stated: ""Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody."" The crowd responded with: ""(LAUGHTER)"" prompting Wallace to shush them.Clinton then spiked the football in the end zone and did a dance. She tied Trump's treatment of women to his treatment of, well, everyone.CLINTON: Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it's not just about women. He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.Wallace then prompted Trump's biggest mistake of the evening -- one that is still reverberating throughout the country -- when he responded: ""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense."" after being asked whether he'd accept the election's results. Since Trump had been focusing on many claims that the election was about to be ""rigged,"" Clinton was once again ready to pounce.CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.This may have been the moment when Hillary Clinton absolutely put the election away, folks. But there were two final zingers that are also worth pointing out. The first came when Trump tried to use his ""Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment"" line, in an attempt to woo Bernie voters to his side. Clinton answered back with the answer she really should have had ready all along.CLINTON: Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president. And he has said...And finally, the biggest jaw-dropping moment ever witnessed in a modern presidential debate by a Republican. Sure, the whole ""election's going to be stolen from me"" thing was astonishing, but this was downright shocking. Hillary got Trump to admit something no Republican has ever (to our knowledge) said in a debate since at least 1980. Clinton teed it up:You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage.And then Trump, a few responses later, just flat-out admitted something that will surely guarantee to keep a large number of Republicans from voting for him:Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.Badmouthing Saint Ronald of Reagan? With tens of millions of Republican voters watching? Somebody please explain why, exactly, some Democrats were afraid to let Hillary Clinton debate so much during the primaries? If she can get a Republican to admit he disagreed with Ronald Reagan on national television, then we have to conclude she's one of the best debaters we've ever seen.[That's it for this week, for anyone who made it all the way to the end of this tome -- see you all again in two weeks, for our final Friday Talking Points before the election!]Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"
58,WOMEN,The Woman Who Helped Prove Females Aren't Too Fragile to Run Competitively,"Skirting the Rules, ContributorA societal movement that enlists women through fiction (for in...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-woman-who-helped-prov_b_12595710.html,,2016-10-22,2016-10-22-1477104849-3821981-STR_watermarks_KathrineSwitzer1170x500.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-22-1477104849-3821981-STR_watermarks_KathrineSwitzer1170x500-thumb.jpg," It may seem crazy to think that less than 50 years ago, women were not permitted to officially run the Boston Marathon. All that changed in 1967 when Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to wear a bib number while running that famous road race. She later helped pave the way for women to run competitively in the Olympic Games. Kathrine Switzer, athlete, activist, and author, was a 20-year-old student at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University when she decided--after proving to her track and field coach that she could run the 42-kilometer or 26-mile distance--to sign up for the Boston Marathon. She did so using her initials, K.V. Switzer, not to pull the wool over organizers' eyes, but because that's how she always signed her name. When marathon official Jock Semple spotted her on the course, he tried to physically stop her--or at least remove her bib, number 261. Switzer's team mates blocked him from succeeding. In that moment, Switzer chose to not let the fear of what had just occurred stop her from making it to the finish line. ""I had to do it and no matter what, I had to finish the race to prove that women could do the distance and deserved to be in the Boston Marathon,"" she says, explaining what motived her to keep going. But these feelings also explain what she felt after, when she decided to keep fighting for women's rights to run long distances in races of all kinds, just like the guys. One of those fights was getting women to participate in the Olympic Games' long-distance races and the marathons. Switzer was faced with many obstacles when trying to get the women's marathon within the Olympic Games, yet she found creative ways to gracefully skirt around the traditional rules in order to create new ones. ""People said it was impossible, that women couldn't run and wouldn't run. The solution was to offer women the opportunities to run in a non-intimidating and welcoming way, like women's-only events so they could experience running with other women. What we did was have thousands and thousands of women turn up to run, which proved to the International Olympic Committee that women could run, wanted to run, and had both the talent and the international representation. At the same time, we had medical evidence from really forward-thinking doctors to prove that, instead of people believing that running was dangerous, running was very healthy and mentally empowering for [women]. It gave them a lot of self-confidence. Women were naturally suited for endurance and stamina."" These were Switzer's words as she explained to Skirting the Rules one of the many efforts she made to get women into the Olympics. She separates these efforts into two occasions: Tokyo and Brazil. In November 1979, a thousand women turned up to an event set up by Switzer to show the Running Confederation in Tokyo, Japan that women wanted to participate in marathons and races when they were prohibited from doing so. Brazil happened after when the executive of that country's federation said it was not socially acceptable for women to run. Switzer said that women could and wanted to. Switzer used the power of the collective to prove them wrong. ""The federation told me that a marathon would not be successful, they told me: 'Well, maybe you'll get a hundred women.' We had more than 10,000 women show up to our event, so the evidence was overwhelming. Women themselves spoke up, turned up, and changed the odds,"" Switzer says.Moreover, thanks to Switzer, who was then the director of the Women's Sports Foundation, the first ever women-only marathon in the US, the Avon International Marathon, was held in Atlanta, Georgia in 1978. More than 250 women showed up from more than 25 countries. The idea that women did not want to run was disproved again in that moment. Still, it was not over--Switzer had to continue lobbying for years in order to help get the first women's marathon to happen in 1984 at the Los Angeles Olympics.Today, as we saw with the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, women can do what men can do. Allyson Felix, 30, made the fastest time in the 400-meter sprint during this year's U.S. Olympic trials, even with a sprained ankle. Caster Semanya from South Africa's Olympic team is still unbeaten since 2009 in the 800-meter run with the best time in the event, as well. Of course, she won gold this year. Kathrine Switzer and her organization, 261 Fearless--named after her infamous Boston Marathon bib number--are helping create a ""community of women who are becoming empowered together and helping women overcome fear through the vehicle of running.""  *Reporting by Sophia Melissa Caraballo Learn the Secret for Maximizing Your Time and Energy: Take the QuizIs High-Functioning Anxiety the New Impostor Syndrome?What Tracking My Time for a Year Taught Me About Productivity"

One might wonder what happens in the cultural void they leave behind.The fall of the Roman Empire, spreading from North Africa to England and from Spain to Turkey left big parts of Europe in the dark for a thousand years. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that sanitation and medical services returned to the level of pre 300 AD Rome.It is not everyday we experience this same magnitude of collapse, however perhaps some insights can be gained from the more recent rise and fall of the Soviet Union. Only sixty years ago, the Soviet Union crushed the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and Europe changed dramatically. The event is captivatingly described in Klaudia Kovacs's Klaudia Kovacs's documentary Torn from the Flag Torn from the Flag. While Hungary's occupation continued for another thirty-three years (a generation and a half in human terms) the effect of the occupation continues on until today. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Hungary, like all Eastern European countries, experienced a crash of their communist regime. In the beginning, this led to euphoria regarding the country's future but things turned bleak within just a few years.For us to understand the difficulties Hungary is still going through today, we need to analyze how the occupation impacted a nation that already had a history of oppression. Hungary's birth rate dropped dramatically and alcohol consumption went up six hundred percent. Their suicide rate increased and, during the 1980's, it was the highest in the world! These statistics give one a glimpse on how debilitating the occupying system felt to those who lived there.Trauma has long-term effects, and one cannot help but think that there might be a link to this recent statistic. In 2012, Hungary was the ""Most Miserable Country"" in the world. The Russian Federation, Estonia, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia also made the list. (Source: USNews.com) Eastern European countries are the most recent in experiencing the departure of suppression. African nations experienced these transitions after World War II, going though a period of withdrawal and an attempt at self-reliance. Just before these nations achieved liberation, countries such as Korea and China had undergone decades of Japanese occupation.Occupation by a dominating culture is therefore much more debilitating than what can be observed by the naked eye. Previously occupied countries struggle with the cultural trauma caused by their humiliating defeats. They experience oppression and have difficulties in forgiving their oppressors, which often plants the seed for future conflicts, such as the flawed peace treaties of World War I later setting the stage for World War II.America's recent occupation of several middle eastern nations, whatever their intention, is disrupting proud, ancient cultures and effectively preparing the soil for generations of discontent with the western powers. A backlash, expressed in clothing, grooming and contempt for objects expressing western ideals is the first step of a process back to normality that may take generations.Special thanks to Klaudia Kovacs for co-writing and researching this article"
60,IMPACT,Human Rights Abuses Escalate at DAPL Prayer Services in North Dakota,"Georgianne Nienaber, ContributorWriter and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/human-rights-abuses-escal_b_12599380.html,,2016-10-22,2016-10-22-1477139357-4185944-brutality_MyKennah_Lott.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-22-1477139357-4185944-brutality_MyKennah_Lott-thumb.jpg,"""It makes me so sad. I want to feel like what we have been fighting for over the past hundred years is our dignity and that we as Indigenous people will be accorded full human rights. This is not the case in Morton County. The endless aggression, strip searching and attempts to humiliate our people are a continuation of 160 years of this. Morton County and North Dakota live in a colonial/military/pre- civil rights, old boy, paradigm. This is evidenced throughout North Dakota in the destruction of land and the desecration and oppression of native people and women. I pray for healing for my people and our land."" ~~Winona LaDuke The photo Winona LaDuke references is stunning because of the brutality it conveys. A 19- year-old Arapaho girl is lying in the mud under a prayer tipi. She is not alone. A Morton County, North Dakota deputy is on top of her with one knee pressed against her neck and the other pushed into her lower back. The girl's face is forced into the dirt by the weight of his body. He might outweigh her by a hundred pounds. You cannot see her face, in fact nothing except her flushed nose is visible. An officer from Marathon County, Wisconsin is crouched to the right, watching. Guns, radios, handcuffs, batons and other devices hidden from view in leather pouches hang from the belts of the deputy and the observing officer. The girl has never been in trouble with the law. She is a deeply thoughtful and spiritual person and wants to tell her story, but must wait. Still, there is something she wants to add to this narrative. One of the officers pulled her beanie off her head and threw it to the ground before they flipped her onto her stomach. She is not certain if the officer wanted to get a rise out of her or wanted to intimidate her, but she calls this a vital and important incident and wants it known. She will not be shamed; she will not be a victim. Her spirit is strong. This is what it means to own your life and to tell your story.We will intentionally call this water protector who was participating in the Dakota Access Pipeline prayer service at Standing Rock a girl. Identifying her as woman in this context seems inaccurate and misleading. Nearby, a 51-year-old woman had been watching. Rebecca Kemble, Alderwoman (Alder) from Madison Wisconsin, sees brutality unfold. She was also arrested and slammed into a section of pipeline. Kemble did not realize when she agreed to assist a legal aide attorney and observe police interactions at the ceremony that she would be called upon to be a witness. She would not take the stand in a court of law, that may come later, but on this day she would become a moral witness. ""I saw the Marathon County deputy push her down the hill and slam her body and head into the transport van after this,"" Kemble said in a message.What happened next to the young Arapaho girl is unspeakable in its attempt to humiliate and traumatize. She was hauled to the Morton County jail, strip searched, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, and charged with criminal trespass and engaging in a riot. The girl who was joining the ranks of her elders and ancestors in a violent rite of passage pleaded not guilty and spent the night in jail with Alder Kemble. Kemble is also facing additional charges of criminal trespass, including engaging in a riot, preventing arrest or discharge of other duties and tampering with evidence. The next day both were released on $250 cash bonds and will meet again at a jury trial on January 12. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier is the official who sets the tone for police actions in Morton County North Dakota. He alone determines how prisoners are treated. He holds the authority to enforce humane treatment or encourage cruelty designed to instill fear, humiliation, embarrassment and shame. And shame is the ultimate weapon--utilized by the narcissist in a pitiful attempt to gain control and break the spirit of his victims. In this case, the water protectors at the Dakota Access Pipeline are refusing to be spiritually victimized. At least 140 have been arrested, stripped, and forced to ""squat and cough"" with a voyeuristic officer watching. Why the ""squat and cough?"" The observing officer watches to see if anything is hidden in the rectum of the detainee. The orange jumpsuit is the final insult, designed to remove a sense of individuality.Alder Kemble writes about this experience and its psychological consequences in her blog. She went so far as to ask for advice about what she calls ""an outrage hangover"" on her Facebook page. This is how she explained the feelings she is having. I'm doing ok in the course of daily life. What's happening is that when I talk about what I experienced and witnessed in North Dakota, which I'm doing a lot (sic) (media interviews, reporting back to folks, etc.), I work to center and calm myself, but at some point a small detail strikes me in a new way and I am transformed into a channel for the fury of the ages. The passion rushes through my system leaving me spent.The woman with decades of life experience is having difficulty processing the humiliation and violence condoned by Sheriff Kirchmeier.In a separate conversation Kemble told us that besides being strip searched, she was not allowed to wear her bra under the orange jumpsuit because it had an underwire. She had to unfasten her ""scrawny"" braids and was not allowed to put them back in. The attempt at dehumanization was complete.Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman David Archambault endured the same shame at the hands of deputies and had his braids taken out. He told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! that the officer(s) were looking for weapons hidden in his braids. Like the young Arapaho girl, this was the first time he had ever been arrested. Archambault, like Alder Kemble, is an adult with decades of experience. How in the world is a 19-year-old expected to deal with such violence and humiliation? Is the Sheriff proud of his vicious campaign of aggression and humiliation--a crusade of human rights abuses ordered against a defenseless teenager?Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician at the reservation hospital in Fort Yates has also come forward with video testimony, as has Cody Hall. Readers can watch his testimony below, and learn how even after his release, officers dressed in full riot gear harassed him and his mother as they left the courthouse.Is this legal?Legality is in the eye of the beholder and requires a moral compass.In April 2011 the Supreme Court delivered a split 5-4 decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, New Jersey. The Court was asked to consider if the Fourth Amendment permits jail officers to conduct a ""suspicion-less strip search whenever an individual is arrested, including for minor offenses.""Justice Anthony Kennedy, while writing the majority decision said, ""Courts must defer to the judgment of correctional officials unless the record contains substantial evidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or unjustified response to problems of jail security.""In his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer noted that, ""a search of an individual arrested for a minor offense that does not involve drugs or violence--say a traffic offense, a regulatory offense, an essentially civil matter, or any other such misdemeanor--is an ""unreasonable searc[h]"" forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, unless prison authorities have reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual possesses drugs or other contraband."" The eye of the beholder rests in a Supreme Court majority decision.What, exactly, does the ""judgment of correctional officials"" require in terms of human decency? What if, as in the case of Morton County, law enforcement has shown a consistent overreach in terms of its treatment of the Native American population? Responding to a press request, Rob Keller, Public Information Officer (PIO) for Morton County, supplied the ""Morton County Correctional Center Policies and Procedures."" The document, known as G 400 is unusual in its format. There is no official seal, it is not in a secure PDF format, and a check of the Microsoft Word ""properties"" of authorship simply reads ""Sheriff Dept."" Anyone can change this document, edit the content, redact or add content. So a link is provided here, but it's official legal content is in question.In the section ""Policy"" and under ""Procedure: visual assessment (strip searching),"" there is this directive.The duty correctional officer(s) will not use or permit the use of visual assessments in the Correctional Center as a means of intimidating or embarrassing inmates. Visual assessments will be conducted only as a necessity to monitor the flow of contraband into inmate access areas. There you have it. A moral compass and clear moral leadership is required, and in the case of Morton County, lacking.Is it reasonable to expect that a pediatrician, the Tribal Chairman, the actress Shailene Woodley, an Alderwoman from Wisconsin and a nineteen-year-old girl were harboring contraband?In Morton County's own words, this was clearly a means of intimidating and embarrassing potential inmates. This is also a systematic attempt to bully Native Americans and other supporters of the DAPL opposition.It seems that a narcissist is in control of Morton County and he is an elected official.The Sheriff and the deputies who carry out his orders are all progeny of Narcissus. They pursue their gratification through violent intimidation, and are falling in love with their images as reflected in press conferences where the Sheriff can term a prayer service a riot and get away with it. Voters in Morton County might want to know that The American Psychiatric Association includes the classification of narcissistic personality disorder in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). An intervention might be in order, or at the very least an independent psychological evaluation of law enforcement leading to a recall."
61,ENTERTAINMENT,'Indivisible' at London Film Fest: Italian Cinema Is Alive and Well,"E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indivisible-at-london-fil_b_12599402.html,,2016-10-22,2016-10-22-1477142285-4153666-INDIVISIBLE_girls.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-22-1477142285-4153666-INDIVISIBLE_girls-thumb.jpg,"The opening shots of Edoardo de Angelis' Indivisible set the tone for the poetic fairy tale he's about to tell. Three girls are coming back from a night out, walking on the beach at dawn in skimpy outfits and melting makeup, yet they appear more like mermaids stepping out of the ocean than teenagers on a walk of shame. After De Angelis makes it clear that their presence is only to set the tone for his magnificently private reality film to come, Indivisible takes off as a cinematic poem. A Southern Italian, modern day, feminine ode to the languid tones of The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock that picks up where T. S. Eliot left us off. Perhaps. Just as well, since Eliot himself borrowed some from our Dante's verses for his own work of art. But I promise that's it of quoting lofty from me. Indivisible owes its great beauty and charm to its simple message, which stands at the core of every shot, every bit of dialogue, every moment of the film, from beginning to end. This idea that we carry our loved ones with us wherever we go, which of course De Angelis takes to the absurd with the story of two siamese twins named Viola and Daisy who yearn to be separated, yet love each other unconditionally. But being tied by love and discovering the pain of separation are notions we are all familiar with, even if at times we wish we were not. How often have we thought of lovers far away or family members in distant lands and wished we could be there by their sides, if only for a minute? It's this concept that I was glad to find resonated deep within the answers that De Angelis provided me with, during our interview in London. Indivisible, after having premiered in Venice and played in Toronto, screened there as part of the Italian Cinema at the BFI London Film Festival program, a fantastic showcase of five films from contemporary Italian filmmakers that included Marco Danieli's Worldly Girl and Marco Giovannesi's Fiore.Indivisible owes its belief factor, even when faced with what could seem absurd, to the perfectly constructed story but also its two protagonists, real life twins (though not siamese) Angela and Marianna Fontana. The not-yet-twenty year old sisters come from Casapesenna, a small town not far from where De Angelis shot his film. It is also an area well known to be under the Casalesi clan's grip, the heart of Camorra land, as De Angelis described to me. A land at once helped and destroyed by the Camorra. On a more, perhaps ""political"" note, Oscar winning Italian filmmakers Paolo Sorrentino admitted recently that Indivisible should have been the Foreign Language Italian entry to the Academy Awards this year, instead of the documentary Fuocoammare -- which could have competed in the documentary section instead. It certainly would have raised the stakes for Italian cinema, this courageous choice proposed by Sorrentino, while also multiplying the country's chances of winning the golden statuette. But we'll leave that for a different time, another piece.Catching up with De Angelis turned out to be a highlight of my festival. We sat quietly on the mezzanine floor of the May Fair Hotel, and talked in a frank, easy Italian, that I've taken the liberty to translate myself. I may not always have gotten the perfect words but I tried to do right to the feelings that his answers carried. And I hope I've done justice to the filmmaker's kind tone, his sultry, calm voice with just a hint of the loveliest Neapolitan accent, which always makes me think of my mother's homeland.What was the inspiration for this film? It's such a particular story, so true on the one side and yet almost like a fable. Edoardo De Angelis: The challenge was to take what was apparently a ""high-concept"", and tell it in a profound, deep way. I wanted to make a film about separation, a story of formation and that would describe how, in order to grow at times we must get hurt, we hurt ourselves. To separate from a seemingly indivisible bond, but at times also split from a part of ourselves. What interested me was the theme of separation -- not only physical but also mental. The image of the two siamese twins is perfect for telling through the physical, the anguish of an internal separation.Were the siamese twins the first idea for being able to tell this pain?De Angelis: It wasn't. But it was a bit about me thinking of this theme, and then I met the screenwriter Nicola Guaglianone who suggested two siamese twins, singers in Naples, who provide a living for their entire family with their singing. And this image seemed perfect for telling this theme. The decisive factor came when I saw an old portrait of the twins Daisy and Violet Hilton -- who give names to my characters -- and there were these two girls conjoined at the hip, pretty, and at the same time a bit grotesque. And that blend of attraction and repulsion really seemed to me like a mirror on our entire human existence. Your film is poetic. There is so little poetry in our lives these days and even harder to find poetry in movies perhaps. Do you think cinema can help us understand ""the Other"", what is different from us?De Angelis: I think that cinema creates order out of the chaos of the world. To do it, it uses synthesized images. Every frame to me represents a synthesis of the world. With all those opposing forces of good and evil, the beautiful and the ugly, of the old and the new. I didn't want to tell this story to an Italian, but rather I wanted to tell it to a human being. Every human being has experienced, or will experience separation. Every human being knows that in order to grow, they will have to suffer. They have to pass through an arch of transformation. Animals know it, and yet human beings at times forget this. They need to re-learn it, this concept. Why do they forget it? Because it brings pain -- there is no growth without pain. There is a beautiful quote by Florentine writer Vasco Pratolini, about our first conscious realization being determined by pain. De Angelis: I believe so. I also think it is a simple way to talk about life and I wanted a simple story, I didn't want to tell a complex tale. Because I didn't want the audience to get distracted following the plot. It's almost like a theater play, the way you show your characters. So intimate, so up close. There are moments I almost felt like a peeping tom, peering into something very private.De Angelis: I wanted to penetrate into the private. That's why I used this obscure language. The girls don't even speak a Neapolitan dialect, it's a mysterious language from a little village near Caserta. I wanted them to be incomprehensible to others. Even I had a hard time at first in understanding them. But I discovered that when they used that language they could communicated feelings in a very immediate way. Without any filters, and so I understood that it needed to be their language. Yes, you can read the subtitles, but also if you don't, their language comes as music and it cuts straight to the heart. It's a language of the deepest sentiments and ancestral times. And it's also different from the language used by those around them. It's almost masonic. They are jealous of their world and they guard it through this secret language. I don't know if this is a film that has poetry, I love hearing it from you. But I wanted to find a simple way, the clearest way -- the undeniable sign. That's the poetry. An undeniable sign. But all human beings, we have those signs, no?De Angelis: Yeah and that is my field of research. The human being. We are children of a cinema tradition that is part of our DNA, even theatrical, particularly in Naples. From Eduardo De Filippo, we have inherited everything. The characters, their morals, their desire to be middle class. Their post-war stories, this was an Italy that searched for peace, and tranquillity. And it found it within the four walls of our homes, where perhaps most treachery hid.Today Italy is living a strange sort of post-cold-war. We come from 20 years of cultural ruins. The critical spirit of the Italian citizen has been completely hollowed out. The worst thing to emerge of the past twenty years is that the Italian citizen has lost all kinds of ethical reference. Ethics have been turned upside down. The respect for family, respect of marriage, respect for honesty, being honest with ourselves and other human beings. This was made completely relative. These days we can try to build back honesty, ethics, but to do it we must start from the very foundation. Otherwise we just survive, we don't live fully. De Angelis: There is danger related to this ""mediocracy"". Everything that is mediocre is accepted. Everything that shines of its own light gets rejected. This is a grave danger for a country because the country slowly dims [dumbs] down. And stops looking to the future. That's why I love that the two girls run away from the spotlights of a permanent reality show where nothing is showcased. And they run away from this nothing because they want to prove themselves. With the danger of remaining alone, or dying, of the cold that comes from stepping out of the spotlight. But they want to risk that, because they want to live.In Italy, there is no longer the bourgeois ideal, rather a jam of fake ideals, fake religions and fake beliefs. Everything that is rounded off is accepted, what is blunt, sharp is not OK. I'm tired of this moral relativism. I want to deal with people who have very precise ethics, I want to know what it means to respect others' words, and other people. I want to know what it means to respect our parents, our friends, our brothers, our wives. All this must be regulated by a strong ethic. These girls teach me that there is a new era, of a moral that is clean and honest. How did you find the girls, your actresses?De Angelis: I already knew them from a previous casting call. And then when we auditioned for this film I remembered them. They have performed in some talent shows in Italy, as singers. But they are traveling down a really interesting road. They've done TV when they were younger, then they debuted in a film, and now they've gone back to the Conservatory to study. It's important to me that they build their career on studies, not just opportunities. Opportunities can be well exploited only if one is well prepared. How would you describe yourself to someone who doesn't know you?De Angelis: A normal person."

Earlier this year, scientists revealed that infants’ cuteness doesn’t end with just chubby cheeks, button noses and other visual features. It also includes how they sound and smell. It’s as if babies are designed to shower us in a positive sensory overload targeting all senses. And this is no accident. Throughout evolution, babies (of humans and probably most other animals) developed ways to optimally attract the attention of adults, whom they need in order to survive. Research going back to the 1940s by renowned ethologist Konrad Lorenz, who looked at babies’ physical features and face — what he called the baby schema — suggests they are not funny or cute by chance, but that cuteness has some sort of evolutionary purpose by provoking a care reaction in adults. But what happens when babies grow out of infancy, and their extremely cute faces morph into something less baby-like and more adult-like? This is a particularly important question for human kids who have a long childhood and a long period of dependency on adults. They have to develop another strategy to keep a firm grip on our hearts. And, of course, they have. As their outside cuteness slowly fades, kids seem to use another skill to continue getting caring attention from parents: something that a group of scientists in Spain have dubbed cognitive babyness.“Preschoolers have something that seems as strong as the baby schema in infants. Something that makes children more appealing for adults,” said psychologist Carlos Hernandez Blasi of University Jaume I in Castellon, Spain. “What we find is that precisely in this period from 2 to 7 years old, which we call early childhood, these important cues for adults are not so physical in nature but cognitive.” Kids at this age show a type of immature thinking that comes off as cute and funny, and provokes a positive emotion and caring reaction in adults, Blasi and his colleagues found in experiments. One such immature thinking involves showing a bias to attribute lifelike and human motivations to inanimate things. For example, a child might say “the sun didn’t come out because he was mad.” This type of thinking is called animism.Another is finalism, or a bias to attribute specific purposes or “reasons for being this way” to events. For example, a kid might say that a mountain has a big peak and a small peak, because the big one is for long hikes and the small one is for short hikes.“We have labelled this group of cognitive traits as reflecting supernatural thinking, because what they share is an explanation of natural phenomena that involves some form of supernatural or magical causation,” Blasi and his colleagues wrote in a new paper in the British Journal of Psychology.Not all childlike thinking involves magical causation and supernatural elements. Overestimating one’s ability (to memorize a long list of 50 items, for example) is one of type of such natural immature thinking.To determine the effects of these various modes of thinking on adults, Blasi and his team presented college students with pairs of short vignettes. One depicted a child showing immature thinking (of either the natural or supernatural type) and a second depicted another child using the same type of mature thinking that adults show.The study participants had to rank the hypothetical children, who ranged in age from 3 to 9, on a dozen adjectives, including, cute, sneaky, smart and helpless.The researchers found that adults rated the children exhibiting immature supernatural thinking more positively and as more helpless than children expressing mature cognition.Sometimes the vignettes were accompanied by a child’s face, but the cognitive cues seemed to be more powerful than facial cues in evoking adults’ positive reactions. This suggest that for kids beyond infancy, cute behavior trumps a cute face when competing for parents’ caregiving responses. “It was more important what the kids said than what they looked like,” Blasi said.In a series of similar experiments, Blasi and his colleagues have found similar effects for both men and women, parents and non-parents, and in two different countries, the United States and Spain.Another piece of evidence that supernatural thinking in young kids serves to boost parental attention is that a 12-year-old doesn’t find it cute. The positive reaction seems to emerge at some point after puberty. “Older adolescents’ reaction is similar to adults,” Blasi said. “It seems that this reaction is not something you are born with but develops later on.” What happens to babies and children who aren’t all that cute, physically or cognitively? Although these young humans may experience some discrimination early on, it doesn’t mean that they would be totally ignored. The babyness that provokes in adults an urge to protect comes in many forms, and a cuter face may just make the reaction come easier and faster. And no one stays cute forever anyway. "

Sign up for HUFFPOST HILL and get a cheeky dose of political news every evening! A new report predicts that global markets would fall sharply if Donald Trump wins the White House, and considering how much the candidate likes market crashes, that might make defeat even more difficult for him. Merrick Garland’s FOMO was temporarily relieved when a short-staffed Supreme Court delayed hearing three cases. And Donald Trump’s terrible Alfred E. Smith dinner speech makes us wonder why anyone would ever have Steve Bannon write jokes. At least Trump didn’t use Bannon’s “A priest and a rabbi walk into a bar ― yeah, a rabbi.” This is HUFFPOST HILL for Friday, October 21st, 2016Happy Friday: “Salma Hayek claimed that Donald Trump pursued her while she had a boyfriend, asked her on a date, and then — angry at being rejected — planted a National Enquirer story about her being too short for him, in an interview on a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show that aired Friday. Hayek, a Hillary Clinton surrogate, began by arguing that Trump was bad for the Latino community and extolled Clinton’s virtues, before the host of El Show del Mandril on Radio Centro 93.9 in Los Angeles asked her opinion on the number of women that have come forward alleging Trump sexually assaulted them.” [BuzzFeed’s Adrian Carrasquillo]PAUL RYAN’S BIGLY SHIT SANDWICH - Matt Fuller: “The problem for Ryan is that Trump, his supporters and his policies do not seem to be going anywhere, even if he loses spectacularly. Ryan’s favorability has fallen 28 points over the past two weeks, fueled by Trump turning his attention to the speaker and criticizing him for sowing division in the party, seemingly without any sense of irony. A Bloomberg poll conducted Oct. 14-17 showed that 51 percent of Republicans think the Trump’s view of what the GOP stands for better matches theirs, compared to 33 percent who said Ryan’s perspective more closely matched theirs.… ‘If we lose 15, it’ll be tough for Paul Ryan,’ one GOP member told HuffPost this month. That means, as other members have told HuffPost, Ryan already has a speaker reelection problem. And that’s before Trump starts whipping up the GOP base. Already, we see some conservatives in the House looking apt to use Ryan’s less-than-enthusiastic support of Trump as a way to potentially remove him.” [HuffPost]MARKETS WOULD SHUDDER AT TRUMP VICTORY: REPORT - Better short the market if he wins. Y’know, short: like his fingers. Alexander Kaufman; “A victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump would send stock markets in the United States, the United Kingdom and Asia down by 10 to 15 percent, according to a new economic analysis. In a paper released Friday by the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, economics professors Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz tracked overnight trading during the first presidential debate last month between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. They found that markets around the world surged as it became clear that Clinton had won the face-off. ‘Markets believe this election will have huge ramifications for the global economy,’ Wolfers wrote in a flurry of tweets breaking down his findings. ‘It’s not just about us; it’s about the world.’” [HuffPost]TRUMP BOMBS ALFRED E. SMITH DINNER - Daniel Marans: “If there was any doubt that Donald Trump’s comedy routine at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner did not go over well with the crowd, Alfred E. Smith V put that to rest on Friday morning. Smith ― the great-great-grandson of the dinner’s namesake, who was the first Catholic presidential nominee from a major party ― specifically told CNN’s ‘New Day’ that Trump’s joke that Hillary Clinton was ‘pretending not to hate Catholics’ did not sit well with the largely Catholic audience. ‘Donald had some very solid minutes early on and eventually he crossed the line and took it a little too far,’ Smith said. ‘Hillary, on the other hand, was able to laugh at herself and at the same time not underplay any of the serious things that Donald Trump has said or done.’” [HuffPost]Like HuffPost Hill?

Follow us on Twitter - @HuffPostHillCOMPARING CLINTON AND TRUMP TWITTER Christopher Mathias, Samantha Storey and Adam Hooper: “The Huffington Post wanted to find out more about the people who follow the candidates. We hoped their 160-character bios might reveal a thing or two about political identity. Not everyone fills out their Twitter bio, but for those who do it acts as a sort of digital calling card. We downloaded the Twitter bios for people who follow either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. That ended up being about 8 million tiny 160-character self-portraits.... Take guns and religion, often associated with the right wing. #2A, meaning Second Amendment, popped up in the bios of 4,320 Trump followers, compared to 585 Clinton followers. Then there’s #MolonLabe, a Greek phrase meaning ‘come and take [them],’ which, legend has it, was the Spartan king Leonidas’ response when the Persian army told him and his army to lay down their weapons. The phrase, adopted by gun rights advocates as a rallying cry against gun control, was in the Twitter bios of 396 Trump followers and in the the bios of just 43 Clinton followers.… Also prominent in Trump followers’ bios were Bible verses: Psalm 23:4, John 15:13, Matthew 19:26, Romans 1:16, Luke 1:37, and most popularly, Joshua 1:9 (’Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go’). Clinton followers, by comparison, were less biblically inclined.” [HuffPost]DONALD TRUMP IS CHUCK GRASSLEY’S BEST FRIEND - From Eliot’s Iowa Senate dispatch: “After Judge declared her candidacy on March 4, it appeared, at least for a fleeting moment, that the Democrats might be one seat closer to retaking the Senate. The New York Times called her a ‘formidable’ challenger, which is about as emotional as the Times gets about anything. In a normal election year, the Supreme Court’s unprecedented staffing issue, and Grassley’s role in preventing Garland from getting a hearing, would be the most-discussed aspect of this race. But that has been rendered a mere afterthought thanks to a Republican presidential nominee whose love of gold trim and threatening his opponents with extrajudicial vengeance is reminiscent of a Soviet bloc leader.... [I]t would appear that Trump has had the salubrious effect for Grassley of keeping the Garland nomination off the front page. Trump has sucked all the oxygen out of the room, and not just because of those great gulping nasal sniffs of his.” [HuffPost]Iowa mood music: “The Supreme Court is offering new evidence that the short-handed court is having trouble getting its work done. The justices have yet to schedule three cases for arguments that were granted full review in January, about a month before Justice Antonin Scalia died. The cases involve separation of church and state, class-action lawsuits and property rights, issues that often split liberal and conservative justices. Their absence from the calendar of cases that are being argued this fall suggests that the justices believe they may divide 4 to 4, and are waiting for a ninth justice to join them.” [AP’s Mark Sherman]TRUMP COULD FLIP KENTUCKY STATEHOUSE - Well, at least he’ll do one thing for the GOP. Adam Beam: “Democrats could lose control of their only legislative chamber in the South because of a blustery hero for folks in coal country — Donald Trump. The New York real estate developer’s anger on the campaign trail matches the mood of many in Appalachia, where job losses associated with the declining coal industry have fueled a backlash against national Democrats that has slowly trickled down to the local level. In Kentucky, the backlash could spill over into races for the state House, where Democrats hold a precarious 53-47 majority. Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo, a Democrat, has not lost a state House election in 36 years. But this time, he’s scared. ‘My opponent can’t beat me,’ Stumbo said. ‘But Donald Trump can.’” [AP]DAVID DUKE: STILL AROUND - The hate-filled man who looks like Donald Trump and a post-motorcycle accident Mark Hamill had a child is still trying to win elected office. Michael McAuliffe: “Republican candidate and former Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke will have a spot on the stage in next month’s Louisiana Senate debate. Duke, who is among a large field of competitors vying to replace retiring Sen. David Vitter (R), had been out of politics since 1999 when he jumped into the Senate race over the summer. His platform includes promises to stop racism against white people and to declare the Black Lives Matter movement a terrorist initiative. He has been trying to leverage the relative popularity of Donald Trump in his state to gain some momentum, although he has not been faring very well. But a poll released Thursday pegged Duke’s support at 5.1 percent, which put him just above the threshold to be included in the next televised forum for Louisiana’s Senate candidates on Nov. 2.” [HuffPost]Sad news at the Journal: “The Wall Street Journal is seeking a ‘substantial’ number of employee buyouts as the newspaper grapples with industry-wide financial pressures. Editor-in-chief Gerard Baker notified staff Friday that management was first looking for buyout-takers in hopes of limiting layoffs down the line. All Journal employees worldwide are eligible for the buyout by the end of October. However, management can elect not to accept some requests. ‘We are seeking a substantial number of employees to elect this benefit, but we reserve the right to reject a volunteer based on business considerations,’ Baker wrote.” [HuffPost’s Michael Calderone]BECAUSE YOU’VE READ THIS FAR - Here’s a kitten and some chihuahuas. PETER THIEL: WHADDA GUY - Julia Carrie Wong: “When Mark Zuckerberg defended board member Peter Thiel’s $1.25m donation to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign this week, the Facebook CEO emphasized that support of the candidate did not necessarily constitute ‘accepting sexual assault’. But part of Thiel’s 1995 book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus suggests that he may sympathize more with Trump ― who has recently been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by several women ― than with his victims. The PayPal co-founder attempted to discredit the idea of date rape ― he wrote that the definition of rape had been erroneously expanded to include ‘seductions that are later regretted.’’ He also suggested that the movement to combat it on college campuses was motivated by animosity toward men.” [Guardian]COMFORT FOOD- The most efficient way to destroy the entire universe ― not that the election has us thinking about such things. - The internet can’t seem to spell “pregnant” correctly.- Don’t watch this slug at 20x speed while high.

Dan Scavino has made nearly $183,000 from it. Current campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s polling firm has been paid nearly $382,000 in a single month.None of them has donated even a single dollar to Trump’s campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.In fact, a Huffington Post review of Trump campaign filings shows that among a dozen top staff members of his campaign who cumulatively have made over $2 million from it, only one has donated: spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, who gave $250 on June 30.Campaign staffers, particularly top staff, typically donate to their campaigns, in part to show lower-ranking staff that they believe in the enterprise.Among Hillary Clinton’s top staff, campaign manager Robby Mook has given eight donations of $100, plus one for $250. Communications director Jennifer Palmieri has given $500, as has top adviser Huma Abedin. Since the start of Clinton’s run, her campaign has paid Mook $142,000, Palmieri $187,000 and Abedin $195,000.As former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush prepared for his run for the GOP nomination last year, senior adviser Sally Bradshaw gave $5,000 to the super PAC supporting him.Neither Lewandowski nor the campaign responded to HuffPost queries about the lack of donations. Lewandowski received $100,000 from the campaign in September, even though he was fired in June. He now works for CNN as a political analyst, where he consistently defends Trump, and continues to have a close relationship with him, including flying with Trump on a recent campaign swing.Because the maximum individual contribution limit is $2,700 per election, staff contributions cannot realistically amount to a significant percentage of a campaign budget. Further, in the case of Trump, a major selling point he used in the primaries and continues to use is that he primarily spends his own money.Trump actually spent only a few million dollars of his own money early in the primaries, and then relied largely on revenue from the sale of “Make America Great Again” hats and other campaign souvenirs until late autumn. At that point, he began spending tens of millions out of his own pocket. Since he won the nomination, though, Trump has cut back his own underwriting to $2 million a month and has relied on both large and small donations to his campaign, mainly through joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The joke was a reference to the publication of a hacked email that Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri, herself a Catholic, had made an controversial comment about Catholics and evangelicals.Apparently, the joke did even worse than appearances would suggest, however. Smith argued that Trump, who spoke first, managed to diminish Clinton’s performance by taking “the tone in another direction.”“Hillary when ultimately she got the mic, she had some very funny things that she had said, and I don’t think they got as many laughs as they could have just because the tone in the room had shifted a bit,” Smith suggested.“The room did get a little uncomfortable,” Smith concluded. “Like I said, that line, in a room full of predominantly Catholics, that didn’t go over so well.”Trump did, however, say some nicer things about Clinton on Thursday night, according to Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who sat between the two nominees. “After the little prayer, Mr. Trump turned to Secretary Clinton and said, ‘You know, you are one tough and talented woman,’” he told Politico.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The 32-year-old systems engineer has spent the last few years trying to raise awareness about what he says is institutional child abuse. It’s what prompted him to shut down the internet in one of the country’s best children’s hospitals, and it’s the reason he’s shed 18 pounds in just over two weeks as a result of an ongoing hunger strike.Now, Gottesfeld is being charged with conspiracy and intentional damage to a protected computer — a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He faces up to five years in prison and $380,000 in fines.  Carmen Ortiz, the U.S. attorney who indicted Gottesfeld, is the same one who targeted internet activist Aaron Swartz. In 2011, she indicted the programming prodigy for computer-related crimes. Swartz faced 13 felony charges, which could have resulted in up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines. It was a highly controversial legal pursuit that ended when Swartz took his own life. Swartz’s story inspired Gottesfeld and he feels connected to the deceased activist in many ways, his wife, Dana Gottesfeld, said. He even keeps a picture of Swartz in his prison cell, surrounded by photos of his family.Gottesfeld, who staged the cyber attack on the Boston Children’s Hospital in April 2014, wasn’t arrested until February of this year, shortly after he and his wife were picked up off the coast of Cuba by a Disney cruise ship.He wants people to pay attention to and stand up against the “troubled teens industry,” which Dana described as a tough-love program for children with mental and physical disabilities.“The idea is breaking the kid down, then building them back up,” she told The Huffington Post. “Except there’s no building up. It’s very punitive.”Dana said she watched her brother fall prey to this approach in a residential treatment facility in Utah, where he was held in solitary confinement and prohibited from communicating with anyone outside the facility, including his family.Because of her brother’s experience with institutional abuse, Dana and Martin felt compelled to do something when they heard about a local case — that of Justina Pelletier, a teenage girl who was allegedly misdiagnosed and mistreated at Boston Children’s Hospital. (For more about Pelletier’s case, which gained national attention, read here.)As the Gottesfelds got more involved with Justina, they became outraged with the lack of awareness and consequences of institutional abuse, Dana said.“We want people to be angry,” she said. “We want people — people in power — to actually do something about it.”Gottesfeld says he will continue the hunger strike until two demands are met. First, he wants the current presidential candidates, including Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, to sign a pledge promising they will work toward ending institutional mistreatment of children.The second demand is that Ortiz, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts whose office is handling the case against Gottesfeld, “stop using the resources of her office to make ‘political’ prosecutions,” Dana Gottesfeld said.Though he’s over two weeks into the strike, Dana said her husband remains in good spirits: “He sounds like himself,” she said, adding that the purpose of his protest — to defend children from torture and abuse — keeps him strong.Ortiz, whose office did not immediately respond to requests for comment, has a long history of prosecuting progressives, as HuffPost reported earlier this year. Some have called her aggressive style an “abuse of power.”“You’d like to think the focus would be on those organizations like human trafficking rings, drug smuggling rings, the kind of organizations that in and of themselves represent a threat to safety, public safety,” Martha Coakley, a former Massachusetts attorney general, told HuffPost in July. But with many of Ortiz’s prosecutions, she said, “there’s a competing social interest, sort of civil disobedience context.”Upon learning of the indictment Wednesday, Gottesfeld penned a statement from the Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island, addressing his grievances with Ortiz and with his circumstances:The fact that Ortiz’s office indicted on debate day, and without a press release, shows they are aware of the unconscionable human rights violations they are attempting to sweep under the rug and the precedence of impunity that would be even more firmly established. They have no compassion for the suffering of Justina Pelletier, a mentally and physically challenged child, ripped from her family, left in agony without her painkillers, and locked in an abusive psych ward. Nor are they concerned with any real semblance of true justice. They hope to pursue this case far from public scrutiny and also without any mention how they caused the death of Aaron Swartz. Now their opponent is an imprisoned human rights activist on the third week of a hunger strike, and they still won’t engage in a public debate where they hold every advantage, except the whole truth. This indictment, and the manner in which it was unsealed, were cowardly acts.Gottesfeld also used his time in custody to draft a comprehensive report of Justina’s alleged abuse, which he sent to the United Nations and the Department of Justice. Neither organization has responded, according to Dana Gottesfeld.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Most Donald Trump supporters can’t imagine how Hillary Clinton could win an election that wasn’t rigged, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, and supporters of both candidates say they wouldn’t accept the rival as a legitimate president.Trump, lagging badly in the polls, has begun repeatedly raising the specter of voter fraud or a “rigged election” ― claims that experts say are entirely unfounded, but which could be damaging toward Americans’ faith in the nation’s electoral process.Although Clinton is overwhelmingly the favorite to win, 42 percent of Americans who’d prefer to see her in the White House still say it’s possible that Trump could legitimately win in the election, compared to 36 percent who say he could win only if the election was rigged.Most of those favoring a Trump victory, however, see a legitimate Clinton win as an impossibility. Fifty-seven percent say she can win only in a rigged election, with just 30 percent believing she could win honestly. A 53 percent majority of Americans who’d rather see Clinton win the election say that if Trump wins, they will not accept him “as the legitimate president.” An even larger majority of those who’d prefer a Trump win ― 64 percent ― say that they wouldn’t accept Clinton as legitimate.In November 2000, by contrast, just 31 percent of Republicans told Gallup/USA Today pollsters that they wouldn’t accept Al Gore as the legitimate president if he were declared the winner and inaugurated, and just 38 percent of Democrats said they wouldn’t accept George W. Bush.The results of the two surveys aren’t directly comparable. For one thing, unlike the online HuffPost/YouGov survey, the 2000 poll was conducted by phone, meaning some respondents may have felt more pressure to give a socially acceptable response. For another, the 2000 polls were taken after the conclusion of a very close election, rather than in the heat of a campaign’s final days.For some respondents to the most recent poll, denying that their preferred candidate could lose legitimately may just be a way of expressing faith in their preferred outcome, rather than an attitude they’ll hold even after the polls are closed. But it’s also possible that increased polarization the heightened rhetoric of this election has left some Americans, especially those backing Trump, less willing to accept that they might be on the losing side in November. “I’ve never seen an election like this. Not in my lifetime. Certainly not in modern history,” Lonna Atkeson, a professor at the University of New Mexico and head of the Center for the Study of Voting, Elections, and Democracy, told Reuters, citing the level of mistrust toward the political system.Even if Americans on both sides of the aisle aren’t prepared to welcome a rival, relatively few say that violence would be an appropriate response if their candidate lost. Those who’d prefer Clinton to win say by a 55-point margin, 70 percent to 15 percent, that a Trump victory would not justify citizens taking violent action against the government.

His platform includes promises to stop racism against white people and to declare the Black Lives Matter movement a terrorist initiative.He has been trying to leverage the relative popularity of Donald Trump in his state to gain some momentum, although he has not been faring very well.But a poll released Thursday pegged Duke’s support at 5.1 percent, which put him just above the threshold to be included in the next televised forum for Louisiana’s Senate candidates on Nov. 2.While Duke still stands virtually no chance of winning the race, he has reached the main stage during a year in which Trump’s rise helped to move white extremist messages more into the mainstream.Louisiana uses a so-called jungle primary process. If no candidate wins a majority on Nov. 8, the two top vote-getters, regardless of party, will move on to a run-off election in December.

Many of the cities studied face the same demographic and economic challenges that contributed to the ongoing and devastating water crisis in Flint, Michigan.The GAO report reviewed the water infrastructure needs of utilities in 10 cities: five large, including Detroit, New Orleans and Pittsburgh, and five mid-size, including Youngstown, Ohio, and Macon, Georgia.All of the cities — many of them in the Rust Belt, like Flint — have experienced dramatic population losses over the past 30 years. They were evaluated through interviews with water experts, city officials and utility managers and an analysis of existing data and records.“These cities are facing economic challenges that makes it more difficult for them to deal with addressing their water and wastewater infrastructure needs,” J. Alfredo Gómez, a GAO spokesman, told The Huffington Post.Water pipeline repair and replacement is an urgent need at the majority of utilities, the report found. One utility, which the GAO did not individually identify, said that nearly all of the 740 miles of its pipelines need to be replaced, a project that would cost more than $390 million. (For comparison, the total 2016 budget of Youngstown was $185 million.)Many of these utilities are also facing the prospect of costly lead replacement initiatives, but don’t appear to be all that concerned that they may be poisoning their customers. This is despite the fact that lead can enter the water supply through lead service lines if they corrode over time. Lead exposure is a public health hazard, especially for children.Six of the 10 drinking water utilities also noted that they were aware that some portions of the service lines that connect customer homes to main water systems definitely or possibly contained lead. Most of them, however, “did not express concern about the risk of lead in their water,” the report read.(This finding is in line with interviews HuffPost conducted with water officials in many of America’s largest cities earlier this month.)Representatives from more than two-thirds of the utilities the GAO interviewed also said that their utilities were struggling with high leakage rates ranging from about 18 to 60 percent. Those rates are as much as four times higher than the 10 to 15 percent maximum water loss rate that the Environmental Protection Agency has identified as acceptable. Affordability of their services is also an issue facing many of the water utilities.In order to keep up with growing infrastructure needs amid a declining customer base, all but two of the utilities the GAO considered had raised their rates for customers over the past two years. But more than half of the utilities the GAO spoke with expressed concerns about whether future rate hikes would be affordable to their customers.That’s because many of these utilities’ low-income customers are already struggling to keep up with their water bill. In all but one of the cities in the GAO report — Macon — water rates already exceed amounts that are considered affordable by the EPA.The report was alarming to Erik Olson, a senior advisor at the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Action Fund. “We really have not been investing [in water infrastructure]. We’ve not been keeping up with this,” Olson told HuffPost.While the GAO report focused on a small number of cities, the national need for water infrastructure investments appears similarly massive. According to the American Water Works Association, a water safety advocacy group, the overall need to restore the nation’s existing water systems will cost at least $1 trillion over the next 25 years. The EPA has estimated current water infrastructure needs at a more conservative but still massive $600 billion.Delaying these sorts of investments will likely result in increased water service disruptions and degraded water service, plus an increasing share of utilities’ limited resources going toward emergency repairs rather than needed upgrades and expansions, the AWWA has reported.Such is the reality for the residents of Flint in recent years, following the cost-saving decision to switch the city’s water source from the Detroit water system to the polluted, highly corrosive Flint River in 2014.The water in Flint remains unsafe to drink more than two years after the city’s water troubles began and a year after they became public. And many Flint residents are struggling to pay their water bills, which were flagged by an advocacy group as among the highest in the nation.On a more encouraging note, Olson described the needed investments as a potential “win-win” for communities like Flint that have struggled with high poverty and joblessness.“If we invest in our future, we not only have safer water for us and our kids, but we also create a lot of jobs, good jobs, good American jobs,” Olson said. “It will be good for labor and jobs, but also really good for the environment and public health.

Editor-in-chief Gerard Baker notified staff Friday that management was first looking for buyout-takers in hopes of limiting layoffs down the line. All Journal employees worldwide are eligible for the buyout by the end of October. However, management can elect not to accept some requests. “We are seeking a substantial number of employees to elect this benefit, but we reserve the right to reject a volunteer based on business considerations,” Baker wrote. Dow Jones, the Journal’s parent company, has already begun a broad review of its operations, dubbed WSJ2020, and Baker’s memo comes two days after the Journal announced plans to overhaul its print edition. This revamping may include combining sections and other cost-cutting measures, according to the Journal. There will also be a few layoffs next week at Dow Jones-owned Barron’s, its editor, Ed Finn, confirmed to The Huffington Post. Finn had mentioned the upcoming cuts in a reply to Baker’s memo that was accidentally sent company-wide. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch paid $5 billion for Journal-parent Dow Jones in 2007 and invested heavily in the paper early on. But significant declines in print advertising and circulation have caused newspapers across the industry to scale back over the past decade. Even major newspapers with robust paid subscriptions online, like the Journal and New York Times, are not immune.The Journal’s plan to scale back comes as The New York Times is also planning to reduce newsroom headcount through buyouts, and potentially, layoffs. The Times tasked an internal committee, the 2020 Group, to oversee its reorganization."

This Man Wants To Make Sure They Keep Them.","Laura Barrón-López, Amber Ferguson, and Sam Levine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-felons-voting-rights_us_5809292fe4b000d0b155b2cc,"If voting doesn't matter, then ""why did they make it so hard?""",2016-10-21,"Muhammad As-saddique Abdul-Rahman (right) helps Richard Simms, 57, and Keith Butts, 53, fill out their voter registration forms in the Richmond neighborhood of Blackwell on Oct. 17.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58092b511b0000582cef867c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"RICHMOND, Va. ― One rainy night in 2009, Muhammad As-saddique Abdul-Rahman woke up in a graveyard.He’d been released from prison seven years earlier, after nearly two decades behind bars for armed robbery, and had spent most of his freedom homeless, drinking and using drugs. Waking up in that graveyard was the wakeup call he needed. He checked himself into a detox facility, joined Alcoholics Anonymous, got clean, and started working as a carpenter. These days, Abdul-Rahman, 53, is a voter registration organizer. Pamphlets detailing ballot measures stick out of his left breast pocket, and he carries two clipboards in his hand. He wears a tie every day. Today, it falls over an orange and blue plaid short-sleeve shirt. A blue cap with white stars is on his head. Since April, he has worked 12-hour to 16-hour days canvassing neighborhoods in Richmond, helping former felons navigate the confusing process of applying to restore their voting rights and then registering to vote. “As an ex-felon, myself, I couldn’t vote and I didn’t feel ― as a citizen I didn’t feel whole,” Abdul-Rahman told The Huffington Post. “I was paying taxes. I had to follow laws, and I had no say in what these laws were.”In a few weeks, Abdul-Rahman’s life will change again. On Nov. 8, he’ll be at his local polling station at 6 a.m. sharp. He’ll vote for the first time in his life.Abdul-Rahman and thousands of other ex-felons are at the center of a contentious battle in Virginia this election year. Virginia is one of only four states that ban former felons from voting. In April, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) signed an executive order restoring voting rights to more than 200,000 state residents who had been disenfranchised because they were former felons. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled three months later that while McAuliffe has the constitutional authority to restore the right to vote, he could not do so with a blanket executive order that applied to every ex-felon. The court also ordered that 13,000 former felons who had registered to vote after McAuliffe’s executive order be removed from voting rolls.Exactly one month after that, on the steps of the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial at the state capitol in Richmond, McAuliffe pledged to restore the voting rights of every former felon individually. He’s signed more than 67,000 orders since. Abdul-Rahman was there that day. “It was magical,” he said. “It was magical, you know what I mean? I was so into it that I said, ‘Give ‘em hell Gov.’”When he first learned of McAullife’s executive order by word of mouth in April, Abdul-Rahman immediately registered to vote. With a new fire in him, he started canvassing on his own, imploring other ex-felons to register. Then he discovered he could get paid to do what he loved. In May, New Virginia Majority ― a progressive nonprofit that organizes communities of color, women, youth, LGBTQ people ― hired Abdul-Rahman to help mobilize ex-felons. He continues to go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings ― where he first heard about McAuliffe’s order ― and considers his service as an organizer part of his recovery. But after convincing hundreds of ex-felons to register following McAuliffe’s initial order in April, Abdul-Rahman had to start all over again. “To cut 13,000 off the voters rolls in one stroke ― that’s un-American, that’s un-democratic and that is wrong ― morally, intellectually and it was legally wrong,” he said.Abdul-Rahman redoubled his efforts to find people he’d already registered, said Tram Nguyen, co-director of the New Virginia Majority.“There were a couple of challenges: One, overcoming the sort of the emotional toll of folks who didn’t have their rights, and then they were given and taken away,” Nguyen said. “And two, convincing folks that they should continue to try to be engaged and their voice does matter.”Abdul-Rahman is one of the top organizers for New Virginia Majority. His passion is fueled by an understanding of what it’s like to be stuck for years in a system that provides little to no help for those trying to start over. He sees Virginia’s restoration of voting rights as a way for former felons to pick themselves back up and have their voices heard. “What they have done with mass incarceration, and by putting a felony on us every chance they got, is that they have froze us out of most of the world,” Abdul-Rahman said, referring to black men like himself. “They’ve created an underclass ― a caste, if you will.”On Monday morning, the day of the state’s 5 p.m. deadline for voter registration, Abdul-Rahman wasted no time. Standing in a convenience store parking lot in sweltering heat, he quickly gathered a gaggle of men around him. As cars rotated in and out of the lot blasting music, Abdul-Rahman informed the men ― most of whom were former felons ― that they may be eligible to vote for the first time. He helped them fill out voter registration forms and used his iPhone to check if their rights had been restored.One of the men Abdul-Rahman helped was Martin Parker, a 51-year-old who said he was released from prison in 2010 after being “in and out” from the age of 18 on charges of robbery and breaking and entering. Parker said he’d never voted and had been working with Abdul-Rahman for three weeks to get his rights restored. He was still waiting on Monday, unsure if he would be able to register before the deadline.Not counting those he helped on Monday, Abdul-Rahman has registered roughly 1,400 people to vote since May, including about 800 ex-felons. It’s easy to see why he’s good at his job. At a bus transfer stop downtown, he sprinted around, asking everyone he saw whether they were registered to vote. At one point, he chased a woman who had an incomplete application onto a bus.For those already registered, he’d leave them with a friendly reminder: “Polls open at 6 a.m. See you on Nov. 8.” He’d check to make sure they had photo ID, which Virginia requires for voting. If not, he’d direct them to the room in City Hall where they could get one for free. Later in the day, Abdul-Rahman joined other ex-felons working for New Virginia Majority at a round-table discussion meant to humanize the issue of felon voting rights. When asked for a word that captures how they felt when their rights were taken away by the court, the men and women offered this: depravation, deflated, stripped, abandoned, hurt, cynical, determined.Charles Satchell, 65, was the only ex-felon at the table still without the right to vote. With just over an hour before the registration deadline, Satchell asked Tammie Hagen, 52, a New Virginia Majority organizer and a former felon, if she would check one more time to see if his rights had been restored. Hagen, using her phone, found that Satchell was still in limbo, his status “pending.”“I’m almost trying to push it aside because I’m getting sad about it, kind of emotional,” Satchell said. “It’s akin to having like a scarlet letter. It’s akin to walking around with like an X on your forehead that people see.”Satchell said not being able to vote in next month’s presidential election only motivates him to make sure those who can vote do so.“I was so engaged in 2008, in 2012, and what this is gonna do is make me even more engaged,” he said. “I want to make sure I get more people out. I’m gonna pick up more people than I would have.” It’s easy for former felons, who’ve been disenfranchised in Virginia since the 19th century, to give into “hopelessness and despair,” Abdul-Rahman said. But once he got a few to realize that they could become full citizens again, they began to “perk up,” he explained. One young woman called her mother the second she had her certificate in hand ― the governor’s order restoring her voting rights.“Some of them have framed their certificate and hung it on their walls,” Abdul-Rahman said, beaming with pride that he had helped them. “You can go in many barbershops and see where guys have hung theirs on the wall. Some have used it to impress their girlfriends.”One man Abdul-Rahman helped said he had been convicted of a felony for stealing a chicken — in the 1950s. He had tears in his eyes when Abdul Rahman registered him to vote.But much of Abdul Rahman’s work could be for naught if Virginia’s Republican-led General Assembly gets its way. Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment (R) has proposed an amendment to the state constitution that would restore the rights of certain ex-felons, but make it more difficult for others ― namely ones who were convicted of crimes the state deems “violent.” Norment’s bill would need to pass both houses of the General Assembly in two sessions, then be approved by voters. If it passes, it wouldn’t make it onto the ballot until 2018. That gives Abdul-Rahman and other former felons who recently got their rights back a way to ensure they keep them: Vote Norment and his allies out of office.Abdul-Rahman is paying close attention to Republicans in the General Assembly, and is devoting his time until Election Day to mobilizing the 1,400 people he registered ― especially the ex-felons. He wants to show Virginia’s elected officials that the electorate is changing, and that there is a new voting bloc that can make a difference. “What I’m going to do now is try to organize these guys so we can punish them at the polls,” Abdul-Rahman said of lawmakers who oppose ex-felon voting rights. “We can vote as a bloc and we can punish them and change this city and state.” Some of the ex-felons Abdul-Rahman meets aren’t particularly eager to join his effort. “‘It don’t count’ is one of the things they say,” Abdul-Rahman said. “And I will tell them that if it did not count, then … why don’t they want you to vote? Why don’t they just generously give it back? Why did they make it so hard?”UPDATE: Virginia extended the deadline for voter registration to Friday. Video produced by Amber Ferguson. "

But after convincing hundreds of ex-felons to register following McAuliffe’s initial order in April, Abdul-Rahman had to start all over again. “To cut 13,000 off the voters rolls in one stroke ― that’s un-American, that’s un-democratic and that is wrong ― morally, intellectually and it was legally wrong,” he said.Abdul-Rahman redoubled his efforts to find people he’d already registered, said Tram Nguyen, co-director of the New Virginia Majority.“There were a couple of challenges: One, overcoming the sort of the emotional toll of folks who didn’t have their rights, and then they were given and taken away,” Nguyen said. “And two, convincing folks that they should continue to try to be engaged and their voice does matter.”Abdul-Rahman is one of the top organizers for New Virginia Majority. His passion is fueled by an understanding of what it’s like to be stuck for years in a system that provides little to no help for those trying to start over. He sees Virginia’s restoration of voting rights as a way for former felons to pick themselves back up and have their voices heard. “What they have done with mass incarceration, and by putting a felony on us every chance they got, is that they have froze us out of most of the world,” Abdul-Rahman said, referring to black men like himself. “They’ve created an underclass ― a caste, if you will.”On Monday morning, the day of the state’s 5 p.m. deadline for voter registration, Abdul-Rahman wasted no time. Standing in a convenience store parking lot in sweltering heat, he quickly gathered a gaggle of men around him. As cars rotated in and out of the lot blasting music, Abdul-Rahman informed the men ― most of whom were former felons ― that they may be eligible to vote for the first time. He helped them fill out voter registration forms and used his iPhone to check if their rights had been restored.One of the men Abdul-Rahman helped was Martin Parker, a 51-year-old who said he was released from prison in 2010 after being “in and out” from the age of 18 on charges of robbery and breaking and entering. Parker said he’d never voted and had been working with Abdul-Rahman for three weeks to get his rights restored. He was still waiting on Monday, unsure if he would be able to register before the deadline.Not counting those he helped on Monday, Abdul-Rahman has registered roughly 1,400 people to vote since May, including about 800 ex-felons. It’s easy to see why he’s good at his job. At a bus transfer stop downtown, he sprinted around, asking everyone he saw whether they were registered to vote. At one point, he chased a woman who had an incomplete application onto a bus.For those already registered, he’d leave them with a friendly reminder: “Polls open at 6 a.m. See you on Nov. 8.” He’d check to make sure they had photo ID, which Virginia requires for voting. If not, he’d direct them to the room in City Hall where they could get one for free. Later in the day, Abdul-Rahman joined other ex-felons working for New Virginia Majority at a round-table discussion meant to humanize the issue of felon voting rights. When asked for a word that captures how they felt when their rights were taken away by the court, the men and women offered this: depravation, deflated, stripped, abandoned, hurt, cynical, determined.Charles Satchell, 65, was the only ex-felon at the table still without the right to vote. With just over an hour before the registration deadline, Satchell asked Tammie Hagen, 52, a New Virginia Majority organizer and a former felon, if she would check one more time to see if his rights had been restored. Hagen, using her phone, found that Satchell was still in limbo, his status “pending.”“I’m almost trying to push it aside because I’m getting sad about it, kind of emotional,” Satchell said. “It’s akin to having like a scarlet letter. It’s akin to walking around with like an X on your forehead that people see.”Satchell said not being able to vote in next month’s presidential election only motivates him to make sure those who can vote do so.“I was so engaged in 2008, in 2012, and what this is gonna do is make me even more engaged,” he said. “I want to make sure I get more people out. I’m gonna pick up more people than I would have.” It’s easy for former felons, who’ve been disenfranchised in Virginia since the 19th century, to give into “hopelessness and despair,” Abdul-Rahman said. But once he got a few to realize that they could become full citizens again, they began to “perk up,” he explained. One young woman called her mother the second she had her certificate in hand ― the governor’s order restoring her voting rights.“Some of them have framed their certificate and hung it on their walls,” Abdul-Rahman said, beaming with pride that he had helped them. “You can go in many barbershops and see where guys have hung theirs on the wall. Some have used it to impress their girlfriends.”One man Abdul-Rahman helped said he had been convicted of a felony for stealing a chicken — in the 1950s. He had tears in his eyes when Abdul Rahman registered him to vote.But much of Abdul Rahman’s work could be for naught if Virginia’s Republican-led General Assembly gets its way. Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment (R) has proposed an amendment to the state constitution that would restore the rights of certain ex-felons, but make it more difficult for others ― namely ones who were convicted of crimes the state deems “violent.” Norment’s bill would need to pass both houses of the General Assembly in two sessions, then be approved by voters. If it passes, it wouldn’t make it onto the ballot until 2018. That gives Abdul-Rahman and other former felons who recently got their rights back a way to ensure they keep them: Vote Norment and his allies out of office.Abdul-Rahman is paying close attention to Republicans in the General Assembly, and is devoting his time until Election Day to mobilizing the 1,400 people he registered ― especially the ex-felons. He wants to show Virginia’s elected officials that the electorate is changing, and that there is a new voting bloc that can make a difference. “What I’m going to do now is try to organize these guys so we can punish them at the polls,” Abdul-Rahman said of lawmakers who oppose ex-felon voting rights. “We can vote as a bloc and we can punish them and change this city and state.” Some of the ex-felons Abdul-Rahman meets aren’t particularly eager to join his effort. “‘It don’t count’ is one of the things they say,” Abdul-Rahman said. “And I will tell them that if it did not count, then … why don’t they want you to vote? Why don’t they just generously give it back? Why did they make it so hard?”UPDATE: Virginia extended the deadline for voter registration to Friday. Video produced by Amber Ferguson. "

Steele added that he also wouldn’t vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.The former chairman is the latest high-profile conservative to disavow Trump. After giving the GOP nominee’s racist and sexist comments a pass for almost his entire campaign, a slew of Republican leaders abandoned ship this month amid growing accusations of sexual assault. Among those disavowing Trump are 2008 GOP nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.).

But every single one of us knows how important it is for women to have safe and affordable healthcare.” The dating app, which only allows women to send the first message, has been hailed as a “feminist Tinder.” A spokesperson for the female-created and led company told The Huffington Post that the post was inspired from the discussion of late-term abortion during Wednesday night’s presidential debate. The spokesperson said that Bumble’s team is primarily made up of women, who understand and value the fundamental rights of women. While the team’s opinions vary regarding the presidential election, they all agree on the vital importance of Planned Parenthood: We feel strongly that having access to reproductive and female healthcare is very important. One team member pointed out that Planned Parenthood saved her life in college, as she did not have access to health insurance and used planned parenthood for her yearly exam. They detected early stages of cervical cancer, and were able to change the course of her health. It’s too often that women will go years without exams because they can’t afford to be seen, and Planned Parenthood is accessible and affordable healthcare for women. Below is a mock illustration of Bumble’s check for $28,747 to Planned Parenthood that the dating app posted in a blog Thursday afternoon.According Bumble’s blog post, the check will be posted on Instagram stories so people can be sure the team isn’t “playing around.”“We feel Planned Parenthood is a natural extension of empowering women to take care of their bodies, giving them the right to accessible health care, as well as the ability to make the best choices for them,” the Bumble spokesperson said. “This isn’t about one particular women’s health matter, it’s about providing women with access to all of the proper healthcare ― reproductive healthcare included ― that they need.”Women helping women helping women?

Brian Babin (R-Texas) says it's fine to call women ""nasty.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580a1cb8170000862aacd62e.jpeg?cache=liH6JoqeGR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) is a “genteel Southerner,” he said in an interview Thursday ― and that’s one reason he thinks it was appropriate for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump to call his opponent, Hillary Clinton, a “nasty woman” at the final presidential debate this week.During Wednesday’s debate, Trump interjected with the insult as Clinton answered a question about Social Security. He didn’t take kindly to her attempt to paint him as a tax-dodging cheapskate ― a characterization that is demonstrably accurate.“Such a nasty woman,” Trump said. Moments before, he’d claimed that “nobody respects women more than” he does, a line that drew laughter from the audience. Within minutes, the “nasty woman” barb had become a rallying cry for women online.Speaking to radio host Alan Colmes the next day, Babin, who has endorsed Trump, supported not only the real estate mogul’s decision to go after Clinton, but also the assessment that Clinton is indeed “nasty.”Babin began by arguing that Trump had won the debate “hands down,” because he’d talked about the issues while all Clinton could do was “attack.”Colmes then brought up the “nasty woman” jab, and pressed the congressman about whether the remark was appropriate.“You know what, she’s saying some nasty things,” Babin replied“I’m a genteel Southerner, Alan,” he continued. “I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she’s being nasty.”Here’s audio of the exchange, via CNN: It’s hard to hear Babin’s comments as anything other than a Republican man saying it’s sometimes necessary to keep a woman in her place. With Trump’s support tanking among women ― especially college-educated women ― amid a series of sexual assault allegations, this kind of retrograde garbage seems unlikely to help.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Carlson recently sat down with TIME Magazine to discuss her post-Fox future. Since the summer, she has become one of the most famous faces of workplace harassment. In July, Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes. He denied the charges, and the two eventually settled amidst a slew of other women coming forward with similar allegations against him. Ailes stepped down from Fox News with a 60 million dollar paycheck, and Carlson was awarded 20 million in the settlement.Carlson has become something of a symbol of strength for women who are in a similar situation. She told TIME that publicly sharing her experience has opened the floodgates for other women to share theirs.“I think this is happening every single day to women in all walks of life and in all different types of corporations,” she said. “I’ve heard from so many women, from Wall Street to a tiny little town in Alabama. It’s everywhere.”Carlson said that she does not think that human resources departments are as equipped to deal with workplace harassment as they should be. She told TIME she’ll be working to close loopholes in employer contracts that make it more difficult for women to get justice in sexual harassment cases.Specifically, Carlson will be testifying before Congress in support of anti-forced arbitration laws ― in her case with Ailes, her Fox News contract forced her to arbitrate, instead of going to court over the lawsuit in a public jury trial. Carlson and other advocates of the Arbitration Fairness Act agree that forced arbitration is damaging because it forces accusers into silence. “A lot of people that I’ve heard from [about being unfairly dismissed] find themselves in the middle of either legal action or, more likely, forced arbitration,” she told TIME. “It is a huge problem. Because it’s secret. And it plays into why we think that we’ve come so far in society and we probably really haven’t ―because we don’t hear about it.”The anti-forced arbitrations laws are sponsored by two Democratic Senators ― Al Franken and Patrick Leahy. Carlson’s move from Fox News darling to anti-harassment advocate testifying with two Democratic Senators might seem surprising, but Carlson told TIME that she has always been adamant about gender equality and women’s empowerment ― political party be damned.“I’ve been for women’s empowerment my entire life,” she said. “It’s not like it’s just happened in the last couple of months. I’ve been very outspoken about it. For decades.” Head over to TIME to check out Carlson’s full interview."

The park, home to the largest population of eastern lowland gorillas, also known as Grauer’s gorillas, was believed to be one of the safest areas in the world for the animals, according to a press release from the conservation group. “We are very concerned about these increased threats to the rangers and their families and to the protection of these animals,” Andrew Plumptre, the group’s senior conservation scientist for Africa, said in a statement. Details of Jacques’ death, which the Wildlife Conservation Society called murder, weren’t available. Another ranger, Oscar Byamungu Mianziro, was shot to death by rebel groups in the park in March.Grauer’s gorillas were uplisted to critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature last month after two decades of what the group called “devastating population decline.” More than 70 percent of the species has vanished in that time and there are now just 3,800 left in the wild.The great apes have been victims of human conflict, including the Rwandan genocide and a civil war in the Congo. Despite conservation protections, the animals are highly prized as bushmeat.Wildlife officials have raced to save the animals, but the profession comes with heavy risks. Last year was the deadliest on record for environmental defenders, according to the watchdog group Global Witness, which found at least 185 people were killed in conservation work."

It’s the only way.“With that, in this venue, your honors, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States. Both in military, not maybe social, but economics also.”Duterte’s efforts to engage China, months after a tribunal in the Hague ruled that Beijing did not have historic rights to the South China Sea in a case brought by the previous administration in Manila, marks a reversal in foreign policy since the 71-year-old former mayor took office on June 30.Lopez sought to explain Duterte’s comments.“Let me clarify. The president did not talk about separation,” Lopez told CNN Philippines in Beijing.“In terms of economic (ties), we are not stopping trade, investment with America. The president specifically mentioned his desire to strengthen further the ties with China and the ASEAN region which we have been trading with for centuries.”He said the Philippines was “breaking being too much dependent on one side”.“But we definitely won’t stop the trade and investment activities with the West, specifically the U.S.”Duterte’s spokesman, Ernesto Abella, said the president’s announcement was a “restatement of his position on charting an independent foreign policy”.Duterte wanted to “separate the nation from dependence on the U.S. and the West and rebalance economic and military relations with Asian neighbors” like China, Japan and South Korea, Abella said in statement.Duterte travels to Japan on Tuesday.ANTI-U.S. PROTESTDuterte’s tone toward China is in stark contrast to the language he has used against the United States, after being infuriated by U.S. criticism of his bloody war on drugs.He has called U.S. President Barack Obama a “son of a bitch” and told him to “go to hell”. On Wednesday, about 1,000 anti-U.S. protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila calling for the removal of U.S. troops from the southern island of Mindanao.Hundreds of left-wing demonstrators burned a replica of the U.S. flag during a rally in Manila on Friday as they called on the government to terminate military agreements with Washington.The United States, a former colonial power, has seen Manila as an important ally in its “rebalance” of resources to Asia in the face of a rising China. The U.S. Embassy press attache in Manila, Molly Koscina, said Duterte’s statements were creating uncertainty.“We’ve seen a lot of this sort of troubling rhetoric recently which is inexplicably at odds with the warm relationship that exists between the Filipino and American people and the record of important cooperation between our two governments,” she told Reuters in an email.“We have yet to hear from the Philippine government what Duterte’s remarks on ‘separation’ might mean, but it is creating unnecessary uncertainty.”She also said the United States would honor alliance commitments and treaty obligations with the Philippines.“And, of course, we expect the Philippines to do the same.”U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Washington intended to keep to its alliance commitments to the Philippines.“Obviously any relationship is one of mutuality and we will continue to discuss that with our Philippine counterparts,” he told reporters before landing in Turkey. “That’s not new today, but that’s our alliance relationship with the Philippines.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, asked in Beijing about Duterte’s comments, said countries should not resort to win-lose mentalities.“As far as China is concerned, we think that at present in international relations we should not have Cold War thinking, it’s either you or me, you win I lose, that kind of zero-sum game,” she told a regular press briefing.“We have always developed relations with other countries in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness, mutually win-win, not aimed at, not excluding and not affecting other countries developing normal relations with each other.”Wrangling over territory in the South China Sea, where neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims, has consumed China-Philippines relations in recent years.China claims most of the energy-rich waters through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, and in 2012 it seized the disputed Scarborough Shoal and denied Philippine fishermen access to its fishing grounds.In a joint statement issued by China’s official Xinhua news agency, China and the Philippines said it was important to address differences in the South China Sea “without resorting to the threat or use of force”.(Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales in Manila, Phil Stewart in Ankara, and Michael Martina in Beijing; Writing by Nick Macfie)"

Kirkuk is located east of Hawija, a pocket still under control Islamic State that lies between Baghdad and Mosul.With air and ground support from the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi government forces captured eight villages south and southeast of Mosul. Kurdish forces attacking from the north and the east also captured several villages, according to statements from their respective military commands overnight.The offensive that started on Monday to capture Mosul is expected to become the biggest battle fought in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.The United Nations says Mosul could require the biggest humanitarian relief operation in the world, with worst-case scenario forecasts of up to a million people being uprooted.About 1.5 million residents are still believed to be inside Mosul, and Islamic State has a history of using civilians as human shields.The fighting has forced 5,640 people to flee their homes so far from the vicinity of the city, the International Organization for Migration said late on Thursday.A U.S. service member died on Thursday from wounds sustained in an improvised explosive device blast near Mosul.Roughly 5,000 U.S. forces are in Iraq. More than 100 of them are embedded with Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces, advising commanders and helping them ensure coalition air power hits the right targets, officials say.However, the Kurdish military command complained that air support wasn’t enough on Thursday.“Regrettably a number of Peshmerga have paid the ultimate sacrifice for us to deliver today’s gains against ISIL. Further, Global Coalition warplane and support were not as decisive as in the past,” the Kurdish command said in a statement.Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, addressing anti-Islamic State coalition allies meeting in Paris via video link, said the offensive was advancing more quickly than planned.Islamic State denied that government forces had advanced. Under the headline “The crusade on Nineveh gets a lousy start,” the group’s weekly online magazine Al-Nabaa said it repelled assaults on all fronts, killing dozens in ambushes and suicide attacks and destroying dozens of vehicles including tanks.In Kirkuk, Islamic State attacked several police buildings and a power station in the early hours of Friday and some of the attackers remained holed up in a mosque and an abandoned hotel.The militants also cut the road between the city and the power station 30 km (20 miles) to the north.At least eight militants were also killed, either by blowing themselves up or in clashes with the security forces, security sources said. Kurdish forces had dislodged the militants from all the police and public buildings they had seized before dawn, they said.Kurdish NTV TV footage showed machine gun fire hitting a drab two-floor building that used to be a hotel, and a car burning in a nearby street.Islamic State claimed the attacks in online statements, and authorities declared a curfew in the city where Kurdish forces were getting reinforcements.Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took control of Kirkuk in 2014, after the Iraqi army withdrew from the region, fleeing an Islamic State advance through northern and western Iraq."

He will serve in the position for 2016/17.Desai has faced conspiracy and corruption allegations since he was first selected in 2009 as a future president of the WMA.Desai has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the pending cases. He did not respond to questions from Reuters sent via email.When Reuters asked the WMA this week for an update on Desai’s legal situation, spokesman Nigel Duncan said the association had nothing more to say.“I don’t think there’s anything we want to add to what we have already said,” Duncan said. He did not answer questions about Desai’s legal cases or what the ethics body had been told about them in recent months.In one case filed in New Delhi in 2010, Desai faces charges of corruption and criminal conspiracy for allegedly being involved in a conspiracy to obtain a bribe of 20 million rupees ($450,000 at the time) from a medical college. In return, investigators allege Desai helped the school get permission from the Medical Council to add more students. When contacted last year, the college, which is not a defendant in the case, declined to comment.Desai was jailed that year and his inauguration as the WMA president was suspended. He was later released on bail. In 2013, the WMA decided to lift the suspension after receiving assurances from the Indian Medical Association, which Desai once headed.The Indian Medical Association did not respond to queries from Reuters this week.A Reuters investigation published in July last year showed that the Indian Medical Association had incorrectly told the WMA that charges against Desai had been withdrawn. Representatives of major doctors organizations accepted the information as fact. The Indian Medical Association said last year that it never misled the WMA. (http://reut.rs/1LZx8BM)The WMA had said it took questions raised in the Reuters article “very seriously” and would look into them. Later, in October 2015, the WMA upheld its decision to appoint Desai as president, without giving reasons.A source at India’s Central Bureau of Investigation said this week that the New Delhi case was still active though it was on hold due to a pending appeal in the Supreme Court. The source saidDesai still needs to appear before the district court judge during hearings.A court document dated Aug. 3 shows Desai, a urologist by training, submitted an application to seek an exemption from a personal appearance in court that day due to an illness. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 4.Proceedings in a separate case, alleging Desai was involved in a conspiracy to have the Medical Council of India allow a private medical school to add more students, were put on hold last year by a district court in northern Uttar Pradesh state until investigators obtain government permission to prosecute. Desai’s counsel in the case, Purnendu Chakravarti, said this week there was no change in the status of the case.Based in France, the WMA sets ethical standards for physicians worldwide and represents millions of doctors. Known for its pioneering work in ethics, its members include the American Medical Association and the British Medical Association. "

Caritas India, a branch of Catholic social welfare organization Caritas Internationalis, announced the launch of a program earlier this month designed to fight discriminatory attitudes toward transgender people.“Caritas is open to work with transgender people. I am even open to recruiting them,” Rev. Frederick D’Souza, executive director of Caritas India, said in a statement reported by Vatican Radio.The group’s initiative aims to combat bias by conducting outreach to transgender communities as part of its development programs, but it reveals the church’s own internal bias in the process.D’Souza said he hoped the initiative would mark the “beginning of a new school of thought,” in which Catholic leaders offer greater “attention and support” to those dealing with “sexual confusion in their body.”In the same breath, D’Souza clarified that the outreach would only go so far. By “transgender,” he said, he was referring to a group he classified as “biological transgenders,” which to him denoted those who identify with a different sex but have not undergone surgery. “We don’t want to confuse the two,” D’Souza said. “We have an opinion on those who undergo sex change, we are not in favor of that. We believe that the natural gender one is born with is what he/she is supposed to cherish and contribute to creation.”The statement reflects the Catholic Church’s complicated relationship with the trans community. In a document on family issues released in April — titled “Amoris Laetitia,” Latin for “The Joy of Love” — Pope Francis warned that “an ideology of gender” is threatening to ruin the family structure.“Creation is prior to us and must be received as a gift,” he wrote. “At the same time, we are called to protect our humanity, and this means, in the first place, accepting it and respecting it as it was created.”The pontiff also recently decried what he called the “ideological colonization” supposedly happening in elementary schools, in which children learn that they can choose their gender.Francis later clarified his position, saying, “It is one thing for a person to have this tendency, this option and even to have a sex change, but it is another thing to teach this in schools in order to change mentalities.”The Catechism of the Catholic Church, a summary of church doctrine, makes no reference to issues of transgender identity. There is one section on “body integrity,” which states that “except when performed for strictly therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations, mutilations, and sterilizations performed on innocent persons are against the moral law.”In 2000, the Vatican sent confidential letters about its stance on gender confirmation surgery to the world’s Catholic bishops, declaring that such procedures do not alter a person’s sex in the eyes of the church.“The key point is that the surgical operation is so superficial and external that it does not change the personality. If the person was male, he remains male. If she was female, she remains female,” the document stated, according to Catholic News Service.With this statement, the church revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be transgender.There are roughly 500,000 transgender people in India according to the country’s census, and activists estimate there may be many more who aren’t open about their gender identity.Despite the presence of hijras, or trans women, in ancient Hindu and Jain texts, negative attitudes toward the trans community have been entrenched in Indian society. Access to jobs, housing, health care and higher education is often a struggle for trans individuals, and a section the Indian Penal Code bars “carnal intercourse against the order of nature.” In part to combat this discrimination, India’s Supreme Court officially recognized a “third gender” in a 2014 ruling, which served as an umbrella for the country’s longstanding hijra population and other trans-identified people. This summer, Indian lawmakers proposed legislation aimed to further guarantee trans right in education, employment, healthcare and more. But activists rejected the measure which would have required trans individuals to attain identification cards in order to secure these rights.As Robert Shine, associate editor for LGBT Catholic group New Ways Ministry, wrote in response to Caritas India’s announcement, “trans communities in India remain quite marginalized.”Shine said the charity’s initiative falls short of full inclusion, but marks an important step that other faith-based organizations may follow to combat anti-trans bias.“This effort by Caritas India is hampered...by not fully understanding gender identity and expression issues at a sufficient level,” Shine wrote. “But the new program plants a seed from which loving accompaniment that is increasingly competent and informed by modern science can grow.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the Vatican issued an official stance on gender confirmation surgery to bishops in 2003. The text was likely completed in 2000, and Catholic News Service reported on it in 2003."
