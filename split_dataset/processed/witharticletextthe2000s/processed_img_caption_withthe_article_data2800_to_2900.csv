4,POLITICS,A Border Wall Like Steve King’s Model Could Be Dangerous For U.S. Agents,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-king-border-wall_us_587e57a5e4b0aaa36942bfdb,"If you’re going to build a wall, do it right.",2017-01-17,"This section of border fencing in Nogales, Arizona, is built of a series of metal beams, which allows Border Patrol agents to see through it.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e5e05170000880192a947.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of America’s toughest immigration hard-liners apparently keeps a model of a border wall in his office.Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) tweeted a photo Friday that showed the model, as well as retired Gen. John Kelly, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of homeland security, with whom King was meeting.Hopefully Kelly seeks out other opinions. The model in King’s photo appears to feature thick, opaque slabs topped with barbed wire. It’s visually impressive. But there would a big problem for anyone tasked with patrolling that wall: You can’t see through it. Modern sections of wall erected along the U.S.-Mexico border are often made of thick steel beams called “bollards,” spaced at short intervals. This kind of barrier is more of a fence than a wall, but is just as difficult for a person to pass through. A fence may seem less grandiose than a wall, but it’s more practical. If the wall is opaque, agents can’t see who’s trying to cross. More importantly, they can’t identify potential threats.In the days before the 2016 election, The Huffington Post took a tour of the border around Nogales, Arizona, with John Lawson, a veteran Border Patrol agent. Lawson told us that when he started out, the primitive fence was opaque. That was a liability for agents, and sometimes a hazard. In some instances, he said, assailants would scale the wall and try to drop cinder blocks on the agents’ vehicles as they passed below.“You need to make a fence you can see through,” Lawson said ― a remark that wasn’t aimed at any public official in particular, and that occurred months before King tweeted his photo of the model wall.When U.S. Customs and Border Protection asked for funds last year to erect additional miles of barrier along the country’s southern border, it requested metal and concrete bollard fencing specifically, according to Reuters.King’s office did not respond to a request for comment.The Iowa Republican has distinguished himself as a vocal opponent of immigration, advocating ideas like making English the official language of the United States and proposing legislation to end birthright citizenship.But his district lies several states and more than 1,000 miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border. Sometimes it shows. "

A necropsy is planned to determine Colo’s cause of death, but the zoo notes that she had a malignant tumor removed under her arm on Dec. 3.Colo, whose name was short for “Columbus, Ohio,” had just celebrated her 60th birthday on Dec. 22, which zookeepers rang in with a gifts and a cake made out of apples and tomatoes. “She was the coolest animal I’ve ever worked with and caring for her was the highlight of my career,” assistant curator Audra Meinelt said in the zoo’s statement. “It was not just about what she meant for the gorilla community but for whom she was as a a gorilla. I’m heartbroken but also grateful for the 19 years I had with Colo.”The average lifespan of a Western lowland gorilla in the wild is 35 years, according to National Geographic. And although gorillas in captivity may have longer lifespans, some primatologists and animal advocates question whether the large, intelligent creatures ethically can be kept in zoos at all.Primatologist Sarah Bluffer Hrdy told The New York Times in June that she has to “turn off” her feelings when she goes to a zoo.“Otherwise, I can’t really justify keeping great apes in cages,” she said.Colo is the second Ohio zoo gorilla to die this month. Bebac, a 32-year-old western lowland gorilla at the Cleveland Zoo, died of heart disease on Jan. 6."

Speaking Tuesday at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Xi called the pact a “hard-won achievement” that “all signatories should stick to.”He stressed that tackling climate change is a responsibility we owe to future generations, and that walking away could have serious global consequences.“It is important to protect the environment while pursuing economic and social progress ― to achieve harmony between man and nature, and harmony between man society,” Xi said.Trump, a longtime climate-change skeptic who has dismissed the phenomenon as “bullshit” and a Chinese “hoax,” has promised to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement ― a promise that did not sit well with hundreds of the world’s leading scientists or America’s business community.In September, U.S. President Barack Obama and Xi fortified commitments to reduce carbon emissions by formally joining the Paris agreement and pledging a “continued bilateral climate cooperation.” The U.S. and China are the world’s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases.As China continues its push to rein in the use of fossil fuels, most recently with an announcement to invest $361 billion into renewable energy generation by 2020, Trump has given new life to America’s oil and gas industry. He has vowed to increase America’s production of coal, oil and natural gas, as well as do away with Obama administration regulations aimed at cutting emissions.In what appeared to be a clear swing at Trump’s “America First” policies, Xi defended free trade and warned countries to “refrain from pursuing their own interests at the expense of others.”“We must promote trade and investment, liberalization and facilitation through opening up ― and say no to protectionism,” he said Tuesday. “No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.”The World Economic Forum noted in a press release that since Trump’s surprise victory, “China has emerged as a potential new leader on the global stage ― and today’s address does little to soften the impression that President Xi is taking an increasingly assertive stance on matters of global trade and climate change.”Since his election, Trump has repeatedly clashed with China, which he has promised to get tough on. In November, China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin took on Trump’s claim that climate change is a Chinese “hoax,” saying it was Republican U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ― not the Chinese ― who started the conversation about global warming. Trump sparked controversy in December when he spoke by phone with Taiwan’s president Tsai Ying-wen, breaking decades of U.S. policy with China, which claims sovereignty over the island. He has also questioned why the United States must be bound by the “one China” policy. A state-run Chinese newspaper called Trump “as ignorant as a child” in response. The president-elect, who takes office Friday, also slammed China for its seizure of a U.S. underwater drone in the South China Sea last month, calling it an “unpresidented [sic] act.”"

Video footage posted online shows her repeatedly yelling out “grab patriarchy by the balls” in both English and Spanish, while trying to evade detention by an official at the Madrid Wax Museum.Soon after, the woman was escorted away and removed from the building, according to Spanish media reports. It’s unclear whether she will face police action. The Huffington Post has reached out for more information.The Spanish branch of the global feminist organization FEMEN ― which similarly disrupted Trump’s polling station in midtown Manhattan, New York City, on Election Day — later claimed credit for the incident.“FEMEN just grabbed Trump’s statue by the balls in Madrid,” it posted on Twitter in a clear reference to Trump’s sickening hot mic comments made alongside then-”Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush in 2005. While footage of the incident went viral, the museum’s press chief described the woman’s protest as “unpleasant.”“If they want to do this, they should do it directly to him,” Gonzalo Presa told Reuters. “This is too easy.”The museum is now beefing up its general security, a spokesman told the Europa Press news agency. “Not just for Trump,” he said, but because “nowadays things occur that didn’t used to occur.”"

López Rivera spent 35 years in prison ― including 12 years in solitary confinement ― for his role in the Armed Forces of National Liberation, a Puerto Rican independence group active during the 1970s and 1980s. The group, known by its Spanish initials as FALN, committed violent acts including bombings, killings and kidnappings. But López Rivera was himself convicted of seditious conspiracy rather than an act of violence. The group was responsible for six deaths, according to Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Día, but renounced violence altogether in 1983.Puerto Rican leaders across the political spectrum have for years advocated for his release, viewing him as a political prisoner who poses no threat to the United States. “I am overjoyed and overwhelmed with emotion,” U.S. Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said in a statement. “Oscar is a friend, a mentor, and family to me and he and his brother José have been friends and mentors for my entire adult life. There were times when hope was hard to find but my wife Soraida always had faith that this day would come. Now it is clear that Oscar will rejoin his family and be able to walk free among the Puerto Rican people.”Other prominent Americans of Puerto Rican heritage issued similarly joyful statements, including “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who tweeted: López Rivera, who is now 74 and currently jailed at Terre Haute in Indiana, will be freed in 120 days. He continues to question U.S. control of Puerto Rico, an island governed as a U.S. territory, but whose residents cannot cast a ballot for president or send a voting member to Congress. “How can a Puerto Rican be seditious towards the U.S. state when we never had any part in electing a U.S. government?” López Rivera said in an interview with The Guardian in October.  Rivera plans to settle in the Puerto Rican town of San Sebastián, where he was born, El Nuevo Día reports. The news Tuesday came the same day as a round of more than 200 other commutations, including one for Chelsea Manning, the U.S. army soldier who was imprisoned for releasing classified documents to WikiLeaks.

The U.S. Coast Guard first discovered the heartbreaking scene in Hog Key Saturday morning. As of late Monday, 82 of the 95 animals, which are a type of dolphin, have died. Thirteen are unaccounted for, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Fisheries announced.“In the coming months biologists will try to determine why this happened by using samples collected during necropsy (non-human autopsy),” the organization stated in a release. At a press conference Monday, Blair Mase of NOAA Fisheries detailed the rescue efforts.“Once on scene, a response team attempted to herd some of the free swimming live whales into deeper water, however, they were ultimately unsuccessful with that effort,” Mase said. “The whales that were beached were scattered and spread out all along the shoreline and deeply embedded into the mangroves making response efforts extremely difficult.”False killer whales, which can grow up to 20 feet in length, get their name from their resemblance to orcas. They are extremely social animals and form tight pods that are known to strand themselves, according to the NOAA Fisheries website.This is only the third known false killer whale stranding in Florida, Mase said.In 1986, 28 dolphins stranded themselves in Key West.

The U.S. Coast Guard first discovered the heartbreaking scene in Hog Key Saturday morning. As of late Monday, 82 of the 95 animals, which are a type of dolphin, have died. Thirteen are unaccounted for, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Fisheries announced.“In the coming months biologists will try to determine why this happened by using samples collected during necropsy (non-human autopsy),” the organization stated in a release. At a press conference Monday, Blair Mase of NOAA Fisheries detailed the rescue efforts.“Once on scene, a response team attempted to herd some of the free swimming live whales into deeper water, however, they were ultimately unsuccessful with that effort,” Mase said. “The whales that were beached were scattered and spread out all along the shoreline and deeply embedded into the mangroves making response efforts extremely difficult.”False killer whales, which can grow up to 20 feet in length, get their name from their resemblance to orcas. They are extremely social animals and form tight pods that are known to strand themselves, according to the NOAA Fisheries website.This is only the third known false killer whale stranding in Florida, Mase said.In 1986, 28 dolphins stranded themselves in Key West. Three years later, in 1989, another pod needed to be rescued near Tampa. Mass strandings of the species have also occurred in Australia and Argentina, Mase said.

Astronaut Gene Cernan, who walked on the moon in 1972 and ended the astonishing adventure with a message of peace and hope, died at the age of 82 surrounded by his family, according to a statement NASA released Monday. “Our family is heartbroken, of course, and we truly appreciate everyone’s thoughts and prayers. Gene, as he was known by so many, was a loving husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend,” Cernan’s family said in a statement, CNN reported. His death was attributed to unspecified ongoing health issues.The retired Navy captain remained an indefatigable fighter for the space program and for other humans to have the opportunities to experience what he had. “When I leave this planet, I want to know where we are headed as a nation. That’s my big goal,” he testified before Congress in 2011.His experience in space changed his life profoundly. “I can always walk on Main Street again, but I can never return to my Valley of Taurus-Littrow [on the moon], and that cold fact has left me with a yearning restlessness,” he wrote in his 1999 autobiography, The Last Man on the Moon.“It was perhaps the brightest moment of my life, and I can’t go back,” he added. “Enriched by a singular event that is larger than life, I no longer have the luxury of being ordinary.”Cernan was a member of a very exclusive club of only a dozen men who have set foot on the moon. He and his partner, astronaut-geologist Harrison “Jack” Schmitt, were the only two men ever to sing on the lunar surface.Cernan, the commander of NASA’s Apollo 17 mission, stepped onto the moon on Dec. 14, 1972, during his third flight into space. En route to the moon, the three-man crew captured the iconic “blue marble” photo of the Earth showing Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the south polar ice cap.Cernan called the landing “the most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime.” There’s “no vibration. There’s no noise. The ground quit talking,” he recalled in a 2007 oral history recorded by NASA. “The dust is gone. It’s a realization, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there [in the] universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by ... human eyes for the first time.”He and Schmitt spent spent some 22 hours on the lunar surface over three days, collecting 250 pounds of moon samples. “In that whole three days, I don’t think there’s anything that became routine,” Cernan recalled. “But if I had to focus on one thing ... it was just to look back at the overwhelming and overpowering beauty of this Earth. I wished I could have stayed awake for 75 hours straight. I knew when I left I’d never have a chance to come back.”The final steps up the ladder back to the Challenger lunar module “were tough to make,” he added. “I didn’t want to go up. I wanted to stay a while. It’s like you would want to freeze that moment and take it home with you. But you can’t.”As he returned he said: “America’s challenge of today has forged man’s destiny of tomorrow. As we leave the moon, we leave as we came, and, God willing, we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.”Cernan was born in Chicago in 1934 and graduated from Indiana’s Purdue University in 1956. He became a Navy attack pilot before being selected for NASA’s astronaut program in 1963. Three years later, he became the second American to walk in space during a Gemini 9 flight ― something he called the “spacewalk from hell” because of several malfunctions in his spacesuit. He logged a total of 566 hours and 15 minutes in space, more than 73 hours of which were on the moon’s surface, either in the module or on the ground. Cernan eventually retired from NASA in 1976.Cernan’s last action on the surface of the moon in 1972 was to trace “TDC” — the initials of his then-9-year-old daughter, Teresa Dawn — in the lunar dust. He said he imagined someone in the far distant future would find “our lunar rover and our footprints and those initials and say, ‘I wonder who was here? Some ancient civilization was here back in the 20th century, and look at the funny marks they made.’”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said Cernan was born in 1935. He was born in 1934.

The initiative is an interview series in which women answer questions while slowly removing items of clothing to show that style is not simply about the clothes you wear but what lies beneath.In the 13-minute interview, Kirke opened up about her neuroses, fear, self-loathing and insecurities. Around the 5:30 mark, the actress and artist discussed how these feelings affected her experience of becoming a mother.“I’m very insecure about my capabilities in a lot of areas ― one of them being parenting,” she said. “I was not ready to have a baby, and I really was not thinking about what I was doing. And I was doing it almost in the same way as getting a haircut or getting a tattoo.”Kirke and her husband Michael Mosberg welcomed their daughter, Rafella Israel Mosberg, in 2010. She gave birth to their son, Memphis Kirke Mosberg, in 2012. According to reports, Kirke and her husband recently split after seven years of marriage.Reflecting on Rafella’s birth, Kirke explained, “To a lot of people, it looked like I was getting my life together. The guilt hit me the second she came out of me ... that I was her mother. I realized, I was like, ‘Oh my god, what did I just do? I just released a suffering person, you know? And they’re just gonna give me a baby.’”Holding back tears, she added, “They should really like, have more of a screening for people at the hospital before they give the baby to you.”Kirke opened up about raising a child as a young mom. “I was still going through my 20s with her as a toddler,” she said. “And there was something that felt unfair about that to her because I wasn’t ready to stay home every night. And I didn’t have the patience because I still had a lot of self centeredness.”Watch the video above for more of Kirke’s thoughts on motherhood, marriage, mental health and more."

Though Casteel does swim with dogs on the show, this particular lesson isn’t featured in the series.Casteel, who has been photographing pets since around 2007, rocketed to fame in 2012, when his captivating shots of dogs swimming underwater went viral online. Through taking photos of dogs in the water, Casteel came to realize that though most dogs instinctively know how to “doggie paddle” when they get in the water, many canines still need some instruction in water safety. In particular, dogs can be confused by swimming pools, since they’re more difficult to exit than say, a lake.“The dog has to understand that it’s not a natural body of water,” Casteel told The Huffington Post. “They see a pool and they don’t get it … they can’t just swim to the side and get out. They have to find the exit.”Casteel also works with dogs who may not be used to swimming to get them more comfortable with the water.“I love to see when a dog makes that transition, from ‘What’s going on?’ to, ‘Hey, we’re having fun,’” he said.At his lesson for spcaLA, he also enlisted the help of Ricochet, an acclaimed surfing therapy dog. Ricochet’s calm and confident nature made her the perfect “role model” for dogs who might have felt a bit bewildered by the water at first, Casteel said.Three of the dogs who participated in the spcaLA swim lesson have already been adopted, but three of them — Cloud, Salem and Harrod — are still looking for homes. You can find more information about those dogs and spcaLA here.NOTE: This post was updated to reflect the fact that this particular swimming lesson does not appear in “Finding Fido.”"

17,CRIME,You Can Help Rebuild A Mosque That Was Burned Down In America,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mosque-arson-fire-bellevue-washington_us_587cfcfce4b09281d0ebc346,"Members of the Seattle area mosque are ""overwhelmed"" by the support so far. But they need more.",2017-01-17,The Islamic Center of Eastside was destroyed by fire early Saturday morning.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587d4dc31200002d00ad7ea8.jpeg?cache=tYKRnG8Pc9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"His mosque was burned to the ground in the early morning hours of Saturday, but on Sunday night his heart was full of hope. “We are so overwhelmed,” said Imam Fazal Hassan, looking out over the crowd inside Sammamish High School in Bellevue, Washington. Some 400 people had gathered there to show support for the local Muslim community, according to mosque board member Tanvir Rahman. Hassan recounted how immediately after news spread that his mosque ― the Islamic Center of Eastside in Bellevue ― had been destroyed by fire, he received calls from the area’s rabbis, priests and pastors, all offering to help.Outside the mosque, Hassan said, other non-Muslims in the Seattle area left gifts: flowers, balloons and cookies. “They were still warm!” Hassan said of the cookies, and the crowd burst into laughter. Hassan then cited a hadith ― “He who does not thank people, does not thank Allah” ― before thanking the town’s mayor, the fire chief, the police chief, the FBI and everyone else in the Bellevue area “from the bottom of my heart.”“I thank you for all the support, love and compassion and respect you have been giving us,” he said. The crowd rose to their feet in applause. (You can see the imam’s remarks on video shot by an audience member here.)It was a moving moment, Rahman told The Huffington Post, and still more moving to know that the Islamic Center has already raised over $200,000 in donations on LaunchGood toward building a new mosque. That’s almost halfway to the $500,000 goal. “We are extremely, extremely humbled by the show of support and acceptance,” Rahman said. (You can donate here.) “I’m shaking in tears and shock right now,” Varisha Khan, a senior at the University of Washington, wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday after watching a video of her childhood mosque in flames.“This was my second home after moving to Seattle and so much of my identity was shaped from the amazing people, experiences, memories, lessons, and standing shoulder-to-shoulder in prayers here for nearly a decade of my life,” she wrote. Police have arrested 37-year-old Isaac Wayne Wilson in connection with the fire, Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett told reporters at a press conference on Saturday.After responding to the blaze at 2:44 a.m., police officers discovered Wilson lying down in a nearby parking lot. Mylett said Wilson, who is homeless, made statements to officers that implicated him in the alleged arson. There is also video evidence, Mylett said. Wilson was also wanted on a warrant in Seattle for malicious mischief. According to The Seattle Times, Hassan, the imam, said Wilson had visited the mosque last year and said he wanted to pray, but he was asked to leave after creating a disturbance and using profanities.Speaking at Saturday’s press conference, a King County assistant prosecuting attorney said he expected his office to charge Wilson with second-degree arson on Tuesday. Prosecutor Mike Hogan added there is no evidence yet that the fire was a hate crime.In a Facebook post, the Washington state chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) asked people to “not jump to conclusions” about Wilson’s motive. Nonetheless, mosques in the area have been targeted in the recent past.Earlier this month, 36-year-old Kamal Samater was arrested and charged with malicious harassment, a hate crime, for allegedly telling a man in the Islamic Center of Eastside parking lot that he was “going to assassinate everyone” at the mosque. “There is no place in America for Muslims,” Samater allegedly said. In the nearby community of Redmond, the Muslim Association of Puget Sound has had its sign vandalized twice in the last few months. Police are investigating those incidents as hate crimes. In June, after the Orlando, Florida, night club shooting, Redmond police received anonymous phone calls threatening people who worship at the Islamic Center of Puget Sound. A report last year from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, tallied at least 260 hate crimes targeting Muslims across the country in 2015. That’s nearly an 80 percent rise from 2014 and the greatest number of such crimes in any year since 2001. Mosques were targeted for vandalism, arson and other types of destruction 80 times in 2015, according to a report from CAIR. That’s a jump of nearly 400 percent from the year before.HuffPost also found nearly 400 acts of anti-Muslim violence, discrimination and political speech in the U.S. so far in 2016.Farida Hakim, a founding member of the Islamic Center of Eastside, told HuffPost that her “heart is overwhelmed with the love and support of our neighbors” since the fire. She said she was especially moved by a letter that a woman dropped off at the mosque Saturday, along with a $20 donation.“Please don’t let the actions of one person (or a nation of people who are ignorant and spiteful for that matter) make you feel unsafe or welcome,” the letter read. The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. Take a stand against hate."
18,WOMEN,Even 'The Bachelor' Can't Hide From Female Solidarity Forever,"Claire Fallon, Emma Gray, and Nick Offenberg",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bachelor-nick-viall-female-empowerment_us_587e53b3e4b0aaa36942b92c,"#LeanIn to making friends, not drama, in the Bachelor mansion.",2017-01-17,Could all these women actually be here to empower each other? Maybe.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e58ed1700002e00fdf171.jpeg?cache=93ytlxBQ2N&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Certain places exist where one simply shouldn’t go to fulfill one’s yen for egalitarian, socially conscious television.For example, “The Bachelor.” Yet on Monday night’s episode of Nick Viall’s season, telltale signs emerged that the franchise has been infected by something antithetical to its very nature: feminism.For 21 seasons, the entire concept of the show has been to exploit women’s social conditioning to compete with each other for male approval and attention, translating the resulting tension into high ratings. At the end, an appropriately feminine, beautiful, and (ideally) demure lady wins the man’s hand in marriage. (Sure, “The Bachelorette” exists, and flipping the roles is great, but it simply doesn’t play off the same long-entrenched gender scripts that the original show does.)Many feminist viewers, including myself, have argued that this rigidly traditional lens is part of the allure of the show: It allows us to critique real gender norms and dating-world absurdities in a comically overblown setting. Though we critique the show’s sexist flaws, I, at least, have never dreamed of a feminist “Bachelor.” By its very nature, the show is anti-feminist; it’s coded into the franchise DNA. A feminist “Bachelor” would be no “Bachelor” at all. (Maybe it would be “Coupled.”)The men and women who compete on the show, however, can change with the times. Last season on “The Bachelorette,” contestant Derek Peth chided villain Chad Johnson for his “misogynistic comments” ― using a word almost unheard-of on the franchise, though the concept is everywhere in evidence. Even this season on “The Bachelor,” usually the format wherein producers are best able to play women against each other for male approval and TV gold, the women have been fairly supportive of each other.Of course, there’s the necessary villain. Corinne, the 24-year-old self-described business owner with a nanny, has carved out a classic arc as the “slutty” femme fatale who demands all of Nick’s attention at the expense of the other women. The first couple of episodes, her tactics ― making out with him during their first conversation, taking her top off during a photo shoot with Nick ― drew some dismissive and slut-shaming comments from other contestants. Corinne, for her part, has plenty of misogynistic comments for other women in the house, and even herself. (It was pretty sad, for me, to hear how convinced she is that approaching a man naked with whipped cream on her breasts is the only way she could truly capture his attention.)During the third episode, however, the contestants mostly chose to handle the kerfuffle surrounding this storyline with female solidarity. Jasmine watched the younger woman pout through a date featuring the Backstreet Boys, then learned she has a nanny named Raquel who makes her bed and prepares her lunches. Finally, Jasmine announced to the camera that she’d slap Nick if he gave Corinne a rose after how she’d behaved. Violence isn’t the most enlightened response (for the record, no such slap occurred), but it’s somewhat heartening to see the women question their potential partner’s behavior and dating preferences rather than directly turning on their so-called competition. Later, Corinne and Nick hooked up in a bouncy castle (really) while the other women were nearby enjoying a pool party, and his antics became known. A bouncy castle isn’t exactly a private spot. The tipping point had been reached, and one by one, women began initiating confrontations ― not with Corinne, as often happens with “Bachelor” villains, but with Nick. Vanessa made the issue most explicit, telling him, “I’m not judging Corinne. I’m judging your actions.” It had left her questioning whether he just wanted to fool around, and she put that on him, not on another woman. It sounds simple, but it’s deeply ingrained in women to blame other women, not men, for their infidelity or wandering eyes. While we’ve seen bromances before on “The Bachelorette,” and a few close female friendships, the general atmosphere in Nick’s house of bachelorettes seems unusually and admirably supportive. Aside from Corinne, the women appear to get along ― they even appear to be pleasant to Corinne. On the second episode, she attempts to goad 23-year-old mental health counselor Taylor into a spat over time spent with Nick on a group date, but Taylor calmly refuses to get upset. (In previews, we see that this will start to devolve, but a gallant effort at staying friendly was made.) On Episode 3, Dominique realizes she’s failed to garner much attention from the Bachelor, and on her group date, she becomes emotional. Rachel, a frontrunner, pulls her aside and comforts her, giving her solid advice on calming down and making the most of her time with the man they’re supposedly competing for. Dominique then stumbles upon Rachel making out with Nick ― and despite her clearly rampant insecurity and envy, she doesn’t succumb to an impulse to trash her rival. Instead, she says that it’s hard to see, but she’s happy for Rachel.At least part of this is likely just the individual crop of women. It’s a kind, classy bunch! But in Vanessa’s pointed remark that she’s not judging Corinne, but is looking to see whether Nick wants the same things she does, there’s a clear consciousness of what female solidarity means.The mutually supportive, empowering spirit among the women remaining in the house (well, most of them) suggests she’s not alone. Whether these bachelorettes came here to make friends or not, they’re not here to hurt other women. That’s pretty refreshing.For more on “The Bachelor,” listen to HuffPost’s podcast “Here to Make Friends” below:Do people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

Díaz was one of them.The Dominican-American author took to his personal Facebook page to share the NYT profile and recount his experience breaking bread with the President of the United States.“I had lunch with President Obama on Friday, which was surreal and extraordinary to say the least,” Díaz wrote in a post on Monday. “I figured after all my criticism of his policies I wouldn’t be high on his list for anything but clearly there’s room at his lunch table for dissent, something we won’t be seeing a lot of with the next president.”And Díaz’s criticism of the president in the past has been very public. He’s condemned Obama’s record number of deportations. In a 2010 New Yorker piece, he also said POTUS’ lacked presidential storytelling prowess; though he did admit he was an “Obama man all the way.” But after his lunch meeting with Obama, Díaz had nothing but praise for the president. “What surprised me was how completely unbowed President Obama was, how certain he was that the country would find its way,” the author wrote on Facebook. “He burned with optimism and faith invincible. If President Obama could still be positive after all the Republican bullshit he’d been through―that gave me hope. He was certainly one of the most complete man I’d ever met. With only a few days left before he leaves office I find myself, more than anything, overwhelmed by the knowledge that over the next four years we’re going to be missing Obama something awful.”And the admiration is certainly mutual. Obama told the New York Times that Díaz’s writing, and that of Jhumpa Lahiri, gave him perspective by touching upon “a very particular contemporary immigration experience” with stories about “longing for this better place but also feeling displaced.” "

23,POLITICS,Politicians Honor MLK Day While Working Against The Rights He Fought For,Alana Horowitz Satlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mlk-day-republicans-voter-id-laws_us_587cf8d7e4b0e58057ffa259,"If your policies lead to voter suppression, you're not actually fighting for justice.",2017-01-16,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) speaks during the third day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587d0857170000fa01fdee28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Politicians across the U.S. marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day this year by sharing photos of the civil rights hero and remembering his fight for equality. Some of the people paying tribute did so despite having actively fought against the causes that Dr. King championed.Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), for one, has been a staunch advocate for voter ID laws. Such laws tend to disenfranchise people of color and low-income Americans, who are less likely to carry the right kind of identification. Proponents of such measures say that they help combat voter fraud, a problem that is both rare and largely not possible to prevent with voter ID laws. Critics of voter ID laws, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, compare them to poll taxes, which Dr. King marched against.Still, Walker tweeted on Monday that he was honoring “the life and legacy” of King.Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) also paid tribute to King, despite his own voter suppression controversies. Scott was criticized by civil rights advocates in the weeks leading up to the 2016 elections for refusing to extend the voter-registration deadline even with a hurricane looming over the state.“Everybody has had a lot of time to register,” Scott said. A federal judge soon reversed that decision, along with a Florida law that put strict standards on mail-in ballots. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Walker called the law an “undeclared war on Floridians’ right to vote.”Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who in 2014 signed into law major restrictions on early voting, called on citizens to “embrace [Dr. King’s] vision of equality, compassion, justice, and peace.”Last year, under then-Gov. Mike Pence (R), Indiana state police raided a voter registration center working to sign up black citizens. Pence, who also opposed a state law banning LGBTQ workplace discrimination, tweeted about MLK Day too. It’s hard not to wonder what Dr. King, who once said that “we must live together as brothers or perish together as fools,” would have thought about the vice president-elect’s record.President-elect Donald Trump and his real estate empire have a long history of discriminating against black tenants. In 1970s, the Justice Department actually sued Trump and his father, Fred, over allegations that they wouldn’t allow African Americans to live in their apartment buildings. The case was settled out of court.Trump also infamously pledged to ban Muslims from entering the country, accused Mexico of sending “rapists” to the U.S. and has nominated for attorney general Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a man who was once deemed too racist for a judgeship position. (Coretta Scott King, Dr. King’s wife, even wrote a scathing letter opposing Sessions’ 1986 nomination.)Despite this, Trump, who has received the enthusiastic endorsement of white supremacists, urged Americans on Monday to celebrate King and “all of the many wonderful things that he stood for.”"

The pieces were on view from Jan. 12 through Jan. 15, at Queens’ Knockdown Center, and, over the course of three days, sold out, raising $42,500, according to Jackson. The NYC version of “Nasty Women” is but one of several shows planned in various cities across the country. As Jackson explained in an email to The Huffington Post, a “Nasty” show in Phoenix, Arizona, that opened on Jan. 14 sold out of over 200 works in the opening night alone, raising $11,000 for Planned Parenthood.In total, the “Nasty” organizers have raised over $50,000 for the nonprofit organization devoted to reproductive health services ― and counting. The significant contribution is timely. Trump has expressed a desire to defund Planned Parenthood and “punish” women for having abortions.Jackson originally posted a callout for a “Nasty Women” group show on Nov. 14, 2016. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!! Who’s interested???” she wrote, tagging women artists, curators and writers in her circle. Soon after posting, the message went viral as artist after artist responded to and passed on the message. “I had no idea how much this would escalate and evolve,” Jackson explained to HuffPost in a previous interview. Within the first hour of posting, she had 300 responses. Jackson’s team accepted every work offered after that and, as a result, they acquired approximately 1,000 pieces by the time submissions closed. “This show isn’t necessarily about highlighting individual artists,” Jackson explained. “It’s about female-identifying artists coming together against the Trump regime.” There are currently almost 30 “Nasty Happenings” scheduled for the next two months, located mostly in American cities with a few shows set abroad. On the official “Nasty Women” website, Jackson and her team invite artists interested in organizing their own “Nasty Women” show to add their own dates, providing instructions with only one caveat: all shows adopting the “Nasty” name must donate their proceeds to an organization benefiting women’s rights. UPDATE: Tara Plath from the Knockdown Center told HuffPost that an additional $8,000 raised via tickets sales to “Nasty Women” evening performances will be donated to four organizations: Girls for Gender Equity, SisterSong, the New York Immigration Coalition, and Callen-Lorde Community Health Center."

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587d39b51700009f0a92a663.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Written by Jay Hancock and Rachel Bluth.When tiny Australian biotech firm Innate Immunotherapeutics needed to raise money last summer, it didn’t issue stock on the open market. Instead, it offered a sweetheart deal to “sophisticated U.S. investors,” company documents show.It sold nearly $1 million in discounted shares to two American congressmen sitting on House committees with the potential power to advance the company’s interests, according to company records and congressional filings. They paid 18 cents a share for a stake in a company that was rapidly escalating in value, rising to more than 90 cents as the company promoted an aggressive plan to sell to a major pharmaceutical company. Analysts said the stock price could go to $2.One of the beneficiaries was Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican poised to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates pharmaceuticals. Price told HHS ethics officials Thursday that if appointed, he will divest himself of the Australian stock as well as stock in about 40 other companies that could pose conflicts. He said he would sell within 90 days of appointment and abstain from any decision-making about companies in which he or his family has had an interest.He has already seen about a 400 percent paper gain in his investment in Innate Immuno, stock trading records show.The other and more substantial August investor was Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican from upstate New York, who along with family members owns about 20 percent of the foreign company. A key supporter of the president-elect, Collins sits on a key health subcommittee.The outlines of the stock deal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, resurrected concerns about powerful public officials gaining investment opportunities unavailable to the public, including from companies whose profits might be influenced by political decisions.A review of corporate documents raises a more unusual aspect of the deal. Innate Immuno is a foreign company which, in documents and presentations, is explicit about a business strategy targeting the U.S. market, where the amount that can be charged for a new drug is generally far higher than in other countries.Innate Immuno has hinged its strategy on winning a preliminary green light for a new multiple sclerosis drug, known as MIS416, from the HHS’s Food and Drug Administration. It says in its private placement offering documents that money raised in the U.S. will help it finance the FDA approval process, which can take years. Innate Immuno CEO Simon Wilkinson could not be reached for comment.Price’s financial disclosures show that he acquired his first small stake in Innate Immuno in January 2015, investing about $5,000. He made two more small purchases in the company that year, declaring a small loss on the stock in his 2015 financial disclosure.His largest purchase was on Aug. 31, 2016, valued at between $50,000 and $100,000, his disclosures show.Government ethics experts said this week that Price’s stake in Innate Immuno as it tries to develop a blockbuster drug would clash with his public duties, making divestiture mandatory.While ethics rules for Congress are relatively relaxed, “the minute you go to the executive branch, it’s a lot stricter,” said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who was President George W. Bush’s chief ethics lawyer.“Dr. Price takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously,” said Phil Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition. He has “complied fully with all applicable laws and ethics rules governing his personal finances.”Innate Immuno told investors it would seek “investigational new drug” status from the FDA, which could shorten the approval process. The FDA would not confirm this week whether the company has filed an application.The drug is in a small clinical trial in New Zealand due to end in April. MS drugs are especially expensive for patients, costing $5,000 a month or more.Positive trial results could set the stage for Innate Immuno’s stock to reach $2, said Australian stock analysts. In that scenario, Price’s investment of between $50,000 and $100,000 would be worth between $555,000 and $1.1 million. House financial disclosures require reporting of ranges of value but not specific amounts.“You could easily picture a drug that is in the billions of dollars in revenues, but that’s assuming the [trial] data is there,” said David Blake, an analyst at Bioshares, a newsletter covering Australian life sciences stocks. “It’s really got to deliver.”A physician who chairs the House Budget Committee, Price also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee and the Congressional Health Care Caucus. He has a history of contacting the FDA on behalf of industry campaign donors.His ownership of Innate Immuno while serving in the House creates its own appearance of a conflict of interest, ethics authorities said.“There is an appearance problem … to have members of Congress buying and selling stocks that are affected by the work of the committees they sit on,” Painter said. “It could be perfectly legal, but it looks terrible and shows lack of judgment.”Price’s Innate Immuno stake is one of more than 40 companies he identifies as potential conflicts with the HHS job, including stock in Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb.Collins, who sits on Innate Immuno’s board, has been a major shareholder in the company since 2011 and has gradually increased his family’s holdings to about 20 percent, corporate documents show. His investment in the private placement last summer was worth $720,000, according to regulatory documents.“Congressman Collins has followed all ethical guidelines related to his personal finances during his time in the House and will continue to do so,” said spokesman Michael McAdams.All told, including Price, Collins and other U.S. investors, the sale raised $1.8 million. In addition to funding the FDA approval process, the company said it would use the money to finance the clinical trial and develop potential manufacturing for the drug.All U.S. investors in the August deal received a 12 percent discount to the stock’s market price at the time, which is not unusual in private placements, said Stuart Glazebrook, a biotech analyst for Gordon Capital Research, a securities research company in Melbourne, Australia.For small companies, private issues can be more efficient than selling new public shares, he said. Selling at less than the market price raises odds of attracting investors, he said.“It’s an incentive,” he said. “It’s like Amazon offering 20 percent off today only if you commit today.”Ethics rules for FDA officials are especially strict, said Joshua Sharfstein, a former agency deputy commissioner.“For the agency’s leaders, even holding onto a single share of stock in a regulated company is prohibited,” he said.A decade ago FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford resigned and pleaded guilty to two criminal misdemeanors after being charged with concealing stock ownership in food and drug companies the agency regulated.Innate Immuno executives have talked openly about selling the company to one of a number of pharmaceutical company suitors if its clinical trial is successful. Many small pharmaceutical companies with hot drugs go that route, reaping shareholders millions in quick profits.The larger company would have the deep pockets to invest in more clinical trials that might be needed to obtain regulatory approval, analysts said.Christina Jewett contributed reporting.This piece was originally published by Kaiser Health News.This feature is a continuation of KHN’s Repeal and Replace Watch series (on Twitter @Repeal_Replace)"
26,POLITICS,Obama Declared An Emergency In Flint One Year Ago. The Crisis Isn't Over.,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-water-crisis-continues_us_587c7f05e4b0b3c7a7b2026a,"“Our water is not safe until all of the lead in all of our plumbing is gone,” said the pediatrician who sounded the alarm.",2017-01-16,"Darlene McClendon, 62, with a stockpile of bottled water at her home in Flint, Michigan, on October 11, 2016. McClendon, a 6th grade teacher, said the water crisis has only made her worry more for the future of her students. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c878a1200002d00ad7c39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One year after President Barack Obama declared a federal emergency in Flint, Michigan, over the lead poisoning crisis, experts say the city’s water system has significantly improved ― but residents still can’t drink the water from their taps, and there’s no clear end in sight.On Wednesday, researchers and public officials hosted a town hall meeting in Flint to share the latest water quality data, following a private U.S. Environmental Protection Agency summit in Chicago the previous day. They focused on progress: lead levels in water samples are easily below the threshold to comply with the federal safe drinking water standard, and have been for several rounds of testing.Other issues with water quality have improved, officials said, citing the ongoing replacement of lead pipe service lines and maintenance of chlorine residuals, a disinfectant used to kill bacteria and other pathogens.  The city’s lead pipes were corroded by Flint River water, which caused leaching and the subsequent contamination of the water supply, resulting in an ongoing public health crisis. City, state and federal groups have banded together to respond to the immediate crisis, fund long-term health and education initiatives, and eventually overhaul the city’s water system.  However, residents still need to use filtered or bottled water with no set end date and were warned that the water system wouldn’t be completely fixed for years.  “Our water is not safe until all of the lead in all of our plumbing is gone,” said Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician whose research showing increased lead levels in Flint children brought attention to the crisis. The city’s treatment plant needs more than $100 million to be up and running by late 2019 or early 2020.  An ambitious project to replace lead service lines is underway, but only a small percentage has been completed ― since March, officials have replaced the lines at 780 homes, of an estimated 20,000, said retired National Guard Brigadier General Michael McDaniel, who heads Flint’s Fast Action and Sustainability Team.McDaniel said they plan to finish almost all construction by the end of 2019, but they still don’t have all the funding needed to finish the project. Flint’s replacement efforts could be a model for other cities, he said.  “No other city … has replaced lead service lines at this rate,” he said. “We will be like we were once in the 1950s, we will be at the forefront again.”Even though lead levels meet federal standards, Hanna-Attisha said there’s a need for caution because the major infrastructure work to replace lead service lines causes disruptions that can increase the risk of lead in the water.Flint’s crisis thrust lead poisoning into the national spotlight, bringing attention to other cities dealing with aging lead plumbing and paint. In December, a Reuters report found nearly 3,000 areas around the country that had recent lead poisoning rates at least double those in Flint at the peak of the crisis. Any amount of lead is dangerous, and is a particular concern for young children, for whom lead exposure can cause developmental delays.Hanna-Attisha said the fact that Flint is not alone when it comes to lead poisoning underscores the failure of federal regulations.“The Lead and Copper Rule is weak nationally,” she said. “Children are drinking lead in their water everywhere ― nothing like what happened in Flint ― but we know that the rules in the book are not strong enough. So until the lead is gone from all of our plumbing, people need to be using filters.”The water crisis began in April of 2014, when the city stopped buying pretreated Lake Huron water from Detroit and began drawing from Flint River water, which was more corrosive. At the state’s direction, the city failed to properly treat the water. Residents began complaining almost immediately about discolored and bad-smelling water, which they blamed for health problems, but the state refused to acknowledge their concerns for over a year, and the EPA ignored early warnings.In the fall of 2015, the state told residents to stop drinking the water and the city switched back to Detroit water. Gov. Rick Snyder (R) declared a state of emergency in Flint and Genesee County on Jan. 5, 2016, and the federal emergency was announced on Jan. 16.In the meantime, lead had been found in the water and in children’s blood at elevated levels, and the county experienced an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, a respiratory illness that caused 12 deaths. Residents were eventually given filters for their taps and still have access to free bottled water, though the state is fighting a court order to deliver water to all households that need it.Schools still only use bottled water “out of an abundance of caution,” one presenter said Wednesday.Though officials touted successes and expressed optimism at Wednesday’s meeting, some residents voiced disapproval, routinely interrupting the panel by loudly crushing plastic water bottles.“I’ve got kids that are sick. My teeth are falling out,” one protester shouted. “You have no solution to this problem.” Flint Mayor Karen Weaver responded with empathy, saying residents needed space to express their feelings.  “We’re angry, and we’re scared, and we’re anxious, and we’re confused, and we sure don’t trust,” Weaver said. “I’m tired of bottles, and I’m tired of filters.”She added that she wanted to let the panelists speak so they could be held accountable.“A lot of things happened when we didn’t have a voice,” she said, “and we do have a voice now.”"

As part of a group that calls itself “Educators in Resistance,” teachers in San Francisco and Oakland have pledged not to cooperate with or normalize an administration that they think emboldens white supremacy. In meetings, which have had anywhere from 10 to 100 attendees, they’ve planned ways to fight back ― such as organizing student-teacher protests outside of San Francisco’s city hall and instating committees to organize resistance movements across local schools.And on Friday, the day of Trump’s inauguration, some plan to walk out of school with their students.The goal, according to several educators who spoke with The Huffington Post, is to create a long-term foundation for struggle against Trump and the policies he may put in place. These teachers work with immigrants and students of color who have expressed fears that the president-elect has emboldened racism and promoted hostile rhetoric against minority groups. The teachers hope their work inspires other educators around the country to similarly organize. “We’re trying to take a stand and be public and support our students, but we’re also saying we’re not going to go along with fascism and the things the Trump administration has promised, which are direct threats to a large number of the students we serve,” said Ben Rosen, who teaches government classes to 12th-graders in San Francisco and was part of the committee that helped craft the pledge of resistance.“We will teach empathy and solidarity in the face of attempts to divide us. We will teach courage and speaking truth to power in the face of intimidation and lies. We will teach critical thinking in the face of dogma and pressure to conform,” the pledge reads, in part. Rosen’s students urged him to go to Washington, D.C., this week to participate in demonstrations against Trump, and that’s exactly what he has done.Jose Montenegro, a ninth-grade social sciences teacher in San Francisco, said schools can harness social power to fight Trump.

The expansion would substantially grow the complex and include a 450-room five-star hotel, timeshare complex and private housing estate, The Guardian reported Saturday. Changes are expected to significantly boost the value of the operation to the Trump Organization. Trump’s attorney Sheri Dillon announced at his press conference last week that in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, her client has “ordered that all pending deals be terminated.” Trump is also arranging to turn over management of his companies to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, but will maintain ownership and investments in his American and global companies and real estate deals. It’s an arrangement that the head of the Office of Government Ethics said fails to meet an ethics standard met by every other president in the last four decades.Trump owns 100 percent of the Trump International Golf Links Scotland, according to the Guardian.A written statement later issued by Dillon’s law firm Morgan Lewis emphasized that Trump’s promise “prohibits — without exception — new foreign deals during the duration of President-elect Trump’s presidency.”It added: “Specifically, the Trust and The Trump Organization will be prohibited at all times ... from engaging in any new deals with respect to the use of the ‘Trump’ brand or any trademark, trade name, or marketing intangibles associated with The Trump Organization or Donald J. Trump in any foreign jurisdictions.”But now Trump’s transition team insists that the golf resort expansion doesn’t constitute a new deal.“Implementing future phasing of existing properties does not constitute a new transaction so we intend to proceed,” a spokeswoman told the Scottish Sunday Herald.Richard Painter, a former White House chief ethics adviser to George W. Bush, called the situation a “perfect example” of obvious conflicts of interest that Trump will apparently continue to attempt to obfuscate.“He’s using language which is ambiguous. It clearly illustrates that around the world, he will simply expand around the various holdings and as they continue to expand, the conflicts of interest expand,” Painter told the Guardian. “It’s like [the board game] Monopoly: if you have one house on Boardwalk, it’s not a new deal to go for three hotels on Boardwalk.”Trump’s Aberdeenshire golf resort is particularly notable because it dramatically raised early fears about his conflicts of interest — and concerns that he would push his own business interests as president ahead of what might be best for the public. In a meeting with British politician Nigel Farage shortly after Trump’s election, Trump complained that planned offshore wind farms providing environment-protecting alternative energy would mar the views at his course. He encouraged Farage and his entourage to lobby against the farms.Scottish residents protested against Trump when he visited last June because of how he handled the golf resort development. Neighbors are suing him because he built a fence blocking a sea view at the house of homeowners who refused to sell to him, and then sent them a bill for it.“You watch, Mexico won’t pay either,” homeowner David Milne told the New York Times.The Guardian has reported that Trump hasn’t paid UK taxes on his courses in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry in Ayrshire because he has lost nearly $31 million on his Scottish golf empire on an investment of some $123 million.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that the Aberdeenshire Council had approved Trump’s application for a second golf course and more housing on his resort. It is processing the application. "

As we, and many other outlets, have previously written, he has long been a voracious reader of everything from contemporary literary fiction to classic writings by American statesmen. His collegiate stabs at poetry were well-circulated during his first presidential run, and his two books of nonfiction have been bestsellers. But fiction?In a thoughtful new interview with The New York Times’ book critic Michiko Kakutani, Obama discussed the short stories he wrote as a young man, giving rare insight into his artistic side. As a community organizer recently out of college, he told Kakutani, he wanted to hold onto his love for writing and storytelling despite his choice of a policy-driven career path. Like many aspiring writers, he said, “I would come home from work, and I would write in my journal or write a story or two.”This isn’t a brand-new revelation; rumblings of Obama’s past life as a story writer have surfaced before. In 2012, writer Michael Lewis profiled the president for Vanity Fair and later told CNN that the two discussed Obama’s youthful forays into the world of fiction. “He tried to submit short stories to literary magazines, and they’re very literary short stories,” Lewis said.In Kakutani’s interview, we get some fascinating details about Obama’s work. Writing short fiction, he told The New York Times, allowed him to sort through the sometimes disparate strands of his identity and arrive at a healthy sense of self:For me, particularly at that time, writing was the way I sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life — race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole.What kind of fiction would a young Barack Obama write? Apparently exactly the kind you’d expect:It’s interesting, when I read them, a lot of them had to do with older people.Melancholy and reflective? Sounds an awful lot like a certain speech he recently addressed to the nation.He even revealed some tantalizing details about specific stories he wrote, which we’re now dying to read:One story is about an old black pastor who seems to be about to lose his church, his lease is running out and he’s got this loyal woman deacon who is trying to buck him up. Another is about an elderly couple — a white couple in L.A., — and he’s like in advertising, wrote jingles. And he’s just retired and has gotten cranky. And his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over.We may never read these short stories, but let’s remember a few key facts: 1. Obama has said he plans to write a book after leaving office.2. Which is happening in a matter of days.3. After leaving the presidency, George W. Bush graced our eyeballs with the fruits of a foray into painting that pleasantly shocked the nation.4. Anything is possible.For more on Pres.

He is going to be, in a few days’ time, the most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the United States government, and I think he has to recognize that his words do have impact.”Brennan accused Trump of being naive about the threat Russia poses to the U.S., and said that the president-elect’s apparent lack of confidence in his own intelligence community could embolden the nation’s enemies.“If he doesn’t have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries?” Brennan asked.Trump’s tweets on Sunday marked the first time he’s called out a member of the intelligence community by name.Trump had earlier accused “intelligence agencies” of leaking the 35-page dossier on alleged Trump-Russia relations, and compared their actions to those of Nazi Germany.“What I do find outrageous is equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany,” Brennan said Sunday. “I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly.”The unsubstantiated report concerning Russia and Trump, prepared by a former British spy, contains unverified embarrassing allegations about the president-elect. Trump learned of the report from intelligence leaders last week when he and President Barack Obama were presented with information on Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential campaign. The report on Trump’s alleged activities in Russia had already been circulated among politicians and members of the media.Trump also took the opportunity on Sunday to again blast one of his favorite targets: NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” Alec Baldwin reprised his Trump impersonation Saturday in a spoof “recreation” of the president-elect’s press conference last week. The bit included several jokes about the “pee pee party,” a reference to a particularly salacious allegation that appears in the unverified report."

He had earlier said a second Canadian and a Colombian had been killed in the attack. One of the dead died in the stampede to exit the club, he added.Pech said the shooter escaped and was still at large. He added that the shooting was not being investigated as an act of terrorism.The Canadian government confirmed that one of its citizens had died and said it was investigating the reports of a second Canadian death.Pech said the incident began when a person entered the Blue Parrot nightclub armed around 3 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Monday morning, during the closing of the festival. Another person tried to stop the person, sparking a gunfight that drew in security staff.The shooting represents a major blow to Mexico’s tourism industry, which has been one of the few bright spots in the economy thanks to a weak peso exchange rate.Tourists are generally shielded from the drug violence that has ripped Mexico apart over the last decade, killing well over 100,000 people since 2007.Pech said 15 people were injured, of whom 7 were still in hospital. The state government said in a statement that one person was in grave condition. Four people were arrested on suspicion of being involved in the incident.Pech said two of the dead were BPM security workers but the festival said in a statement that three members of their security team were killed. BPM said the shooting was carried out by a lone shooter.Quintana Roo and the surrounding Yucatan peninsula have traditionally been less violent than other parts of Mexico, with relatively low murder rates. However, with many foreign tourists and a vibrant night life scene, there has long been an important local drug market in and around Playa Del Carmen, which is just south of the popular resort of Cancun.REGIONAL CHAOSThe organizer of an electronic music event near Playa Del Carmen told Reuters that armed men who claimed to be part of a drug cartel turned up recently at one of his parties, demanding access to sell drugs.The event’s security team decided to let them enter so as to avoid conflict with the men, the organizer said, adding that there were now cells from all the major Mexican cartels operating in Quintana Roo, a wealthy region full of tourists.The organizer said the situation in Quintana Roo deteriorated after the political party controlling the state government was forced out in local elections last year, a shift that can spark violence as criminal groups struggle to realign their allegiances with the incoming political class.“They’re all fighting for control of the region,” said the organizer, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals. “This is an aggression toward any promoter of electronic music in Mexico. It’s a wound for the entire community.”He added that he thought BPM would have to end, and feared for his own events in the region.PANIC ON THE STREETSVideos purportedly shot at the scene shown on television and social media appear to show dancers ducking for cover and running out on the streets to safety.“This is a very, very sad situation. Tryna get my head around it still. Thoughts and condolences to all affected,” Scottish DJ Jackmaster, who was performing at BPM, said on Twitter.The BPM festival, which was entering its 10th year, has grown to be one of the biggest electronic music events in the world, with top DJs flying in every January to play the clubs of Playa del Carmen along Mexico’s Caribbean coast.In recent years, Mexico’s Caribbean coast has drawn a growing number of DJs and fans of electronic music to the beautiful, balmy region, looking to escape the frigid European and North American winters.(Reporting by Gabriel Stargardter and David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Alan Crosby)"

Yellow fever is spread by the same mosquito that spreads Zika virus, dengue fever and chikungunya. Brazil’s ministry of health has deployed teams to the state to help investigate the outbreak, kill mosquitos (the virus is mosquito-borne) and immunize residents, all in the hope of containing the outbreak to Minas Gerais. States that border Minas Gerais could experience large outbreaks, WHO notes, because they harbor the Aedes mosquito and the population is not immunized at all against yellow fever, as these areas were previously thought to be low-risk.The country is still recovering from the Zika virus outbreak, another mosquito-borne disease that infected an estimated 214,193 people and resulted in the births of 2,366 infants with congenital Zika syndrome from 2015 to 2017.Minas Gerais has experienced yellow fever epidemics before; the last one was in 2002 to 2003, when 63 people got the fever and 23 people died. Other Brazilian states have experienced more recent outbreaks; from 2008 to 2009, Rio Grande do Sul had 21 confirmed cases and nine deaths, while Sao Paulo had 28 cases and 11 deaths. Because the yellow fever vaccine can come with rare but severe side effects, only people who are living or traveling through high-risk areas should get vaccinated. Serious side effects can include deadly allergic reactions, nervous system diseases and diseases that infect internal organs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, during Brazil’s 2008 to 2009 yellow fever epidemics, the country reported six deaths and 45 cases of neurotropic disease as a result of the widespread vaccination campaign that immunized over 5.5 million people. These outcomes, while rare, are the reason yellow fever vaccine is not universally recommended. Yellow fever itself is much more serious. The majority of people infected will have only a mild illness, which includes symptoms like fever, chills, headache, body aches, vomiting and weakness. However, about 15 percent of patients will get more severe symptoms, which include high fever, jaundice, bleeding and multiple organ failure. Of those who get this severe form of yellow fever, 20 to 50 percent could die, according to the CDC. There is no cure for yellow fever, and the only recommended treatment is rest, pain relievers, fever reducers and drinking plenty of water. Yellow fever can spread across borders and through international travel. In 2016, Angola suffered an endemic yellow fever outbreak, reporting 345 deaths and 3,317 suspected cases in a final count in June. The fever also spread to the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo, which at final count tallied 63 deaths and 700 suspected cases. A handful of cases also popped up in China and Kenya in travelers who had recently visited Angola. "

As of Friday, he’s responsible for that relationship.”Trump said in an interview with the Times of London and the German newspaper Bild that Merkel had made “one very catastrophic mistake, and that was taking all of these illegals,” referring to the Syrian refugees and other migrants the country took in. The president-elect has frequently derided Syrian refugees as a “Trojan horse” for terrorists ― and once officially proposed banning all Muslims from entering the U.S., but later said he would like to ban people from certain countries, mostly majority-Muslim ones. Trump isn’t the president yet, which means the Obama administration is still in charge of foreign policy ― even when the president-elect makes it difficult. When Merkel responded to Trump, she stressed that he hadn’t taken office yet. “I’m waiting for his inauguration, as is proper,” she said in Berlin, Politico reported. “Then we’ll work with him on all levels. He has just stated his positions, which have been known for quite some time. My positions are also known.”Kerry said he thought Merkel “was extremely courageous” in her response to the refugee crisis and that the Obama administration “valued her leadership enormously.”“I think we have to be very careful about suggesting that one of the strongest leaders in Europe and most of important players with respect to where we are heading made one mistake or another,” Kerry said of Trump’s comments. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to be commenting on that.”Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It crashed when trying to land in poor visibility at 7:31 a.m. (0131 GMT).The doomed plane plowed on for a few hundred meters (yards) through the Dachi Suu village, home to hundreds of families, shattering into pieces and damaging dozens of buildings.Plumes of smoke rose above the crash site, with some mudbrick buildings razed to the ground and others pierced by parts of the plane.The torn-off tail assembly, rotated upside down, towered above a one-story house. A football pitch-sized area nearby was completely leveled and covered with twisted pieces of metal.Locals said they had initially thought the area was struck by an earthquake.“Around seven o’clock in the morning I heard a strong swat (noise) and after that all the nearest houses were shaken,” said local resident Andrei Andreyev.“Of course, everyone got frightened and started to run out of the houses to the street. Nobody understood what was going on because there was a fog, the weather was not good.”Initial estimates put the death toll from the crash at 37, said Kyrgyzstan’s emergencies ministry. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev announced Tuesday would be a national day of mourning.Turkish Airlines said in a statement that the cargo flight was operated by ACT Airlines and neither the Boeing 747-400 aircraft nor the crew belonged to Turkish Airlines.Turkish cargo operator ACT Airlines also said the jet was theirs.“Our TC-MCL signed plane, flying on Jan. 16 from Hong Kong to Bishkek, crashed on landing at Bishkek at the end of the runway for an unknown reason,” ACT Airlines said in an emailed statement."

The reports could not immediately be confirmed.Dozens of people have previously been detained in connection with the attack for which Islamic State has claimed responsibility, saying it was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.On Jan. 1, the attacker shot his way into the Reina nightclub then opened fire with an automatic rifle, reloading his weapon half a dozen times and shooting the wounded as they lay on the ground.Turks as well as visitors from several Arab nations, India and Canada were among those killed in the attack.Horasani was described as being of Uzbek origin by the Haberturk website, which said he was caught at a housing complex in Esenyurt district, on the European side of the city.There were three people in the apartment where he was caught, the home of a Kyrgyz friend of his to which he had gone three days earlier, Haberturk said.According to state-run Anadolu news agency, five people were detained in the operation, including the alleged perpetrator, a man of Kyrgyz origin and three women. It said simultaneous raids were being conducted on other cells linked to the group.The shooting in Istanbul’s Ortakoy neighborhood, an upscale district on the Bosphorus shore, came after a year in which NATO member Turkey was shaken by a series of attacks by radical Islamist and Kurdish militants and by a failed coup.One security source said in the wake of the attack that the gunman appeared to have been well-versed in guerrilla warfare and may have trained in Syria.President Tayyip Erdogan has said the attack, which targeted a club popular with local celebrities and moneyed foreigners, had been being exploited to try to divide the largely Sunni Muslim nation."

Library borrowing is cheap, it prevents you from filling your home with stacks of finished books, and it functions as way to show support for a pillar of civic life.Then again, shopping for discount reads on Amazon is so much easier these days.Just open your laptop, browse through the new bestsellers, and click “Buy.” But changing your book-procurement method doesn’t have to be too onerous, with a browser extension called Library Extension. Install it on Google Chrome and it will pull up listings of the books you’re scoping out on Amazon at your local libraries. (Where, again, they will be free to borrow.)The extension, which also works on a few other sites, including book-tracking community Goodreads and Barnes & Noble, does a neat role reversal on the old problem of showrooming.When Amazon, with its quick shipping and rock-bottom prices, rose on the book-selling scene, brick-and-mortar bookstores noticed that customers were coming in to browse their offerings only to turn around and buy the books they selected online, at a discount. Book Court, the store mentioned by author Emma Straub in a 2011 Time piece on showrooming, shuttered late last year. But via Library Extension, this practice is turned on its head: Web users browsing for their new read from their couch can quickly locate copies of the book they want locally, and choose to support a nearby library instead.Though not all libraries appear to be on the extension, reviews suggest that the app’s developers are prompt about responding to requests to add more local branches. Wrote one, “A friend told me about this and they didn’t have my library. I sent them a request and my library was added within 5 hours!!”Reviews of the extension, overall, are glowing, with an average rating of 4.5 stars. One librarian wrote, “There is such value in sharing materials, and this app will help the members of my community save their hard-earned money. In a poverty-stricken area like mine, this is essential to leading a happy, healthy, productive life.”Amazon has already decided to dive into the bookshop pool with stores opening in several cities over the past year, and more planned. If libraries are the new competition, maybe an Amazon local library will be the next step.H/T Bustle"

John Lewis (D-Ga.) a “racist pig” on Facebook over the weekend. Tommy Hunter, a Republican on the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners, wrote two Facebook posts about Lewis and “Demonrats” on Saturday and Sunday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Both were deleted as of Monday morning.The posts came after Lewis, a leader in the civil rights movement, told NBC that he does not “see this president-elect as a legitimate president” because of U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump win. Trump then lashed out against Lewis, and Hunter followed suit. “John Lewis is a racist pig,” Hunter wrote on Saturday, according to a screenshot posted by the Journal-Constitution. “There ain’t one political pundit that didn’t say on November 9 that this would be Demonrats EXACT response to Trump winning. Like I heard Rush, I believe say, Demonrats DO NOT live in reality. They believe polls were right and THE REAL VOTES were wrong. What a bunch of idiots.”Gwinnett Democratic Party Chairman Gabe Okoye told Atlanta’s Channel 2 Action News, “Mr. Hunter is a disgrace to Gwinnett County and Georgia. I call on Mr. Hunter to resign immediately. I call on all Democrats to contact Mr. Hunter with the same message.”Hunter, who told a television reporter that his words were “inappropriate,” however said, “We don’t resign because of something somebody says.”Hunter, who did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the “racist pig” remark was “probably an overreaction out of aggravation.” “While I am grateful for what the Congressman did in Selma and other times during the civil rights movement, you get respect by showing respect,” Hunter told newspaper. “He is using his fame as a way to continually divide the races and in this case standing on the very much unsubstantiated claim that the guy I voted for [Trump] is racist and only won because of Russians hacking the election—which, of course, we all know didn’t occur.”On Monday, Hunter told WSB-TV in Atlanta, “I didn’t mean it to be derogatory. I meant it to make him mad.”On Sunday, Hunter also wrote that “Lewis’ district is drawn to keep him in power. His wins are all illegitimate.”Gwinnett County, where Hunter serves, has been accused of district-drawing problems of its own. Civil rights groups and voters filed a suit against the county in August 2016 accusing it of violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ― which Lewis fought for at the time, even suffering beatings by police in a march to demand equal access to the polls.The lawsuit alleges that the county drew district lines that make it harder for minorities to be elected. The entire Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners is white, as is the County Board of Education.

John Lewis (D-Ga) via Twitter backfired. Big time.The president-elect responded to Lewis’ statement to NBC News on Friday that he was not a “legitimate president” by tweeting that Lewis was an inactive congressman whose district was “crime infested” and “falling apart.” Many people, including Democrats, Republicans and residents in his district, immediately came to Lewis’ defense on social media and noted that Trump’s argument couldn’t be further from the truth. Support for Lewis didn’t stop there. Soon after Trump’s tweets, sales of the National Book Award recipient’s two graphic civil rights novels and memoir skyrocketing, shooting up to three of the top five bestselling slots on Amazon over the weekend. March, his graphic novel trilogy set, went from 451st place to No. 1, a 76,000 percent increase according to The Hollywood Reporter. Walking the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement moved up 8,699 places to No. 2, according to The Guardian. The first book in the March trilogy landed at No. 5 on the list by Sunday.His 2012 book about lessons he’s learned as an activist, Across That Bridge: Life Lessons and a Vision for Change, made a huge jump, from 34,480 to 175 in the overall bestseller list. That Trump attacked a civil rights icon, who marched alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma, on Martin Luther King Day weekend is, unfortunately, not a surprise. The support pouring in for Lewis, however, is inspiring and on par with the respect he deserves."

She gave birth to a child in May of 2015.Authorities said Mendez, who is a citizen of Guatemala, fled to his home country shortly after learning about the girl’s pregnancy and was extradited to the U.S. ahead of his trial.

Part of the job description is also shaping public opinion. And we were very effective, and I was very effective, in shaping public opinion around my campaigns,” he said. “But there were big stretches, while governing, where even though we were doing the right thing, we weren’t able to mobilize public opinion firmly enough behind us to weaken the resolve of the Republicans to stop opposing us or to cooperate with us. And there were times during my presidency where I lost the PR battle.”One of those times was the passage of the Affordable Care Act, particularly the individual mandate. Republicans seized on it, relentlessly pledging to repeal the law.Last week, with control of both chambers of Congress and an incoming Republican president, both the Senate and the House took initial steps toward Obamacare’s repeal, which would jeopardize health insurance coverage for over 20 million Americans.President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he intends to repeal and replace the law “essentially simultaneously ... on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour.” However, Republicans have continually failed to present an alternative plan, and some GOP members of Congress are wary of repealing the law without a replacement.Obama also struggled to convey the magnitude of his economic recovery policies. As HuffPost’s Sam Stein reported last year, residents in places such as Elkhart, Indiana, which received federal funding through Obama’s stimulus package, were unaware that they had benefited from his efforts.Time will tell if his media-savvy, image-obsessed successor will be a better salesman of his policies. So far, Trump has been adept at promoting even the smallest victories, like convincing Carrier to keep about 800 jobs at its plant in Indiana, and often gives himself credit for things that he did not do."

So I’m going to have some catching up to do in terms of how day-to-day things operate.”For his post-presidential plans, Obama has bandied about various areas of interest, including writing a book, developing his presidential library and promoting issues about which he is passionate, from championing grassroots organizing to building the Democratic Party’s next generation.“I am looking forward to getting out of the bubble,” he said Sunday. “I am glad that I’m leaving this place at a relatively young age, at 55. So I have the opportunity for a second ― maybe even a third ― act, in a way that I think would be tougher if I were, you know, the age of some presidents when they left.”When asked what he will do on Jan. 21, Obama was more certain.“Well, here’s one thing: I’m not setting my alarm,” he said. “That I’m certain of. That I am absolutely positive of. I’m going to spend time with Michelle, and you know, we got some catching up to do. We’ve both been busy.”"

The announcement comes five weeks after The New York Times published a data analysis showing that precinct detectives in the Bronx, on average, carry more than twice the case load on violent felonies than their counterparts in Manhattan and Staten Island.Al Baker and Benjamin Mueller of The New York Times spent a year writing about every single murder in the 40th Precinct of the Bronx. While the murder rate has dropped to all-time lows in many other parts of New York City, this precinct, a mostly black and Hispanic community, has seen persistent violent crime. Usually these types of stories are fodder for tabloids ― Man Fatally Shot, Brother Injured ― with scant information about the victim, beyond their gender and circumstance of death. But at the beginning of 2016, The New York Times decided to go deeper than the basics, to tell the story of each victim’s life ― and death. Baker and Mueller, along with other reporters, immersed themselves in the community, spending time with the deeply traumatized families and the severely under-resourced police department.The Huffington Post talked to Mueller and Baker about what it was like to report these stories. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length. What was the seed of the story? Did you pitch it or did an editor?Al Baker: It was a group decision. There was a desire to tell the story of crime in New York in a more meaningful way than in an annual end-of-year recap. Benjamin Mueller: It’s always been a struggle to write meaningful crime stories. For a daily story, it’s hard to get depth on who the victim was. We rely on coded cues from the police, a signal to the reporter that there was some sort of criminal activity. These stories mean nothing to the reader and you end up writing 350 words on a person who got killed, but it tells nothing about the victim, who they were and why they were killed.AB: For this series we had a goal: We wanted to figure out why the murder happened and what the police were doing about it.So many murders get skipped by the press. It’s a big city. For this series we decided not to skip any. We wanted to treat each story as a big long tale, like we would for a story about a cop killing. We decided to treat them all as big stories worth our attention. How did you begin?BM: We had to figure out where to write about first. We worked up files on precincts where crime is still high. We came up with two precincts in the Bronx and Brooklyn. We also researched what the neighborhoods were like, the demographics, the type of public housing. AB: We needed something manageable. We knew we had a 12-month period and we knew how deeply we wanted to report each story, the murderer and the murdered. We didn’t want to get caught in the same trap of giving each story short shrift. We needed to find a place where crime was persistent, but also a place we could manage journalistically.What tipped it over to the Bronx?BM: We waited for the first homicide of the year. It was in the Bronx. A woman had been killed in the hallway outside of her apartment. We started trying to get to know her and her family. We had a lot of trouble learning about the man who killed her. He had had mental health difficulties for a while.We tried to put the murder into context, the challenge of predicting when mental illness might become violent. The challenge of living in public housing. A lot of people are fearful. They triple-lock their doors. The don’t talk to reporters, the police or their neighbors. We tried to understand the government institutions who helped the victim or the mentally ill.AB: Ben went back up there a week later and found they still hadn’t cleaned up the blood. The victim’s friends and family were on their hands and knees cleaning it up with cleaning supplies, scrubbing blood off the floor. It was such a haunting reminder of how quickly people are forgotten by the city. These horrific tragedies are unseen. Imagine someone in that much anguish has to go through that and no one witnesses it. It’s hard to imagine that happening in many places in the world, really.How did you build trust with the victims? AB: It’s time. That’s what journalism needs.BM: People are used to reporters showing up for a day and then disappearing. Being there for the third or fourth day didn’t by default make them open up, but it did get them to be more trusting.I hung out for hours and hours in the lobby where one victim’s friends were building a memorial, picking up new things about him, who his friends were. Beyond time, it is also the accumulation of information, learning something from court documents or public records. And then we’d bring back that information to the victim’s family and friends and they see you’re not coming to them blank. You are coming to them with information.AB: Information builds. You become such an authority in some ways, they become invested in wanting to inform you even more. Now they know why it’s important for them to speak, to put into context the past, to try and shed light on what their loved one endured.Ben, you tell people, “We are here and we need you to help us understand what went wrong,” and we would just keep coming back. We had the luxury of being able to say, “Just think about it, we’ll be back.” And by the time we came back, we had read the court file or talked to the cops, and sometimes we had information they didn’t even know. Then they were invested in explaining and we were invested in getting it accurate and getting at the nuance. We had time to gather more information, and we had the trust of our editor. He had confidence in our ability to tell the story, and we had his backing and his support of us in these pursuits.BM: We understood why they didn’t want to talk to us. We knew we were showing up at the most horrific time possible in their lives.What was it like getting the police’s point of view of the story? AB: I spent a lot of time with them. It’s the same principle. They’re people like everyone else. And just as it was important to spend time with the relatives of the dead, it was just as important to spend time with the people who were charged with trying to make sense of it from a societal point of view, the crime of it.BM: I think you put it well. It’s a kind of police work that doesn’t get a lot of attention. The detectives are spending every waking minute to give justice to these families. We rarely tell the story of that aspect of what they do. They’re telling the victim’s family what next steps there are. They’re helping them make sense of what happened. The police spend more time than anyone else in the city trying to understand what happened to the victim. Their work deserved to be told.Go Behind The Scenes With Other Reporters: Every week, HuffPost Must Reads features a behind-the-scenes look at how long-form journalism is made. We go under the hood.

A recent report at Reuters suggests Trump’s transition team is now moving forward with this plan.Voiding DACA will have an immediate impact on individuals and their families. Children could be pulled out of school, higher education will no longer be within reach for many young adults, and “sanctuary spaces,” offering both legal and moral protection, may become a means of last defense.As an educator, I can’t help but wonder how many generations will be affected by this in the future. I’ve personally experienced how the effects of our immigration and citizenship laws can affect families for generations.My grandmother was stripped of her U.S. citizenship; she never went to school. My father grew up in a home with undocumented parents; he dropped out of high school. Years later, I am still playing catch up; I’m a third-generation Mexican American who is finally a first-generation college graduate.My Nana’s undocumented life – despite having been born in the US – scarred my father and now colors my own experience half a century later.Like my Nana, many of our nation’s undocumented are “Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.” If President-elect Trump goes forward with his plan to deport people, chances are the effects of this decision will harm families for generations.My Nana’s Undocumented LifeMy Nana’s life story is not that uncommon. She was born in Southern California, got married, and together with her husband worked and raised a family.But taking a closer look, her story becomes a cautionary tale. My Nana was born in a work camp for Mexican railroad workers. Because of a discriminatory law, she lost her U.S. citizenship when she married a Mexican migrant. For most of her life, she was undocumented – a woman without a country – all while living and working in her native state, California.She was one of the many women who were considered “disposable citizens” under the 1907 Expatriation Act. Per the statute, which deprived women of independent citizenship, “Any American woman who marries a foreigner shall take the nationality of her husband.”For her, our nation’s immigration and citizenship laws must have seemed like a baffling maze of xenophobia and gender discrimination.My Nana would see the US enter WWI, WWII, and the Korean War before calling the INS to ask about her lost citizenship. In a letter dated December 28, 1951, an official wrote back: “It would appear that you again became a citizen of the United States on July 2, 1940, in accordance with legislation effective that date (54 Stat. 715m 8 U.S.C. 9(a)).”By that time, she had lived through several waves of anti-Mexican hysteria, including the infamous deportation raids in Los Angeles County during the Herbert Hoover Administration. In her home, like in other Mexican American homes, Hoover was despised for taking out Depression-era angst on Mexicans.Is it any wonder my Nana kept the letter from the INS in her purse? It was her proof of U.S. citizenship.Hoover TowerYears ago, after my Nana passed away, my father came to visit me while I was a visiting scholar at Stanford University. He asked me about the campus’ most visible architectural landmark, the Hoover Tower. Most parents would feel proud if their child were at a prestigious university. Yet, as I explained that the tower was named after Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover, my father became upset and said: “That #$@&%*! tried to deport my mother!”I had always known about my Nana’s story. But it wasn’t until that moment that I realized the depth of pain caused by these policies.Striking is the amount of time she was forced to live without U.S. citizenship: she was legally expelled for 26 years plus another 11 years while she didn’t know her status. Had her husband been racially eligible for citizenship the Cable Act might have cut her expulsion to eight years.Getting an education was impossible for my Nana. When my father dropped out of high school, it must have seemed natural, considering neither of his parents had ever gone to school. For better or worse, this history has profoundly shaped me as a scholar and a professional.Election 2016Before the election, undocumented students relied on a complex web of federal, state, and local policies to enroll at universities. Immediately after the election, campuses across the nation vowed to support undocumented students. The bottom line is, like Hoover, President-elect Trump has a narrow view of who counts as “Americans.”In December, I became an ally for AB540 and undocumented students at UC Irvine. Seeing today’s post-election climate through my family’s history, it was important for me to learn how to support our students.To be sure, some will say: “Get over it.” But this is my family’s experience. These policies have left a mark. They’ve had an adverse ripple effect over time.Likewise, this isn’t to suggest that Trump’s proposed policy is unique. As relatives in both my mother’s and father’s families can attest, the threat of deportation has been a mainstay for many generations of Mexican Americans, whether one has labored as a bracero during the 1950s, as my uncle did, or one has had to navigate SB 1070, the most recent in a long line of anti-Mexican laws in Arizona, as my mother’s cousins do today.Recently, the President-elect has said he will “work something out” for Dreamers. But his pick for attorney general suggests otherwise. In the Senate hearings on Jeff Sessions’ nomination, the nominee has made it clear that the Trump administration “plans to throw DACA immigrants to the wolves.”The effects of our immigration and citizenship laws go on for generations. I hope, as the inauguration draws near, that President-elect Trump will take a moment and consider this."

Olivia Higgins, founder of Queerly Elementary, and other parents have 11 tips to help families navigate the process of attending a protest. 1. Explain why you are protesting. Discuss with your family values with your children and how these are motivating you to attend the march. Many marches or demonstrations have written mission statements that can be used to frame your discussion. Focus on what you are marching FOR instead of what you are marching against. Saying, ""We are demonstrating against unjust wars,"" can be turned into, ""We are marching because we believe in peace.” Marching for a cause may make children feel more connected to the goals of the march. Bear in mind that children often misunderstand what they are hear and take things literally. If a child hears, ""we must fight against this injustice,"" they may think that they are preparing for a physical fight. Saying “we are marching for justice” is not frightening and is empowering. 2. Create child-friendly signs. Help your children think of appropriate slogans and consider making signs with slogans to which children can relate. A simple peace sign or simply “Be Kind” can keep your signs on-message and age-appropriate. Encourage your child to design his own sign to feel more involved and create excitement about attending the protest. Wooden paint stirrers that can be picked up at your local hardware store are the perfect size for little hands. Mount your card stock sign securely to the paint stirrer with duct tape and hold a practice march around the block. Most children will not hold a sign for very long, so be prepared.3. Plan for children’s needs. Have everyone in your group use the bathroom before the protest begins and bring water, snacks, and sunscreen. Dress for the weather and wear layers. Children may start off a bit cold but warm up quickly once they start walking. Backpacks work well so your hands will be free.4. Bring cash. Large crowds frequently bring out small mobile vendors who are selling trinkets, water, snacks and anything else you can imagine. Many times they only take cash. If the march you are attending will take you far from your starting point, you may also want cash to take a taxi, bus, or metro back.5. Sit back and watch. If a child is getting tired over stimulated move to the side, take a seat and watch the other marchers for a few minutes. If you are unable to remove yourself from the situation, have your child focus on something they can control: watch people’s feet as we walk by, sing a song together, find something to count, etc. Also, know that participating in a march doesn’t always require marching. You may also find a great deal of inspiration, humor, and excitement through people watching. If you think your child may not last very long in a march consider attending just the beginning or end of the march. Your presence will still be noted and appreciated!6. Check in with your child: Ask open-ended questions that allow for a broad response before, during, and after the event. Some questions you may want to ask are: What was the most memorable part of the day?; What surprised you?; What questions do you have? Sharing what your own thoughts and observations will encourage your child to do the same. Also, because many children process information over time they may have questions, observations and concerns a week or two after the event. Remember to check-in with other adults as well to decompress and get their impressions of the march.7. Wear matching outfits, t-shirts, or hats: Wearing matching clothing will help you easily identify the members of your group, especially if you are unexpectedly separated. Dressing children in brightly colored clothing can help identify them more easily in a crowd.8. Know when to leave. Remove your family from the event moment you start feeling as though the mood of the protest is heading in a direction that is making you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Don’t wait to see what will happen. Go with your instinct. If you are with children, do not engage if you are faced with direct opposition, keep calm and move away from the situation.9. Plan for separation. Have a clear plan about what to do if you become separated from your child. Plans might including finding a police officer or official safety volunteer, going into a store to speak with an employee in a uniform, or going into a fire station. Children should have two reliable numbers memorized or easily accessible, such as tucked away in a pocket. One should be of a landline of someone not at the march in case cell service is interrupted. Or, write the numbers on their arm with a sharpie.10. Sometimes it is better not to take the children. If you think the march will be simply too much for your child, if you think it may turn violent, or if you are so passionate about the cause that you may not be able to parent your child in the way they need, you may decide to not take your child. Occasionally the march organizers may plan for childcare.11. Be prepared: Many marches provide list a schedule of events, march route, and other important information. Familiarize yourself with official plans so you can be flexible. Some marches may have safety guidelines about the types signs or size of bags that are permitted and it’s helpful to know about these in advance.By bringing your children to a protest you are helping to shape them into involved, concerned, civic-minded citizens. With a little preparation, there is no reason why children can’t join adults in having their voices heard."
48,POLITICS,Imagine What Obama Could Have Accomplished Had He Had The Support of Congress,"David Fagin, ContributorWriter, musician, Trump Resister, food snob",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/imagine-what-obama-could-have-accomplished-had-he-had_us_587b10e8e4b03e071c14fdca,"As we careen, head-on, toward Jan. 20 like a locomotive with no brakes, the best tweet/meme I’ve seen that humorously captures",2017-01-16,<p>President Obama during his farewell speech.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c9c7e1700001903fded04.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As we careen, head-on, toward Jan. 20 like a locomotive with no brakes, the best tweet/meme I’ve seen that humorously captures the sheer dread the overwhelming majority of us are feeling re: our new President-elect, comes from Us Weekly contributor, Wendi Aarons. In which, she said:“It’s like America’s amazing dad is leaving us and mom’s new perverted boyfriend just pulled up in his Trans-Am.”That about sums it up for me. As Mr. National Embarrassment, himself, and his Legion of Doom prepare to take the helm and, by all accounts, proceed to steer us straight into an oncoming iceberg ― an iceberg so massive you can see it from Jersey ― I realize, now, more than ever, how much I’m gonna miss my Dad.The one thing that could actually stop our new President-elect from steering the ship into that iceberg, i.e., the same thing that pretty much cut President Obama’s legs out from under him each and every time he tried to legislate for real change and managed to gut and hack away at everything he tried until it was just a shell of what it could have been ― I’m talking about our Congress ― will actually aide him in sinking the ship.The Republicans, once again, control the House and The Senate. But now, for the first time in decades, the President will have their support. Quite tragic, really. Because, imagine, if you will, what these guys could have accomplished with a President like Obama if they actually cared about anything but themselves? Ah, what’s the use?Not only will President-elect Trump have the support of Congress as he attempts to dismantle what’s left of our national pride/respect, banking regulations, global warming policies, NATO, world peace, etc., he will also, no doubt, use his aggressive “You’re on the list, buddy!” style to turn most of them into his obedient puppets for fear of reprisal. When you think about it, it’s kind of fitting mom’s new boyfriend’s named ‘Don,’ as he’s the spitting image of a mafia Don, in both personality and posture. The fact that he’s a completely inexperienced political hack, with no actual policy ideas, should make for an interesting next four years, for sure.In ‘08, when President Obama took office, Senators McConnell and Boehner (remember him?) openly stated their only goal ― their only focus in the next four years ― will be to make sure Obama is a one-term President. And, while they obviously failed at their deplorable quest, over the next eight years, they succeeded at using their power and influence, along with the rest of the GOP, to see to it that, if they couldn’t get him out, they’d politically castrate him every chance they got. Which is why it’s truly a miracle, and a testament to the man’s fortitude and, most importantly, patience and dignity, he was able to accomplish all the things he’s done for this country.Forget for a moment that a statement such as that from Sens. McConnell and Boehner, two of the nation’s highest ranking policy makers, was akin to an admission of treason to the oath they swore to uphold when they took office, one McConnell continues to betray with every breath he takes, they did everything they could, regardless of whether compromise of some form would have been in the best interest of The People, to see to it that our President failed. And, still, against all that opposition, he didn’t. In the end, in spite of, and because of, their despicable tactics, Obama’s come out the victor, while the lot of the GOP emerged as nothing more than what they are; petty, infantile school children, not worthy of an office in a library, let alone positions as important as the ones they hold.Now, imagine Trump in those shoes. A situation where the Democrats attempt to hinder, hamper, and destroy every-single thing the man attempts, over and over and over again, for the next eight years, and succeed. I doubt our President-elect would last a week before strangling Bernie Sanders and declaring war on some third world nation as a direct result of his displaced aggression. “Who can we bomb? I need to bomb someone! I’m in charge here and I say we bomb someone!”Luckily for Mr. Trump - and unlucky for us - he won’t have that problem. He won’t have to show us, as well as the rest of the world, his ability to remain calm and composed on a daily basis while dealing with the most incredibly sensitive and stressful situations. After all, if we’ve learned one thing at this point, it’s that Trump’s ability to handle stress gracefully is about as absent as I was from physics class my senior year.I’m not saying I support every choice our outgoing President has made,. I differ with him on many issues and think he’s made some major mistakes, i.e., taking about six and half years to realize the GOP was not interested in working together, and rather, preferred a street fight on every issue, letting the banks off the hook, not prosecuting Bush/Cheney - at least Cheney - for war crimes, appointing a former Monsanto exec. to oversee the FDA, and, of course, refusing (so far) to pardon Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, but, in light of the opposition he’s faced at every turn, looking back, it’s amazing he was able to do what he’s done for health care, for the economy, and, of course, after being left with the biggest mess in the history of our country, i.e. Iraq/Afghanistan, etc., as janitor.And, c’mon, after having been through eight years of a non-stop dogfight with some of the most despicable men/women on God’s green earth, how many of us would be able to say we still look like we could step into a Dos Equis commercial on a moment’s notice?Translation: The man’s forgotten more about class/character than Donald Trump will ever learn, and he continues to improve on that point as each day approaches, signaling the end of his tenure. So, as we watch our awesome ‘Dad’ head on down the driveway for the last time, ne’er to return, and prepare for the mess that is Mom’s new boyfriend, we, the kids, must now make every effort to stick together and refuse to allow this douchebag to hurt mom, in any way. It won’t be easy, but, for the foreseeable future, we seem to be stuck with the jerk. Fuzzy dice and all. "

They are now",2017-01-16,U.S. President Barack Obama (C) makes briefs remarks to the news media at the beginning of a cabinet meeting. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is in the upper right.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587d4dab170000880192a6d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Eight years ago, when our kids were 7, 4 and 1, their dad started work in the West Wing of the White House. They are now high school, middle school, and elementary aged kids. None of them have clear memories of their dad’s professional life prior to these eight years. As our time in the White House comes to a close, I’ve thought a lot about what they have learned from this experience, aside from witnessing long hours and missed family events. It will be awhile before they understand the importance and intricacies of policies made in the Obama administration, even though the immediate impact of these years is already apparent. They’ve had unique opportunities, like meeting Justin Timberlake and playing basketball at Camp David, that any kid would remember. But the life-changing opportunity has been meeting countless talented, hard-working men and women who make up our federal government, not just in Washington but across the country.We met just a small number of the more than 4 million permanent employees in the federal government and I’m not naïve to think that every employee is extraordinary. But those we did meet – and they were many, from all walks of life – are remarkable public servants. Several, in fact, have served as role models for our children. These are experts who could have worked fewer hours, for more pay, in more hospitable surroundings in the private sector. They chose instead the federal government. Judging from the ridicule they endure from Congress and the intermittent pay freezes that have had their salaries grow at less than inflation, they surely didn’t select this for fame or fortune. Watching them work and hearing their pride in that work makes clear that they did it because they want to be part of something bigger, to look out for the public, and work on behalf of its security, opportunity, and freedom. And from what my kids have seen, federal employees are doing that. Our kids saw National Park rangers, stewards of the world’s largest collection of federal lands and national parks, who shared what young people can do as Junior Rangers to help protect our natural resources, and explained to us their work to control invasive species and combat the effects of fire and drought.They met members of the Armed Forces who, as we learned in visits to Fort Belvoir, Fort Mead, Joint Base Andrews, Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, and the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery, dedicate years to the intense training, teamwork and reverence for their fellow comrades at arms that undergird the best military in the world. And we have seen our friends over these eight years move their families at least every three years― just one indication of the intense sacrifices military families endure to make our military work. They got to know researchers at the National Institute of Health (NIH) who talked to us about the new treatment options they are working on for patients with life threatening diseases whose options have been exhausted and hope for a healthy outcome otherwise beyond reach.They learned from State Department employees who discussed youth exchange programs they have with over 160 countries, and programs that empower girls and women around the world.They met doctors and nurses at the Veterans Administration and Walter Reed who discussed increased knowledge about and development of new brain treatments benefiting our wounded troops – and which at the same time advance our understanding of other brain injuries and concussions in children like them.They have been greeted by political and career staff of the White House who showed us – and 4.5 million other visitors over the past eight years – the beauty and history of the president’s home. They saw a staff that includes a pastry chef who organized the baking of over 25,000 elaborately decorated holiday cookies each December, butlers who have worked for first families for several decades, establishing trust with presidents and their families, and a ground’s crew that treats the eighteen acres of the White House ground as lovingly as they would their own home. And our kids spent time with Secret Service agents and Uniformed Division officers who never complained about being away from their families over holidays, and whose hard work allowed so many to meet their president and first lady at events around the country.Our kids experienced a core part of what makes this country strong: a federal government made up not just of institutions, but of people who make the institutions work. If more Americans could see what we’ve seen, I am confident they would respect and value that this federal government is not made up of faceless bureaucrats but of passionate, committed, and talented patriots. That is a lesson from one mom and three kids that I hope will reverberate for families across the country.Kari Hillstrom McDonough is the co-founder of Vets Community Connections.

I’m not a person who is accustomed to making losing bets, and this one was about as sure a wager as I’d ever encountered. Here was a supremely qualified candidate running first against a foe-of-the-week plucked by the media from a field of Keystone Cops who turned tripping over their own shadows into an art form. Then she found herself running against a man who, simply put, was the most abominable figure to ever run for our country’s highest office. How could she lose? Well, we now know that black swans are indeed native to the United States. While sadly, Mrs. Clinton’s political career may be over, the Democratic party lives on – with a future, at the moment, that is by no means bright. Zombie movies show more signs of life. The challengers to Mrs. Clinton for the party’s nomination did not at the end of the day provide an appropriate alternative as determined by the voters, there appears to be no one on the horizon, at the moment, at least, who offers a compelling argument against the kind of guttural populist appeal, despicable though it may be, that Mr. Trump is making. (True, Bernie Sanders gave her a run for my money, but let’s not forget that, until the primary season, Mr. Sanders was not a Democrat.)Like many of my friends and associates, I am a life-long Democrat. We have a rock-solid commitment to supporting the political party that we so strongly believe offers the most promising vision of America, one that recognizes the proper role of government, the importance of compassion and the value of diversity. We are committed – after a period of sober wound-licking ― to rejoining the fight against a retrograde administration that has vowed to roll back everything we won over the past eight years.But supporters need a commitment from the Democratic Party before they will be willing to open up their checkbooks. We are not asking for much. I still believe the Democratic Party remains the party of the future of the country in its appeal to the middle class, minorities, urban concerns, issues of fairness and equality and the like. Republicans who fail to recognize that they owe their current good fortune to the electoral equivalent of an appendix – a vestigial organ better out than in – are more arrogant than the Democrats who thought all Mrs. Clinton had to do was show up to win. No, the Democratic Party is still the right vessel on the right course, but it has taken some hits that require urgent repairs. Among others, they are: 1. Reorganize the Democratic National Committee under new long-term leadership. The former DNC head, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, got a raw deal in the WikiLeaks scandal and in the long run did not provide a unifying role. The committee now needs an equally strong captain to take decisive steps at the national level to unify the party and engage new faces in constructive dialogue – including people from rural America and, at the risk of seeming self-serving, more people from the business world, both of whose voices often seem unwelcome.2. Have the new blood establish a set of policy priorities that can unite the party and bring it to more of a centrist position. No more pandering to the ultra-liberal wing in an attempt to neutralize the right. As we saw in the latest election with the candidacy of Jill Stein, and in 2000 with Ralph Nader, the far left votes how it wants no matter what the party platform – to devastating effect.3. Rebuild the party at the local level to cultivate the national leadership of the future. Most importantly this means making sure no race, no matter how small, goes uncontested even if it means supporting candidates who are long shots to win. After all, DNC stands for Democratic National Committee, not Don’t Not Challenge!4. Adequately prepare to seize the initiative before the next redistricting takes place after the 2020 election. Involve many key gubernatorial and state legislative officials over the next several years to prepare ballot initiatives to create independent commissions before we are preempted by the GOP. 5. And finally, here’s something we can learn from the president-elect: Party officials should think like entrepreneurs. They should be prepared to take risks and be open to new ideas, while avoiding the beltway bias that convinces them that others around the country don’t know as much as they do about policy, politics and how to win elections. As a venture capitalist, I invest in people and ideas that are fresh, vibrant and willing to disrupt the market. As a political donor, I like to see the same energy in the people I support."

John Lewis (D-Ga.).“Donald Trump won this election fair and square,” Pence said on “Fox News Sunday.” “While I have great respect for John Lewis, particularly his contributions to the civil rights movement, I was deeply disappointed to see someone of his stature question the legitimacy of Donald Trump’s election as president and say he’s not attending the inauguration, and I hope he reconsiders both positions.”Lewis said on Friday that Trump is not a “legitimate president,” referring to intelligence reports of Russian interference in the election. Lewis added that he will not be attending Trump’s inauguration. It will be the first one he’s missed since he was elected to Congress in 1986.“I hope that John Lewis, and some others who have joined his plans to take a pass on the inauguration, will rethink that and will be with us and celebrate this extraordinary moment in the life of our nation and the life of democracy,” Pence said on Sunday.Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Lewis’ comments are “insanity,” “wrong” and “disappointing.” “We need folks like John Lewis and others who I think have been champions of voter rights to actually recognize the fact that Donald Trump was duly elected. He’s going to put his hand on the Bible in five days,” Priebus said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think it’s incredibly disappointing ― and I think it’s irresponsible ― for people like himself to question the legitimacy of the next United States president.” “Putting the United States down across the world is not something a responsible person does,” Priebus added. Trump himself took to Twitter Saturday to slam Lewis, saying the civil rights icon is “all talk, talk, talk ― no action.” Host Chris Wallace asked Pence on Sunday if Trump could “really say that about the man who got his head cracked open walking across the bridge in Alabama on Bloody Sunday.”“Donald Trump has the right to defend himself,” Pence said. “When someone of John Lewis’ stature … to use terms like this is not a legitimate president ― it’s just deeply disappointing to me, and I hope he reconsiders.” Pence then, oddly, claimed that Trump was really talking about the “generations of failed policies coming out of Washington, D.C.” instead of making the assumption that a black congressman was representing a failing district. (It’s not failing.) “Donald Trump is a man who is profoundly impatient with failure, and you saw in the campaign, he went to major cities in this country and said we are going to bring safety to our streets,” Pence said.  “You remember that great line ‘what the heck do you have to lose?’ He is committed to bringing all the people in this country jobs and prosperity in ways that the failed liberal policies of the past several generations have not,” he said.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also voiced concerns about Trump on Sunday, telling ABC’s “This Week” that Americans should be concerned about the president-elect because of his racist past.“We all remember that Trump was one of the leaders of the so-called birther movement trying to delegitimize the presidency of our first African-American president, Barack Obama, which is an outrage,” Sanders said, adding that the focus should be on holding Trump accountable. This post has been updated with comments from Sanders and Priebus."

Then he looked the other way as that industry polluted.",2017-01-15,Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. His confirmation hearings begin Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587ba41d170000850192a2b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With his nomination hearing just a matter of days away, Environmental Protection Agency administrator nominee Scott Pruitt is facing allegations that he gave a regulatory pass to polluters who in 2010 helped elect him Oklahoma’s attorney general.A new investigation by the Environmental Working Group advocacy organization revealed that Pruitt received more than $40,000 in campaign donations from executives and lawyers who represented poultry companies named in a lawsuit brought by Pruitt’s predecessor, Drew Edmondson.That lawsuit, filed in 2005, accused the companies — including Tyson Foods — of polluting the Illinois River basin with runoff from chicken manure spread over land in northeastern Oklahoma. While the lawsuit was concluded about a year before Pruitt took office, the judge never issued a ruling in the case and Pruitt never issued an appeal for the matter to be resolved.In a comment to The Oklahoman newspaper last year, Pruitt explained his inaction on the case by saying that “regulation through litigation is wrong in my view. That was not a decision my office made. It was a case we inherited.”In total, the EWG report noted that more than half — about $21,700 — of the poultry industry cash received by Pruitt’s campaign in 2010 came from Tyson executives or lawyers representing Tyson. All told, the poultry donations totaled about 4 percent of the approximately $1 million raised by the campaign.That number includes $7,500 from Tyson’s former general counsel James Blair and his wife Nancy, $5,000 from former Tyson CEO and current chairman John Tyson and another $5,000 from former Tyson CEO and board member Don Tyson, who passed away in 2011.In a statement issued to The Huffington Post, Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman noted that Tyson did not, as a company, contribute to Pruitt’s campaign, but added that “our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels, and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit.”As the EWG report notes, the contributions also preceded Pruitt’s dismantling of the Oklahoma environmental protection unit that cut the unit’s funding from $463,000 the year he took office to zero two years later. While a Pruitt spokesman told the New York Times that environmental cases are still being handled by the state solicitor general’s unit, Edmondson noted to the paper that prosecution of environmental crimes in the state are still down due to the unit’s erasure. Ken Cook, president of the EWG, described Pruitt’s acceptance of those contributions and his action on Oklahoma’s environmental protection unit as a “disturbing” indication of his broader stance on environmental protections.“Very clearly, this is someone coming in [to lead the EPA] with an ideology to deregulate at whatever government level he finds himself,” Cook said. “There’s no saying that ‘we just have a different philosophy’ about who should enforce environmental law. The philosophy, if it exists, is that environmental policy shouldn’t be enforced at a state or federal level.

56,POLITICS,Trump's EPA Pick Went Easy On Industry That Backed Him: Report,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-poultry-contributions-lawsuit_us_587960bae4b0e58057fee7bd,"Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt accepted over $40,000 in campaign cash from people in the poultry industry. Then he looked the other way as that industry polluted.",2017-01-15,Runoff from chicken manure generated from Arkansas poultry operations including Tyson Foods' has allegedly contributed to pollution of the Illinois River watershed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587bc16c1200002d00ad7af5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With his nomination hearing just a matter of days away, Environmental Protection Agency administrator nominee Scott Pruitt is facing allegations that he gave a regulatory pass to polluters who in 2010 helped elect him Oklahoma’s attorney general.A new investigation by the Environmental Working Group advocacy organization revealed that Pruitt received more than $40,000 in campaign donations from executives and lawyers who represented poultry companies named in a lawsuit brought by Pruitt’s predecessor, Drew Edmondson.That lawsuit, filed in 2005, accused the companies — including Tyson Foods — of polluting the Illinois River basin with runoff from chicken manure spread over land in northeastern Oklahoma. While the lawsuit was concluded about a year before Pruitt took office, the judge never issued a ruling in the case and Pruitt never issued an appeal for the matter to be resolved.In a comment to The Oklahoman newspaper last year, Pruitt explained his inaction on the case by saying that “regulation through litigation is wrong in my view. That was not a decision my office made. It was a case we inherited.”In total, the EWG report noted that more than half — about $21,700 — of the poultry industry cash received by Pruitt’s campaign in 2010 came from Tyson executives or lawyers representing Tyson. All told, the poultry donations totaled about 4 percent of the approximately $1 million raised by the campaign.That number includes $7,500 from Tyson’s former general counsel James Blair and his wife Nancy, $5,000 from former Tyson CEO and current chairman John Tyson and another $5,000 from former Tyson CEO and board member Don Tyson, who passed away in 2011.In a statement issued to The Huffington Post, Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman noted that Tyson did not, as a company, contribute to Pruitt’s campaign, but added that “our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels, and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit.”As the EWG report notes, the contributions also preceded Pruitt’s dismantling of the Oklahoma environmental protection unit that cut the unit’s funding from $463,000 the year he took office to zero two years later. While a Pruitt spokesman told the New York Times that environmental cases are still being handled by the state solicitor general’s unit, Edmondson noted to the paper that prosecution of environmental crimes in the state are still down due to the unit’s erasure. Ken Cook, president of the EWG, described Pruitt’s acceptance of those contributions and his action on Oklahoma’s environmental protection unit as a “disturbing” indication of his broader stance on environmental protections.“Very clearly, this is someone coming in [to lead the EPA] with an ideology to deregulate at whatever government level he finds himself,” Cook said. “There’s no saying that ‘we just have a different philosophy’ about who should enforce environmental law. The philosophy, if it exists, is that environmental policy shouldn’t be enforced at a state or federal level. It is industry unrestrained.”The Illinois River watershed is cleaner today than it once was.

John Lewis (D-Ga.) has made it very clear that he is not a fan of President-elect Donald Trump ― so much so that he wouldn’t even invite Trump to visit Selma, Alabama, with him.“I would not invite him to come,” Lewis said during a wide-ranging interview with “Meet the Press” on Sunday.In 1965, Lewis, a civil rights icon whose work led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of that year, was badly beaten on Edmund Pettus Bridge during Bloody Sunday. He often visits the city with politicians from both parties, and has even been there with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush went to Selma with Lewis and others to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in 2015.Lewis said on Sunday that he would not try to stop a Trump visit and that maybe the president-elect would leave Selma better off than when he came. “Well, by going to Selma, like President Bush, President Clinton, President Obama, maybe he would learn something,” Lewis said. “Maybe he would get religion.” Lewis and Trump have been sparring with each other since last week. On Friday, the civil rights icon said Trump is not a “legitimate president,” based on reports of Russian interference in the 2016 election. He added that he will not attend Trump’s inauguration, making it the first one he’s missed since his election to Congress in 1986. Trump responded to Lewis via Twitter, saying the civil rights legend is “all talk, talk, talk ― no action.”Lewis told “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd that it would be “almost impossible” for him to work with Trump since he does not see the president-elect’s win as legitimate. Later in the interview, Lewis said he agrees with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who proposed establishing a special committee to investigate allegations of Russian interference in the election. Todd asked what, if anything, Trump could do to get Lewis to work with him. “You know, I’ve had an opportunity to meet with every president since President Kennedy, except President Nixon. I met with President Nixon when he was out of the White House. And it’s painful. It is hard. It is difficult to see our country come to where it is today,” Lewis said. “There’s a whole body of people in America today that believe there was a conspiracy, a deliberate, systematic effort to destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and place this person in the White House,” Lewis continued. “There were outside forces.” "

In an interview with The New York Times, the “Trainwreck” director suggested Trump will run the country like the reality competition show “The Apprentice,” which he so famously hosted.“I watched an enormous amount of ‘The Apprentice,’” Apatow said. “Donald Trump sits in his office. He sends his kids to watch the teams do their missions. Then they come back and tell him what they think of it and then he makes an impulsive decision based on the information that Donald Jr. or Ivanka give him. That’s how he’s running the country.”Apatow noted that he wasn’t particularly surprised when Trump won the election because, as he has stated before: the funniest candidate always wins. “I said it as a joke, but I think there’s something to it,” he said. “Reagan was funny. Bill Clinton was funny. Bush was funnier than Gore. Obama was funnier than probably anybody who’s ever run for office.”In terms of Trump, Apatow thinks the former “Apprentice” host “has a demented sense of humor” and “is way funnier than Hillary Clinton.”Apatow, a Clinton supporter, did make a point of expressing his thoughts about where the former secretary of state went wrong in her campaign, saying she “made a few enormous mistakes.”“One of those mistakes, to me, was that you can’t get paid that much for speeches and go back into politics,” he said. “That has to be your victory lap — you cash in, you do the speeches and you’re done.” With Trump being sworn into office on Friday, Apatow plans to alter the way he opposes the president-elect. “I don’t think it serves a purpose to be against him,” he said. “It only serves a purpose to fight issue by issue.”To read more from Apatow’s interview, head over to The New York Times.

Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and several other members of Congress addressed the large crowd that had waited in long lines in below-freezing weather to attend the event. Many who have received health insurance thanks to the ACA shared their emotional stories as well.When Sanders finally took the stage after his colleagues, the roar of the audience and chants of “Bernie, Bernie Bernie” made it clear that for many in the crowd, the Vermont senator was the main attraction. Sanders’ political action nonprofit, “Our Revolution,” live-streamed the event on YouTube and Facebook.“This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” Sanders said. “It is time we got our national priorities right. The United States today and I hope everybody in America understands it: We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right!”True to his democratic socialist form, Sanders, who won an upset victory against Hillary Clinton in the Great Lakes State presidential primary, went beyond defending the ACA.“So our job today is to defend the Affordable Care Act. Our job tomorrow is to create a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system,” he exhorted the crowd.There were some 70 similar rallies across the country, according to Sanders. Photos on social media show significant crowds in Portland, Maine; Richmond, Virginia; Tampa, Florida; Boston, New York City and many other metropolises.Other grassroots efforts suggest that the prospect of the ACA being repealed is finally mobilizing Democrats and their allies to take unified, concerted action. The progressive organizations MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and People’s Action reported that they were holding 500 “resist Trump” meetings on Sunday.And on Saturday, over 100 people angry about ACA repeal packed Republican Rep. Mike Coffman’s constituent meeting in Aurora, Colorado. It was a scene that resembled past politically effective moments of protest, including the raucous anti-ACA town hall meetings in the summer of 2009. Coffman only let people speak to him in groups of four at a time, then sneaked out a side entrance earlier than the event officially ended.Head over here to learn about protest events scheduled for inauguration day this Friday."

The new U.S. administration will not be able to abandon it,” Araqchi told a news conference in Tehran, held a year after the deal took effect.“Nuclear talks with America are over and we have nothing else to discuss,” he added.“It’s quite likely that the U.S. Congress or the next administration will act against Iran and imposes new sanctions.”Under Iran’s agreement with the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, most U.N. sanctions were lifted a year ago. But Iran is still subject to an U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions, which are not technically part of the nuclear agreement."

Forensic investigators will begin identifying the corpses on Monday, they added.Police surrounded the prison overnight, but waited until noon to enter because of reports that inmates remained armed and out of their cells. Nine inmates injured in the clash were taken to hospitals near the Alcaçuz facility, officials said.As with other prison riots across the country earlier this month, almost all the inmates killed were decapitated, with some bodies being partially burned, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. Police have identified the six prisoners who led the riot and may transfer them to federal prisons, the person said.Behind the bloodshed in some of the nation’s prisons is an escalating feud between some of Brazil’s most powerful drug gangs, which ended two decades of an uneasy working relationship about six months ago.“There is no confirmation of this, but all the recent riots across Brazil might have created an incentive for this one,” said Wallber Virgolino, the state’s justice secretary. “Our state had never seen such a bloody prison uprising.”Brazil’s deadliest jail uprisings in decades have exposed growing turf wars between São Paulo-based gang Primeiro Comando da Capital, or PCC, and the Rio de Janeiro-based Comando Vermelho that risk plunging a chaotic penitentiary system deeper into violence.Their split, which is thought to have happened last year, has unleashed a war with state prisons as their epicenter. The Rio gang has teamed up with five fellow groups around Brazil to counter the PCC’s growing might.The last time that Brazil witnessed such a long span of drug-related violence was in May 2006, when the PCC unleashed attacks across the state of São Paulo.According to the newswire service of O Globo newspaper, the PCC was the drug faction behind the killings in Alcaçuz, a facility outside Natal, the capital of Rio Grande do Norte state. Alcaçuz has about 1,150 prisoners and capacity for 620 detainees.Part of the fourth pavilion of the Alcaçuz prison, where the uprising broke out, was damaged as prisoners set fires and damaged pipes and electricity wiring. There is no timetable for a remodeling of the pavilion, Virgolino added.Earlier on Sunday, Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes vowed to extend financial and security support for Rio Grande do Norte to prevent further prison uprisings. Moraes authorized the state to use some of the 13 million reais ($4 million) wired in recent days to upgrade and acquire prison equipment."

Frank was also born in Frankfurt, signaling a possible connection between the two families.The statement continues:While it is not known if Cohn survived the harsh conditions in the Minsk ghetto, her pendant reached Sobibór sometime between November 1941 and September 1943, when the ghetto was liquidated and the 2,000 Jewish prisoners interned there were deported to the death camp. There, along the path to the gas chambers of Sobibór, the pendant belonging to 14-year-old Karoline Cohn was taken, dropped, and remained buried in the ground for over 70 years.“This pendant demonstrates once again the importance of archaeological research of former Nazi death camp sites,” Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologist Yoram Haimi said in the statement. “The moving story of Karoline Cohn is symbolic of the shared fate of the Jews murdered in the camp.”Sobibór was one of several Nazi death camps ― places where Jews were sent specifically to be exterminated. Although open only a little more than a year ― from March 1942 until October 1943 ― more than 165,000 Jews died there. Nazis then closed the camp and attempted to erase any trace of it.Experts are now trying to get in contact with Cohn’s relatives for more information, the statement said."

A spokesman told Reuters such reports were speculative and did not comment further.After May said in a TV interview last week that post-Brexit Britain would not be able to keep “bits” of its EU membership, the pound fell sharply as the comment was interpreted as signaling a clean break from the EU’s single market - the biggest destination for British exports.In the Brexit negotiations, the EU is likely to insist on freedom of movement for its citizens in return for full access to the single market, but many of those who voted for Brexit did so precisely in order to be able to restrict immigration.EU TRADE WARBritish finance minister Philip Hammond was quoted on Sunday as saying the country could change its economic model to regain competitiveness if it were to leave the EU without an agreement on access to the single market.His comments, from an interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, were interpreted as a warning that Britain could use its corporate tax rate as a form of leverage in negotiations.“He appears to be making a sort of threat to the European community,” said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s main opposition Labour Party. “It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future.”Nevertheless, Corbyn said he would not block the triggering of ‘Article 50’ - the legal process of leaving the EU. An upcoming legal ruling might insist that May gets parliamentary approval for her plan to trigger Article 50 by the end of March.In an article in the Sunday Times, Brexit minister David Davis wrote that Britain would consider ways to extend or smooth the exit process to provide certainty for businesses.“If it proves necessary, we have said we will consider time for implementation of new arrangements,” he wrote."

The American people see right through it.”Earlier in the interview, Pence said the campaign was focused on things other than Russia.“All the contact by the Trump campaign and associates was with the American people. We were fully engaged with taking his message to ‘Make America Great Again’ all across this country,” he said.During his first press conference since winning the election, Trump ignored a question from a reporter last week asking if there had been any contact between his team and Russia. Instead he said that Russia will have “much greater respect for our country” once he takes office. Pence also addressed Trump’s comments that the intelligence community is attempting to undermine him and that the release of a dossier obtained by intelligence agencies is reminiscent of Nazi Germany. “The very fact that a few organizations, not this one, trafficked in opposition research and this salacious garbage, I think was deeply troubling to millions of Americans,” Pence said. Pence was also asked about Trump’s suggestions that he would lift sanctions against Russia, calling America’s “terrible relationship” with the Kremlin “a failure of American diplomacy in successive administrations.” “What the President-elect is determined to do is explore the possibility of better relations,” Pence said. “We have a common enemy in ISIS, and the ability to work with Russia to confront, hunt down, and destroy ISIS at its source. It represents an enormously important priority of this incoming administration.” “What you’re hearing in his reflections ― whether it be with Russia, whether it be with China, whether it be with other countries in the world ― is that we are going to re-engage,” Pence added. “We are going to put America first. We’re going to put America’s interest first, but we’re going to re-engage in a way that advances America’s interests in the world and advances peace.”This post has been updated with more detail from Pence’s comments."

The airports tallied 158 strikes per year in the five years before the Hudson River accident and an average of 299 per year in the six years after it — even though tens of thousands of gulls, starlings, geese and other birds were killed after the emergency river landing. At Kennedy Airport, which routinely killed birds before Sullenberger’s crash because it’s on a major migration route, the number of reported strikes has also increased — though the number of birds killed has dropped slightly.The killings — and statistics — are disheartening to bird lovers. “There has to be a long-term solution that doesn’t rely so extensively on killing birds and also keeps us safe in the sky,” said Jeffrey Kramer, of GooseWatch NYC.Despite the numbers, airport officials are convinced the killing programs have made flights safer because there hasn’t been a similar Sullenberger crash.After the Hudson crash geese were primarily targeted around LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark. They were shot out of the sky by wildlife officials or rounded up in traps and killed.Among the 70,000 birds killed were 28,000 seagulls, 16,800 European starlings, 6,000 brown-headed cowbirds and 4,500 mourning doves. Close to 1,800 Canada geese were also eradicated.Planes hit birds over New York daily but they rarely cause accidents. Sullenberger’s Fight 1549 flew into an entire flock of Canada geese on Jan. 15, 2009, shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia. The encounter took out two engines and Sullenberger was forced to land — safely — in the Hudson River. All 155 people on board survived. His story, starring Tom Hanks, is featured in the movie “Sully.” Bird strikes have been an issue since 1905 when Orville Wright struck a bird over an Ohio cornfield, notes the Illinois Dispatch Argus. More than 255 people have been killed worldwide because of bird strikes since 1988.CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this post referred to the Tom Hanks movie as “Miracle on the Hudson.” While the event has been referred to as that, the movie’s given title is “Sully.”"

He was 73. The Fiji-born wrestler had been living in hospice care in Florida while battling stomach cancer and dementia over the last year, his family had said.He was brought home from the hospital Sunday morning to be with his family shortly before his death, the family’s attorney, Robert Kirwan, told The Huffington Post. Kirwan said his death was due to “ongoing medical problems.”Snuka’s daughter, fellow wrestler Tamina Snuka, announced the news of her father’s death on social media Sunday by sharing a photo of what appeared to be her holding his hand.Actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson also shared the news to his Twitter followers.The last year of Snuka’s life had been another kind of wrestling match after he was charged in late 2015 for the 1983 death of his former girlfriend, Nancy Argentino.Earlier this month a Pennsylvania judge dropped third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges against Snuka after ruling that he was incompetent to stand trial. At the time of the judge’s decision, the retired athlete was said to have just months to live.“At the rate he’s going, at the rate he’s deteriorating, I don’t think that he’ll make it until May or June of this year,” Kirwan told HuffPost.Addressing the past charges against Snuka on Sunday, Kirwan said that his office plans to release vindicating new information about the case “at the appropriate time.”“There’s more to the case than we were able to say,” he said.Snuka, who was known for his high-flying style of wrestling, was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996.His name was scrubbed from the site after the criminal charges were brought against him. That same treatment was given to retired wrestler Hulk Hogan after a recording of him using racist language surfaced on the web.The WWE added its voice to the number of statements mourning Snuka’s loss. In a statement, the company memorialized his wrestling techniques.“Snuka is regarded by many as the pioneer of high-flying offense because of his Superfly Splash from the top turnbuckle. His dive off the top of the steel cage onto Don Muraco at Madison Square Garden as hundreds of flash bulbs went off will forever live as one of the most memorable moments in WWE history.“WWE extends its condolences to Snuka’s family, friends and fans,” they stated.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Snuka was charged with first-degree murder. It was third-degree murder. "

It looks like those rumors about the band recording new music weren’t far from the truth. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, McVie and Buckingham discussed their project, which is tentatively scheduled to be released in May. “I’ve been sending Lindsey demos in their very raw form, and he’s been doing his Lindsey magic on them, which I love,” McVie said. Fleetwood Mac co-founder and drummer Mick Fleetwood, as well as the band’s bassist, John McVie, are also working on the album, but that doesn’t mean it will bear the band’s name. Instead, the working title is simply “Buckingham McVie,” in the same vein as Buckingham’s pre-Fleetwood duets album with Stevie Nicks (”Buckingham Nicks”). McVie re-joined Fleetwood Mac on tour in 2014 after a 16-year absence from the group ― save for one surprise performance in 2013. Buckingham told the LA Times that after they were reunited, he and McVie spent time in the studio and ended up creating enough music for an entire album."

John Lewis after the black congressman challenged the legitimacy of Trump’s coming presidency, but he also ripped Lewis’ Atlanta district as “crime infested” and in “horrible shape and falling apart.” Now Atlanta residents are furious.“He needs to do a little more research before he opens his mouth,” local mom Monique Smith told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.If “Trump believes Georgia’s Fifth Congressional District is ‘falling apart,’ then he believes Atlanta is falling apart,” the newspaper noted, and that’s hardly the case. The economically and racially diverse district includes 750,000 people and encompasses most of the city along with some suburbs. It’s unclear what Trump meant by “falling apart.” As for “crime infested,” Atlanta was ranked 14th in violent crime rates by the FBI in 2015. Kansas City, Missouri, ranked 8th, and Washington, D.C., ranked 12th. The 5th District includes impressive sections of wealthy areas like Buckhead, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Georgia Institute of Technology.Trump’s knee-jerk perception of Lewis’ district is similar to views he expressed during his campaign when he characterized some black communities as crime-ridden hellholes worse than Afghanistan.Trump appears to be less concerned about accuracy in his portrayal of the 5th District and more focused on devaluing a critic’s assessment of him by evoking a negative image of a blighted black community failed by its leadership.Lewis’ furious constituents and others flooded Twitter after Trump’s comments with responses defending their congressman and their community under hashtags such as #defendthefifth and #notsad. Houston Astros pitcher Collin McHugh of Atlanta tweeted: “As someone who lives in the 5th district, I don’t think #DJT has any idea what he’s talking about. And then doubling down by insulting the civil rights hero on #MLK wknd … wow #classy.”Some people posted photos of high-rises, beautiful homes and children playing in a park. One Twitter user quipped that Atlanta should be relieved about Trump’s attitude — because it means he probably won’t be visiting.Trump attacked Lewis and his district after the congressman said he wouldn’t be attending the inauguration. He said he believes Trump won the White House with the help of Russian hackers.“I think it was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians and others to help him get elected,” he said in an interview Friday on NBC for Sunday’s “Meet The Press.” “That’s not right. That’s not fair. That’s not the open democratic process.”Lewis added: “I don’t see this president-elect as a legitimate president.”Lewis, an iconic civil rights leader who was once beaten so badly by a law enforcement officer in a protest that his skull was fractured, has represented the 5th District since 1987. The NAACP has called on Trump to apologize to him. Organization President Cornell William Brooks said in a Saturday tweet that Trump’s remarks “demeaned Americans” and the rights Lewis has fought for throughout his life."

She is now facing kidnapping charges, authorities said.Aiken, speaking to the Mail Online following Saturday’s reunion in Walterboro, South Carolina, said they decided not to discuss what happened all those years ago but instead get to know one another.“We laughed, we chatted. We didn’t allow any negative thoughts. We didn’t talk about the kidnapping,” he told the website. “It’s going to be hard for her to turn this into a positive. She’s got very mixed emotions about the woman who raised her.” Those who know Williams have meanwhile reacted with total surprise to the allegations brought against her.“I was shocked. I was devastated because ... I wasn’t expecting that at all. Not with her. Not the type of person she is. Not the type of reputation that she carries,” a Walterboro neighbor told News4Jax.Williams was described as a church-going woman who assisted the local Veterans Association. Her criminal record includes charges of writing bad checks, welfare fraud, and an arrest for breach of trust in 2003, News4Jax reported.Williams’ alleged double life was revealed after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a tip about her daughter’s true identity, the center’s vice president, Robert Lowery, told CBS News.

Organizers told the AP that they’re expecting thousands of people to attend the event in New York City, which is being put together by Greenpeace and activist organization MoveOn. On Saturday, Moore announced the news on Twitter, encouraging his followers to come to the event. According to his tweet, the rally will take place right in front of Trump International Hotel.“We are sending a message to Washington that we will fight, at every step, discrimination and harmful policies, today, tomorrow and every day,” Ruffalo said in a statement obtained by the AP, adding that participants “are coming together to stand up for one another, as we will do every day, to protect the values we hold dear.”Moore, Ruffalo and Baldwin have all been vocal about their opposition to Trump and his policies. The stars often use social media to speak out against the former “Apprentice” host. Ruffalo also hit the streets in New York City to protest Trump’s presidency after the election results were announced back in November. And of course, Baldwin has been mocking Trump with his spot-on impression on “Saturday Night Live.” This weekend, the actor took on Trump’s recent press conference and talked about inauguration entertainment, golden showers and Trump’s sons, “Beavis” and “Butthead.”The former “30 Rock” star also confirmed he’ll be stepping back into Trump’s shoes for “SNL” on the day after the inauguration."

Although, his transition leaves a void for those of us who loved him dearly, we can celebrate and be happy for him, knowing he’s at peace.”Born May 12, 1953, in Huntersville, North Carolina, Long became the pastor of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in 1987. The church currently serves more than 25,000 members and officiated the funeral of Coretta Scott King in 2006. Long delivered his final sermon to the church earlier this month. He had issued a statement last September to The Christian Post confirming reports that he was battling a “health challenge,” but said the undisclosed health issue was unrelated to his raw vegetable diet and requested privacy and prayers for his recovery.In 2010, Long was accused of sexual abuse by four male members of his congregation who claimed Long used his influence as pastor to coerce them into a sexual relationship. The lawsuits were settled out of court in 2011 to undisclosed terms.Long is survived by his wife, Vanessa; his four children, Eric, Edward, Jared and Taylor; and three grandchildren."

Now the transition team is considering moving journalists from the briefing room.,2017-01-15,Donald Trump's team is considering moving presidential press briefings out of the White House.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587b83a61700002e00fdeb32.jpeg?cache=Zu68QkW2Cn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Donald Trump’s team is considering moving press conferences out of the White House briefing room, where they’ve been held for decades, in a potential change that has alarmed journalists just days before the start of the new administration.“No briefings shouldn’t move out of the White House,” April Ryan, a veteran White House reporter for American Urban Radio Networks, tweeted Sunday. “If it happens, what makes us different from Russia & China when it comes to the press.”Esquire reported Saturday night that the incoming administration “may evict” reporters from the White House, with one unnamed senior official calling the press “the opposition party.” The nearby White House Conference Center or Old Executive Office Building are said to be under consideration as new locations for briefings. On Sunday, key members of the Trump team acknowledged having discussed moving press briefings, though claimed doing so would be for logistical reasons and to accommodate more reporters. In TV interviews, they suggested reporters would still be able to work from offices currently on White House grounds, though stopped short of definitively saying that long-running practice would continue. For more than a century, reporters have worked inside the White House. They have been centrally located in the press briefing room since 1970. There are 49 assigned seats in the briefing room, with potentially dozens of other reporters able to stand alongside and ask questions. Vice president-elect Mike Pence said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that the incoming administration wants to “make sure that we accommodate the broadest number of people who are interested and media from around the country and around the world.”On NBC’s “Meet the Press” Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, said a move could result in “more access” because three to four times as many reporters could attend a briefing at the Old Executive Office Building.But Priebus said it “hasn’t been determined” whether reporters would still be able to work in the White House. Following the broadcast, “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd tweeted that “moving press out of people’s house” would send a symbolic message to authoritarian regimes around the world. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Sunday on Fox News’ “MediaBuzz” that allowing more reporters to attend briefings would lead to “greater accessibility.”Pence, Priebus and Spicer all separately mentioned that the White House complex is 18 acres, suggesting that a move to the Old Executive Office Building, for instance, would still be considered within the White House. Spicer has been promising for weeks that “business as usual is over” for White House reporters, though the transition team has kept reporters guessing about what changes may actually take place. The incoming press secretary has discussed no longer televising daily briefings, a practice that began in the 1990s, or even holding the briefings in a different way. He’s also talked about switching up the briefing room seating arrangement, a process overseen for decades by the White House Correspondents’ Association.WHCA President Jeff Mason said in a statement Sunday afternoon that he is meeting with Spicer “to try to get more clarity on exactly what they are suggesting.”It continued:The briefing room is open now to all reporters who request access. We support that and always will. The WHCA will fight to keep the briefing room and West Wing access to senior administration officials open. We object strenuously to any move that would shield the president and his advisers from the scrutiny of an on-site White House press corps.Removing reporters from the White House would mark a symbolic shift in the relationship between American presidents and the press and further escalate Trump’s fight with a news media he’s consistently vilified and tried to delegitimize.During the 2016 race, Trump’s campaign blacklisted nearly a dozen news organizations, including The Huffington Post; kicked journalists out of events; forced them into a “press pen”; and condoned the manhandling of a reporter. The candidate’s press-bashing was likened to that of authoritarian leaders. He ditched reporters and routinely ridiculed them on stage and on Twitter, behavior he’s continued since winning the presidency. Trump’s unprecedented attacks on the press during the campaign raised fears he could do the same if elected, given that the relationship between the White House and reporters is largely based on precedent rather than law.A day before the 2016 election, The Huffington Post reported that “there’s nothing stopping Trump from deciding not to hold a daily press briefing or kicking media outlets off the White House grounds.”Though the most aggressive investigative journalism takes place outside the briefing room, reporters rely daily on being in close proximity to White House officials to ask questions on the public’s behalf. Ed Henry, Fox News’ chief national correspondent and a former WHCA president, recalled Sunday how reporters were moved to the White House Conference Center for about a year during George W. Bush’s presidency.“I don’t want to say a disaster, but it was very difficult because you had much less access to White House press secretary at that time, Tony Snow, and the president, because you were no longer on the White House grounds,” Henry said on air. “You were across the street.”This post has been updated with a statement from the White House Correspondents’ Association."

You can build cars for the United States, but for every car that comes to the USA, you will pay 35 percent tax,” Trump said in remarks translated into German.“I would tell BMW that if you are building a factory in Mexico and plan to sell cars to the USA, without a 35 percent tax, then you can forget that,” Trump said.Volkswagen (VW) shares closed down 2.2 percent, while BMW and Daimler’s shares ended 1.5 percent lower.Under pressure to deliver on campaign promises to revive U.S. industrial jobs, Trump has turned his fire on carmakers that use low-cost Mexican plants to serve the U.S. market. He has also warned Japan’s Toyota it could be subject to a “big border tax” if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a planned factory in Mexico.All three German carmakers have invested heavily in Mexico, but also pointed out on Monday that they manufacturer in the United States as well.BMW executive Peter Schwarzenbauer told reporters the company was sticking to plans to invest around $1 billion in a new plant in Mexico, which is due to go into production in 2019 and create at least 1,500 jobs.SERIOUS WARNING“The president’s powers are considerable. He can legally impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days. Trump is not constrained by Congress,” said Simon Evenett, professor of international trade at Switzerland’s University of St Gallen.“Even if foreign companies object and seek to challenge the legality of tariffs, it will take at least 18 months to get decided. Corporate strategies will be disrupted by then.”While investing in Mexico, German carmakers have quadrupled light vehicle production in the United States over the past seven years to 850,000 units, more than half of which are exported from there, Germany’s VDA automotive industry association said.“In the long term, the United States would be shooting itself in the foot by imposing tariffs or other trade barriers,” VDA President Matthias Wissmann said in a statement.German carmakers employ about 33,000 workers in the United States and German automotive suppliers about 77,000 more, the VDA said.Speaking in tabloid newspaper Bild, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that rather than trying to penalize German carmakers, the United States should instead respond by building better and more desirable cars.Norbert Roettgen, head of Germany’s foreign affairs committee, said Berlin needed to take Trump’s comments seriously. “He seems to be absolutely focused on short-term job interests and security interests ... not that he is looking for free trade so much, but more for protection,” he told Reuters.MEXICAN PLANSDaimler’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW already have sizeable factories in the United States where they build higher-margin sports utility vehicles (SUVs) for export to Asia and Europe.Around 65 percent of BMW’s production from its factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is exported overseas. BMW builds the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models in the United States.“It is surprising that Trump singles out the carmaker that exports more vehicles from the United States than any other manufacturer,” Evercore ISI analysts said.A BMW spokeswoman said the planned plant in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi would build the BMW 3 Series from 2019, with the output intended for the world market. The plant would be an addition to existing 3 Series production facilities in Germany and China.In June last year, BMW broke ground on the plant, pledging to invest $2.2 billion in Mexico by 2019 for annual production of 150,000 cars.Daimler has said it plans to begin assembling Mercedes-Benz vehicles in 2018 from a $1 billion facility shared with Renault-Nissan in Aguascalientes in Mexico. A spokesman for Daimler declined to comment on Trump’s remarks.Last year, VW’s Audi division inaugurated a $1.3 billion production facility with 150,000 vehicle production capacity near Puebla, Mexico. Audi said it would build electric and petrol Q5 SUVs in Mexico.Audi declined to comment on Monday. VW also declined to comment on Trump’s remarks but noted it was investing another $900 million in its U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.Trump called Germany a great car producer, saying Mercedes-Benz cars were a frequent sight in New York, but claimed there was not enough reciprocity. Germans were not buying Chevrolets at the same rate, he said, calling the business relationship an unfair one-way street.Chevrolet sales have fallen sharply in Europe since parent company General Motors in 2013 said it would drop the Chevrolet brand in Europe by the end of 2015. Since then, GM has focused instead on promoting its Opel and Vauxhall marques.Asked by Reuters whether Trump could take any steps to make it easier for GM to sell more American-made cars in Europe, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said the company aimed to build cars in markets where they are sold.“We’re a global company so we’re going to continue that focus just because from an economic perspective that generally turns out to be the best framework,” she said. “I think there is a lot that we can work on with President-elect Trump.”(Reporting by Edward Taylor, Ilona Wissenbach, Andreas Rinke, Andreas Cremer and David Shepardson; Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter)"

Because Gildan’s clothing is sold through other retailers, the Times suggested that any future American Apparel items will be found in chain stores, like Kmart or Target, or through other wholesale buyers.The company’s sale comes two years after its controversial Canadian-born founder, Dov Charney, was ousted in 2014 following allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of company funds.Today he is working on a new business, according to his website, that showcases an ongoing photography project titled “That’s Los Angeles.”"
76,EDUCATION,DeVos's Disqualifying Record,"Randi Weingarten, ContributorPresident, American Federation of Teachers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/devos-disqualifying-record_us_587aceffe4b03e071c14fdb2,"One year ago, Congress—urged on by parents and educators—reached a cease-fire in the education wars. After No Child Left",2017-01-15,"<p>Weingarten speaks at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Jan. 9</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587acf781700008a0192a1ff.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One year ago, Congress—urged on by parents and educators—reached a cease-fire in the education wars. After No Child Left Behind and the fixation on testing instead of on children, Republicans and Democrats—from rural, urban and suburban communities—agreed on a fresh start for public education with the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). What a difference a year makes. This week, the Senate will consider the nomination of Donald Trump’s choice for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, someone who has spent decades—and millions of dollars—to divide communities and defund, undermine and privatize public schools.DeVos lobbied for a school voucher law that voters in her home state of Michigan overwhelmingly rejected. But she was able to push through the vast expansion of for-profit charter schools with little oversight. DeVos has written so many checks (including to several senators who will vote on her nomination) and strong-armed so many lawmakers that, despite having no experience in public education, she has influenced nearly every aspect of education in Michigan. The result? Achievement has declined across the state. In addition to media reports of rampant corruption, nearly half of Michigan’s charter schools rank in the bottom of America’s schools, and the state’s charter schools lag 84 percent behind state averages in math and 80 percent in reading.Americans want the secretary of education to strengthen and support the public schools that 90 percent of American children attend. In a speech last week at the National Press Club, I outlined four pillars that do just that—and help ensure every neighborhood public school is a viable choice for parents. The pillars focus on children’s well-being, powerful learning, teacher capacity and collaboration. Promoting Children’s Well-BeingEducation starts with meeting children where they are—emotionally, socially, physically and academically. We must confront the reality that half of all public school students live in poverty. One way to help these students is through community schools—neighborhood public schools that meet kids’ needs by coordinating partners and resources. New York City’s Community Health Academy of the Heights is a great example. CHAH offers supports like mental health counseling, a parent resource center, a food pantry and a community health clinic. A variety of indicators, including large gains in academic achievement, attest to the academy’s effectiveness. Supporting Powerful LearningSociety rightly sets high expectations for our public schools—to develop students academically, for work and civic life, and to lead fulfilling lives. The path to accomplishing these goals lies in powerful learning—learning that engages students and encourages them to question and collaborate. Like the New York City students who conducted a mock trial of a participant in the Rwanda genocide; and the students in Corpus Christi, Texas, who investigated the potential for humans to live on other planets. Career and technical education can also deeply engage students and help them to develop skills and knowledge they can use in the world of work. Building Teacher CapacityBecoming an accomplished teacher takes time, support and an intentional focus, such as teacher residency programs that pair prospective teachers with accomplished educators, and opportunities for new and veteran teachers to share their expertise with colleagues. Teacher evaluation can also build capacity, and the AFT has fought for evaluation systems that support both teacher growth and student learning. Fostering School and Community CollaborationThe quiet successes that result from educators, parents and community partners working together are the glue that holds all this together. Collaboration is essential—schools with parents, educators with administrators, and schools with community partners. When schools struggle, the response too often is “disruption”—mass firings, school closures, and district or state takeovers. Those approaches are indeed disruptive, but they are not effective. The Path ForwardThese four pillars are in every K-12 public school that works. ESSA creates the potential to put them in place, but it doesn’t guarantee it. If the Senate considers Betsy DeVos through the same lens as it did ESSA, then senators will reject her nomination. Everything we know about her—her lack of experience with public schools, her antipathy to LGBTQ students, her evangelism for privatization regardless of results, and her zeal to undermine and pauperize public education—disqualifies her from holding the position she seeks. Regardless of what the Senate does, thousands of people in hundreds of communities will take action on Jan. 19—and, indeed, every day—for the public schools all children deserve. That should be everyone’s goal, particularly anyone who seeks responsibility for our children’s future."
77,POLITICS,6 Reasons Why Trump's Wall Is Even Dumber Than Most Of Trump's Other Ideas,"Robert Reich, ContributorChancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of Califor...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-reasons-trumps-wall_us_587b8dfee4b0e58057ff46e3,"At his turbulent his news event last Wednesday (I won’t dignify it by calling it a news conference), Trump reiterated that",2017-01-15,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in Trump Tower, Manhattan, New York, U.S., January 11, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587b8f02170000880192a2a1.jpeg?ops=crop_8_42_4364_2540%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"At his turbulent his news event last Wednesday (I won’t dignify it by calling it a news conference), Trump reiterated that he will build a wall along the Mexican border. “It’s not a fence. It’s a wall,” he said, and“Mexico will pay for the wall.”Here are six reasons why Trump’s wall is an even dumber idea than most of his others.1. The U.S.-Mexican border is already well defended, and a wall won’t improve the defenses. The United States now spends $3.7 billion per year to keep some 21,000 Border Patrol agents on guard and another $3.2 billion on 23,000 inspectors at ports of entry along the border, a third of which is already walled or fenced off.2. The cost of Trump’s fence would be a whopping $25 billion on top of this. That’s the best estimate I’ve seen by a Washington Post fact checker. (When Trump discussed the cost last February he put it at $8 billion, then a few weeks later upped the cost to $10 to 12 billion. )3. There’s no way Mexico will pay for it. On January 11, Mexican President Enrique Peña assured Mexicans they would not be footing the bill. “It is evident that we have some differences with the new government of the United States,” he said, “like the topic of the wall, that Mexico of course will not pay.”4. There’s no reason for the wall anyway because undocumented migration from Mexico has sharply declined. The Department of Homeland Security’s estimatesthat the total undocumented population peaked at 12 million in 2008, and has fallen since then. According to the Pew Research Center, the overall flow of Mexican immigrants between the two countries is at its smallest since the 1990s. The number of apprehensions at the border is at its lowest since 1973.5. The decline isn’t because of rising border enforcement but because of Mexico is producing fewer young people and therefore less demographic pressure to migrate to the U.S. In 1965, Mexico’s fertility rate was 7.2 children per woman; by 2000 it had fallen to 2.4; today, it’s at 2.3 children per woman, just above replacement level.6. There’s little or no evidence undocumented immigrants take jobs away from native-born Americans, anyway. A new analysis of Census data finds that immigrants take very different jobs than Americans. In fact, the United States already allows a significant amount of legal immigration from Mexico under the “guest-worker” program –1.6 million entries by legal immigrants and 3.9 million by temporary workers from Mexico over the last 10 years – because farmers can’t find enough native-born Americans to pick crops.Of course, Trump lives in a fact-free universe designed merely to enhance his power and fuel his demagoguery. But you don’t have to, and nor does anyone else.Originally published at RobertReich.org."

We’ve seen people of color shot in the back while running away. We’ve seen police officers take on the role of judge, jury and executioner and pay no price for that breach of justice. And just last month, we saw a jury unable to reach a verdict even after seeing videotape of police shooting an unarmed black man who was stopped for a broken taillight.We must all face the uncomfortable truth that it is dangerous to be black in America. Shockingly, our courts have accepted that race is relevant evidence in determining the reasonableness of using deadly force ― by police and by regular citizens standing their ground and defending their property against a vague threat. This systemic belief that black people are inherently dangerous has created an “open season” on people of color in America.And it doesn’t end with physical violence. Black people are killed again when they enter the courtroom. When innocent black defendants are forced to plead guilty to a lesser felony conviction to avoid a decade in prison, they become the walking dead, unable to get a job or vote, unable to achieve a stable income to support their children. This is the steep price they pay.There is an unmistakable tension in America’s soul at this moment that will not go away until there is justice for all Americans regardless of the color of their skin. Tension is not a comfortable thing, but as Dr. King taught us, sometimes it is a necessary thing. He told us that “there is a kind of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth… the kind of tension that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.”And what is brotherhood? Brotherhood is the conviction that you and I are one family regardless of the color of our skin and I cannot be free while your freedoms are trampled. Brotherhood deeply understands how interconnected we are. Dr. King said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” He reminded us that as brothers, “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”It was the sense of brotherhood that caused a small Bible study group at Emanuel AME Church to welcome an outsider into their midst to study God’s word with them. And after he murdered them in cold blood, hoping to provoke a race war, the citizens of Charleston, black and white, responded in unity, and clung to each other in grief. His evil action failed because it galvanized the brotherhood of black and white people of good intent, who were united in their outrage and grief.When the families of the victims choked out expressions of forgiveness for the killer days after their loss, holding up an example of divine brotherhood, the nation watched in awe. That action said we don’t get to choose who is our brother. God ordains this brotherhood of humanity and, as Jesus said about His church, “the gates of hell will not prevail against it.” The evils of racism and hatred will not overcome.We are at a crossroads. As a nation, our brotherhood has never been more divided. The lines are sharp and deep: Police and citizens. Black and white. Democrats and Republicans.Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate, said “the really important victory of the civil rights movement was that it made racism unpopular, whereas a generation ago you had to embrace racism to get elected to anything.” I pray that’s still true today.It’s incumbent on President-elect Trump to set the tone for this America and denounce division, racism and nativism as he becomes president of all...It’s essential that his Attorney General embraces and upholds the high purpose of his office and becomes the champion of civil rights for all...And it’s necessary that we, as Americans, sharpen our gaze to root out racism and raise our voices in defense of justice for all.This is not a moment for silence. It’s not a moment to go about our ordinary business and look the other way. This is a moment for all Americans of good intent – black and white – to raise our voices and claim our God-given brotherhood.Dr. King said, “Three hundred years of humiliation, abuse and deprivation cannot be expected to find voice in a whisper.” This is not a moment to whisper. At this pivotal time in American history, let us raise our voices and demand that America lives up to the high ideals on which she was founded.Let us demand that the Constitution… the document that makes this fragile experiment in democracy possible… is upheld. America, these are your words. As the Constitution guarantees, let us insist on due process and equal justice for all ― the white skinned and the brown skinned, the privileged and the destitute, the powerful and the powerless.Mr. Trump, in five days, you will become America’s 45th president. Your legacy is unwritten, but it will quickly take shape. You have real power and profound influence. You can use it to unify - - or to divide, to create a more just America or a place of squandered potential that falls pitifully short.You promised to “Make America Great Again.” Let me suggest that the path to greatness is living up to the ideals of our Constitution.In a truly great America, the vast majority of black men are educated and not incarcerated.In a truly great America, the ranks of our police officers and our prosecutors reflect the diversity of our communities ― diversity of thought, culture and race.In a truly great America, those with power are held accountable when they abuse it, harass a citizen or wrongfully take a life.In a truly great America, all are innocent ‘til proven guilty, regardless of their skin color.And in a truly great America, justice is achieved in a courtroom not handed out on a city street.Because, as we know, America cannot be truly great unless she also is truly just.There is a high road forward from here. It is the way of justice… And only justice leads to a lasting peace. As Dr. King reminded us, “peace is not merely the absence of tension. It is the presence of justice.”Mr. President-elect, many say your election made history. Well, it’s not just about making history. It’s about making progress... progress toward a true brotherhood of Americans......a brotherhood of black lives and blue lives where both police and citizen can go home to their families in safety because violence against our police is as unjust and unacceptable as violence against innocent people of color.Technology has brought to light things that were long hidden. Injustices are captured daily on dash cams and smart phones for all the world to see.Now, it’s time for moral and spiritual wisdom that keeps pace with our technological advancements.It’s time for American greatness to be founded in justice, education and economic opportunity. And it’s time for true brotherhood, because, as Dr. King taught us, “only if we live as brothers can we avoid perishing as fools.”As we remember the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King today, let us honor his legacy by taking up his mantle and moving America forward for the future of our children.We must speak up for our children, stand up for our children, and, when necessary, even fight for our children, because, at this moment, we are creating the America they will inherit from us.Let us make an America worthy of our children, an America where children of all races and incomes and creeds have an equal chance for a future and equal protection under the law.May God’s providence continue to rain down on this great nation as it always has.From our very start, when America was fighting for our independence, God gave us patriots like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.When America was in a struggle to save our national soul from the evils of slavery, God gave us a statesman for the ages in Abraham Lincoln.And when America needed to live into its high ideals and embrace civil rights for all Americans, God gave us a man of uncommon faith...... a man who was not afraid to go to jail for his convictions.... a man gifted in words, who used them to lift us up and spur us on.Yes, when America needed a spiritual course correction, God gave us Martin Luther King Jr.Now, in this most potent and precarious time, we look to God again to intervene in America’s destiny...... to continue His divine providence.... to infuse our national, state and community leaders with wisdom.... and to shine a light on the role He ordains for each of us to play.Only God can unite this broken brotherhood and strengthen us to reject the evils of hatred and division.Only Almighty God can endow America with greatness that flows from righteousness.It’s up to each of us abandon our prejudices, acknowledge our brotherhood and accept God’s call to greatness.Dear God, help us make America truly great... great in her freedom... great in her brotherhood... and, above all, great in her justice.Attorney Ben Crump has distinguished himself as a civil rights advocate, earning him the Henry Latimer Diversity Award, Outstanding Philanthropist of the Year, 2014 National Newspaper Publishers Association Newsmaker of the Year, and The Root 100 Top Black Influencers.

82,PARENTS,Things to Love About Parenting Teens,"Toni Williams, ContributorMom, writer, social media rockstar, and content creator. I wri...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/things-to-love-about-parenting-teens_us_587b8bc0e4b077a19d180e91,They aren’t afraid to ask questions.,2017-01-15,<p>Fashion trends and accessories are discussed a lot in our house.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587b8caf1200003000ad7a8c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was 4:00 am and everything was quiet. All three of teens were asleep and I woke up to have some quiet time. Before I started reading, I got my usually glass of water, took my thyroid medicine, and as I’ve done since they were babies, surveyed the kids sleeping.In a few short hours, I’d have them up and in the midst of our morning routine preparing them to get out the door and on the way to school. This day is special (and more challenging) because it’s the first day back after the holiday break. This morning needed to extra preparation. But before I started preparing and I gazed at each one of them. I whispered one thing…thank you. Thank you for my babies who are now teenagers. Thank you for their giving hearts. Thank you for the people they have become. Thank you. We survived that morning and after I dropped the kids off at school, my mind wandered back to my place of thankfulness. In the land of parenting, we don’t seem to stay in any one season for long. For now, I’m sharing this and am determined to soak it all in before it eases away.What I Love, Admire, and Respect About This Season of Parenting There is always someone to tattle. Yes friends, teens still tattle. And as a parent, I am ever so thankful for it. With three kids life gets busy, and sometimes I miss some stuff that I need to handle as a parent. In comes the benefits of those who tattle.They don’t know life without each other. There is a 13-month difference between the oldest two and 18 months between number 2 and number 3. None of them can ever say “I remember being an only child” or how life was so great before their siblings arrived because they don’t remember it.I have finally figured out a way to spend regular and consistent time alone with each child. This is probably the thing I am most proud of. I have read several articles on parenting over the years that talk about the value of spending time alone with each child and they have always left me frustrated. As a mom it’s been very hard to schedule and little bit guilt-inducing to spend time with only one child. Over the past year I’ve figured it out, mastered it, and I don’t feel guilty anymore.Family and dinner discussions include fashion trends, scented fragrances, and accessories. Sometimes these discussions about trends make me feel nervous and raise my eyebrows, but for the most part they are interesting.Household chores include making meals. We can officially say I’m preparing them to live on their own. We can unofficially say that some days I’m so tired that I don’t even remember we have a refrigerator, much less food in it. All three take turns with the food preparation and clean-up.They have a consciousness that reminds me to “stay woke” about the injustices of the world. I’ll admit it. Sometimes the injustices of the world wear me down. They consistently remind me to advocate and fight for what’s right. Thank you, J. Cole.They can get through to each other when I can’t. In many of our deep discussions I try not to say too much. I’ve found that the minute I say something, that one thing is met with a different interpretation of what I initially meant. Oftentimes though, a sibling can get through in ways that I can’t and says it far better than I would.Sibling code, grandparent code, cousin code. As much as I’d like to say that the kids talk to me about everything in their lives, I know they don’t. I am thankful for the relationships they have with my parents, their cousins, and each other to bounce ideas off of.They are actively exploring and defining spirituality. Last year I was terrified when one of the teens asked about atheism. Since then, I’ve encouraged them to develop their own relationships with God and I’ve modeled my own quiet time with God. I don’t expect them to be where I am on their spiritual journeys, but I know they are headed in the right direction.They aren’t afraid to ask questions. This can be hard, because sometimes the questions are tough. Whenever they do ask the tough questions, I pause and remember to be grateful for the fact they chose me to ask those questions of.Bonus: They have an appreciation for the 80s and 90s hits from my teen and young adult years.Double Bonus: We watch “20/20,” “What Would You Do?,” “Shark Tank,” and “Bob’s Burgers” together every week.What season of parenting are you in? What are you thankful for about it?"
83,THE WORLDPOST,Civilians in War Zone Skeptical of America's Sudan Deal,"Nuba Reports, ContributorSudan-based conflict media organization",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civilians-in-war-zone-skeptical-of-americas-sudan_us_587bb32fe4b077a19d180eaa,This year could be the first time in five years Ibrahim Haron enjoys a bomb-free existence. The possibility comes from a,2017-01-15,"<p>Haron, a 68-year-old shopkeeper from the conflict area in the Nuba Mountains: “You cannot really trust the Sudan government, unless there are pressures put over them.” </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587bb39c1700001300fdeb79.jpg?cache=oRGsMiLLAb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This year could be the first time in five years Ibrahim Haron enjoys a bomb-free existence. The possibility comes from a surprise last-minute move from the Obama administration last week to lift U.S. economic sanctions against Sudan in return for a series of concessions, including an end to hostilities in Sudan’s internal wars in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile.But Haron, a 68-year-old shopkeeper who has lived in war for years, is skeptical. He suspects Khartoum will renege on any promise, even one made with the United States.“Civilians [in the Nuba Mountains] have been suffering over five years with false promises from the government of Sudan,” Haron said. “Until now there have been around 12 rounds of peace talks, but they have not lead to any fruitful results.”Since 2011, the Sudan government has sought to defeat rebel fighters in the Nuba Mountains who, after years of neglect from the central riverain government, demand greater autonomy in their remote border region. Haron knows how scarce basic commodities become during wartime in the Nuba Mountains – where the conflict has triggered mass displacement and food insecurity.The U.S. originally issued economic sanctions against Sudan in 1997 for supporting terrorism, specifically for harboring the former Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama Bin Laden, and in 2006 for its continued violation of human rights in the conflict in Darfur where over 300,000 people have been killed. But now these sanctions are to be lifted, allowing Sudan to trade extensively with the United States and attract much-needed investment in its collapsing economy. According to the agreement, the U.S. will end a 20-year economic embargo on Sudan – allowing both imports and exports (including gas and oil), as well as unfreeze government Sudanese property and assets held in America. In return, Sudan is expected to stop supporting rebels in South Sudan, cooperate with American intelligence, improve access for aid groups and cease bombing rebel territory. The catch is a probationary period of six months. The sanctions will be eased in 180 days only if Sudan “has sustained the positive actions” that the U.S. says led to President Obama’s executive order in the first place. This could mean a very overdue break for Haron and other civilians in the Nuba Mountains from at least six months of government warplanes bombing civilian targets, including schools and hospitals. Nuba Reports has documented more than 4,000 bombs dropped by the government on civilian areas in the region since 2012. Citizens in Kauda, the rebel-controlled capital in the Nuba Mountains, told Nuba Reports they are not convinced and deeply distrust Sudan’s President Omar Al-Bashir and the ruling government in Khartoum.“Khartoum is very clever in dealing with the international community,” says university student Daud Kodi, in Kauda. “With the lifting of sanctions, they [the Sudan government] will be able to access more hard currency so they can focus on buying weapons for warfare, instead of buying medicine for the people.”Bashir’s government has a long history of breaking promises. Sudan has breached at least half a dozen ceasefire agreements in the past. A week ago, government forces defied Bashir’s own pronounced ceasefire and attacked a rebel position in Arum in Blue Nile State, according to news reports and aid agencies. Sudan warplanes also recently bombed Um Dorein and Hajar Bako in the Nuba Mountains during an alleged ceasefire, injuring two children.“How can you lift sanctions because Khartoum has ‘improved?’ Where is the improvement here?” said Kodi, the university student. “That is just improvement via the media, but it is not the case on the ground.”Haron, the shopkeeper, agreed.“You cannot really trust the Sudan government, unless there are pressures put over them,” he said.According to the State Department, Sudan has shown “significant progress” in the last six months in ending military operations within the country, improving humanitarian access and countering terrorist groups. While there have been few bombings in the Nuba Mountains since May, bombings typically slow every year during the rainy season starting in June, and generally pick up again during the dry season sometime between December and March. Notably, Sudanese troops continue to hold fertile farmland in the Nuba Mountains from the last fighting season.The State Department cited humanitarian access granted by Sudan to aid agencies to Golo town in Darfur and revised directives to allow improved aid access to areas in need. Rights groups too have called this claim into question. As recently as September, the government allegedly used chemical weapons in Darfur. Leslie Lefkow, the deputy director of the Africa Division for Human Rights Watch, called the U.S. government’s claims of progress “inexplicable.”“Many Sudanese, and those, like me, who have followed Sudan’s developments the past two decades, will ask, ‘What sustained progress?’” she wrote in reaction to the news. “The government has broken innumerable promises over the years, so why not wait to lift sanctions until after there is real progress?”For civilians further south in the Nuba Mountains, praise for the government on humanitarian access rings hollow. Sudan has routinely denied any humanitarian access to the war-affected citizens since the conflict began.Humanitarian access routes to the conflict areas constitute the central reason the last internationally brokered peace talks collapsed in Sudan. Khartoum has denied aid access emanating outside the country since the war started, harboring deep suspicions over aid routes being misused by the rebels for military purposes. The government nominally supported a Memorandum of Understanding between the rebels and international actors to provide humanitarian access to war affected areas in 2011 but the document was never implemented to date.Meanwhile, Bashir remains wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes in Darfur. No charges have been brought for alleged crimes committed in the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile.“Every Sudanese living in Sudan knows exactly the atrocities the government of Sudan is committing against their own people,” Nagwa Konda, a Nuba civil society activist, told AJ Stream in a September debate among Sudanese about lifting sanctions. “Sanctions are the only international recognition of the misbehavior of the government of Sudan, especially in the Nuba Mountains and southern Blue Nile.”Observers have said the State Department was motivated almost entirely by Sudan’s counter-terrorism assistance. Deputy State Department Spokesperson Mark Toner says Sudan is helping the U.S. in countering the terrorist group the Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL) among other regional terrorist threats.But this is the fear of many Nuba people: The U.S. may be using the carrot instead of the stick for short-term gains while sidelining the concerns of the war-affected populations in Sudan. With Khartoum blocking media access to the conflicts in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains, and Blue Nile, this makes these populations even easier to forget.Follow Nuba Reports on Twitter and Facebook for more news from Sudan."

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, accused Shaub of “blurring the line between public relations and official ethics guidance” in a letter Thursday.During a separate appearance Sunday on “This Week,” Chaffetz further called into question Shaub’s statements, claiming he had “never done an investigation and never looked at the paperwork in the point where he can actually come to a reasonable conclusion.”Asked whether he, as chair of the House Oversight Committee, would look into Trump’s conflicts of interest around the world, Chaffetz said he had “no plans to do that at this point.”“I’m not just going to go on these fishing expeditions,” he said. “I didn’t do that with President Obama. We didn’t go through this with President Obama. I think the world and certainly the American voters understand that Donald Trump has mass holdings. He’s worth billions of dollars. He’s been very successful in business. And I think the American voters understood that when they voted him in.” "
88,POLITICS,Why Trump's Contempt For The Emoluments Clause Matters,Jason Linkins and Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-emoluments-clause_us_58794852e4b09281d0eaf212,Foreign governments could still line his pockets in lots of ways.,2017-01-15,"President-elect Donald Trump and his lawyer, Sheri Dillon, describe their plan to get around the Constitution's Emoluments Clause Jan. 11 in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a4fab1700002e00fde9e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As many people have pointed out, President-elect Donald Trump has a problem: It’s called Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution, better known as the “Emoluments Clause.” It says this:“No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”“The idea behind the clause is pretty intuitive,” Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman notes at Bloomberg View. “If federal officials can be compensated by foreign governments, they can be bought.” He adds: “It’s pretty clear that the clause was intended to stop foreign governments from currying favor with federal officials through gifts.”But Trump’s massive business holdings ― more than 500 different corporate entities around the world ― and his refusal to sell them before he takes office places him on a collision course with the Constitution.The Trump International Hotel in Washington is one of the more talked-about entities in which the incoming president will run afoul of this constitutional stipulation. The $800-a-night showpiece was already a source of ethical woes for Trump, owing to the fact that the building is leased from the government, which by law is prohibited from renting property to officials in said government. This means that as soon as Trump is sworn into office, he will technically be on both sides of the lease, as both tenant and landlord. But we digress.The more serious issue with the new hotel is that representatives of foreign governments could decide to book rooms as a way of currying favor with the Trump administration, which is already happening. And despite the efforts of Trump’s tax attorney, Sheri Dillon — who this week said that Trump would give away the profits (after expenses) his hotels made from foreign governments ― big concerns remain about foreign money flowing through Trump’s resorts.All the attention this week to Trump’s plan for avoiding profiting from foreign delegations at his hotels only served to distract from the real news that came out of his press conference on Wednesday: Trump is not planning to do anything to keep foreign influence from flowing into the other 500-plus companies he owns.Here’s the thing: The Trump Organization is not one, single corporate entity that can be said to be “Trump Inc.” Instead, the president-elect’s business empire is made up of hundreds of individual LLCs, each housing assets that range from a high-rise in Uruguay to a helicopter in Manhattan.Judging from Trump’s financial disclosure forms, scores of these companies are basically dormant ― little more than a name on a piece of paper and a license to sell stuff. This is fairly common in commercial real estate, where deals can take decades to finalize, and where partnerships can run into trouble during periods of recession and spring back to life when times are good.Trump’s own development of Manhattan’s West Side Yards — which Trump has said was the “best deal” he ever made — took years to develop, and was dormant for several years after Trump and then-Mayor Ed Koch got into a scrap in the late 1980s over tax abatements, which Koch ultimately refused to provide. While the development was on hold, Trump received an offer from fellow developer William Zeckendorf Jr. in 1989 to buy the property, but Trump wouldn’t sell, even though Zeckendorf offered nearly four times what Trump paid to acquire it. It wasn’t until 1994 that Trump’s creditors forced him to sell. (The property ended up in the hands of Hong Kong developers, who used Trump’s name on some of the buildings; he eventually walked away with minority stakes in a pair of office buildings now worth $640 million.)Now that we know Trump has hundreds of paper companies in dozens of countries, it’s time to revisit the Emoluments Clause from a new angle. Take, for example, Trump’s two inactive companies in Egypt — Trump Marks Egypt Corp. and Trump Marks Egypt LLC. Both were incorporated in 2007, but currently exist in a form of suspended animation. Egypt, like many developing countries, has high levels of public corruption, and low rates of prosecution for high-ranking officials accused of misusing government funds. In this environment, it’s not a stretch to see how it might be in the interest of the Egyptian state to revive Trump Marks Egypt Corp., in the hopes that doing business with Trump’s sons in Egypt could help strengthen the fragile government’s relationship with an American administration that currently provides Egypt with $1.46 billion a year in foreign aid. I mean, it’s hard to make the argument, if you’re Egypt, that you should do anything but revive the deal you struck years ago to do who-knows-what with Donald Trump. In order to shield the fact that such a deal was being financed with government funds, in many parts of the world it would be relatively easy to pass the money through a corporate entity run by an ally of the current leadership. Heck, that kind of stuff already happens all the time! As it happens, Trump’s lawyer’s only assurance in this regard was that his “company would make no new foreign deals,” which leaves the door open for Trump to reap riches off any foreign deals set up in the past. Whether they’re lying dormant, were put on hold for a minute, or are furiously being negotiated in the eight weeks between Trump’s election and his inauguration, these projects all share one thing in common: They could technically be considered ongoing business matters that existed prior to Trump taking the oath of office.If any of these foreign deals suddenly come back to life during Trump’s presidency, it’s safe to assume Trump’s attorneys would argue that they were pre-existing business affairs, like his D.C. hotel and his Manhattan skyscrapers — not new deals struck between Trump’s family members (who want to make money), and state actors (who want a business partner in the Oval Office). “The notion that there won’t be new deals doesn’t solve the problem of all the existing businesses,” Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics (whom congressional Republicans are now threatening to subpoena), noted this week. Although Trump has announced that he will be handing off these affairs to his two eldest sons, the president-elect cannot unknow the existence of his hundreds of shell companies or his stalled overseas deals, any more than he can forget that he has two grown sons. While Trump insists he will not discuss these matters with his adult children, there’s no way to either police or enforce this promise. In case you weren’t already freaking out, consider this. Just as foreign favor-seekers can look for ways to enlarge Trump’s empire, they can also threaten to shrink it as well. As The New York Times reported in November:And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump’s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan — suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup — the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump’s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests.And even here, we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of the constitutional conflicts. In addition to the aforementioned entanglements, Norm Eisen (who served as a presidential ethics adviser in the Obama administration), Richard Painter (who served in the same capacity for President George W. Bush), and Laurence Tribe (constitutional law professor at Harvard University) outline several more in a paper published by the Brookings Institution in December, titled, “The Emoluments Clause: Its Text, Meaning, and Application to Donald J. Trump.”According to Eisen, et al., areas of concern include:“Shortly before the election, President Duterte of the Philippines named Jose E.B. Antonio, a business partner of Mr. Trump and founder of a company behind Trump Tower Manila, as a special envoy to the United States.”The authors’ overall assessment is very straightforward:Wholly apart from any quid pro quo arrangements of demonstrable bribes or payoffs, the Emoluments Clause will be violated whenever a foreign diplomat stays in a Trump hotel or hosts a reception in one; whenever foreign-owned banks offer loans to Mr. Trump’s businesses or pay rent for office space in his buildings; whenever projects are jump-started or expedited or licensed or otherwise advantaged because Mr. Trump is associated with them; whenever foreign prosecutors and regulators treat a Trump entity favorably; and whenever the Trump Organization makes a profit on a business transaction with any foreign state or foreign-owned entity.Despite what you’ve just read, all is not lost. There is one more avenue of influence that could be exerted over the incoming president and his future foreign business partners: Public pressure from public exposure. That’s right, folks, the crooked media with its fake news and its rude questions might just be our last, best hope to stop the president from becoming the world’s most popular business partner.Indeed, two such projects have already fallen victim to the hot glare of investigative reporting: The first was a Trump-branded resort on the Black Sea in Batumi, Georgia. The second was a Trump-branded office tower in Buenos Aires. Both of these developments were briefly revived in the weeks after the election — but have since been canceled. In all likelihood, the media attention on strained U.S. relations with the countries where these deals were situated likely played a role in killing them.. But if reporters are the last, best hope, we’ve got to do a much better job than we’ve been doing these past few weeks. Case in point: Given the opportunity to probe the president-elect and his attorney on foreign business dealings at this week’s press conference, only one reporter opted to do so, weakly inquiring, “What is your response to your critics who say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest?” If that’s the best the media can do, then Trump and his family are poised to make billions of dollars by running roughshod over the Constitution.~~~~~ Christina Wilkie is a White House reporter for the Huffington Post, where she covers the incoming Trump administration.
