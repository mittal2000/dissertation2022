0,POLITICS,Neighbors Cover Lawn Of School For Refugees With Warm Welcomes,Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school-refugees-welcome-signs-trump-ban_us_588fb9afe4b02772c4e8919e,Georgians respond to Trump’s immigration order.,2017-01-31,"The signs left in front of the International Community School in Decatur, Georgia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588fd91417000025002d9677.jpeg?cache=XwUbRvC0L1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is a good sign.The International Community School, a public charter school that seeks out and teaches refugee and immigrant children in DeKalb County, Georgia, was plastered with positive signs made by its neighbors Monday morning.The handmade signs, planted in the school’s lawn and along its sidewalk, carry messages including “You’re home,” “We are one” and “We are glad you are here.”The idea was to send refugee students and their families some support after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that targets Muslims and refugees.“It restores some of my faith in humanity,” Danny Vincent, a mother who lives in the area, told The Huffington Post. “It’s a reminder that that’s where this change has to happen. And that’s where we could do the most good, by taking care of the people around us.”Vincent told HuffPost that after Trump’s first turbulent week in office, she had had enough. She decided Saturday that she couldn’t take any more news from social media and was going to unplug on Sunday.“But because I don’t have any will power, I checked social media first thing on Sunday morning with my coffee,” she told HuffPost. “I was like, ‘I’ll check it once in the morning and then I’ll put it down.”But that’s when she saw a post in her neighborhood’s Facebook group that caught her eye. It was by a neighbor she didn’t personally know. The neighbor had made a sign and put it on the Decatur school’s lawn. She posted a picture of it to the group and said that she had been thinking about the kids at the school all weekend and was worried about them and their families and how they felt.“She said she had done this in support and was hoping that others in the neighborhood would do the same,” Vincent said. “And it grew from there.”Inspired, Vincent asked her 8-year-old daughter, Amelia, if she’d like to make a sign to put in front of the school.Amelia happened to be playing with a neighbor her age, a girl named Abby, and Vincent asked if Abby wanted to make a sign as well. Then Amelia asked if she could invite more of her friends over to make signs.So Vincent threw a sign-making party.By 1 p.m. Sunday, Vincent had rallied about 20 people to come to her house to make signs.At 4 p.m., the party planted the signs in the lawn of the International Community School.“There were six or seven signs when we got there, and we probably added 12 or 15,” Vincent said. “When we went by this morning, there were well over 40 to 50 signs on the walkway.”Vincent said that the current political climate has left her feeling helpless and pessimistic but that this experience has given her hope.“When I went by that school this morning and I saw those signs and I saw those kids walking and reading those signs,” Vincent said, choking back tears. “I thought, ‘I can do this. We can do more of this.’ It’s knocked some of the cynicism out of me.”The Huffington Post reached out to the International Community School but were unable to get comment. We will update this story accordingly."
1,POLITICS,Most Americans Don’t Think The Media Is Honest,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/most-americans-media-not-honest_us_58909bc2e4b0522c7d3d01e4,That plays well into the Trump administration’s strategy to discredit the press.,2017-01-31,Press secretary Sean Spicer answers questions during his daily press briefing at the White House on Jan. 30.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58909c861b0000260004d794.jpeg?cache=bjVGsvleQr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over half of Americans say that most members of the news media are not honest, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday. Only 39 percent think most media personnel are honest. The numbers play well into President Donald Trump’s attempts to sow mistrust in the media among the American people. In fact, 86 percent of Republicans and 6 in 10 independents think the media is dishonest, while nearly two-thirds of Democrats think most members of the news media are honest.A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found very similar results. When asked if they had trust and confidence in the media to state the facts fully, accurately and fairly, over half of respondents said they had “not very much” trust or “none at all.” A majority also don’t trust Trump’s administration to be truthful, but most Republicans trust Trump to be honest. In the Quinnipiac poll, young people are more likely to think the media is dishonest than any other group except Republicans. Seventy percent of those age 18-34 think most members of the news media are dishonest. That’s compared to 53 percent of 35- to 49-year-olds, 57 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds and only 45 percent of those over age 65 who share that view. The HuffPost/YouGov poll did not show significant differences by age, however. In that poll, a majority of all age groups reported little or no trust in the media.Although it’s not clear that the low levels of trust in the media are a result of the current political climate, there is evidence that Trump’s assault on the press could be successfully moving the bar on public opinion. Gallup reported in September that Americans’ trust in the media was at an all-time low since it began asking the question in 1972. That drop ― from 40 percent with a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media in 2015 to 32 percent in 2016 ― was mostly caused by an 18 percentage point downturn in media trust among Republicans since 2015. That’s the largest single-year drop Gallup has ever measured on the question. The situation for the media isn’t likely to improve among Republicans and Trump supporters. The president has continued his strong criticism of the press in his first days in office, and both Trump and adviser Steve Bannon have referred to the media as the “opposition party.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer has regularly berated the media during daily press briefings for what he perceives as biased coverage. And Trump frequently refers to various news outlets, such as The New York Times and CNN, as “fake news.” These attempts to discredit the press by the current administration shouldn’t be dismissed as simply the ravings of a president who can’t handle criticism. Polling data consistently tell us that a majority of Americans don’t trust the media. Trump’s rhetoric has a friendly audience on this issue."
2,POLITICS,The Recent U.S. Terror Plots You Won't Hear Donald Trump Talking About,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rightwing-terror-plots-trump_us_588faef1e4b0522c7d3c5b69,The president’s decision to approach terrorism exclusively as a Muslim issue is dangerous.,2017-01-31,"Left to right: Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright and Patrick Eugene Stein in booking photos provided on Oct. 15, 2016. The men were part of a white supremacist group and allegedly planned to bomb an apartment complex full of Somali immigrants.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588faf9117000025002d958e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As President Donald Trump struggles to defend his decision to halt refugee resettlement and immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, it’s become increasingly clear that the executive order he signed on Friday is a solution in search of a problem.Islamophobia may sell in the White House, but many Americans find it hard to buy his argument that the order will keep out “radical Islamic terrorists” but is “not about religion.” No refugee from any country targeted in Trump’s ban has carried out a fatal U.S. terror attack. This fact is inconvenient for Trump. He first proposed what critics ― and reportedly, Trump himself ― referred to as a “Muslim ban” in December 2015, after a Muslim couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Syed Rizwan Farook, the husband, was an American born in Chicago. And Tashfeen Malik, the wife, was a legal permanent resident of the U.S. whose native country, Pakistan, is not included in Trump’s order.Yet those facts didn’t stop White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer from citing the San Bernardino shooting as a justification for Trump’s ban on immigrants and travelers from other Muslim-majority countries this week.There’s little factual basis for this anti-immigrant fear-mongering, but it does enable the Trump administration to scapegoat people from a set of countries that have a combined population of 218 million. Only four nations in the world are that populous.To understand the inconsistencies at work, it’s helpful to consider the terror threats the White House isn’t talking about ― the ones that are part of a wider trend of domestic terrorism motivated by white supremacy and other forms of right-wing extremism. First, let’s talk about the fatal attacks carried out by foreigners in the U.S. Between 1975 and 2015, foreign-born terrorists ― including immigrants and tourists ― killed a total of 3,024 people on U.S. soil, according to a 2016 Cato Institute report. All but 41 of those deaths came on Sept. 11, 2001 and the following days. Three deaths came at the hands of refugees: a pair of political attacks by anti-Castro Cubans in the 1970s. A number of non-fatal terrorist attacks ― including three by refugees from Iran and Somalia, both nations on Trump’s list ― also took place over that time.Not only is the “death by refugee terrorist” phenomenon extremely rare, but dying in an attack by a foreign-born terrorist is among the least likely causes of death in America over the past four decades. According to the Cato Institute, there’s a 1 in 3.64 billion chance each year of dying in a terror attack carried out by a refugee. These astronomical odds speak to the incredible rarity of death by terrorism in the U.S., especially when compared to more common causes, like routine gun violence and even shark attacks. Studies have also shown that new immigrants are generally equally or less likely to commit crimes than their natural-born counterparts. Some supporters of Trump’s immigration ban have pointed to terror plots in Europe in the past few years, claiming the new policy is the only way to ensure a refugee never carries out an attack on U.S. soil. Beside the obvious differences between the U.S. and Europe, these arguments often fail to acknowledge the strict vetting system that currently governs refugee resettlement into the United States. The current screening process takes between 18 and 24 months on average, and includes biometric and biographic tests, interviews and database checks carried out by both United Nations and U.S. security agencies. But Trump has successfully exploited Islamophobia and irrational paranoia to temporarily close off U.S. borders to people from certain countries. He defended his hasty and chaos-provoking decision by claiming that “bad dudes” would “rush” into the country if he waited (as if there were no national security apparatus to prevent this from happening).Security experts say the terror threat from refugees and immigrants from the seven countries named in Trump’s ban ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― isn’t significantly higher than it’s been in the past, and they believe the order is only likely to make threats worse. The president has effectively cast aside the proverbial scalpel in favor of a sledgehammer. Now we’re watching him use it to perform an entirely unnecessary, far-from-surgical procedure.This approach has created a desperate need for additional context. Between 9/11 and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando last year, right-wing terror attacks actually claimed more lives than those reportedly motivated by Islamic extremism, according to one frequently cited study. The government defines right-wing terror as activity often motivated by principles of racial supremacy and the embrace of anti-government, anti-regulatory or anti-abortion beliefs.Recent acts of right-wing terror include the fatal 2012 shooting of 6 people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, the 2015 killing of 9 people at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and another 2015 shooting that killed 3 people at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic. Authorities disrupted many more plots that the public may have overlooked because they didn’t involve Muslims.Republicans have played a role in deflecting attention away from far-right terror. In 2009, when former President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security issued a report on right-wing extremist radicalization, GOP leaders blasted language identifying “disgruntled military veterans” as potential targets for terrorist recruitment. Then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano eventually apologized to veterans and retracted the report.The cases below certainly don’t serve as a comprehensive list of every right-wing terror plot uncovered in the past few years, and calling attention to them is not an attempt to paint all men with right-wing beliefs as terrorists intent on killing Muslims or people of color.Yet as long as the White House continues to focus exclusively on terrorist acts by people who claim to be acting in the name of Islam ― and on the least likely sources of such terrorism, like refugees ― Muslims in the U.S. and around the world will continue to be unfairly demonized. Critics say this is likely to complicate the fight against legitimate terror threats and inspire more terrorism, both foreign and domestic.In October, Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were arrested and charged with conspiring to detonate a truck bomb in a Kansas apartment complex where more than 100 Somali immigrants lived.All three were members of a white supremacist group called “The Crusaders.” The group espoused “sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs,” according to an FBI agent’s affidavit. Authorities have since filed additional firearms charges against the defendants, who have all pleaded not guilty. Federal authorities arrested Ronald Chaney III, Robert Curtis Doyle and Charles Halderman in November 2015 after they allegedly tried to buy an automatic weapon, explosives and a pistol with a silencer from undercover agents. The men had discussed a plot to attack black churches and Jewish synagogues, which they justified as a necessary assault in “an impending race war.” All three suspects later pleaded guilty.Federal agents arrested Walter Eugene Litteral, Christopher James Barker and Christopher Todd Campbell in August 2015, after discovering a plot to manufacture explosives and purchase weapons and body armor to kill members of law enforcement and the U.S. military.The men believed “the federal government intended to use the armed forces to impose martial law in the United States, which they and others would resist with violent force,” according to court documents. They believed this as part of a popular conspiracy theory regarding a multi-state military exercise known as Jade Helm. All three defendants later pleaded guilty and were sentenced to less than two years in prison.Police and FBI agents raided a home in St. Louis in March 2015 after informants revealed that its owner, David Michael Hagler, had discussed plans to go on a killing spree targeting members of law enforcement at funerals and fundraisers. Informants said Hagler held “extreme anti-government and anti-law enforcement views,” and had recently hardened his rhetoric against minorities and Muslims. Police were concerned they’d find explosives, booby traps and assault rifles at Hagler’s home, but an extensive search only turned up other firearms. Hagler later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison in February 2016.Robert Doggart, of Sequatchie County, Tennessee, was charged in 2015 for allegedly plotting with associates to lay siege to Islamberg, an Islamic community in upstate New York.Doggart, a former congressional candidate, allegedly planned to use assault rifles, firebombs and even machetes to “inflict horrible numbers of casualties upon the enemies of our Nation and World Peace,” according to court documents. His trial is set to begin next month.In July 2014, Pennsylvania police found approximately 20 improvised explosive devices at the house of Eric Charles Smith, a man with white supremacist ties whom authorities had previously arrested. Federal officials also discovered Nazi paraphernalia and literature suggesting Smith had been hosting meeting for a group called the “White Church Supremacists.”One of the bombs included a message reading “(Expletive) the government — down with Obama (racial slur) Muslim Pig,” according to police. Smith pleaded guilty and was later sentenced to more than 7 years in prison.Shane Robert Smith was arrested in August 2015 after allegedly amassing an arsenal of machine guns, semi-automatics, armor-piercing ammunition and silencers to form a “hit squad” to murder minorities and Jewish people. Officials said that the teen’s social media accounts were littered with hate speech against the groups he may have intended to target. Smith pleaded guilty in 2016 and has been sentenced to 3 years in prison. Violence and radicalism are complicated forces, often driven by complex social and political conditions and inflamed by personal factors. No single radical, or even group of them, can define a race, religion or belief system.But extremism in any form can be a threat to U.S. security, and Trump says he’s simply pursuing the impossibly ambitious goal of keeping all Americans safe. If he truly wants to do that, he should be more consistent in acknowledging all potential sources of terror. Most importantly, he must not encourage further extremism, whether carried out in the name of Islam or in opposition to it.Portions of this piece were published in a previous story on right-wing terror plots."
3,POLITICS,"Betsy DeVos' Nomination Clears Senate Committee, Despite Staunch Democratic Opposition",Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-education-secretary-nomination_us_588f77bbe4b02772c4e80681,The vote on Trump's pick for education secretary was split along party lines.,2017-01-31,"The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted to advance the nomination of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588fe06d17000030001d14f7.jpeg?cache=3Cqb8Cmfr4&ops=crop_10_309_5053_2951%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A Senate committee voted to advance the nomination of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education Tuesday.The vote was split along party lines, with all 11 Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voting to reject DeVos, and all 12 of the committee’s Republicans voting to approve her. Next, DeVos faces a full Senate vote. Two Republican senators on the HELP Committee, Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), suggested that they were not sure how they would vote at that point.“I have not been persuaded that Betsy DeVos will put students first if she were confirmed and I have not been persuaded that she has the experience, skills, understanding or vision to lead this critical department at a time when it is more important than ever,” committee ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Tuesday before the vote. “There is so much about Betsy DeVos’ record over the years that we can look to when we make this decision.”DeVos has inspired staunch opposition from some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups. Although her vote in committee was originally scheduled for last week, it was delayed so lawmakers would have more time to review the paperwork she filed with the Office of Government Ethics. DeVos answered questions during a committee hearing earlier this month, but in the past week, Democrats requested a second opportunity to question her amid new revelations about her vast financial entanglements. Their request was rejected. Since DeVos’ hearing, Democrats submitted over 800 additional written questions to the nominee in an effort to get more details on her views. By Monday evening, DeVos had responded to all of the questions, but some Democrats complained that her answers were not sufficient and actually raised more questions. On Monday afternoon, Murray once again pressed for a postponement of the vote.“After an initial review of the responses sent to Committee members with less than twenty four hours before the scheduled vote, staff has identified a number of critical questions about Ms. DeVos’ financial disclosure to the Committee and other areas that have not been answered to anywhere close to satisfaction,” said a Monday statement from Murray’s spokesperson, Eli Zupnick. “Senator Murray does not believe that members of the Committee have enough information about Ms. DeVos’ opaque finances, conflicts of interest, and other issues.”DeVos, a Michigan native, comes from a billionaire family that has donated millions of dollars to members of Congress. She is a passionate education activist, mostly involved in causes that prop up private and charter schools. Her opponents say that her interest in these institutions comes at the expense of traditional public schools ― which a vast majority of American students attend ― and that her views could have disastrous consequences for the public school system. DeVos has never formally worked in a public school. She is a staunch opponent of teachers unions, and a broad coalition of civil rights groups also say they are worried about her ascent. On Monday, about 250 national and local civil rights groups signed an anti-DeVos letter, saying that she “has demonstrated no previous commitment to ensuring equal educational opportunity in school.”In recent weeks, the chorus of voices challenging DeVos appears to have grown louder. After putting up what many saw as a lackluster performance at her confirmation hearing, protests opposing her confirmation broke out across the nation. During the hearing, DeVos stumbled over key questions and became fodder for late-night television after saying that schools might need guns to protect against grizzly bears. A review of written answers she submitted to the committee showed many lines were lifted verbatim and without citation from statutes and other sources.Several Democratic lawmakers report having seen an influx of anti-DeVos calls from constituents, and some have even begun capitalizing on the fierce opposition to her as a fundraising tactic, reports Education Week. The progressive change network CREDO Action collected over 1.4 million signatures on an anti-DeVos petition, a record for the group.Still, she has strong support from prominent Republicans such as HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Before the vote, Alexander noted that he thinks DeVos has been the most questioned education secretary nominee in history.“I don’t think it’s fair to treat Ms. DeVos so different than we did Obama’s nominees,” Alexander said. “I respect my colleagues, I don’t question their motives, I don’t question their votes, but I believe their concerns are misplaced.”Also during Tuesday’s HELP Committee panel, Murray called for a vote on an amendment that would require Cabinet nominees to release their tax returns.“I have asked each Cabinet-level nominee that this committee will consider to submit three years of tax returns ― but so far each has refused,” she said. “So I am hopeful we can come together, across party lines, in the interest of good government and ethics ― and pass this amendment to move the HELP Committee to where a number of other committees already are, including Finance, Budget, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.”The amendment was defeated along party lines.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

The outlet reports Gottwald claims Kesha told Gaga that the producer had raped another female recording artist. “Dr. Luke seeks to add an additional defamation claim against Kesha based upon the discovery of another false and defamatory statement she made about him that was part of her calculated effort to harm his reputation and business,” Gottwald’s lawyer, Christine Lepera, said in a statement. According to the complaint, which was obtained by Pitchfork, the text conversation between the two pop stars took place on Feb. 26, 2016.“During this text message conversation, Kesha falsely and basely asserted that Kesha and another female recording artist ... had both been raped by [Dr. Luke]. Kesha’s assertions to Lady Gaga were completely false,” the complaint reads. It also states that Gottwald “did not rape Kesha, and he did not rape the other recording artist,” and notes “Kesha was (and is) well aware Gottwald never raped Kesha. Kesha has no basis or justification whatsoever to falsely assert that Gottwald raped the other recording artist.”The complaint goes on to accuse Gaga of spreading “negative messages” about Gottwald and suggesting she had some damaging information on the producer. (Gaga has openly supported Kesha throughout this legal battle.)Kesha filed her own counterclaims against Gottwald Monday, according to BuzzFeed, claiming that Gottwald has a “vendetta against Kesha.” “You can get a divorce from an abusive spouse. You can dissolve a partnership if the relationship becomes irreconcilable,” Kesha’s amended complaint states, via Pitchfork. “The same opportunity — to be liberated from the physical, emotional, and financial bondage of a destructive relationship — should be available to a recording artist.”As BuzzFeed reports, Kesha’s filing claims Gottwald is the reason she’s been unable to return to work or release new music. Her court papers read in part, “Kesha’s efforts to record and release her next album have been met with unfounded resistance and delay,” according to BuzzFeed. The outlet reports not one of the 20 songs she had provided this past summer were approved and there have been no advancements on promoting or releasing a new album. The “We R Who We R” singer’s claim states if Gottwald wins the legal fight ― and as a result, millions of dollars ― she and her mother will be “penniless.”It also claims, according to Pitchfork, that Sony’s contract with Gottwald is supposed to end in March 2017, but “without the court’s intervention and Sony’s facilitation, Kesha will remain contractually bound to Dr. Luke until she releases three additional albums, each containing six songs produced individually by Dr. Luke, no matter how many years that takes.” The contract Kesha initially signed in 2005 at the age of 18 requires her to deliver five albums for Gottwald before the agreement is terminated. If she does not release three more albums, she could essentially be stuck in the contract for the rest of her life, according to BuzzFeed. The pop star tried to be released from her contract, but a judge denied her motion to do so in February of last year. In response to Kesha’s counterclaims, Lepera said, “Kesha’s new proposed counterclaim simply repeats the meritless and untrue allegations that were set forth in her earlier pleadings and which Dr. Luke fully disputes.”The Huffington Post has reached out to a representative for Kesha and will update this post accordingly. Kesha and Gottwald have been embroiled in a legal battle since October 2014, when the singer accused the producer of sexual assault and battery and filed a lawsuit against him. That same month, Gottwald fired back with his own lawsuit, accusing Kesha and her mother of defamation. Since then, Kesha has appeared in court, but as mentioned, a New York Judge denied a preliminary injunction that would have allowed her to record under a different label. However, the judge did rule that she would be allowed to record with a different producer under Sony’s umbrella. Gottwald has maintained his innocence. Kesha has been extremely vocal about the entire experience, often using social media to express her emotions and thank fans for their support. She also released a song with EDM producer Zedd, and performed with with Kesha and the Creepies. According to Pitchfork, Kesha is set to appear in court on Feb. 7, while Gottwald is scheduled for a deposition on Feb. 14. On Feb. 21, a phone conference with the judge is scheduled. "

Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community. President Trump continues to be respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights, just as he was throughout the election. The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression. The executive order signed in 2014, which protects employees from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors, will remain intact at the direction of President Donald J. Trump.Obama’s 2014 executive order protected federal contractors from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The GOP-led House of Representatives tried to overturn that policy in May.Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said he was unimpressed by Trump’s announcement.“Claiming ally status for not overturning the progress of your predecessor is a rather low bar,” he tweeted.Trump’s announcement came a day after widespread rumors that the president was considering a broader “religious freedom” executive order that would target the LGBTQ community. The Washington Post reported that there was even a draft of the order in circulation. LGBTQ groups quickly responded on Twitter that they were ready to fight Trump if he went forward with it. There are still concerns that Trump could carry out such a move, similar to what has been passed in states. Such a policy would allow federal employees, for example, to cite their religion and refuse to serve LGBTQ people, or allow programs ― such as adoption agencies ― that receive federal funding to turn away individuals on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Trump’s statement Tuesday did not rule out this sort of order.The 1964 Civil Rights Act protects people from discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion and national origin, but there are no federal protections for sexual orientation and gender identity. Democrats have legislation that would address that gap, but the GOP-controlled Congress has refused to take it up. Trump has said he doesn’t support marriage equality but that he considers the matter settled because the Supreme Court made it the law of the land in 2015. Trump also expressed support during the campaign for North Carolina’s law that bars cities and localities from enacting anti-discrimination policies that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.And Trump’s number two, Vice President Mike Pence ― a longtime outspoken opponent of LGBTQ equality ― enacted a religious freedom law in his own state when he was governor of Indiana in 2015. The law quickly sparked intense backlash against Pence and the state of Indiana. Opponents of the bill argued that it would open the door to widespread discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. Business owners who didn’t want to serve same-sex couples, for example, could have legal protections to discriminate.Under heavy state and national pressure, Pence eventually signed a revised version of the law that explicitly barred a business from denying services to someone on the basis of categories that include sexual orientation and gender identity."

Americans have more sympathy for refugees in theory than in practice. And most of the public is concerned about people losing their health insurance. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, January 31, 2017.REPUBLICANS TRUST TRUMP MORE THAN THE MEDIA - HuffPollster, with Paige Lavender: “According to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 81 percent of Republicans think the media wants Trump to fail. Only 5 percent of Republicans said they trusted the media ‘a great deal’ to state facts fully and accurately, but 38 percent say they trust Trump and his administration to present facts fully and accurately. A December 2016 poll revealed similar numbers among Trump voters, 56 percent of whom said they’d believe Trump over a national media outlet reporting he’d said something untrue.” [HuffPost] What should the role of the media be? - The poll found that a majority of the public, 61 percent, thinks that the media should be neutral. But 36 percent of Republicans think that the media should want Trump to succeed. Just 5 percent think that it does want him to do so. Three-quarters of Republicans say they think media coverage of Trump has been too negative, and just 17 percent that it’s been either too positive or about right. Among all Americans, that number is 41 percent, with 14 percent calling the coverage too positive, and 27 percent saying it’s been about right.THE U.S. HAS LONG BEEN SKEPTICAL TOWARD REFUGEES - HuffPollster: “Surveys taken last year found that most Americans oppose temporarily barring Muslims from other countries, but that there’s also little enthusiasm for helping Syrian refugees….In the years leading up to World War II, many Americans were also suspicious of Jews fleeing the Nazis….In theory, the public supports helping those in need. When asked in 2011 whether the inscription on the Statue of Liberty — ‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free’ — should still apply to immigration policy, 62 percent of Americans said it should. In the face of a specific crisis, their views often turn less welcoming. ‘Americans have a general reluctance to accept refugees into the U.S., even in response to situations that are clearly oppressive,’ Frank Newport, the editor-in-chief of Gallup, wrote in 2015. He noted that the firm had found majority support for allowing in refugees only once, in response to a 1999 question about bringing several hundred Albanian refugees from Kosovo.” [HuffPost] Jens Manuel Krogstad and Jynnah Radford lay out six key facts about refugees to the U.S. [Pew] Will Jordan argues that Trump’s travel ban is “a Muslim ban in all but name.” [Borderline]MANY AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT LOSS OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE - Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Emily Swanson: “Though ‘Obamacare’ still divides Americans, a majority worry that many will lose coverage if the 2010 law is repealed in the nation’s long-running political standoff over health care. A new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 56 percent of U.S. adults are ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ concerned that many will lose health insurance if the health overhaul is repealed. That includes more than 8 in 10 Democrats, nearly half of independents, and more than 1 in 5 Republicans. Another 45 percent of Republicans say they’re ‘somewhat’ concerned….Released Friday, the poll serves as a reality check for Republicans as they try to find a path to repealing and replacing former President Barack Obama’s signature legislation. It found that even as few Americans want to keep the health law in its current form, many provisions enjoy broad popularity. The exception: the law’s requirement that most Americans carry health insurance or face fines.” [AP] Survey finds rising approval for ACA- Anna Yukhananov: “Approval ratings for the Affordable Care Act jumped to 47 percent immediately after Trump came into office, up from 41 percent at the beginning of January, prior to his inauguration. That compares to 45 percent of voters who disapprove of the law, down from 52 percent. The spike was particularly pronounced among people who say the country is on the ‘wrong track.’ Fifty-two percent of people who chose that response now approve of the ACA, up 13 percentage points from the prior poll. Approval numbers also went up more than 10 percentage points among people who care about health care, urban voters, those in the middle class and young people.” [Morning Consult] Few support total repeal - Quinnipiac University: “Most American voters are satisfied with the quality and cost of their health care and say Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) should be fixed, but not repealed, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. And voters say 84 - 13 percent that Congress should not repeal the ACA until there is a replacement plan in place. Only 16 percent of voters say President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress should repeal all of the ACA, while 51 percent say repeal parts of the law and 30 percent say don’t repeal any of the ACA.” [Quinnipiac]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

11,POLITICS,Trump's 'Monday Night Massacre' Another Sign Of No Business As Usual,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-attorney-general-firing-another-sign-of-no-business-as-usual_us_58900dc1e4b0c90efeffc488,"The world isn't burning yet, but it's increasingly important to stay vigilant, legal experts say.",2017-01-31,Constitutional law professor Lawrence Tribe says Donald Trump is raising his risk of fights with the courts.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5890269e1b0000260004d6ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s snap firing of acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday night has observers recalling President Richard Nixon’s “Saturday Night Massacre” of 1973, when White House attacks on an independent investigation caused the resignation of the then-attorney general and his deputy.Decades later, the incident is remembered as a pivotal moment because it exposed how petty, vindictive and unethical Nixon was willing to be.Experts who closely watch the law say Trump’s move against Yates is different but still important. Although not an immediate crisis, it is historic and a reminder that the Trump administration seems set for ever-greater conflicts with U.S. legal tradition, analysts told The Huffington Post.Nixon’s action “was different and considerably more serious,” said Robert Gordon, a Stanford law professor and past president of the American Society for Legal History.Nixon was clearly retaliating against a special prosecutor appointed by Congress, ordering Justice Department officials to fire him without consulting lawmakers. Trump was replacing an acting attorney general who would have soon been replaced with one of his appointees anyway.“This just seems to me another example of the impetuous thoughtlessness of this administration,” Gordon continued. The attorney general position requires sensitive treatment because of its importance to the rule of law, experts said.While the person in that role does serve at the pleasure of the president, his or her ultimate obligation is elsewhere.“The attorney general has an independent obligation to the law as well as to her boss in the White House,” Gordon said. “It’s not a clear hierarchy.”The official is ideally meant to ensure that the executive branch does not violate the law. Yates believed there was a possible violation, according to her Monday statement.The attorney general job is difficult if the executive branch does not want to listen. The George W. Bush White House, for instance, sought the opinions of junior attorney John Yoo rather than those of the attorney general or more senior staff at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) ― a decision that is still condemned today.Sujit Choudhry, the former dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, said the public dispute could have been avoided if Trump’s team had sought opinions from Yates before issuing the executive order on immigration that she said she could not defend. “These sorts of debates happen within the executive branch all the time,” Choudhry said. “I think it happened differently in the sense that the standard policy process in terms of issuing an executive order would be to consult and engage the agencies.”Trump’s White House did not seek legal guidance from the OLC before issuing the order, CNN reported. It also neglected to make a similar request to the Department of Homeland Security or seek advice from the Pentagon, according to The New York Times.White House officials later claimed they had OLC approval, and Trump’s replacement for Yates made the same assertion Monday night.“The relevant agencies were brought in at the end of the day, and there wasn’t consultation with important members of the houses [of Congress], and that’s the process by which our government works. It’s how we make policy and it helps to ensure better policy, and it’s one way to think about what a system of checks and balances is,” Choudhry said. “That’s what’s a departure from how we normally run things ... that’s truly unprecedented.”He noted that this appears to be the first instance of an attorney general’s being made to leave by a president without having shown any inclination to depart.Trump could have avoided the public drama of the firing and worries about presidential overreach by allowing the Justice Department to do its analysis and appointing a special defense counsel in the meanwhile, Harvard Law professor Lawrence Tribe said on MSNBC.By choosing this path, Tribe continued, the president was rapidly boosting the risk of fights with the courts.Those worried about Trump’s actions should note that federal courts are already aggressively examining them and have faith in U.S. institutions, Choudhry said.Yates was already winning high-profile applause Monday night while criticism of Trump grew harsher and congressional battles over his attorney general pick and anticipated Supreme Court nomination seemed to become more likely.“People are right to be worried,” Choudhry said. “Let’s just take it one step at a time and not leap to conclusions about the system coming down.”"
12,POLITICS,People Are Literally Taking Donald Trump's Promises Literally,Arthur Delaney and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-promises-literally_us_5890c4b9e4b0c90eff0060ab,Trump seems to be doing what he said he'd do.,2017-01-31,President Donald Trump attends a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Jan. 31. A new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds Americans increasingly expect him to literally carry out his campaign pledges.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5890c6951700002f001d1732.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― During the campaign, some savvy Donald Trump supporters criticized the media for taking Trump literally but not seriously when he promised to build a giant wall and ban Muslims from traveling to the U.S.Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel was the most prominent person to espouse the Figurative Trump Theory. “I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously, but not literally,” Thiel said at the National Press Club in November, referring to Trump’s two aforementioned promises. Now that Trump is president and has actually taken steps toward building the wall and restricting Muslim immigration, people are certainly taking him literally. A new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds 49 percent of Americans now say they believe that the president intends to carry out all the ideas he proposed during the 2016 campaign, up from the 33 percent who believed so in a November survey. Just 29 percent now say they think Trump “sometimes said things he didn’t really mean” during the campaign.The vast majority also now say Trump was speaking literally, not metaphorically, in regard to some of his most extreme pledges, several of which he has already taken actions toward in his first weeks as president. Sixty-nine percent believe Trump meant literally his promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico and to make Mexico pay for it; 67 percent think he meant literally his pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., and nearly three-quarters think he was being literal in his promise to temporarily ban refugees arriving from some Muslim-majority countries. (The survey was conducted largely before Trump’s executive order on the topic was announced Friday night.) A 60 percent majority also believe he was being literal when he previously questioned the birthplace of former President Barack Obama.Steve Trivett is a Trump voter in Florida who was more on the metaphorical side. He wasn’t sure Trump would actually try to build a wall, though he did think the idea signified the right policy direction. “I was hoping the country’s borders would be secured,” Trivett, a 70-year-old semiretired journalist, said in an interview. “A wall can be a physical barrier or a boundary line or even a philosophical separation between point A and point B.” But now that the Mexican border wall has real prospects, Trivett is pleased. “I was a little unsure but I am glad that it is turned physical,” he said.Congressional Republicans are reportedly drafting a supplemental appropriations bill to cover the $10 billion to $25 billion cost of the wall. Trump’s campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall may not be as literal as the structure itself.Americans only doubt Trump’s literalism on one topic in the survey ― his stated willingness during the campaign to prosecute rival Hillary Clinton, which he has already walked back, to the disappointment of many of his supporters. “That plays great before the election ― now we don’t care, right?” he told supporters chanting “lock her up” in December.Just 31 percent of the public think Trump literally intended to prosecute Clinton, while 36 percent say he was speaking metaphorically, and the rest that they’re unsure.Voters who supported Trump in the election are, for the most part, especially prone to say that they take his words at face value. Seventy-eight percent believe he intends to carry out all the ideas he proposed, and more than 80 percent think he was being literal in his pledges to build a wall, keep out refugees and bring back manufacturing jobs. Trump voters, however, are about equally unlikely as Clinton voters to think he was speaking literally about prosecuting Clinton ― 34 percent and 36 percent, respectively, say he meant it. And although 58 percent of Trump voters believe that his birtherism was meant literally, that’s lower than the 69 percent of Clinton voters who say the same.Thiel, for his part, specifically said that Trump voters took Trump less literally than other voters did ― that they didn’t think he would really want to engage in the construction of a nearly 2,000-mile wall, even though Trump repeatedly said that he did. The data show that Republican voters are the most literal of all. “What they hear is we’re going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy,” Thiel said. “We’re going to try to figure out how do we strike the right balance between costs and benefits.” The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 26-27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Michael McCaul (R-Texas) says, “I think from a legal basis, you have to be careful.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588fe3471b0000250004d613.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, was initially one of the first Republicans to offer support for President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and foreign nationals. But now that the Texas Republican understands the immigration order better, he wants his committee to review the document.“I think from a legal basis, you have to be careful,” McCaul told The Huffington Post on Monday night.“They’re denying people entrance into the country that already have the legal authority to do so. I think that that’s the sticking point,” McCaul said.He said he’s informed the Trump administration that the Homeland Security Committee will be reviewing the order. “We’re going to be hashing those issues out. It’s certainly not over.”That’s a departure from McCaul’s original position. He was quick to praise Trump once the executive order was announced Friday afternoon.“With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last Administration did in eight years,” McCaul said in a statement that came out before the text of the order was made public.But Monday, with a better understanding of the language, McCaul seemed to reverse course in a new statement Monday.“In light of the confusion and uncertainty created in the wake of the President’s Executive Order, it is clear adjustments are needed,” McCaul wrote.In addition to suspending refugee resettlement, the executive order bars nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from entering the U.S. for 90 days. The ban was so broad that it extended even to legal permanent U.S. residents, which was a sticking point for McCaul and several other Republicans. The Department of Homeland Security announced Sunday evening that legal permanent residents are not barred from the country, though they must undergo a review before they can enter.McCaul was a national security adviser for the Trump campaign and was a top contender to be DHS secretary before Trump selected retired Gen. John Kelly.With McCaul’s close relationship with Trump, as well as his position as the House Homeland Security chairman, he’d be a natural ally in helping to put together the executive order. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani even said he had worked with McCaul and others on how to take a “Muslim ban” and show Trump “the right way to do it legally.”Despite claims from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer that staff from “appropriate committees” had been consulted in drafting the language, McCaul said he was not involved at all.“It could have been done better,” McCaul said."

Troop leader Gina Sohn told The Huffington Post that during the visit, the 10-year-old girls discovered “to their great disbelief and outrage” that while there are more than 20 statues of actual historical men in Central Park, there are none honoring real women.Instead, women are represented in the form of fictional characters like Mother Goose, Alice of ‘Alice in Wonderland,” Juliet with Romeo, and characters like angels and nymphs.

Anthony Statue Fund, an initiative to place statues of the two famous women’s rights activists in Central Park.The dollar amount commemorates the year 1920, when women in the U.S. won the right to vote.“The girls were also out in Central Park most weeks this fall raising awareness for the cause with signs, chants and information they handed out about the fund,” Sohn said. “We can’t put a number on donations that resulted from this, but they hope it has made a difference.”Author Myriam Miedzian and her husband Gary Ferdman launched the statue fund in 2013 after noticing the absence of statues honoring women during one of their frequent long walks through the park. Together, they formed a committee with other people looking to change thsi reality. “My husband and I identified 44 women who we believed were as deserving as many of the men in the park, of statues honoring them!” Miedzian told HuffPost. “We decided that most deserving of all were Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony who had worked together for over 50 years for the most basic human rights that women were denied during their lifetime.”Major fundraising efforts began in May 2015, after New York City Parks and Recreation Commissioner, Mitchell Silver, gave them the go-ahead for the project and confirmed a location, Central Park at West 77th Street. The budget is $1.5 million, and to date, they’ve raised over $200,000 from more than 400 donors. The fund also received a challenge grant from New York Life Insurance Company, which pledged to match contributions up to $500,000.Ferdman told HuffPost he believes these statues will help raise awareness around women’s issues. “I think that young men also need a greater appreciation of the achievements of women and the importance of the kind of organizing that resulted in women winning the right to vote,” he said. “Violence against women, unequal pay, the lack of women in political leadership are problems that affect us all.” Sohn said her troop hopes to rally enough people to donate to the fund so that the first statue of a real woman will appear in Central Park by 2020 ― the centennial of women winning the right to vote in the U.S.The girls also hope this project will inspire others to examine their cities and parks and ask, “Where are the women?” And if there are none, perhaps those people will work to get women “out of the dark and into the park” by starting their own similar campaigns.Sohn commends the members of her troop for turning inspiration into action. “The girls have been studying human rights this year, and all the different rights that fall under human rights ― including women’s rights. They were outraged by what they identified as problem to women’s rights (representation) and came up with an idea of how to solve it,” she explained.“They learned that there was power in their loud voices and passion to right wrongs and ‘to help people at all times’ ― part of the Girl Scout Law,” she added. “They were bold, courageous, intelligent, creative and persistent in their approach to righting a wrong. Girl Scouts can and should be a moving force in empowering girls and young women to change the world for the better.

16,POLITICS,Site That Helped Battle Brexit Will Fund Lawyers Challenging Trump Muslim Ban,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crowdjustice-brexit-trump-muslim-ban_us_588fad45e4b02772c4e87f59,"U.S. officials forced up to 60 people to surrender their legal status, according to a suit CrowdJustice is supporting.",2017-01-31,"Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), center, speaks at a rally against the travel ban in Washington on Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58902ce91b0000260004d6b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― CrowdJustice, a prominent British fundraising platform for legal representation, launched in the U.S. Tuesday, accepting donations for its first American case: a complaint in Virginia against President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.British activists used the for-profit company’s system to raise over £170,550 (more than $200,000) for a “people’s challenge” to their government’s decision to withdraw from the European Union following a referendum last summer. Last week, the British supreme court ruled in favor of those activists and other opponents of the government move, setting a historic precedent and forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to take the issue to Parliament.Now the site is fundraising for the Legal Aid Justice Center, a Virginia-based group that filed suit against Trump’s order on Monday.The order caused homeland security officials to lie to up to 60 individuals who traveled to Dulles International Airport in Virginia after Trump signed his ban, the suit alleges, forcing them to sign away their legally granted right to be in the U.S. under a false threat of a five-year ban on entry. Once they had obtained the travelers’ signatures, the border agents were able to deport or detain them. The center’s attorneys believe the government violated due process rights specifically because of a desire to discriminate against Muslims, they wrote. “One can renounce one’s legal status. That might be for whatever personal reasons,” said Mary Bauer, the center’s executive director. “The issue here is that the Department of Homeland Security could not accomplish what they wanted lawfully, so we have reason to believe that they lied.”The suit names two affected individuals, Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz, both Yemeni citizens with U.S. visas. They arrived at Dulles on Saturday as part of their journey to reunite with their father, a U.S. citizen. Border agents did not allow them to board their connecting flight. Instead, they handcuffed them and took them to detention, where they made them sign the forms ― which specifically say they are to be used voluntarily. They placed the brothers on a flight back to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they remain, Bauer said, unwilling to return to war-torn Yemen. They do not even have copies of the documents they signed, she continued.The other approximately 60 individuals who lawyers believe had similar experiences ― holding passports from countries on Trump’s list and valid U.S. immigration documents, such as green cards or visas ― are not named in the complaint. The center is working to identify and name those who were affected, Bauer said.The complaint notes that travelers who had similar documents were permitted to enter the country after some time in detention, citing this as further evidence that border officials lied.Dulles authorities have defied attorneys and lawmakers for days, even after a federal judge ruled Saturday that detainees with green cards must have access to counsel.After a trip to the airport Saturday night, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he believed the border agents were defying the court ruling. He provided an affidavit on the events of the night for the complaint and sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly Monday evening.The Virginia suit is one of multiple legal challenges to Trump’s order, which the top Justice Department official refused to defend before Trump fired her Monday night. Meanwhile, protests against the administration’s actions are ongoing across the country. CrowdJustice, the platform helping support the case, anticipates strong public backing for multiple suits in the Trump era. “We’re really, really excited to launch here in the U.S. ... at a time when the courts are proving a very valuable antidote to executive power,” said Julia Salasky, the firm’s chief executive. Launched because of worries about increasingly unequal access to the courts in the United Kingdom and the U.S., the site allows individuals to choose which cases they want to support ― an option not currently available when donating to large organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union. It hopes to attract activists on the left and right.“There’s not really a political aspect to what we’re doing,” Salasky said. “There’s a huge democratization aspect.”"

It’s a research area with obvious implications for counterterrorism operations. And it’s one that Salih wants to continue pursuing in the United States after he gets his degree.But Salih, who is here on a student visa, has a problem. He’s from the Kurdistan region of Iraq, which means that under President Donald Trump’s executive order ― designed to impede the worst outcomes of extremism ― he would be prohibited for the next 90 days from coming back into the country should he leave.And he needs to leave. His research brings him back to Iraq as well as to various international conferences. He attended one in Beirut just four days before Trump’s inauguration. His family is in Iraq, too, and should there be an emergency, he’d be forced to choose between uprooting his life or missing out on family events. He is now contemplating the once unthinkable. After waiting seven months for his first visa and four months for his second, he’s now waiting 90 days to see if the suspension of refugees and travelers from Iraq and six other countries is lifted. If it is not, he’ll explore greener career pastures outside of the United States. “Before coming to Annenberg, I had admission from Concordia University in Montreal, which is also a good school. And when I was weighing my option, I was thinking quite a bit about it given the rhetoric in the primaries,” Salih said. “At the end, because of Annenberg’s standing and reputation, I decided I would want to come here. And you can imagine, right now, i’m sort of wondering quite a bit if I made the right decision. I’m actually wondering whether I should have not picked the school in Canada and gone there.”After just 10 days in office, Trump has shaken the world of science and academia. It’s not just the general skepticism that he and his Cabinet seem to bring to some fields (predominantly climate science) or the promises he’s made to tighten the nation’s discretionary spending, which could come at the price of federally funded scientific research. The Trump White House’s decision to clamp down on communication from various federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, has left researchers frightened over political influence seeping into their work. And his executive order has left students and scientists in limbo, removed from their classrooms and work. Advocates are warning that the inhospitable environment will lead, quite quickly, to a brain drain. A young generation of thinkers, academics and researchers might simply look to other countries to conduct their work. “We understand that a strong visa policy is important for our national security. But if we abandoned our goal here of attracting the best and brightest, the long-term implications are serious for our leadership in the world,” said Association of American Universities President Mary Sue Coleman. “I would have a tough time, if I felt that we couldn’t be welcoming as a country, telling a student that he or she should come here.” Already, the beginning of brain drain is taking shape. Coleman said the Institute for International Education estimates 16,000 to 17,000 students hold valid visas from the seven countries were listed in Trump’s executive order. Many prominent schools spoke out in concern Monday, while entire research labs were thrown into uncertainty.Beyond that, there are faculty and university staff from those seven countries who are unable to leave the U.S. now or, in some cases, return to their classrooms. Two associate professors at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth were detained at Boston’s Logan International Airport over the weekend. A Yale professor was separated from his wife and newborn, who were visiting family, while a professor at Middlebury College remained decamped in Iran with his two children waiting for further guidance on whether he’d be allowed back into the United States with his green card. The Association of American Medical Colleges warned that its ability to attract top talent from around the world was being threatened. Scientific consortiums and organizations are planning to move conferences overseas for fear that they couldn’t have full attendance under the constructs of Trump’s order. The International Astronomical Union urged U.S. officials to reconsider their screening measures, noting that they had hosted a conference in Hawaii in 2015 with about 3,000 astronomers, including some from the seven targeted countries. Wendy Naus, executive director of the Consortium of Social Science Associations, said that, on a phone call to discuss the executive order Monday morning, two members of a group of scientific societies pushed to move their conferences to Canada. “People are scrambling right now in the scientific community to figure out all the ways it plays out and what it means for grad students, innovation and the private sector,” Naus said. “If it is a glitch or a blip, and the outrage is heard and things go back, the damage isn’t done. But if it is the new normal, then, yeah, we are risking our competitive advantage. These are fundamentally things we’ve never confronted before.”As the United States begins closing its doors on foreign-based scientists, other countries are sensing an opportunity. Kaz Nejatian, co-founder and CEO of Kash, a next-generation payment company, promised to connect those turned down for H-1B visas (which Trump is rumored to be targeting for restrictions) with Canadian tech companies who are hiring. Meanwhile, U.S.-based tech companies ― at least those who spoke out ― were uniform in their disapproval of the executive order, noting that they’d be left without the ability to recruit from some of the best workforce pools.Lawmakers are acutely aware of this issue, not least because many hail from districts with universities and others receive campaign donations from groups and industries affected by the executive order. But the prevailing sentiment within the White House has been against opening up U.S. borders. “That’s a real problem,” said Liz Mair, a pro-immigration Republican strategist, “both in terms of risking longer-term brain-drain but also in terms of actual direct, day-to-day health care where America is very reliant on foreign nationals— something that might change in 10 years but can’t change in the course of 72 hours and might matter to a lot of people in the next 90 days.”The concerns for science and research advocates go beyond immigration policy. Apparent gag orders at the EPA along with the fear of belt-tightening from Congress will sour the scientific climate and drain the pool of funds for prospective researchers. In that environment, the more established scientists with better known projects tend to thrive, while the younger ones flounder, become discouraged and look elsewhere. Naomi Charalambakis, 26, a U.S. citizen, is a third-year doctoral student at the University of Louisville, studying anatomy and neurobiology. But upon graduation, she plans to leave the field. Part of it is a lifestyle decision, an eagerness to have a family and a 9-to-5 job. But the funding climate is also daunting: Her mentor, she said, has stopped ordering lab supplies over concerns that appropriations will dwindle. And her career choice is a reflection of that. After earning her doctorate, Charalambakis plans to come to Washington, D.C., to advocate for expanded budgets at the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and elsewhere.“My colleagues are frustrated and don’t know what to do. A lot of them say they don’t know if they can continue in the lab and are wondering if they will have to start all over and have another career entirely. I feel we just can’t be quiet.”"

19,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Breaking His Promise To Be Tough On Wall Street,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wall-street_us_5890c587e4b02772c4e98b79,The president's agenda is full-throttle deregulation.,2017-01-31,"Steven Mnuchin testifies before Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 19, 2017, to become secretary of the treasury.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5890c66c17000026002d98bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Feb. 3 ― President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Friday that halt the Obama administration’s conflict of interest rule for retirement savings and order a review of the 2010 financial reform rules meant to make banks more stable and less likely to need bailouts.If there was ever doubt that President Donald Trump’s tough talk on big banks was an empty show, his first 12 days in office have put it to rest. Trump is governing like a run-of-the-mill, deregulating Wall Street crony, despite his populist campaign rhetoric: His party’s platform pledged to return to the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which broke up big financial institutions by separating investment and commercial banking; he vowed to close a tax provision that saves private equity managers billions of dollars; he lambasted his opponent for her ties to Goldman Sachs, and he assailed the bank’s CEO in an election ad.On Monday, Trump made his first direct comments since his inauguration about the post-financial crisis bank regulation reform bill. “Dodd-Frank is a disaster,” he said. “We’re going to be doing a big number on Dodd-Frank.”Tossing out Dodd-Frank would mean gutting huge swathes of rules restricting big banks, including intricate capital standards and the annual stress tests regulators use to make sure banks won’t need to be bailed out to the independent Consumer Financial Bureau. Indeed, the financial industry’s antipathy to the CFPB ― the brainchild of bank foe Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ― has Democratic aides and consumer advocates increasingly worried that Trump will fire its director, Richard Cordray. A mortgage company has brought forth a lawsuit questioning the president’s authority to do so. A three-judge federal appeals court panel ruled in October that the president could fire the agency’s head for any reason. (The agency has asked for the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear the case.)The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In between claiming his rivals Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were controlled by Wall Street, Trump peppered his campaign with pledges to undo Obama-era financial reform. But he undercut the idea that he would enact tough new oversight to replace Dodd-Frank even before being inaugurated ― by filling his new administration with a cadre of Goldman Sachs alumni. Steven Mnuchin, a former second-generation Goldman partner who founded a hedge fund and bought and ran a bank that foreclosed on tens of thousands of Americans during the housing crisis, was Trump’s pick to run the Treasury Department. Mnuchin was asked in his confirmation hearing what Trump’s idea of a new Glass-Steagall meant, specifically. His muddled response indicated that it simply referred to what, if anything, Trump ended up replacing Dodd-Frank with. (Senate Democrats are currently holding up Mnuchin’s nomination because he said in his confirmation hearing his bank didn’t use robo-signing. A Columbus Dispatch report used public documents to show Mnuchin’s claim was false.) Trump chose Gary Cohn, who spent a decade as Goldman Sach’s president and chief operating officer, to serve as his director of the National Economic Council ― a job generally seen as the No. 2 economic policy role, after the Treasury Secretary. And Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund salesman, event promoter and Goldman Sachs alum, was brought into the White House as a public liaison to government agencies and businesses. Scaramucci said in October that the Obama administration’s rule that cracked down on fees and bad advice to people saving for retirement was the equivalent to the Dred Scott decision. (He later called the comparison “a Dog Whistle for the media to demonstrate mock outrage.”) Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, was also an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in the late 1980s.Indeed, what appears to be the first action of the new Trump administration ― reversing a planned decrease in the cost of a federal mortgage insurance program that helps working- and middle-class Americans buy homes ― will mean hundreds of thousands of Americans will pay more money every month and tens of thousands may not be able to buy homes at all. The price hike, however, is a helpful boost to anyone selling private mortgage insurance and investors in mortgage-backed securities. "

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) are both concerned about the executive order's sweep but await clarifications from the White House.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588ffa751b0000260004d657.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Congress may need to take action to curtail President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking all refugees and specific foreign nationals if lawmakers don’t start getting answers, a number of Senate Republicans said on Monday.Not a single Senate Republican out of the 10 that The Huffington Post talked to had been consulted before Trump signed the order Friday afternoon. The White House did not release the final text until 2½ hours later, and even then left major issues unclear, such as whether legal permanent residents, also called green card holders, should be subject to the ban. As a result, many people who live in the U.S. returning from travel were detained in airports across the country. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly announced that green card holders can be admitted case by case.Senate Republicans were left scrambling to answer questions from constituents over the weekend without understanding the full implications of the ban. By Monday, many senators still didn’t have their questions answered and, even with the clarification concerning green card holders, thought the order was still too sweeping.“Obviously the communication was not there, interagency process was not there, folks here on the Hill were not aware of what was getting ready to happen, people around the world were not aware,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters Monday. “Chaos ensued.”Corker, who wasn’t approached by the administration for advice ahead of the rollout, said he was “immediately” contacted by a White House official after issuing a statement Sunday calling the order “poorly implemented.” Now the administration is keeping an open channel to help him fully understand the ban, but Corker left the door open for “legislative action.”“In a few days, if there are still some concerns, then possibly,” Corker said when asked if Congress should step in. “But right now I’d rather them more fully develop what it is they really have initiated.”Trump’s executive order is far more dramatic than what Republicans have voted for in the past. It suspends the entire refugee resettlement program for 120 days and blocks Syrian refugees indefinitely. It also bars from the country travelers and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― for 90 days.A number of Republicans who spoke out against the ban objected specifically to the fact that it swept up green card holders, while others said it was done with too little consultation or was harmful to U.S. national security efforts.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Trump should have at least consulted the departments of homeland security, justice, state and defense before issuing the order. Asked if Congress should take action to revise it, Collins said she was “hoping that between the courts and administration making revisions that that will take care of it.”Presently, she added, the order is “still overly broad.”“I’m concerned about Iraqi translators and bodyguards who worked for our military, saved the lives of our troops and our diplomats, and whose own lives are at risk if they stay in Iraq,” Collins said of those potentially caught up in the ban. “We do need better vetting ... but to have a blanket ban on refugees just does not make sense, and I am also very concerned about anything that is akin to a religious test for admission into the U.S. That is contrary to our American values and likely unconstitutional.”Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told reporters he still couldn’t get his questions answered about the ban and called it a “mistake” on the administration’s part not to coordinate with the necessary agencies.Rubio said his staff was told the State Department “was ordered not to talk to Congress about this issue” but wasn’t given a reason why.“We reached out to state, and we were told that the directive was that they were not to share any information today,” Rubio said. “I suppose it’s because [they’re] not clear what they’ll tell us yet, but that cannot be a permanent position. We expect answers here fairly soon. We have constituents calling.”Outside of the thousands of “very vulnerable people living in dangerous places” that have been shut out with the halting of the entire refugee resettlement program, Rubio said, he received calls over the weekend from companies asking if they could get employees off cruise lines and onto shore, and from constituents asking if they’d be allowed back if they traveled overseas. “Right now we have more questions than we have answers, and I hope that’s going to change here, and if it doesn’t, then perhaps there’s a role” for Congress to take action, Rubio said. Sen. John Isakson (R-Ga.) was also open to the idea of Congress stepping in, saying “it may be necessary” but that it’s up to party leaders and committee chairs. Other Republicans struggled to defend Trump’s actions since they were still rushing to catch up with the specifics of the order. A few blamed former President Barack Obama for the way Trump decided to rollout the ban. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he hopes Trump consults with lawmakers in the future, but now that the issue concerning green card holders has been clarified he doesn’t have much of a problem with the order. “People who do not live here do not have constitutional rights,” Paul said. “You don’t have a constitutional right to immigrate here.” Pressed on the administration’s messy rollout on a Friday afternoon without asking for any input, Paul blamed it on Trump’s predecessor. “Well, they’re following the lead of President Obama, who used his executive order and executive power to do many things, but many of things we’re going to see undone are being undone [because they] were executive orders to begin with,” Paul said.  This particular executive order, however, isn’t undoing any of Obama’s.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) fumbled with the elevator button and waited for the doors to start closing between him and reporters before finally answering if he was disturbed by Trump taking action without talking to Republican lawmakers first. “Umm, we’ll see where it goes from here,” Flake said. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) chalked it up to Trump being Trump, but added it “could have been helpful” if the president had consulted with the Hill in advance. “He’s doing some things that are unconventional, and that’s not a bad thing, if they work,” he said. “We have a president that moves at the speed of business, not the speed of government,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) before escaping onto an elevator. Trump’s speed sent federal officials into a tailspin, and many did not have directives on how to carry out the executive order. Over the weekend, thousands flocked to airports to protest the ban as many individuals with proper paperwork were detained for hours and denied access to legal counsel.Elise Foley contributed reporting.

The roughly 150 people at Silver Spring’s Muslim Community Center are worried about what Trump will do next. “Some of the things that happen, they lead to bigger things,” said Samina Ali, 65, who is originally from Pakistan and has been a U.S. citizen for 40 years. “I was reading about the Holocaust, and this is how it all started: small incidents and they got bigger and bigger and bigger. ... I think that’s the extreme ― those were different days and these are different days ― but of course it does concern you.” Her daughter, 45-year-old Sarah Shakir, added that she knows the current executive order doesn’t apply to native-born American citizens like herself or naturalized ones like her mother, but the next orders might. “I feel like that could change any minute, and that’s what’s really frightening for me,” Shakir said. Trump signed an executive order on Friday that halts all refugee resettlement for 120 days, bars Syrian refugees indefinitely and places a 90-day ban on entry for nationals of seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. There was a striking lack of clarity about the order, which the White House did not release until 2 and 1/2 hours after Trump signed it, leaving people to speculate and fret over what was inside. Some things are still unclear, such as whether green card-holders will continue to be part of the ban ― White House officials contradicted themselves on this point, before finally announcing later Sunday that green card holders should be admitted. It’s also not clear how a court order that temporarily blocked parts of the ban will play out in the coming days.That lack of clarity was part of why people gathered at the Muslim Community Center, where children went to Sunday school or played while their parents asked experts what to make of what had happened. The event’s speakers, Abed Ayoub of the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee and law professor Khaled Beydoun, didn’t sugarcoat things: They predicted that although there have been positive signs in the courts and in public support, Trump has more up his sleeves. “This ban is the first of many Islamophobic policies still to come,” Beydoun said.Many people asked for specifics on the ban related to people with a green card who are not from one of the seven countries targeted in the order: Should doctors from other Arab countries avoid going on a trip to provide pro bono medical care? Should a legal permanent resident from Pakistan come back to the U.S. immediately?Beydoun and Ayoub said they think more countries could be added to the list. In other words, someone from Pakistan might not be affected now, but could be at any moment. They advised the group to act accordingly. “If you assume that your country is going to be added, and I think that’s a majority of all Arab or Muslim nations, then it’s probably best to stay put until we straighten this out and figure out what’s going on,” Ayoub said of people already in the U.S. He said that people should also keep an eye out for a travel ban that prevents entry into the U.S. for people who recently visited one of the seven countries, or potentially others as well. The current order applies solely to nationality, so if a British citizen, for example, took a trip to Syria, he or she would still be able to come to the U.S. Then there were concerns beyond the order itself, such as whether Trump will create a Muslim registry and whether, if he does, people should agree to join it. The speakers said that a registry is likely but that it probably wouldn’t involve U.S. citizens signing up ― more likely, it would be along the lines of President George W. Bush’s National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, or NSEERs, that tracked non-citizens when they entered the country. That doesn’t mean a U.S. citizen would have nothing to fear in a registry ― Beydoun said he thinks surveillance could allow the government to collect a considerable amount of information about American Muslims. Attendees of the meeting asked how they should handle airport screening, already a problem for many that has the potential to now get even worse. The experts advised the group to know their rights, answer questions broadly and make sure a trusted individual or a lawyer knows their flight information, just in case they are detained upon arrival. Travel was a concern for Saira Ahmed, 40, who said she and her husband will wait and see whether they should visit their parents in Pakistan. They are both U.S. citizens, as are their three boys. Pakistan isn’t on the list of countries in Trump’s executive order, but they want to see how things play out before making plans. “Even though we’re citizens, you just don’t know what’s going to happen,” Ahmed said. “Just because you’re a Muslim, are you going to be labeled? Is this our version of the Holocaust that’s about to start; are we about to be branded?”"

Both were born in what is now South Sudan ― Sudan is among the seven countries named in Trump’s order ― and are dual citizens (Maker is Australian, Deng is British). Maker was able to return to the United States from Toronto on Friday night after a game against Lowry’s Raptors, but the NBA still said it was seeking clarity from the State Department on how the order would work.Deng tweeted on Monday that he was a “#ProudRefugee.” “I would not be where I am today if it weren’t for the opportunity to find refuge in a safe harbor,” an accompanying statement said.At least two NBA coaches also spoke out against the ban over the weekend. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called its hasty, confusing implementation “Keystone Kop-like,” while Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr ― whose father was killed in a terrorist act in Beirut in 1984 ― went even further.“I would just say that as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism, having lost my father, if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about and creating fear, it’s the wrong way to go about it,” Kerr said. “If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror, so I’m completely against what’s happening. I think it’s shocking and a horrible idea and I really feel for all the people who are affected and the families that are being torn apart and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world.”"

Starting in April 2017, shoppers will be able to bring their used Patagonia merchandise to local stores and exchange it for credits to buy new items. Patagonia will then clean, repair, and sell the older donated items at discounted prices on their new Worn Wear website. The program is an expansion of Patagonia’s existing Worn Wear program, which was created in 2013 to repair old items so they can be worn longer ― and kept out of landfills. In addition to a Worn Wear warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where Patagonia repairs over 45,000 items per year the company also provides customers with repair kits and resources to do it themselves. The entire practice speaks to the brand’s efforts to get people to keep their clothing for longer periods of time, CEO and president Rose Marcario said in an e-mail. When Worn Wear initially launched, stories about customers and their long-time Patagonia items became a film, inspired clothing repair programs and more.“We want our friends and customers to learn that the single best thing you can do for the planet is to use stuff longer,” Marcario said.

This week, eight years after the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the foundation is featuring a story from Lilly Ledbetter herself. The post, “Lilly Ledbetter Remembers,” was created in collaboration with Story Corps and is part of the Obama Foundation’s “Our Story” timeline. It features Ledbetter speaking about the moment she realized she was making 40 percent less than her male counterparts at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company plant in Alabama.“I was humiliated. I was embarrassed...I just wanted to go and hide,” she says. But instead of hiding, she took her employer to court. Eventually, her case reached the Supreme Court. In May 2007, the Supreme Court did not rule in her favor, saying that she could not take action against Goodyear for pay discrimination due to the 180-day statute of limitations (as per the Civil Rights Act of 1964). But in 2009, after his historic presidential win, then-President Barack Obama acted to fulfill what the Supreme Court did not ― he amended the Civil Rights Act with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act.Obama signed the act on January 29, 2009 ― his first act president. Then, in April of 2014, Obama signed an Executive Order preventing workplace discrimination against employees who openly discuss compensation ― thus protecting women for inquiring about their employer’s pay practices. “So many people have benefitted after that bill passed,” Ledbetter says in the interview. “I’m so grateful and so very proud of it.”Head over to the Obama Foundation to hear her whole story."

Trump has insisted, despite obvious evidence to the contrary, that as many as 1.5 million people attended his inauguration. He has claimed, with no evidence at all, that as many as 5 million people voted illegally in his election – every single one of them for his opponent. He issued a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day that omitted any mention of Jews.And at the close of business marking his first week in office Friday, he signed an executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., without running it past the departments that would implement it. The ensuing disarray brought swift rebuke from several federal judges, blocking parts of the order at least temporarily.“Well, no surprise there, right? It’s disruption and chaos,” said Thomas Mann of the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. “And it’s all centered on Donald Trump and his acolytes in the White House.”On Saturday, Bannon was elevated to the National Security Council and its “Principals Committee” – even as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence were removed as permanent members of that influential committee. They will now be invited to meetings on those occasions when issues on the agenda concern them.Bannon previously ran Breitbart News, the conservative website that aligned itself with Trump starting in late summer 2015. He was among Trump’s top political aides during the final months of the campaign.Neither Republican President George W. Bush nor Democrat Barack Obama had put a political aide on the NSC, to avoid the appearance of mixing politics with national security.Douglas Lute, former ambassador to NATO under Obama and a deputy national security adviser under Bush, said he was puzzled by Trump’s decision to put Bannon on the NSC. “I found it a little peculiar,” he said.How much actual influence Bannon has there, Lute said, will depend on how the paper structure Trump signed Saturday winds up playing out in real life in the coming weeks and months. “We’ll have to see how this works,” he said.White House press secretary Sean Spicer did not respond to a Huffington Post query about Bannon’s role on the NSC. In an interview with ABC News, Spicer said Bannon’s background as a naval officer made him a good fit.That explanation, though, did not impress Brooking’s Mann. He called Bannon someone who is “mainly known for being a former Breitbart head and a white nationalist,” not a national security expert. “It’s breathtaking,” Mann said. “The heads of defense and intelligence are not relevant to national security concerns, but the president’s political strategist is?”During his 18-month campaign, Trump wore his complete lack of government experience as a badge of honor. He bragged that his record as a billionaire who ran 500 separate businesses would help him fix the country’s problems in a way that no “all-talk, no-action” politician could.Yet those boasts, which both high-ranking Republicans as well as many of his supporters at campaign events cited, contained fundamental exaggerations. While Trump tried to convey the impression that he led a gigantic, diversified global enterprise, in reality his “Trump Organization” is far more modest. Many of those hundreds of businesses are actually limited liability companies created for a single specific purpose – owning his personal jetliner, for example, so as to shield the parent enterprise and Trump personally should it be involved in an accident.His financial disclosure documents instead portray more of a family business that primarily collects rents – from those playing golf at his courses, from those staying at his hotels, but most of all from those licensing his name for use on their own buildings.And that family business mindset appears to have carried over into the White House, where Trump has installed his son-in-law as a senior adviser and has come to rely on a small group of aides for nearly everything of consequence.It’s unclear how involved Trump himself has been in the details of his proposals. During the campaign, he boasted of being correct on issues without any need for analyzing them. In an August campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump mentioned how in an interview he was asked about NATO. “And I don’t study it,” he said. “I’m a business guy.”Despite this, he said he gave good responses. “They’ve actually changed NATO because of what I said,” he said.Even Republicans on Capitol Hill have started to express worries about the way Trump and his White House staff have set about their work.“It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted,” said Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham in a joint statement Sunday about Trump’s immigration order.They added that the “hasty process” of drafting and signing the order without review by the relevant agencies will actually give jihadists a propaganda boost. “This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” the statement said. “That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.”Trump, for his part, defended the order in his own statement – and then lashed out at McCain and Graham personally on Twitter. “They are sadly weak on immigration,” he wrote. “The two Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.”Mann said the Republicans’ relatively muted response so far is misplaced, given the radical changes Trump is implementing.“Everyone ought to be screaming to high heaven. This is not a time for anyone to be saying let’s give the president a chance to get his government in place,” he said. “This is how a democracy slips into an autocracy.”"

Regardless of whether or how you worship, where you come from or who you love, everyone’s individual experience is what makes us stronger as a whole,” Parker said in the note. “Those values are being threatened by the recent executive order in the U.S. banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven Muslim-majority countries. This is a policy we don’t support.”Parker’s statement specifically referenced British Olympic champion Mo Farah, who was born in Somalia, which is one of the countries on Trump’s travel ban list. In a Facebook post Farah raised concerns about the president’s executive order. The four-time gold medalist, who is sponsored by Nike, has lived and trained in Oregon for the past six years ― he was in Ethiopia when the order took effect. “President Donald Trump,” Farah wrote, “seems to have made me an alien.”"

This year’s nominees feature actors of color including Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Mahershala Ali, presenting the welcome image of a Hollywood committed to telling more diverse stories than past decades’ predominately white, male ones.But in non-acting categories ― that is, the ones not inherently divided by gender ― the landscape is marked by one defining factor: They’re still mostly men. A study by the Women’s Media Center found that only 20 percent of Academy Award nominations in categories from writing to editing to directing went to women this year. That’s in spite of the Academy inviting nearly 700 new voting members in mid-2016, including many women and people of color.“We have a saying, ‘If you can see it, you can be it,’ but in the crucial behind-the-scenes non-acting roles, our ‘Women’s Media Center Investigation’ shows that what you see is 80 percent of all nominees are men,” Julie Burton, president of the WMC, said in a statement.The organization notes that the number of nominated women is roughly on par with the number of women hired in behind-the-scenes roles in 2016. Women made up 17 percent of those directing, writing, producing, editing and cinematographer positions among the year’s top 250 domestic films in 2016, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film.Acting categories seemed to be more diversified after two consecutive years of #OscarsSoWhite protests against Hollywood’s lack of representation. Three black women were nominated for supporting roles ― a record. Behind the scenes, there was good news for diversity advocates, too. “Moonlight” co-editor Joi McMillan became the first black woman ever nominated for editing, and “Jackie” composer Mica Levy became the first woman to be nominated in 17 years for an original score. But the WMC warns that until more women are hired for those behind-the-camera jobs, parity in nominations will be tough to reach.“[W]ith appreciation to Michelle Obama,” Burton said, “we ask the studio and agency executives who are OK with making a bunch of deals that exclude women to ‘be better.’ The perspectives, experience and voices of more than half the population deserve an equal seat at the table.”Take a look at the gender split in non-acting categories below.

The site is represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which has also worked with Vice, Gizmodo Media Group (formerly Gawker), Salon, Fusion, The Root and ThinkProgress.Though the yearlong contract negotiations appeared to stall last month, with some employees voicing frustration on social media, the two sides recently came to an agreement that generated near unanimous support.For more than 200 employees covered by the union, there will be across-the-board raises of at least 3 percent. However, some staffers could see increases as high as $10,000 to $20,000 over the course of the three-year contract, which puts in place new minimum salaries for newsroom job titles.The contract features new language ensuring editorial independence and enhancing newsroom diversity, along with specific provisions regarding comp time, discipline, dismissal and severance in the event of layoffs. Management has agreed to pay employees two months’ severance, plus an additional week’s pay for each year of service.“When we decided to unionize at HuffPost, we had a lot of concerns we wanted to tackle: editorial autonomy, newsroom diversity, fair and transparent pay, and job security,” The Huffington Post Bargaining Committee said in a statement. “We’re happy to say we’ve achieved a contract that addresses all that and more.”“This agreement is going to improve the lives of many of our peers, and make HuffPost an even better place to do great journalism,” the committee continued. “It shows what a newsroom can accomplish when it decides to come together and bargain collectively. We’re grateful to the company for working with us toward such a strong and fair first contract.”HuffPost CEO Jared Grusd praised staff in a statement on the agreement.“Our editorial and video staff have been instrumental in making The Huffington Post the groundbreaking news platform it is today and they are among our greatest assets,” Grusd said. “We are very pleased to have worked collaboratively with the WGAE to have reached this agreement. We remain committed to providing growth opportunities for all of our talented and dedicated editorial and video staff to ensure The Huffington Post is the leading digital platform for news and information.”Lowell Peterson, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East, said in a statement that “this landmark agreement demonstrates that collective bargaining works.” “Our large and engaged negotiating committee worked tirelessly to communicate the real concerns of WGAE-represented employees, and the company’s bargaining team was respectful and responsive,” Peterson said. “We are building a strong movement of digital journalists in perilous times. The writers, editors and producers at The Huffington Post have achieved real gains by unionizing, and there are now 500 digital journalists covered by WGAE-negotiated contracts.”  "

Its impact has already been felt in the film industry, and there are growing concerns that the order could affect a number of professional athletes too. Thon Maker, a rookie on the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks who was born in South Sudan, was able to re-enter the United States without issue Friday night after the Bucks played the Toronto Raptors in Canada, the team said. Maker is a former refugee whose family fled Sudan when he was five.Maker and Los Angeles Lakers guard Luol Deng, who is also Sudanese, are the two NBA players who could be most directly affected by Trump’s executive order. Though both have dual citizenship status ― Deng is British, Maker is Australian ― the order could still apply. Neither the Bucks nor Lakers are scheduled to travel to Toronto, the NBA’s only market outside the U.S., for the rest of the season, though Milwaukee could still end up facing the Raptors if both make the NBA playoffs this spring. An NBA spokesperson said in a statement Saturday that the league is consulting with the State Department to see how the order might affect its players.“We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries,” NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said in the statement. “The NBA is a global league, and we are proud to attract the very best players from around the world.”A federal court on Saturday temporarily blocked part of Trump’s executive order, forbidding the deportation of refugees given government clearance or immigrants with valid visas. And while professional athletes may have better access to resources for immigration help, that many face uncertainty under Trump’s order is a reminder of how far-ranging its effects may be, especially in leagues where teams travel internationally. No Major League Soccer players were born in the seven countries listed in Trump’s order, but two have ties. Steven Beitashour of Toronto FC is an Iranian-American dual citizen who has played for Iran’s national team. Columbus Crew’s Justin Meram, similarly, was born in the U.S. but has played for the Iraqi national team. It’s unclear how the order might affect either player. An MLS spokesperson declined to comment on the issue Sunday.Michael Bradley, the captain of the U.S. Men’s National Team and Beitashour’s teammate in Toronto, said in an Instagram post Sunday that he is “sad and embarrassed” by Trump’s refugee ban.One athlete has already felt the effects of Trump’s order. “President Donald Trump,” British Olympic champion Mo Farah said in a Facebook post Sunday, “seems to have made me an alien.”Farah, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, is a British citizen who was originally born in Somalia, one of the seven countries listed in the ban. He lives and trains in the United States, but was training abroad in Ethiopia when the order took effect Friday night. His wife and children live in Portland, Oregon.“I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years ― working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home,” Farah said on Facebook. “Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It’s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home ― to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.”Former NBA player Nazr Mohammed, who was born in Chicago to Ghanaian parents, criticized the ban Saturday afternoon. (Ghana is not among the seven countries named in the order, but Mohammed is a practicing Muslim.)The ban has also drawn criticism from international sporting officials. Richard Peterkin, a member of the International Olympic Committee’s executive board, tweeted Saturday that “Trump’s Executive Order on immigration is totally contrary to Olympic ideals.” The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics included, for the first time, a team composed of refugees from around the world who competed under the Olympic banner. The 10-member team included two athletes from Syria and five from South Sudan."
35,POLITICS,Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein Actually Speaks Out Against Immigration Ban,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lloyd-blankfein-muslim-ban_us_588f6ce5e4b01763779592c2,Perhaps he should call his former colleagues in the Trump administration.,2017-01-30,"Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Donald Trump's ban on certain immigrants is ""not a policy we support.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588f6d321b0000260004d309.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a voicemail sent to his employees on Sunday night, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein criticized Donald Trump’s executive order suspending refugee resettlement and barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries from the United States. “This is not a policy we support,” Blankfein said. “I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily.” Blankfein supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the election.Trump’s executive order, issued Friday night, sparked nationwide protests and condemnation from Democrats in Congress, attorneys general around the country and a handful of Republican senators. At least three judges have blocked aspects of it. Blankfein’s comments seem to have opened the door for other banks to denounce Trump’s order. On Monday afternoon, Citigroup chief executive Michael Corbat sent a memo to employees about the ban. “We are concerned about the message the executive order sends,” he wrote.JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, have said nothing about the ban, beyond sending an email to employees with some vague language about diversity:“We understand that our country, economy and wellbeing are strengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us, where we are dedicated to serving customers and communities in more than 100 countries every day,” reads the last line of the email, sent jointly by Dimon and nine other members of the bank’s operating committee.Morgan Stanley sent out a similar memo Sunday night. That’s what amounts to fiery condemnation from Wall Street during the Trump administration. Wall Street’s reticence on the immigration ban is notable. It’s hard to believe anyone operating a global business that relies on hiring top talent from around the world would support the draconian immigration measures Trump has unleashed.Yet while high-profile CEOs and companies in the tech sector have started to speak up ― including CEOs of nearly all the major Silicon Valley firms ― non-tech companies have mostly been silent. Over the weekend, The Huffington Post reached out to the almost 20 business leaders on the president’s advisory board and their companies; only two have offered public comments. Several told HuffPost they weren’t commenting; some said off the record that the issue was too controversial to wade into. So much for the corporate activism and social responsibility these guys like to promote in press releases.There have been a couple of notable exceptions on the Fortune 500: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz not only came out against the ban, but also said on Sunday that the coffee company would hire 10,000 refugees. Nike CEO Mark Parker also released a letter condemning the order: “Nike stands together against bigotry and any form of discrimination,” he wrote.On Monday, Ford Chairman Bill Ford and CEO Mark Fields both said they oppose the ban.Many other companies are scrambling to make sure their employees aren’t caught up in the new rules and trying to counsel and assist those who are.In his voicemail, Blankfein said the firm will work with affected employees and their families to “minimize disruptions”:“This is Lloyd. The president has issued an executive order that, generally, bans individuals from seven different countries from entering the United States and freezes the broader refugee program. This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily. Perhaps Blankfein should’ve left his message with the six Goldman Sachs alumni who have top jobs in the Trump administration. At least one of them ― Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci ― apparently didn’t think the immigration ban would actually happen, as Bloomberg View’s Matt Levine pointed out on Monday. “I’ll make a prediction right now that he will not put a ban on Muslims coming into America,” Scaramucci, a Goldman alumnus who was selling shares in hedge funds before he moved to the Trump administration, told Gawker before the election.Scaramucci recently found himself courted by the world’s most elite executives and politicians at their annual schmooze-fest in Davos, Switzerland.Other ex-Goldmanites in Trumpland include Blankfein’s former No. 2, Gary Cohn, treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon and adviser Dina Powell, who worked on impact investing for Goldman. Jay Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer who has represented Goldman, was chosen to head up the Securities and Exchange Commission.This story has been updated to reflect that Citigroup and Morgan Stanley have also written memos about Trump’s executive order.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), the only Republican representing a district in New York City, said Sunday he supports President Donald Trump’s executive order banning Syrian refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. “We are and should continue to be a compassionate nation, but we must balance our compassion with security interests,” he said in a statement on his Facebook page. “The FBI director said to the Homeland Security Committee, on which I sit, that we cannot properly vet people from war-torn countries, and we know ISIS will use refugee flows to infiltrate the West. President Trump’s decision is in America’s best interest, and I support exploring safe zones in the region to protect innocent life.”Donovan’s post drew more than 180 comments, many from people expressing disappointment in his statement.Donovan represents all of Staten Island and some of southern Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge ― a neighborhood home to one of New York City’s largest Syrian immigrant communities. He’s represented the district since 2015, when he was elected to replace Rep. Michael Grimm (R) after Grimm pleaded guilty to tax fraud. Donovan was previously a district attorney who gained some notoriety in 2014 for failing to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner.In late 2015, Donovan voted to pause the Obama administration’s plan to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S. “This vote is about keeping our city and country safe from radical Islamic terror, a threat New Yorkers know all too well,” he said at the time.According to The Washington Post’s count, more than 50 congressional Republicans have said they support Trump’s executive order, which also temporarily bars all refugees. At least 20 Republicans, including Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) have come out in opposition.“This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” McCain and Graham said in a statement on Sunday. “That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.”Following massive protests at airports around the country over the weekend, House Democrats planned to introduce a bill Monday that would block funding to enforce Trump’s order. Democrats in the Senate have also vowed to fight the order."

The government used a similar tactic in 1942, when President Franklin D.

HuffPost: What are your reactions to Trump’s executive order this weekend? What would your father think?Karen: Seventy-five years ago, during World War II, Franklin Roosevelt used the Office of the President to issue Executive Order 9066, which authorized the forced removal and mass incarceration of all Japanese Americans on the West Coast. Specifically, the Executive Order gave the authority to the Secretary of War and any military commander designated by him “to prescribe military areas ... from which any or all persons may be excluded.” Note, and analogous to today, the Executive Order does not mention Japanese Americans by name.While I, and so many other Americans, celebrate my father’s birthday today, I am reminded of the power of Executive Orders considering the news.

It is important that we stand on the right side of history and not repeat the dangers of the past.HuffPost: What lessons from your father’s experience should we keep in mind during Trump’s presidency?Karen: In Korematsu v. United States, the government argued that President Roosevelt’s Executive Order and the incarceration of the Japanese Americans was based on military necessity. In his dissent on Korematsu, Justice [Robert] Jackson stated, “[t]he principle then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.” Forty years later, documents were discovered that there was no military necessity; Japanese Americans had not committed acts of treason to justify mass incarceration; and our government misrepresented the facts before the U.S. Supreme Court and to the American people.The lesson learned is that the government wields incredible power and our leaders must use it responsibly.

39,POLITICS,Wells Fargo Sued For Barring DACA Recipients From Student Loans,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wells-fargo-sued-for-barring-daca-recipient-from-student-loans_us_588f9ca2e4b02772c4e850d4,The lawsuit could affect many others rejected over their citizenship status.,2017-01-30,"A Wells Fargo branch is seen in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588f9fcb17000030001d1366.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After Mitzie Perez filled out a preliminary form online to inquire about a student loan from Wells Fargo last summer, a message flashed across the screen saying the bank had no options for her. “This could be due to the school you selected, your field of study, and/or your citizenship status,” the bank’s website said. The third-year bachelor’s student in gender and sexuality studies at the University of California, Riverside, didn’t think her citizenship status would be a problem. Though she’s undocumented, in 2012 she received work authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That program shields undocumented immigrants who arrived as youths from deportation and allows them to work legally. Curious, Perez hit the back button on her browser and changed her answer on one of the preliminary questions to say she was a permanent resident. After she resubmit her application, Wells Fargo allegedly offered her a loan option she could apply for. “I didn’t expect it,” Perez told The Huffington Post. “I’ve been approved for credit cards. It was weird to me that a loan wouldn’t be approved, but creditors would provide me that support.”A class action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Northern California says rejecting her application based on immigration status violates both federal and state law. The lawsuit could have sweeping implications if successful. It asks the court to create a class of people affected by the Wells Fargo policy that would include not only people like Perez, with DACA, but also any financially qualified person who applied for a loan and was denied for lack of U.S. citizenship since 2013.The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund brought the lawsuit on behalf of Perez and the California chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, whose membership includes DACA recipients affected by the bank’s loan policies.“We don’t think Wells Fargo was unique, but it was the case that came to us first,” MALDEF President Thomas Saenz told HuffPost. “Our hope is that if we can resolve the issue with Wells Fargo, perhaps the other banks seeing what we’re doing will change their policy.”Wells Fargo spokesman Jason Vasquez pointed out that the bank only accounts for roughly 1 percent of total student loans and that its policies are in line with the U.S. Department of Education, which also does not loan to DACA recipients. The bank offers two products for which DACA recipients qualify ― a credit card and secured personal loan.“While we respect the important role that the California League of United Latino Citizens and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund play in support of the community, we are disappointed they filed a lawsuit rather than work with us on solutions to help people realize their goals of higher education,” Vasquez wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Wells Fargo understands the dream of pursuing higher education and we remain focused on our responsible lending practices to assist temporary and permanent residents and U.S. citizens in obtaining student financing.” When assessing whether to offer a loan, a financial institution is only supposed to establish the applicant’s true identity and the risk the applicant will default, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit contends that using an applicant’s immigration status as a factor when considering whether to extend a loan violates the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1866, which allows anyone in the country to enter into contracts. “It’s discriminatory,” Saenz said. “The bottom line is that banks are supposed to make loans based on the assessment of risk. ... A person’s immigration status is simply not relevant.” The lawsuit alleges the Wells Fargo policy also violates a California state law protecting against discrimination and another that prohibits unfair business practices. Barring Perez from applying for a private loan added one more financial hurdle to her path toward a college degree. The DACA program provides some protection from deportation and allows her to work legally, but she’s still not allowed to apply for federal student aid ― the largest pool of financial assistance that people use to pay for a college education.Already indebted, she charged her tuition on credit cards and works a schedule that includes two full days from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in class and the rest of the week working as a community organizer. She also works on weekends ― not just to service her debt, but to help support her family. “I’m trying to be a good student,” Perez said. “I’m trying to give back to my community and be involved.” The lawsuit seeks damages on her behalf and for the bank to end its policies of weighing immigration status as part of its loan applications. If the class were granted, it could affect many more people in similar situations. “We deserve a chance to get a student loan,” Perez said. “We want to be a part of this economy. We want to do well in school. But sometimes we’re not getting the support we need.”"

The organization, which launched on Jan. 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration, was already surging with interest before Trump signed an executive order Friday that bans Syrians from taking refuge in the United States, halts the U.S. refugee resettlement program for four months and temporarily blocks people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. at all.The president’s action, which comes amid a wave of nationwide protests against him, sparked chaos at U.S. airports over the weekend as refugees and immigrants arrived only to be detained or told they couldn’t enter the country. Thousands of protesters showed up at airports to speak out against the Muslim ban and demand that arriving immigrants be let through.Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, said Trump is doing a great job of driving furious Democrats into public service.“Anyone leading a protest or organizing friends to get to a local airport should think about running for office,” Litman said. “Trump’s presidency is already inspiring an incredible wave of energy and re-engagement in civic life ― running and winning is how we capture that and make it last.”A number of progressive grass-roots groups have cropped up since Trump’s win in November, and they, too, have seen huge interest. Swing Left, which links volunteers with progressive House candidates in nearby swing districts, has drawn more than 220,000 people since it launched two weeks ago. Daily Action, which launched in mid-December and makes progressive activism as easy as a daily text, already sends 75,000 texts per day and has more than 40,000 Facebook members.The organizers of the massive Women’s March on Washington started a campaign, too: 10 actions for the first 100 days, which calls on its broad base of supporters to take action on a specific issue every 10 days.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Sheldon Whitehouse's (D-R.I.) spaghetti dinner to speak out against his vote for President Donald Trump's CIA nominee. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588e9f7417000025002d922f.png?ops=crop_3_53_741_505%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Last week, as hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied against the inauguration of Donald Trump, many of the top contenders to lead the Democratic Party were nowhere in sight. Instead, six of the seven candidates for chair of the Democratic National Committee were attending a retreat of top party donors in Florida. The lone exception was South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who joined the women’s march in his hometown in Indiana. A week later, and with another wave of protests erupting, those DNC officials made sure to place themselves squarely on the vanguard. Two top contenders for the post ―Buttigieg and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez ― both rushed to the airport in Houston to join the masses demonstrating against Trump’s executive order outlawing refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The next day, Perez was at the airport in San Francisco, protesting once more, and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn) ― as the first Muslim-American to serve in Congress ― was on CBS’s “Face the Nation” attacking Trump and joining protesters at the airport in Minneapolis.Nine days into his presidency, Trump has unleashed a wave of angst and opposition far greater than anticipated. But as the evolving travel schedules of the prospective party chairs illustrate, Democratic officials are still sprinting madly to catch up. “These are not the standard activists. This is finally the awakening of what I’d call the first global generation. These are people whose principles Trump’s victory has thrown out the window. They feel left behind by their own country and finally they are going to do something about it,” said Howard Dean, the former DNC chair who has been privately encouraging Senate leadership to more forcefully oppose Trump. “And if Democrats don’t take the leadership of this, they won’t have the opportunity to do so later on.” There is little dispute that the backlash against Trump has engendered a tremendous opportunity for the Democratic Party. But from the onset, there’s been confusion and disagreement over what the best posture should be. Elected officials settled on a hybrid approach: firm opposition to much of Trump’s agenda, with a notable willingness to compromise on select issues like infrastructure. For the base, such nuance glossed over the unique moral threat that Trump represented. Resist isn’t a hashtag for them; it is the cause. So when the DNC candidates showed up at the Florida fundraiser instead of marching in D.C., they faced blowback for misguided priorities. And when Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) ― two progressive stalwarts ― voted to move forward with Dr. Ben Carson’s nomination for secretary of housing and urban development, they were charged with helping legitimize Trump. When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) held a spaghetti dinner this past weekend in Providence, approximately 1,000 people showed up to urge him to oppose Trump’s policies and his cabinet nominees. (Whitehouse had voted to confirm Trump’s CIA director, Mike Pompeo.)  The progressive group Democracy for America, which endorsed both Warren and Brown for reelection before the Women’s March, got complaints from its members who were disappointed over the Carson vote. “That certainly serves as a warning shot to anybody who’s up for reelection in 2018. The Democratic base is watching, and they do not want to see Democrats aiding and abetting or appeasing or voting for any of Trump’s nominees. They want to see them actually stand up and be strong. If they do that, they’re going to be rewarded. If they don’t, then they’re not. And it’s really that straightforward,” said DFA Executive Director Charles Chamberlain. And as the second wave of protests erupted over the weekend, activists began more forcefully airing their frustrations that elected officials weren’t doing enough.“Honestly, as someone who’s worked for elected officials before, I don’t have a lot of hope for Democrats,” said Arona Kessler of Fairfax, Virginia, who protested outside the White House on Sunday. “His nominees are getting confirmed with Democratic support, so that’s all you need to know.”“We need leadership,” said John Garrity, of Washington, D.C, who also attended the march. “We need somebody to step up and really try and leverage the momentum that we’re seeing over the last couple of days. It’s incumbent for someone to step up and build off of what we’re seeing. Right now we’re sort of rudderless from the Democratic Party perspective.” Matching the concerns of the protestors is a difficult task for a Democratic Party with no tools of political power, save the Senate filibuster that will force 60 votes for Trump’s legislative agenda. And while they were despondent over the likelihood of Trump’s Cabinet being confirmed, most protesters on Sunday said they recognized that there were few, if any, leverage points to stop those nominees. But progressive groups that provide resources, donations and manpower to Democratic candidates all told The Huffington Post Sunday that their members now want uniform opposition to the nominees. MoveOn.org said it expects Democrats to do everything in their power to slow the nomination process and, by extension, much of the business in the Senate. “After the last 72 hours, they expect Democrats to vote against every single nominee and resist and obstruct every single one of his legislative initiatives,” said Murshed Zaheed, vice president and political director of CREDO Action. Added Progressive Change Campaign Committee Co-Founder Stephanie Taylor: “Voting for Trump’s nominees at this point normalizes his hate-filled actions like the Muslim ban.”For lawmakers more accustomed to the slow pace of governance, where opposition comes in the form of roll calls and procedural gamesmanship, it’s been an adjustment. But already, a more aggressive posture is apparent. On Sunday afternoon, congressional Democratic leadership announced that they’d meet at the steps of the Supreme Court Monday to demand that Trump withdraw his executive order. Other Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, said they’d introduce legislation to rescind the ban, in addition to exploring filing an amicus brief in support of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has fought the executive order in the courts.Lawmakers were conspicuous on Saturday and Sunday at the protests around the country, with even freshmen like Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) taking a prominent role, breaking with the tradition of new senators keeping low profiles. Other Democratic lawmakers directly confronted Customs and Border Protection officials to get access to detainees. Others who didn’t show up may feel the consequences. Zaheed, who was at the San Francisco airport, said protesters confronted Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) when he arrived, asking why other California elected officials weren’t there with him. Senate Democrats will soon face a key test, when Trump nominates his choice to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Unless they change the filibuster rules, Republicans will need some Democratic votes to approve Trump’s pick. Progressives hope to turn the battle into a litmus test on Trump’s orders and to keep the party uniformly opposed. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said he will oppose any Trump pick that is out of the “mainstream,” but for many in the base ― and even more establishment types ― more may be needed, and soon. “If the Democratic officeholders don’t start [showing fight] soon, then they are going to become irrelevant,” predicted Dean.Travis Waldron contributed reporting.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Arona Kessler was part of the march to the Capitol.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said he will oppose any Trump pick that is out of the “mainstream,” but for many in the base ― and even more establishment types ― more may be needed, and soon. “If the Democratic officeholders don’t start [showing fight] soon, then they are going to become irrelevant,” predicted Dean.Travis Waldron contributed reporting.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Arona Kessler was part of the march to the Capitol.

43,QUEER VOICES,Sen. Baldwin Explains Why She Won't Vote To Confirm Sessions For Attorney General,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tammy-baldwin-jeff-sessions_us_588f3c41e4b08a14f7e6f3f0,"""It gives me great concern,"" Baldwin said of the nominee's LGBTQ record.",2017-01-30,"""If he indeed is confirmed... it is up to all of us to do our best to keep him accountable.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588f6b9217000030001d11fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), the only openly lesbian or gay U.S. senator, is voting “no” on three upcoming confirmation votes for anti-LGBTQ Donald Trump cabinet nominees.They include Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos, whose family has given millions of dollars to anti-LGBTQ groups; health and human services secretary nominee Tom Price, a Georgia GOP congressman who has consistently scored a”zero” from the Human Rights Campaign on its annual scorecard; and attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), whom Baldwin spoke out against in an interview with me last week SiriusXM Progress.“[There have been] a rampant number of instances of discrimination and hate crimes experienced by the LGBT community — and given Sen. Sessions record, both prior to his time in the senate and as a senator, opposing the expansion of hate crimes law, it gives me great concern,” she said. “It’s at a time when I believe we actually need to increase resources and focus on that part of the department of justice.”You can listen to the full interview here:Baldwin is also concerned about how Sessions might investigate and prosecute hate crimes such as the massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last June, which left 49 people dead, most of them queer Latinx.“The aftermath of the massacre at the Pulse nightclub that targeted LGBT Americans, Latinos was a hate crime where we saw at that moment, that tragic, tragic moment, we saw people unwilling to speak of it as a hate crime, and to acknowledge that it was a crime that was perpetrated against the LGBT community, the Latino community,” she said. “It just says to me: we need to be increasing resources for prevention of hate crimes and enforcement of our hate crimes laws.”Though she is voting against Sessions, Baldwin said, “if he indeed is confirmed by the Senate ― and it is certainly a probability that he will be ― it is up to all of us to do our best to keep him accountable.”Sessions, whose confirmation vote was delayed by Senate Democrats but is now scheduled for Tuesday, has been opposed to just about every pro-LGBTQ measure during his tenure in the Senate, from the “don’t ask, don’t tell” repeal to job protections for LGBTQ people.During his confirmation hearing, Sessions deflected from his own record and avoided speaking about LGBTQ equality by saying he would, as attorney general, “ensure that anti-discrimination ‘statutes’ for ‘the LGBT community’ are ‘fully enforced’” ― though there are no federal statutes that protect LGBTQ people against discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations.Follow Michelangelo Signorile on Twitter: www.twitter.com/msignorile"

We’re ‘Black-ish.’ We’re ‘Fresh Off the Boat.’ We’re ‘Jane the Virgin.’ We’re ‘Stranger Things.’ We’re a hodgepodge of races and sexes and sexualities.”To highlight one example of elevating the black narrative, Davis thanked “Fences” writer-playwright, August Wilson during her acceptance speech for inserting a man of color into the center of his 1983 play.“Sometimes we don’t have to shake the world and move the world and create anything that is going to be in the history book,” she said. “The fact that we breathe and live a life and was a god to our children. Just that means that we have a story and it deserves to be told.”"

About 10,000 demonstrators were present, some carrying signs reading, “Refugees welcome here,” and “No hate, no fear.”Friends, families and individuals of all ages and backgrounds chanted “Let them in!” and “Si se puede!” Speakers fired up the massive crowd with messages of unity and hope, before thousands marched down Greenwich Street toward the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services building.The crowd was dotted with colorful signs and pink pussyhats, the signature headwear many sported during last week’s Women’s March. Demonstrators also carried American flags, highlighting their message that the United States has a long history of immigration. During a news conference earlier on Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) promised protesters he would “fight with every fiber of my being” to overturn the executive order. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) called Trump’s executive order a mark of shame for the country. “It goes against everything that we, as New Yorkers, stand for,” she said.Yunis Esa, a Yemeni-born warehouse manager who lives in Brooklyn, told The Huffington Post that the political events were personal for him. “I’m from Yemen.

As Muslim Americans, we were born and raised here, we find it ridiculous what’s happening.” As demonstrators forced downtown D.C. to a standstill for the second time this week, Trump settled in for a movie with his family at the White House ― “Finding Dory.”Hundreds gathered at the Detroit Metro Airport to protest Sunday afternoon, including U.S. Reps. Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell, both Michigan Democrats. Video footage taken at the airport shows hundreds of people holding signs and chanting behind barricades.“We have to make our voices heard,” Dingell said. “So we fight for why we are so proud to be American.” Afaf Elhady, 27, came to the Detroit protest from Toledo, Ohio, with a group of about 30 people, including her son Terak, age 10 months.Elhady was born in Yemen but came to the U.S. at age 6 and is a naturalized citizen. She’s now worried about her grandmother, who is in Yemen alone ― the family was in the process of helping her renew her green card. Elhady was planning to go to Jordan next week but canceled the trip, saying she didn’t want to risk it even though Trump’s current executive order wouldn’t apply to her as a citizen.“I don’t know what I would do if I couldn’t get back here. This is my only home.”“Mainly I came here as an American, before as a Muslim,” she said of the protest. “This is not what my country stands for.” Aerial footage of Boston’s Copley Square shared on social media Sunday afternoon showed a large turnout for a #NoBanNoWall protest organized by CAIR Massachusetts. Police estimated the crowd to number at 10,000. Speakers at the rally included Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Philadelphia’s airport tweeted that the police’s airport unit was directing demonstrators to the baggage claim area after the arrivals hall had hit capacity.Hundreds of people gathered at the Federal Building in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the State House in Rhode Island, protesters chanted, “Equal rights for one and all, no ban, no wall!”Sunday’s protests came at the end of a tumultuous weekend in some of the nation’s airports and courts.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order to bar all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days, keep out Syrian refugees indefinitely, and restrict travel for individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.As the order went into effect, travelers from those seven countries, including people holding U.S. government-issued visas or green cards, became trapped at U.S. airports on Saturday. More than 100 people were denied entry to the U.S. upon arrival, The New York Times reported. More than 170 were stopped before boarding planes. Thousands of demonstrators descended on the airports, vowing to stay put until all detainees were released. Late Saturday night, a federal judge in Brooklyn temporarily halted parts of the executive order in response to action filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, immigrants’ rights groups and refugee relief organizations on behalf of two Iraqi nationals who were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Federal judges in Virginia, Massachusetts and Washington state also issued orders temporarily barring the deportation of travelers stranded in their jurisdictions.In a statement released early Sunday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said that it would comply with the court orders, while emphasizing that it would continue to enforce the national security priorities under Trump’s executive directive. For much of Sunday, confusion persisted over whether green card holders would be affected by the ban going forward. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning that the order would not affect green card holders “moving forward” or “going forward.” Secretary John Kelly finally affirmed on Sunday evening that the ban would not apply to permanent residents.“In applying the provisions of the president’s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest,” Kelly said in a statement. “Accordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”Laura Bassett reported from Washington, D.C.

I’m serving notice to the armed forces of the United States. Do not do it, I will not allow it,” Duterte told a televised news conference.“Provisions of the Visiting Forces (Agreement), there shall be no permanent facilities. A depot is by any other name a depot. It’s a permanent structure to house arms.”He added: “I do not even know if there is a nuclear tip (missile) now, that they are unloading.”His comments come after the Pentagon gave the green light to build warehouses, barracks and runways this year under a 2014 Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the two longtime allies.If U.S. arsenals were built in the Philippines, Duterte said he would consider a review of treaties “and maybe ultimately abrogate, since it is an executive order.”EDCA allows the expansion of rotational deployment of U.S. ships, aircraft and troops at five bases in the Philippines as well as the storage of equipment for humanitarian and maritime security operations.Duterte has repeatedly threatened to tear up security deals with the United States, while also giving guarantees those would be honored, muddying the picture in a relationship that prior to his election was one of Washington’s most crucial Asian alliances.He also chided the United States for pressuring the Philippines to enforce a ruling last year by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that invalidated most of Beijing’s claims to the South China Sea.Duterte has done the opposite and has sought to create warm ties and secure investment from China rather than confront it. In a stunning about-face in Manila’s foreign policy, he has put the arbitration award on the back burner.He said Washington was putting regional stability at risk and its actions could put the Philippines in “extreme danger” because of the posturing between the United States and China.“You are egging us ... egging us (on) to force the issue of arbitral judgment,” he said, referring to the United States.“The missiles of China are pointed at the American expeditions,” he said, referring to its naval patrols. “A depot would serve as a supply line.”Duterte said he had an “urgent” message to China, asking it to help provide precision-guided missiles so Philippine troops could fight Islamic State-linked militants in the south.He said the court ruling on the South China Sea would be discussed with China when the time was right.“I made a commitment to President Xi Jinping, I made a solemn commitment that we will talk about this arbitral award during my term. When, I really do not know, but we will talk hard,” he said.(Additional reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Stephen Powell)"

All the tourists were tied together and were carried away by the currents,” he said.Ahmad Puzi said authorities were investigating the sinking of the catamaran and whether it should have been used as a tourist vessel.“The weather conditions were quite bad with very high waves, which raises the question as to whether the boat should have gone out to sea,” said Malaysia’s national security minister Shahidan Kassim, who was present at the news conference.Shahidan said authorities would deploy search assets that can operate at night, in order to locate those who were still missing.The Malaysian navy, maritime police and air force were involved in the search, which covered 400 nautical miles.The search had been hampered by strong winds and choppy waters, officials said.“Time is critical considering the bad weather,” Malaysian navy chief Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin told Reuters when contacted.Chinese President Xi Jinping called on his country’s government departments to step up cooperation with their Malaysian counterparts on rescue efforts, official state news agency Xinhua reported.The China National Tourism Administration said it has initiated emergency response procedures.(Editing by Stephen Coates and Raissa Kasolowsky)"

Speaking about Trump, she joked “opposites attract” and praised the countries’ “special relationship.”She announced Britain would move away from “failed policies of the past” including intervention in foreign affairs, which for many struck a familiar chord to Trump’s “America First” movement. May also expressed her support for many of Trump’s decisions, but condemned the use of torture and said she would stick to U.K. policy on that issue.On Saturday, the Trump administration’s new executive orders halting entrance to the U.S. by Syrian refugees and restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority nations began to spread fear and anxiety around the globe. Leaders from Germany, Turkey, France, Luxembourg, Canada and several other countries were quick to speak out and defend their values.“The American president is dividing the Muslim world into good and evil with this,” Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told Der Tagesspiegel, a German newspaper. “The decision is also bad for Europe because it will increase the Muslim world’s mistrust and hatred of the West.”May’s response was vague, to say the least.“The United States is responsible for the United States’ policy on refugees,” she said when asked for comment. Angry backlash ensued, and she later issued a statement saying she disagrees with the ban.Non-American citizens (including Brits) who have dual nationality with Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen are among those temporarily barred from entering the U.S.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said May’s reluctance to denounce such xenophobia was a “weak failure.”“President Trump’s executive order against refugees and Muslims should shock and appall us all,” he said. “Theresa May should have stood up for Britain and our values by condemning his actions. It should sadden our country that she chose not to.”May was elected after Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down upon defeat in a controversial “Brexit” referendum. May, who opposed Brexit but has maintained a tough stance on immigration, is now tasked with leading the British departure from the European Union.“I think Brexit is going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” Trump told her during a meeting at the White House on Friday. “You’re going to have your own identity and you’re going to be able to make your own trade deals without having someone watching you.”Brits have expressed disappointment in their prime minister by using the hashtag #TheresaTheAppeaser on Twitter."

I hope to see you next year but if not, then it was a wonderful year here and I couldn’t be happier tonight.”Nadal, the 2009 champion, was also typically gracious after losing his third Melbourne final and coming up short in his bid for a 15th grand slam title.“It was a great match and I think Roger probably deserved it a little more than me,” the 30-year-old said.“I played a great quality of tennis. That’s great news for me. I believe that if I have my body in the right condition, I can have a great year.”FIRST BREAKTHROUGHFederer made the slower start to the contest but it was the Swiss who made the first breakthrough, converting the first break point of the match with a forehand winner to go 5-4 up.That was enough to take the opening set but this was never going to be a straightforward win for either player and Nadal was all over his opponent’s serve at the start of the second and grabbed a 2-0 lead.Federer had two break points in the next game but Nadal fought them off and then broke again as his rival struggled for accuracy under the Spaniard’s onslaught.Four big forehands gave the Swiss a break back but Nadal held firm to serve out the set and Federer needed three aces to save three break points at the start of the third.The momentum had swung, though, and Federer stepped up a gear and rattled off the next two games with Nadal left scrambling to fend off a second break in a marathon fourth game.He was unable to repeat the feat in the sixth game and Federer, his crosscourt backhand causing Nadal all sorts of problems, secured a two sets to one lead with a drop volley.The pendulum had not finished swinging yet, however, and Nadal broke for 3-1 in the fourth and held under huge pressure in the next game with a brilliant crosscourt forehand winner at full stretch.Nadal again closed out the set and Federer took a medical timeout before the start of the decider, returning to court only to give up his first service game.Federer was not prepared to give up easily on a first grand slam title since Wimbledon in 2012, though, and upped his aggression to put the set back on serve at 3-3 when Nadal sent a rasping forehand wide.He needed another five break points on Nadal’s next service game before the Spaniard finally cracked as Federer sealed the title with a forehand winner that Hawk-Eye confirmed hit the line.“In the fifth set, I didn’t win one serve easily. Even if I played great in the break points, I was suffering a lot,” said Nadal.“He probably remained a little bit more free on points on my serve. That’s what I needed in that moment, and I didn’t have.”With Federer’s contemporary Serena Williams having won the women’s title for the seventh time on Saturday, the 2017 Australian Open is destined be remembered as the retro slam.Federer gave a reminder that no one is immune to the ravages of time, however.“Now it’s time to celebrate in a massive way,” he said. “(But) at 35 years old, I don’t like to say it, but I’m so old and so the body hurts, it aches.”(Reporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Toby Davis)"

The order, signed on Friday, aimed to block Syrian refugees from entering the country and temporarily ban travelers coming from several Muslim-majority countries. (Parts of the order have been temporarily halted after the American Civil Liberties Union filed action in federal court.)“Los Angeles is the home of so many immigrants, so many creative people, so many dreamers,” Legend said. “Our America is big, it is free, and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions. Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump. I want to specifically tonight reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.”“My wife and I were a little bit conflicted about being here tonight when we know what’s happening in the streets, we know what’s happening at LAX and the airports around the country,” Legend said, referring to the protests that erupted at Los Angeles International Airport and other American airports. Legend also noted he and wife Chrissy Teigen “wanted to put our money where our mouth is” and donated to the ACLU and other organizations “who are committed to fighting for freedom in the land of the free.”“Let’s all continue to stand up together for what is right,” he added. Legend has been extremely vocal about his opposition to Trump. When the former “Apprentice” host was elected in November, the “All of Me” singer took to Instagram to express his feelings. “I wanted us to choose unity and inclusion over building walls and singling out ethnic and religious groups for hate and suspicion,” the musician wrote. “I wanted us to choose progress over yearning for some long-lost mythical era when America was supposedly greatest. I wanted us to destroy the highest glass ceiling instead of electing an admitted sexual assaulter. But we did not.” Of course, the 38-year-old singer isn’t alone in his thinking. Plenty of other stars, including Michael Moore, Miley Cyrus, Alyssa Milano, Kerry Washington and Debra Messing, also spoke out this weekend about the president’s order to block Syrian refugees from entering the country.

After gathering near the White House, a portion of the crowd broke into an impromptu march, heading east toward the Capitol. Hundreds of protesters streamed past empty bleachers still standing from Trump’s inauguration parade earlier this month and stopped at the Trump International Hotel, where demonstrators led cheers.“No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here,” chanted a crowd from the steps of the hotel.Trump’s executive order barred all refugees from entering the country for 120 days and suspended the Syrian refugee program indefinitely. The measure also halted the entry of nationals from seven majority-Muslim countries into the U.S. for the next 90 days, restrictions that have led critics to claim the policy is intended to discriminate against Muslims specifically.“We wanted to represent and stand up for what’s right,” said Manar al-Badarneh, a Palestinian-American college student who traveled with her family from Columbia, Maryland, to join the Washington demonstration. “We believe this is wrong. As Muslim Americans, we were born and raised here, we find it ridiculous what’s happening.” Many in the crowd continued down Pennsylvania Avenue, passing the Newseum on their way to the Capitol.Trump’s order has sparked mass confusion, as U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents detained a number of green card holders at airports, with many unable to speak to lawyers. Demonstrators and lawyers have been camped out at international airports around the country, offering resources and support to incoming passengers who they fear may be turned away.Federal judges issued rulings late Saturday that stopped parts of Trump’s executive order from taking effect and clarified the right of legal U.S. residents to counsel ― though some are still reportedly being denied access to attorneys. This was little consolation to the protesters who came out in force on Sunday, in opposition to what critics have branded Trump’s “Muslim ban.”Alan Henderson, 42, from New York City, said he came to Washington last weekend with his Iranian wife to join the Women’s March on Washington, and he was surprised to have to return to D.C. for a second protest. He said he’s concerned that Trump’s immigration ban would keep his wife from being able to visit her relatives in Iran. Henderson didn’t know whether protesting was going to accomplish anything, but he hopes it “puts the heat” on Republicans in Congress to oppose Trump’s actions.“We should all be embarrassed by this,” he said. “Jesus would be embarrassed by it. It’s the opposite of what America and Christianity are supposed to be about.”Other protesters wondered aloud if Trump could hear their chants from inside the White House. Their voices were likely competing with the sounds of the Disney Pixar film “Finding Dory,” which Trump spent his Sunday watching.Laura Bassett contributed reporting."

It’s critical that “little girls and little boys see someone that looks like them, talks like them, has the same culture as them, has crazy, curly hair and wears a natural, has brown skin, included in different things in this world,” Fenlator-Victorian said, fighting tears. “When you grow up and you don’t see that, you feel that you can’t do it. And that is not right.”Fenlator-Victorian, a native of New Jersey, finished 11th for the United States with Lolo Jones at the Sochi Olympics in 2014. She switched her team affiliation to Jamaica, the country of her father, Cosman, for the 2018 Olympics in an effort to boost representation in the event there. Jamaica, which sent the men’s bobsled team of “Cool Runnings” movie fame to the 1988 Olympics, is fielding a women’s bobsled team for the first time.“So, coming back home to Jamaica, I wanted my Jamaican people to see that they could do it,” Fenlator-Victorian, 33, continued. “And there’s not just one path that way or one path this way to get out of poverty, to make money or to make a name for themselves.

We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today,” said White House spokesman Raj Shah in a statement Friday.Sorensen is the second White House official to resign this week over domestic abuse allegations. On Thursday, White House staff secretary Rob Porter stepped down after reports emerged that he was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives.Sorensen’s former wife, Jessica Corbett, told The Washington Post about several violent episodes she said occurred during their marriage. She accused him of running over her foot with a car and burning her hand with a cigarette, as well as sending her abusive emails and text messages. The couple divorced in September.Sorensen has denied the allegations, saying he stepped down to relieve the White House of a potential “distraction.” “In fact, I was the victim of repeated physical violence during our marriage, not her,” he said in a statement to the Post. He detailed some of these incidents to the newspaper and provided photographs of bruises and scrapes he said he received from her during their arguments. Sorensen, who worked on the Council on Environmental Quality, joined the Trump administration last year after working as a top adviser to Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R). At the time of his White House appointment, the Portland Press Herald wrote that “he has a reputation as an aggressive and sometimes combative political operative.”According to Politico, officials had not yet completed a background check on Sorensen. Corbett told the Post she told the FBI about his behavior last year.Porter’s background check had also never been completed. Earlier Friday, President Donald Trump made his first public comments on Porter’s departure, pointing to his ex-staffer’s denials and calling the situation “very sad.” “As you probably know, he says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “He said very strongly yesterday that he’s innocent, so you’ll have to talk to him about that.”According to CNN, White House chief of staff John Kelly and others in the administration knew about the allegations against Porter for months before they became public.This article has been updated with details on the allegations against Sorensen and Trump’s comments Friday about Porter.

58,IMPACT,"Why This California City Is Taking On Chevron, Exxon And Shell Over Climate Change","Melissa Hung, On assignment for HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-fossil-fuel-lawsuits_us_5a7dbfe3e4b0c6726e12bc83,Richmond became the ninth U.S. community in the last year to sue fossil fuel giants over climate change.,2018-02-10,"Kenneth Davis who lives near a Chevron refinery in North Richmond, California, speaks during a protest outside the annual meeting at Chevron headquarters in San Ramon, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7dc2372000004d00eae666.jpeg?cache=CFi63fm5bP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Andrés Soto remembers the first time his parents allowed him to walk to a friend’s house after dark. As he made his way down the street in Richmond, California, where he lived, he could see a massive flame shoot up into the air from the refinery in the distance.“You know, I was 10 years old. I thought it was hella cool,” Soto says. “But now I know that’s flaring and that it was being done to burn off an imbalance of gases to prevent an explosion.”The Chevron refinery looms large in Richmond — physically, but also in the affairs of its residents and government. On Jan. 22, the city filed a lawsuit against the multinational and 28 other oil, gas and coal companies ― including BP, Exxon and Shell ― for knowingly contributing to climate change.A climate change adaptation study commissioned by the city revealed challenges it will face by 2100. It found that the city’s current levees will not protect it against rising sea levels and its water supply, sourced from runoff from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, is vulnerable to drought.“We have two rail lines, 3,000 acres of public waterfront parks, vulnerable neighborhoods, two wastewater treatment plants, and a refinery, all subject to inundation,” said Richmond Mayor Tom Butt in a press statement.Richmond is the ninth U.S. community in less than a year to take major fossil fuel companies to court, alleging that the industry has known for 50 years that its products significantly impact the Earth’s climate yet concealed these dangers from the public. It joins New York City and seven California communities, including San Francisco, Oakland, Santa Cruz and San Mateo County, in seeking damages to help pay for infrastructure projects related to sea level rise.Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall called the lawsuits counterproductive in an email, saying they will do nothing to address “the serious issue of climate change.” He added, “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement.”But residents in the communities that have sued are cautiously optimistic. Soto, now a community organizer in Richmond with Communities For a Better Environment, says he’s delighted to see the city file the latest lawsuit. The effects of climate change are on the community’s mind, he said, from California’s droughts to recent devastating wildfires.“I have never seen that kind of air quality in my entire life living in the Bay Area and I’m 62 years old,” Soto said of the wine country fires in October and the smoke they generated, which affected the entire region. “It was dense. It was dark. It was blocking out the sun. Everything was red,” he added. “To us, these are all evidence of climate change. And the fact that the petrochemicals industry knew they were doing this to the planet and covered it up is why Richmond and these other cities are saying, ‘Enough’s enough.’”Surrounded by water on three sides, Richmond, with a population of 107,500, is home to some of the poorest communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Chevron is the city’s largest employer.“They just don’t care. They just care about the profit, how much they can make money,” lifelong Richmond resident Torm Nompraseurt, who is an organizer with the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, said of Chevron’s attitude to climate change.Kate Sears is a county supervisor from Marin County across the bay from Richmond, which filed a similar lawsuit in July against 37 fossil fuel companies. Sears likened the lawsuits to ones filed against the tobacco industry, which hinged on whether those companies lied to the public about the health dangers of their products.“Instead of warning consumers about the dangers of their unabated consumption of fossil fuel products or adjusting their products to limit greenhouse gas emissions, or at least communicating, they launched a public campaign to create confusion and doubts and discredit the science of consensus about climate change,” she said.It’s possible now to attribute amounts of greenhouse gas emissions to particular companies, she said. The level of scientific knowledge “gave me a lot of encouragement about the strength of this lawsuit because of the strength of the science.”Rising sea levels could compromise nearly 20 miles of public and private roadways, in addition to many buildings, according to a 2015 assessment released by Marin County.Kevin Conger, who has lived in the county for 15 years, said he’s noticed increased flooding in the past five to six years. “On a clear day when the road is flooded out and it’s not raining or hasn’t rained for a week, it’s pretty clear that sea level is the issue,” he said.Conger is a landscape architect and participant in Resilient by Design, which brings together residents, experts and public officials in the San Francisco Bay Area to develop solutions to sea level rise and severe weather — such as horizontal levees that use vegetation and floating islands. No matter the result of the lawsuits, residents need to start thinking about climate change to voice their priorities to policymakers, he said.“We either are going to flood slowly and abandon areas around the bay that can’t protect themselves or we’re going to adapt and protect the areas,” he said. “The good news is we have some time to do that — not forever, a decade maybe, before things become really urgent. But planning at this scale is really, really slow. So we need to start on it right now.”Local communities are clearly feeling this urgency. In Imperial Beach, a working class city of 27,000 mostly Latino residents located south of San Diego, citizens have packed public meetings about the impact of sea level rise. Four hundred people appeared at one meeting, according to Mayor Serge Dedina. “It was the most widely attended meeting we had in our city’s history,” he said.The real wake-up call for the city happened during the last El Niño in 2015, when the ocean was 12 inches higher than normal, said Dedina. “We really saw the future coming out at us. We saw some of the worst coastal flooding — without very big surf conditions — that we’d ever seen. In fact, in our bay front we had the worst flooding ever. ”Imperial Beach also sued fossil fuel companies in July. Paloma Aguirre, a town resident and avid surfer, is also the coastal and marine director of Wilcoast, an environmental nonprofit that Dedina co-founded. Sea level rise brings raw sewage and solid waste into the city from Tijuana, Mexico, which shares the border and an estuary with Imperial Beach, she said. Rising temperatures in Southern California means more mosquitoes, she pointed out. Some of them carry deadly viruses like West Nile or Zika.“To the community here, it is absolutely an issue of environmental justice,” she said of the lawsuit, noting that rising sea levels will force families out of their homes. “And that is an injustice because many residents here have grown up here and love this community,” she added. “I certainly do. I wouldn’t want to be pushed out because of an issue that could have been prevented or resolved by some of these corporations.”For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook group.

59,BLACK VOICES,Students Walk Out After Princeton Professor Uses Racial Slur In Class On Hate Speech,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/princeton-university-lawrence-rosen_us_5a7dfa26e4b0c6726e134b09,"Professor emeritus Lawrence Rosen repeatedly used the word ""n****r,"" a student said.",2018-02-10,"People walk past Princeton University's Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey, on Nov. 20, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7e0a801e000037007ab47a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Several students walked out of an anthropology course at Princeton University on Tuesday after a professor repeatedly used a racial slur in his class about hate speech.The professor, Lawrence Rosen, is an award-winning legal anthropologist who has taught at Princeton University for 40 years. He received emeritus status last year.Rosen’s course, titled “Cultural Freedoms: Hate Speech, Blasphemy and Pornography,” explores the legal and cultural limits of free speech. This week, he led a discussion on verbal symbols and what types of speech should be protected. The heated debate that followed was first reported on by The Daily Princetonian.Destiny Salter, a 19-year-old Princeton student who identifies as black, told HuffPost that about 10 minutes into the class, Rosen gave this example: “Which is more provocative: A white man walks up to a black man and punches him in the nose, or a white man walks up to a black man and calls him a n****r?”″He repeated the example once more, leaving students “shocked and visibly uncomfortable,” Salter said.A few minutes later, students began to point out their discomfort with a white professor using the word in its entirety.When one student asked if Rosen planned to keep repeating the word in future classes, the professor reportedly responded that he would if he deemed it necessary for the discussion.Rosen then said, “I purposely did that, because I wanted everyone to feel the power of that word,” Salter told HuffPost.“As if black people haven’t been feeling the full power of the N-word for the past 400 years,” she said.At that point, Salter said she and another student decided to walk out of the class. When other students expressed that the word troubled them, Rosen reportedly continued to defend his use of the slur and refused to apologize.“The professor didn’t seem to consider the fact that obviously repeatedly saying the N-word, while it makes everyone uncomfortable, would affect the black people in the class on a far deeper level,” Salter said.In the end, at least three students walked out of the class as a result of the disagreement, she estimated.Salter said that she has “absolutely no problem” discussing the politics of the slur ― she expected that to be part of the course when she signed up for it. However, she thinks discussing the ramifications of hate speech and slurs does not give one the right to use them. The ends do not justify the means, she said.She was also alarmed that the professor appeared to be happy about the fact that he had elicited such a strong negative reaction from the class, and that he steadfastly refused to apologize. The incident left her “furious and disgusted,” Salter said.“He very easily could have stated the same question and just said ‘the N-word’ rather than saying the actual word. That would have sparked discussion, which is what he supposedly wanted,” she said. “Saying the actual word simply offended the class and derailed the entire conversation.” HuffPost sent Rosen a request for comment, but has not heard back.In a statement, Princeton’s acting university spokesman Michael Hotchkiss told HuffPost that the conversations and disagreements that took place in the seminar are “part of the vigorous engagement and robust debate that are central to what we do.” The university is in the process of setting up a meeting with the students, he said.“We will continue to look for ways to encourage discussions about free speech and inclusivity with the students in Professor Rosen’s class and the campus community more broadly,” Hotchkiss wrote.In a letter posted to the school newspaper, the chair of Princeton’s anthropology department, Carolyn Rouse, defended Rosen’s decision to use the racial slur.

He received emeritus status last year.Rosen’s course, titled “Cultural Freedoms: Hate Speech, Blasphemy and Pornography,” explores the legal and cultural limits of free speech. This week, he led a discussion on verbal symbols and what types of speech should be protected. The heated debate that followed was first reported on by The Daily Princetonian.Destiny Salter, a 19-year-old Princeton student who identifies as black, told HuffPost that about 10 minutes into the class, Rosen gave this example: “Which is more provocative: A white man walks up to a black man and punches him in the nose, or a white man walks up to a black man and calls him a n****r?”″He repeated the example once more, leaving students “shocked and visibly uncomfortable,” Salter said.A few minutes later, students began to point out their discomfort with a white professor using the word in its entirety.When one student asked if Rosen planned to keep repeating the word in future classes, the professor reportedly responded that he would if he deemed it necessary for the discussion.Rosen then said, “I purposely did that, because I wanted everyone to feel the power of that word,” Salter told HuffPost.“As if black people haven’t been feeling the full power of the N-word for the past 400 years,” she said.At that point, Salter said she and another student decided to walk out of the class. When other students expressed that the word troubled them, Rosen reportedly continued to defend his use of the slur and refused to apologize.“The professor didn’t seem to consider the fact that obviously repeatedly saying the N-word, while it makes everyone uncomfortable, would affect the black people in the class on a far deeper level,” Salter said.In the end, at least three students walked out of the class as a result of the disagreement, she estimated.Salter said that she has “absolutely no problem” discussing the politics of the slur ― she expected that to be part of the course when she signed up for it. However, she thinks discussing the ramifications of hate speech and slurs does not give one the right to use them. The ends do not justify the means, she said.She was also alarmed that the professor appeared to be happy about the fact that he had elicited such a strong negative reaction from the class, and that he steadfastly refused to apologize. The incident left her “furious and disgusted,” Salter said.“He very easily could have stated the same question and just said ‘the N-word’ rather than saying the actual word. That would have sparked discussion, which is what he supposedly wanted,” she said. “Saying the actual word simply offended the class and derailed the entire conversation.” HuffPost sent Rosen a request for comment, but has not heard back.In a statement, Princeton’s acting university spokesman Michael Hotchkiss told HuffPost that the conversations and disagreements that took place in the seminar are “part of the vigorous engagement and robust debate that are central to what we do.” The university is in the process of setting up a meeting with the students, he said.“We will continue to look for ways to encourage discussions about free speech and inclusivity with the students in Professor Rosen’s class and the campus community more broadly,” Hotchkiss wrote.In a letter posted to the school newspaper, the chair of Princeton’s anthropology department, Carolyn Rouse, defended Rosen’s decision to use the racial slur. The purpose of the course, Rouse said, was to give students the ability to clearly state why hate speech should or should not be protected, using an argument other than “because it made me feel bad.” She pointed out that Rosen had also mentioned anti-American or anti-Semitic examples in the class. Rosen has reportedly been using the word “n****r” as an example “year after year.” This is the first year he’s gotten such a critical response from the class, she said.Rouse said she believes the students’ reactions were probably reflective of heightened racial tensions in America.“This is diagnostic of the level of overt anti-black racism in the country today,” she wrote. “Anti-American and anti-Semitic examples did not upset the students, but an example of racism did.

But following significant media coverage of Berrones’ situation, the agency reversed its decision. After the one-year stay, Berrones will have to file for a renewal.PREVIOUSLY:Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to deport an undocumented man from Mexico whose child is battling cancer.On Thursday, ICE denied an extension to remain in the U.S. for 30-year-old Jesus Berrones, who lives in Arizona with his pregnant wife and five children. The immigration agency ordered Berrones to appear on Monday to be deported, according to his lawyer Garrett Wilkes.Berrones has been living in the U.S. since he was 1½, when his parents brought him here in 1989, according to his wife, Sonia. In 2006, at age 19, Berrones was caught driving with a fake license and deported to Mexico. He then twice re-entered the country unlawfully to rejoin his family.In 2016, ICE granted Berrones a stay of removal based on his son’s illness. Even when it has grounds for deportation, the agency can use its discretion to grant stays and has commonly done so in the case of individuals caring for a sick child. Last year, under the new Trump administration, Berrones went to ICE to refile a stay, and officials told him it was not necessary because he was no longer a deportation priority, Wilkes said. But in January, Berrones got a notice from ICE that he would be deported. The lawyer filed another request for a stay, but it was recently denied.Berrones’ 5-year-old son has been battling leukemia since 2016 and is undergoing chemotherapy. Berrones is the family’s sole breadwinner.“He’s a hard-working man,” Sonia Berrones, who is a U.S. citizen, told HuffPost on Friday, in tears. “We’re scared. The kids will ask me: ‘Where’s Daddy?’”HuffPost reached out to ICE for comment, but did not receive a response by early Saturday.On Friday, Berrones took refuge at Shadow Rock United Church of Christ in Phoenix, which is a “sanctuary church,” according to Wilkes. The church is one of hundreds of congregations nationwide that have welcomed immigrants facing deportation to live in their church until they are no longer under threat. ICE has designated churches as “sensitive” places to avoid when carrying out arrests.  “We’re just fulfilling our mission to provide a safe place for people, to keep families together,” Shadow Rock’s Rev. Ken Heintzelman told HuffPost on Friday, when asked about providing sanctuary for Berrones. “We think the immigration policy and its enforcement is unjust.” The Trump administration has made it a priority to crack down on illegal immigration. ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan said in June that undocumented immigrants should “look over [their] shoulder.” Berrones plans to remain at the church until ICE grants a stay or Wilkes is able to find a legal resolution. The lawyer is considering filing a petition that argues Berrones was not granted the opportunity to go before an immigration judge when he was first deported in 2006."

What’s more, ICE sent him to a detention center more than 1,000 miles away in Florida. Ragbir was released more than two weeks later after Manhattan federal Judge Katherine Forrest called ICE’s decision “unnecessarily cruel.”Despite his release, Ragbir was still scheduled for deportation for Saturday, Feb. 10. A suit filed Wednesday by Ragbir and other pro-immigration groups in federal court accuses ICE of targeting activists. For instance, Jean Motrevil, a co-founder of New Sanctuary Coalition, was deported Jan. 16 by ICE and sent to Haiti. The lawsuit also discusses Ragbir’s time while in custody with ICE.″[Ragbir’s] movements were restricted and monitored,” while in custody, according to the complaint. “Contact with his wife and his counsel was extremely limited, particularly while detained in Florida. He was unable to receive calls at all, nor could he make outgoing calls unless funds were placed in his phone account.”The lawsuit adds that ICE officers knew that Ragbir was an activist.On Thursday, a federal court agreed to halt Ragbir’s upcoming deportation while his case is considered. Saturday will now be a check-in for the activist instead.“Like so many people who are living in this country under the threat of deportation, I know how important it is to raise our voices against the injustices in the system,” Ragbir said in a statement. “This lawsuit is not just about me, it is about all of the members of our community who are speaking out in our struggle for immigrant rights.”Ragbir, along with other community organizers, plans to hold a rally outside of ICE offices in New York City on Saturday to “help hand-deliver a message of love for all immigrants.”"

He will return to his former role as chief content officer. Newsweek Media Group placed Candappa on leave less than two weeks ago, just hours after BuzzFeed reported that Reuters fired Candappa in 2016 after one of his subordinates filed a complaint detailing months of sexual harassment. According to the complaint, BuzzFeed said, Candappa pressured the woman to enter into a romantic relationship with him and became agitated when she did not reciprocate, once texting, “I may quit and come after you. Be warned.”Only months after Reuters fired him, Candappa landed a job at Newsweek Media Group, where he was named global editor-in-chief of the International Business Times and chief content officer of Newsweek Media Group.Staffers, both present and former, expressed shock on Friday that Candappa will be returning. Upon hearing of Newsweek’s decision, staff writer Marie Solis tweeted that she felt “sick to my stomach.” “I’ve been told by editors to continue doing the best work I can do during whatever remaining time I have at Newsweek, advice I’ve tried to heed. This decision makes that all the more difficult,” she added. It’s been a long week for Newsweek staffers.

He will return to his former role as chief content officer. Newsweek Media Group placed Candappa on leave less than two weeks ago, just hours after BuzzFeed reported that Reuters fired Candappa in 2016 after one of his subordinates filed a complaint detailing months of sexual harassment. According to the complaint, BuzzFeed said, Candappa pressured the woman to enter into a romantic relationship with him and became agitated when she did not reciprocate, once texting, “I may quit and come after you. Be warned.”Only months after Reuters fired him, Candappa landed a job at Newsweek Media Group, where he was named global editor-in-chief of the International Business Times and chief content officer of Newsweek Media Group.Staffers, both present and former, expressed shock on Friday that Candappa will be returning. Upon hearing of Newsweek’s decision, staff writer Marie Solis tweeted that she felt “sick to my stomach.” “I’ve been told by editors to continue doing the best work I can do during whatever remaining time I have at Newsweek, advice I’ve tried to heed. This decision makes that all the more difficult,” she added. It’s been a long week for Newsweek staffers.

It has also suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC).“Although the ROC was suspended, the IOC nevertheless chose to offer individual athletes the opportunity to participate in the Winter Games under prescribed conditions - a process that was designed to balance the IOC’s interest in the global fight against doping and the interests of individual athletes from Russia.”Among those appealing on Friday were athletes who were not sanctioned for doping in their careers and were not named specifically in the investigations but were still excluded from the games, with the IOC saying the evidence was there as was suspicion of wrong-doing.Konstantin Vybornov, spokesman for the Olympic athletes from Russia in Pyeongchang, told Reuters he could not immediately comment on the CAS ruling.The games begin later on Friday and run to Feb. 25.(Additional reporting by Gabriellle Tetrault-Farber, Editing by Peter Rutherford/Greg Stutchbury)"

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) wants industries to be more transparent about workplace sexual harassment and assault, particularly businesses like hotels, restaurants and retail, where workers face steeper challenges in reporting incidents, seeking recourse and being heard, due to their economic inequality and relative anonymity.Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate’s committee on health, education, labor and pensions (HELP), and one of several congressional lawmakers who has led legislative efforts to combat sexual misconduct, on Friday mailed letters to major industry organizations requesting information about their policies for addressing such incidents.“Although we are seeing headlines about powerful and famous people being called to account for their actions, we are seeing far less action in industries outside of the spotlight,” she wrote. “Therefore, I hope and expect that you are taking steps to address concerns about misconduct in your industry and to ensure your members’ workplaces are free from harassment.”Questions that Murray is posing to these organizations include noting whether they have “ongoing discussions, plans, and actions ... aimed at protecting employees and establishing an equal and harassment-free workplace,” whether industry leaders have conducted research or surveys to understand the problem’s magnitude and if there are factors specific to their industries that may contribute to workplace sexual abuses.The #MeToo movement has exposed sexual misconduct across a wide range of industries and institutions, from Hollywood to Congress itself.It has also demonstrated that women in lower-wage jobs and less-prominent industries, such as hotel housekeepers to flight attendants, face particular challenges and vulnerabilities because the economic disparity between them and their harassers is much greater. They also work in relative anonymity, compared with more high-profile survivors of sexual misconduct in industries like entertainment and media, whose name recognition and star power generate more headlines about the issue.Murray said last month that she hopes to work with Republican HELP committee chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) to hold hearings on the issue of workplace sexual harassment.Capitol Hill lawmakers have also introduced legislation to combat the legal mechanisms that can prevent accusers from speaking out and allow companies to conceal harassment and assault, such as secretive settlements and non-disclosure agreements.The full list of industry organizations from which Murray is seeking information:1.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) held up the bill until after 1 a.m. ― setting off a technical lapse in government appropriations ― the Senate approved the six-week funding extension and spending limit deal 71-28. A few hours later, racing the bill through procedures that normally take hours, the House passed the bill 240-186, with 67 Republicans and 119 Democrats opposed, and 167 Republicans and 73 Democrats in favor. (The Republican vote totals flipped almost completely from the previous two-year budget deal, when it passed with 79 Republicans voting yes and 167 voting no.)Friday’s vote in the House culminated in a bizarre standoff, with Democrats holding back the vast majority of their votes to show just how many Democratic votes Republicans needed to pass the bill. About 40 Republicans, for their part, also held off voting on the bill, waiting for Democrats to put up more votes before they themselves voted no.In the end, under the threat of the presiding officer closing the vote at the expiration of the 15 minutes allotted for the roll call, Democrats began changing their votes in favor of the bill. At about 5:30 a.m., the bill passed. President Donald Trump signed the bill Friday morning.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) continued her opposition to the legislation Friday morning, insisting once again that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) give Democrats the same assurances that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave Senate Democrats ― that Democrats would have a level playing field for offering amendments to a bill to help undocumented young people losing Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program protections.In the end, neither Pelosi’s demands nor the voting games mattered, as a critical number of Democrats supported the bill.The legislation is a massive spending deal. In addition to the six-week extension of government funding, it would raise spending by roughly $320 billion, providing $80 billion above the spending caps for defense and $63 billion for non-defense for this year, and another $85 billion more for defense and $68 billion more for non-defense for the next fiscal year. The agreement also sets up $140 billion in war funding and $20 billion more for other emergency spending over two years, and throws in $89 billion for disaster relief.In spending, it’s a huge win for Democrats, but they did not get the assurances they wanted on DACA, meaning House Republicans are free to bring up an immigration bill that they want rather than one that hews closer to Democratic priorities.Democrats still hope that, because McConnell has made those open amendment concessions, and because the Senate is expected to go first on a DACA bill, there will be pressure on Ryan to put the Senate immigration measure up for a vote in the House.If Ryan doesn’t, Democrats still have the remaining omnibus bill as leverage ― Friday’s deal was simply to allow lawmakers time to write an actual measure spending the money they approved. But their opportunities to extract concessions are waning, and unless the bill that comes out of the Senate is assured a vote, Democrats may have just let go of a key piece of influence they had over the eventual immigration product.Immigrant rights advocates have argued since September, when Trump rescinded DACA, that the best chance for helping its recipients would be getting protections attached to a must-pass bill, like government spending. Their fear is that as a stand-alone bill could be riddled with poison pills — or not brought for a vote at all. Trump is demanding significant border security investments, including his wall, massive legal immigration cuts, and changes to asylum law in order to approve protections for undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as kids, which could sink a deal.Thousands of DACA recipients have already lost their status, but the number will jump by an estimated 1,000 people losing protections each day starting March 6, due to the way Trump phased out the program. That’s why some lawmakers say the deadline for action is March 5, even though DACA recipients can currently apply to renew their protections under a court order that the Trump administration is fighting.Ahead of the vote, Ryan told lawmakers that he was committed to working toward a bipartisan immigration deal that Trump would support. That’s still not the commitment Democrats wanted in exchange for their votes on the funding bill, but Ryan has suggested he wants a solution on DACA that can pass Congress, which suggests the need for Democratic votes anyway.“My commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment,” Ryan said just before the vote. “We will solve this DACA problem.”Igor Bobic and Alana Horowitz Satlin contributed reporting.This article has been updated to reflect that Trump signed the bill.

So what's next?,2018-02-09,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7e16b01e00002c007ab48b.jpeg?cache=Jbpjjn6SFv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For months, immigrant rights activists believed their best chance to help young undocumented people was to get Democrats to insist on protections for them in a must-pass spending legislation. That strategy, however, is now dead. And their best hope going forward may be to rely on the goodwill of Republicans. Instead of forcing the GOP to swallow a bill to help undocumented youths, they need the GOP to instead decide they truly want one. On Friday, Congress approved another government funding bill without any action on so-called Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. It was the third time they had done so. Dreamers and their allies now turn their attention to Republicans, whom they’re hoping they can persuade to help them for a number of reasons. That could be because they care about Dreamers, whose lives would be thrown into chaos if Congress does nothing. It could be because they think it’s good policy. Or it could be because they don’t want to suffer political damage caused by an inevitable string of news stories about young people who came to the U.S. as children being detained and deported once they begin to lose protections at a rate of about 1,000 per day starting in early March. “The image of America deporting fellow Americans is not something this country or the Republican Party want to see unfolding every night on the national and local news,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), a top champion of Dreamer relief, said in a statement on Friday. The Senate is set to begin floor debate next week on a bill to provide relief for Dreamers, 700,000 of whom will lose Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival work permits and deportation protections over the next two years because President Donald Trump rescinded the program. Thousands of DACA recipients have already lost their protections, but the number of expirations each day will balloon after a March 5 “deadline” set by Trump for Congress to act. Some recipients are applying to renew their protections after a court order that temporarily reopened the program, but that could take months or be blocked, so losing relief is a real and frightening possibility. That’s why immigration advocates haven’t given up hope, even though they condemned Democrats and Republicans for voting on government funding without a Dreamer fix. Todd Schulte, president of the pro-reform FWD.us, said the country is “almost certainly heading into incredibly cruel and chaotic times” that only Congress can stop. “So I remain pretty confident of getting something done here,” he said. “I don’t know the exact timing, but the reason is that the consequences of failure are incredibly severe.” It’s still going to be tricky. Trump is demanding a slate of highly controversial policy changes, including slashing legal immigration, bulking up border security and restricting access for asylum, in exchange for protections for the Dreamers he claims he wants to help. His proposals will now be tested in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would allow for an open process to let all senators submit their ideas and then see what can get enough approval to pass. It’s “both terrifying and a great opportunity,” as Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-reform group National Immigration Forum, put it.Some of Trump’s framework will likely fall apart. He wants to dramatically cut legal immigration pathways ― the diversity lottery and types of family-based migration ― without replacing them with something else, which some Republicans oppose, as do most Democrats. Funding for his border wall might be difficult to swing, although the White House’s broad definition for what constitutes a “wall” makes it easier for Democrats to stomach. But then the Senate will have to figure out what can pass, with supporters for a narrow bill up against people who want to drag in other issues, potentially as poison pills to kill it. The Dream Act, the preferred bill of immigrant advocates to grant a path to citizenship to Dreamers, has bipartisan support, but not enough. A large group of senators is working on their own approach that they have yet to unveil. As a fallback, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a co-sponsor of the Dream Act, said this week that he is preparing a bill that would extend DACA protections on a temporary basis, along with some border security measures. If the Senate pulls off a bill, it could still die in the House. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said he wants to get something done, with the caveat that he wants a bill the president will sign ― which could mean blocking bills that a majority of the chamber supports based on a prediction that Trump would veto them. Ryan might also insist on the informal Hastert Rule, a tradition of allowing votes only if a bill can pass with a majority of Republicans. It’s not clear what route the House will take. A bill from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and other GOP members to reshape immigration policy and enforcement ― without a path to citizenship for Dreamers ― faces heavy opposition. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Ryan to offer the same open process in the lower chamber that McConnell is holding in the Senate. If he did, potentially breaking the Hastert Rule, one of them would likely pass ― either the Dream Act, a Republican alternative put forward by Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) or a bipartisan bill from Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas), Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.). Or, perhaps, whatever bill the Senate approves. Then there’s the president. Although he’s said he supports action for Dreamers, his White House spends far more time emphasizing the dangers of both legal and undocumented immigrants, indicating his top priority is keeping people out of the U.S. rather protecting young people’s ability to remain. Still, even Trump might want to avoid the bad publicity of DACA recipients losing their protections in massive numbers, or be convinced it’s worth compromising to get his wall. McConnell, Ryan and Trump are in the driver’s seat now more than they were before. That’s frightening given their past and current stances, said Mayra Macias, political director of Latino Victory Project, which promotes Latinos in politics and pro-reform candidates. “We want to be hopeful and also really hope that we’re wrong about Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and this administration and hope that they will stick to their word and have a substantive conversation about what immigration reform looks like,” she said. Pressure will be on Democrats, too, to not compromise and approve measures that would hurt other immigrants in order to save Dreamers. Undocumented immigrant activists say they don’t want to be used as bargaining chips for Trump’s proposals to block off legal immigration channels or anything that could put the rest of the undocumented community in danger. Even though they feel betrayed by Democrats who did not use their leverage on government funding to get Dreamer protections and wary of Republicans who voice support but don’t act, undocumented youth will keep pushing lawmakers. They don’t have any other choice, Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director of the undocumented youth organization United We Dream, said on a call with reporters.“There is no option of giving up,” she said."

In recent years, several young players, including Chris Borland of the 49ers, have bowed out of the sport early due to growing concerns over the potential for long-term brain damage, but Urschel’s motivation was different: he just didn’t have time for football anymore. He was getting a PhD in math at MIT. The idea of a 300-pound offensive lineman trading in his helmet for a protractor obviously generated a lot of interest, as well as a lot of bad math/football puns. Now, Urschel has quietly set himself a new goal: he wants to become a chess master.You might think someone who spends his days studying Laplacian eigenvectors would pick a hobby that’s a little more restful on the brain. But for Urschel, the appeal of math and the appeal of chess are very similar. “As a mathematician, I really like to understand the structure of things,” he says. “[Chess] is very mathematical to me. You’re playing a game, you’re faced with some position, you’re trying to figure out the way to proceed, and you don’t really know in most cases if I play this move or that move, if that’s winning, if it’s losing, if it’s drawing... It doesn’t feel that much different from being faced with a mathematical problem and trying to reason your way through.”Urschel has set himself the goal of earning the National Master title, which is awarded by the US Chess Federation to players who reach a certain rating level. While the “NM” title falls well below the prestigious Grandmaster title given out by FIDE (the International Chess Federation) it’s still a heavy lift for someone who’s getting a PhD and raising a child at the same time. Nevertheless, Urschel thinks he can do it. So does Daniel Rensch, Vice President of Chess.com, the most popular online chess site. “I would be surprised if he doesn’t make master in the next five years,” he says.The two met sometime last year, when Urschel reached out to Rensch on Twitter. Rensch is an International Master (the second-highest title bestowed by FIDE), and was one of the top junior players in his youth. “[Urschel] said he was a big fan of Chesscenter, which is a show that we do, a monthly sports-style recap of all the biggest stories in chess,” recalls Rensch. “At first I was like, ‘who’s this?’ Then I click and I’m like, ‘oh crap, this is an NFL star.’ And then I found out John is one of the most interesting people on the planet.”Intrigued by the idea of an ex-NFL player who wanted to become a chess master, Rensch made himself Urschel’s unofficial mentor. Nowadays you can often see them together on Chess.com’s youtube channel, like in this video where Rensch gives Urschel a calculation lesson:In July, Chess.com organized a “celebrity chess match” between Urschel and Shaun Hutchinson, or “Hutch”, a popular eSports streamer and commentator who dabbles in chess. “At the time our ratings on Chess.com were comparable,” says Urschel. “It seemed like a cool thing to do.”After losing the first game, Urschel surged to a blowout victory by winning the next eleven in a row ― but he’s charitable to his vanquished foe. “I won but I want to stress that the score did not represent our talent levels,” he told me. “He very much went on tilt, as people do. People go on tilt, things happen.”After I spoke to Urschel on the phone for this article, I challenged him to a quick game on Chess.com. He accepted. It was a tense game, with both sides holding the advantage at various points. Urschel managed his clock better than me and I lost on time in the endgame (in timed games, the first player whose clock runs out loses). I showed our game to Daniel Rensch to see if he had any thoughts. After offering me some tips on my own play, he turned to Urschel’s. Get ready for some chess jargon.“I think John’s biggest mistake was that after e5 on move 19 he should’ve played d5,” he told me. “If he responds with d5 there he’s got a really strong passed pawn in the center, and it leaves your bishop on f6 blocked by your own e-pawn. John has a tendency to like trading pieces, because he really likes the endgame, but it means he can misplay some middlegame space advantages. I’ve worked with him on this.”Getting to master level means meticulously identifying and ironing out those weaknesses, one by one. “I think it’s totally realistic that he can make master in 3 to 4 years,” says Rensch. “In that way I am both his biggest cheerleader and his biggest critic. Because I do push him to challenge his own weaknesses and not to be comfortable. John loves the game, he loves the scientific aspects of it, and he’s willing to work hard. But whether he’s able to fully embrace the gamesmanship aspect of it will be a big determining factor. I think John is already on the way to having a master-level understanding of the game. But he’s not there yet.”In 2015, after Chris Borland’s retirement due to concerns over football-related brain damage, Urschel published a piece in the Players’ Tribune defending his decision to keep playing the game. “Objectively, I shouldn’t,” he admitted. So why not quit? “I love hitting people,” he said simply. For Urschel, there was just no replacing the rush of physically dominating another player.Two years later, growing academic and family commitments had changed the calculation. While it seems unlikely chess will be able to fill that very specific void in his life, Urschel has developed enough of a passion for the game to keep pushing toward a master title. “By the end of 2020 I think seems like a reasonable goal,” he says. “Hopefully by then I’ll have something to celebrate.”"

In recent years, several young players, including Chris Borland of the 49ers, have bowed out of the sport early due to growing concerns over the potential for long-term brain damage, but Urschel’s motivation was different: he just didn’t have time for football anymore. He was getting a PhD in math at MIT. The idea of a 300-pound offensive lineman trading in his helmet for a protractor obviously generated a lot of interest, as well as a lot of bad math/football puns. Now, Urschel has quietly set himself a new goal: he wants to become a chess master.You might think someone who spends his days studying Laplacian eigenvectors would pick a hobby that’s a little more restful on the brain. But for Urschel, the appeal of math and the appeal of chess are very similar. “As a mathematician, I really like to understand the structure of things,” he says. “[Chess] is very mathematical to me. You’re playing a game, you’re faced with some position, you’re trying to figure out the way to proceed, and you don’t really know in most cases if I play this move or that move, if that’s winning, if it’s losing, if it’s drawing...

82,ENTERTAINMENT,Gloria Allred: More ‘High-Profile’ Hollywood Figures Will Be Outed As Predators,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gloria-allred-netflix-documentary_us_5a7b4fd0e4b0c6726e0eb151,"Ahead of her new Netflix documentary, ""Seeing Allred,"" the famous attorney suggests there are more #MeToo stories to come.",2018-02-09,"Gloria Allred at one of her press conferences in ""Seeing Allred.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c6961210000c300600a31.jpeg?cache=fDtQkx9QSQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARK CITY, Utah ― Gloria Allred is no longer just a crusading lawyer: She’s now a Hollywood headliner, having splashed around last month’s Sundance Film Festival, where her documentary, “Seeing Allred,” premiered ahead of its Feb. 9 Netflix release. There, in addition to speaking at the Women’s March rally, she was subjected to the sort of press junket all too familiar to movie stars ― the kind where she was seated in a nondescript condo suite for hours while a parade of journalists, one after the next, sat before her with their allotted 20 minutes’ worth of questions.I was one of those journalists, and let me tell you this: Gloria Allred knows her talking points. No matter the query, her answers tended to contain well-packaged legal advice and testimony about her commitment to helping women “speak out about injustices they have felt in their lives.”Allred’s chief message during my time with her was to urge survivors of sexual assault and harassment to seek an attorney’s counsel before contacting the media or logging an allegation on Twitter. And it appears she knows a handful of women who’ve done exactly that.In fact, Allred said she’s currently representing clients with allegations against “high-profile figures” who have yet to be exposed by the #MeToo movement. Despite her misgivings about social media, Allred did acknowledge that the court of public opinion has made an impact. “Many wrongdoers are facing very serious consequences, even though there is no civil lawsuit filed or criminal case brought against them, and there may never be,” she said. “They’re facing consequences to their careers, and they’re on the defensive. They’ve always been on the offensive, but now suddenly there’s a power shift, and they’re on the defensive.”“[Women are] feeling very empowered,” she added, “and a lot of the men in Hollywood are shaking in their boots and saying, ‘Oh my god, am I going to be next?’ And many of them are, because I’m contacting many of them and their names are not in the news.”Unsurprisingly, Allred didn’t elaborate further, except to say these individuals “may be surprised because they may have underestimated the commitment of their victim to [take action].”Such action forms the backbone of “Seeing Allred,” directed by Sophie Sartain and Roberta Grossman, who last collaborated on the World War II documentary “Above and Beyond.” The film shows Allred at work, tracing her roots as an activist, her own rape and subsequent abortion, and her eminent role in recent cases against Bill Cosby, President Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein.“Allred” also touches on her daughter Lisa Bloom’s legal career. Bloom defended three women who accused now-disgraced Fox News heavyweight Bill O’Reilly of sexual harassment. But she also briefly advised Weinstein and reportedly tried to discredit a journalist pursuing a story about former Amazon Studios chief Roy Price, which left some questioning Bloom’s commitment to ousting alleged wrongdoers.When I asked Allred about Bloom’s work, Allred insisted that she and her daughter don’t talk about cases or the broader movement. “I haven’t discussed #MeToo with either my daughter or my granddaughter,” she said before changing the subject to quote a speech she’d delivered at a dinner during Sundance.Naturally, “Seeing Allred” is an especially timely documentary, given the continuing cycle of #MeToo-related news. But Allred said she agreed to participate in the film “months before we even knew the Bill Cosby story would break, before President Trump [was] elected by the Electoral College, before Harvey Weinstein.” As she tells it, it took the directors two years to persuade her to commit to the project.“It just worked out because they were able to cover so many issues that I’ve been working on for 42 years,” she said, “and in a way that they could understand what I’m doing, why I’m doing it and how important it is that persons who are victims, or believe that they are, speak up.”“Seeing Allred” is now streaming on Netflix."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7dc56b2100003800600c58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Quincy Jones spilled some serious tea this week when he causally mentioned during a wild interview that Marlon Brando had had sex with Richard Pryor.Jennifer Pryor Lee, Pryor’s widow, later confirmed the claim. She said the late comedian had been open about his bisexuality and wrote about his sexual relationships in his diaries, which she plans to publish later this year. She also told TMZ that she thought Pryor would have been amused by Jones’ comment about him and Brando. Now Pryor’s daughter, Rain Pryor, is weighing in on Jones’ and Lee Pryor’s comments, saying that her father never slept with Brando.“Daddy did NOT have relations with Brando,” she wrote Thursday in one of two Facebook posts about the subject.In another post, Rain Pryor completely dismisses Jones’ interview.“All you who touted Faux News and preach about wanting blacks to be represented in a great light and then posted Q’s interview are irrelevant and full of your own BS,” she wrote. “Q, was once a brilliant music producer who is losing his mind, and decided to garner publicity for himself with a sensationalized interview.”She also delegitimizes Lee Pryor’s comments about the comedian’s sexuality.“Then on top of it all, my dad’s so called widow validated it, because she needs to keep legitimizing herself and tarnish our dad even after he’s dead. She hated Q and Daddy,” Rain Pryor wrote. But she also wrote candidly about her father’s fluid sexuality.“My dad was very open with his life, so much so that news of his relationship with a trans woman in the early 70s and 80s wasn’t really newsworthy nor notable,” she wrote. “As a child I knew her, not as the trans person in our home, but the lady whom everyone accepted. So much acceptance I did not know she was Trans until recently.”Pryor Lee told Vulture that many of her husband’s sexual encounters with men were one-night stands, and that that was probably what had happened with Brando after a night of partying.“Knowing Richard, it was a one-off thing,” she said.Rain Pryor and Lee Pryor have a contentious relationship, largely because Lee Pryor has ownership over her late husband’s estate. There was a lot of friction between the two women when Lee Pryor attempted to make a biopic about Pryor’s life in 2015.Rain Pryor has also been open about her contempt for her stepmother. In 2004, she blasted Lee Pryor for the way she tended to her ailing father, who died a year later after a long battle with multiple sclerosis.“There are medications that could help my dad but there’s someone in his life controlling whether or not he takes those medications,” Rain Pryor told Steppin’ Out magazine, referring to her stepmother."
