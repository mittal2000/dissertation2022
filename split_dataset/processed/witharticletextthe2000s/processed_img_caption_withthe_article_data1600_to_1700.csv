Kevin Eck, unhappy with Hamill’s political tweets, told him last year to “stick to playing Han Solo’s short little bitch.”Eck, who previously made headlines when it was found that he had complained about the all-black cast of “The Wiz,” has since protected his tweets, But CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski shared the comments about Hamill on Tuesday: Hamill fired back ― and unlike a stormtrooper, he didn’t miss: The actor drew a round of virtual applause:"

In total, 58 companies, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Lyft, Square and Wikimedia, signed on. Many of the same companies joined a similar brief in February in opposition to the first version of Trump’s ban.“The technological and scientific breakthroughs that fuel the economic engine of the country — search, cloud computing, social media, artificial intelligence, faster and faster microprocessors, the Internet of Everything, reusable spacecraft — were all made possible by the ingenuity, imagination and invention of newcomers to America, including Muslims from across the world,” the brief states. “Never in modern American history has that infusion of talent and passion and creativity been stanched, as it is vital to the lifeblood of our economy. Never, until now.” Trump signed the revised order on March 6, more than a month after federal judges struck down the initial version banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees from temporarily entering the U.S. While the new version is significantly watered down ― only travelers without visas are banned, and Iraq has been removed from the list of prohibited countries ― the order still targets Muslims and puts the refugee resettlement program on hold. Hawaii filed its lawsuit two days after the new ban was announced, arguing that the order violates the U.S. Constitution and would have a “chilling” effect on the state’s tourism industry. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have filed an amicus brief in support of that suit, contending that the ban will do “serious harm” to their residents, businesses and communities. A federal judge in Hawaii is set to hear arguments on the case later on Wednesday.Washington state’s attorney general has filed a separate lawsuit challenging Trump’s order, arguing that the impact of the ban has not changed despite the revisions. Multiple states, including California and Maryland, have signed on to that suit. Read the tech companies’ full amicus brief below: "

The Huffington Post reached out to Rihanna’s rep to confirm the singer’s involvement with the movie. “She was never ever attached,” she said in an email. Dreams deferred.PREVIOUSLY: Remember when Rihanna made her feature-film debut in “Battleship”? Someone must have texted her in a crisis, because the singer’s movie career has seen an upswing since that noisy board game hit the big screen in 2012.Rihanna’s latest booking is “Annette,” which Variety and Deadline call a “music-filled drama.” The Film Stage tweeted a sales poster that labels it “a film all in songs,” implying a full-on musical.Amazon acquired North American distribution rights on Tuesday, confirming Rihanna’s casting opposite Adam Driver. (We know he can sing!) Rooney Mara had also been attached to the film, but she dropped out due to reported scheduling conflicts. The movie revolves around a widowed stand-up comedian, presumably played by Driver, whose 2-year-old daughter has an unlikely gift. Producers are hunting for a female lead to replace Mara before production begins this spring. Featuring new music from the indie-rock band Sparks, “Annette” is the first English-language project directed by Leos Carax, known for arty French films like “Boy Meets Girl” and “Holy Motors.”Rihanna has a busy acting schedule ahead: She’ll soon be seen as Marion Crane on “Bates Motel,” and this summer she has a role in the time-traveling sci-fi adventure “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,” starring Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne. Next year, she’ll appear as part of the illustrious “Ocean’s 8” cast, calling the shots with Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, Sarah Paulson and other celestial gems."

It dumped over 2 feet of snow in parts of Pennsylvania and New York and caused thousands of flights to be grounded and schools to close.During Tuesday’s nor’easter, a 16-year-old girl in Gilford, New Hampshire, was killed after her car skidded out of control on a snowy highway and struck a tree. Hours later, Daniel Baerga, 83, was accidentally hit by a snow plow while walking in the parking lot of his apartment building in East Hartford, Connecticut. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.In Longmeadow, Massachusetts, an Amtrak train and a snow plow truck collided, killing a town public works employee who was clearing the tracks. The victim has not yet been identified.Strong winds and frigid temperatures continued to lash the northeast on Wednesday, making shoveling and commuting into work especially difficult for many people.Sarah Thomas, 23, said Wednesday that she was snowed in for the second day in a row at her home in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, roughly 20 miles southwest of Scranton. Thomas, who said she measured nearly 2 feet of snow Tuesday afternoon, spent the morning helping her father shovel since the learning center where she works was closed.“I expected it to be a big storm, but I didn’t expect it to have as huge of an impact as it did,” Thomas told The Huffington Post.Thomas said she spent the morning helping her father shovel since the learning center where she works was closed.“I’m kind of concerned about driving conditions today,” said Thomas, who had hoped to venture outside the neighborhood in the afternoon. “I’ve got cabin fever. I was actually going to try and make it to the gym for Zumba.”Though big cities like New York City and Philadelphia faced minimal impact compared to earlier forecasts, the fierce Nor’easter unloaded 1-2 feet of snow in some areas of the region.Boston was hit with roughly 7 inches of snow Tuesday, despite earlier predictions estimating upward of 18 inches. Still, Boston public schools remained closed Wednesday.By early Wednesday, Binghamton, New York set a 24-hour record snowfall at 31 inches, shattering the old record of 23 inches set in 1961, reported weather forecasting service Accuweather.The storm system cut power to nearly 250,000 customers from Virginia to New England, reported The Associated Press. Airline-tracking service FlightAware told HuffPost on Wednesday that over 500,000 travelers have been impacted by the nearly 9,000 flights canceled since Monday. This is a developing story.

Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s shooting death at a bar in Olathe, Kansas, has exposed a divide within the Indian-American community about whether President Donald Trump has responded adequately to hate targeting their community. Trump offered Indian Americans nine words in consolation, during a Congressional speech nearly a week after the shooting.“Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms,” the president said during his speech.Some Indian-Americans are overlooking the timing of his response and continuing to support Trump’s policies ― specifically his stance on terrorism. But for many others, his words were not nearly enough to assuage fears about their safety, especially as reports of attacks and vandalism continue to surface. A few days after the Kansas attack, a Sikh man of Indian origin was shot and injured in Washington state, reportedly after the gunman told him to “go back to your own country.” In Florida, a man attempted to set fire to a convenience store owned by Indians, assuming that they were Arab. And in Colorado, an Indian family’s home was reportedly vandalized with hate messages and smeared with eggs and feces.Given these incidences of hate, some Indian Americans believe President Donald Trump must do more to ensure that Indians, South Asians and other marginalized groups feel safe in America.Suhag Shukla, the Indian-American co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, told The Huffington Post that she had been “deeply and profoundly saddened” by news of Kuchibhotla’s death. ”While I appreciate [the president’s] condemnation of the incident, my personal opinion is that a stronger and swifter message would have been appreciated,” she said.The advocacy group South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) said it has documented over 200 incidents of hate violence and xenophobic political rhetoric aimed at South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Arab, and Middle Eastern Americans during the 2016 elections. The group claimed 95% of the incidents were motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment.Suman Raghunathan, Executive Director of SAALT, told The Huffington Post that there’s been an increase in xenophobic political rhetoric over the course of the year leading up to the election. She believes there’s a direct link between this rhetoric and an increase in hate incidents.“We have been looking at hate violence for several years now, and only recently, over the past year in our tracking, were we comfortable in tracing this direct relationship,” she said. “We now unfortunately believe this uptick in violence is linked to an uptick in problematic statements about our communities.” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has rejected the idea that the president’s rhetoric has contributed to a rise in hate violence.“I mean, obviously, any loss of life is tragic,” Spicer said when asked about Kuchibhotla’s death during a press gaggle on Feb. 24. “To suggest that there’s any correlation I think is a bit absurd.”And for some segments of the Indian-American population, hate violence against Indians haven’t shaken approval of the president.As a whole, the majority of Indian Americans tend to vote Democratic and are not fans of Trump. A poll taken before the election suggested that only 7 percent of registered Indian American voters planned to vote for Trump. But there is a small group of Indian-Americans who have shown support for the president. The “Hindus for Trump” movement has found a foothold in both India and America. Some analysts say Trump’s Hindu supporters see a similarity between Trump’s America-first rhetoric and the Hindu nationalism espoused by supporters of Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.In the United States, the Republican Hindu Coalition is a particularly vocal group. The RHC’s chairman, Shalabh Kumar, was one of Trump’s biggest individual donors during the election. Although the RHC has the word “Hindu” in its title and Hindus hail from many different countries, one of the organization’s goals seems to be forging strong ties between India and the United States.There’s also an aspect of the “Hindus for Trump” movement that is attracted to Trump’s hardline stances on terrorism. In India, some supporters believe Trump’s blunt talk on extremism will lead to tougher policy towards Pakistan.In the United States, the RHC has used Islamophobic rhetoric and imagery to tap into anti-Muslim sentiment. The organization has expressed “full-throated” support for Trump’s executive order on immigration, which targeted immigrants and refugees from several Muslim-majority countries. In a statement about the order relased on Jan. 29, the RHC applauded the Trump administration for “taking this decisive move to protect our citizens from Islamic terror.” Dr. Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of religion at the University of Florida, said that she isn’t aware of any other prominent, organized coalition within the South Asian American community that’s similar to the RHC in their public support for Trump. She said that Hindus’ support could be fueled by a number of reasons ― from concern about terrorism to opposition to the Affordable Care Act, to loyalty towards the Republican Party. She doesn’t think it’s likely that the Kansas shooting will change their minds. “Once people have made up their minds, not too many change them,” she told The Huffington Post.Indeed, Kuchibhotla’s death does not appear to have swayed the RHC’s support for Trump. Kumar personally condemned the shooting on Twitter. The RHC released a statement that seemed to claim that the RHC’s India ambassador, Manasvi Mamgai, was partly responsible for getting Trump to address the Kansas shooting. In an interview with The Hindu, Kumar said that Trump reacted to the Kansas shooting “at the right time, in an appropriate manner.” He claimed the fear that has swept through the Indian-American community was caused by “biased media coverage,” “a Left-wing campaign to target the President,” and activists and lawyers ""trying to make a business out of this.”“Donald Trump does not have an iota of racism in him. He and his advisers have great love and admiration for India and Hinduism,” Kumar said.The Huffington Post reached out to the RHC for comment, but did not hear back.Narayanan believes hate crimes that affect the Indian community are the result of “xenophobia in a chromophobic incarnation.” In other words, “hatred is simply targeted at skin color and perceived ethnicity.”“People committing hate crimes now are certainly enabled and feel validated by overt, public xenophobic statements as well as by the silent assent of others,” Narayanan said. “There is no getting away from the racism, xenophobia, and chromophobia that led to the tragic death of Mr. Kuchibotla.”Raghunathan, of SAALT, believes that rhetoric that pits South Asian communities against each other is not only unjust but also unhelpful. Despite the incredible religious, national, and socioeconomic diversity in the community, it’s evident to her from the Kansas shooting and other incidents of hate that for perpetrators of violence against South Asians, that diversity doesn’t matter.“We’re all seen as a monolith,” she told The Huffington Post. “We’re all seen as part and parcel of the same nationality, or religious community.” For Raghunathan, the current climate of xenophobia against immigrants makes it more important than ever to promote a pan-South Asian platform ― one that also advocates for the needs of Jewish, Arab, Latino, black, queer, and other marginalized communities. Raghunathan said she’s seen more South Asians coming forward who are ready to engage in issues that affect all of these groups. That’s why she sees this era of South Asian American history as a “movement-building moment.”“We’re just continuing to see increasing levels of interest in engagement,” she said. “And people understanding that the liberation of South Asian Americans is increasingly bound up with the liberation of their ... brothers and sisters [in other communities].”"

The streaming service said it would finance the completion and restoration of the film, which is considered by movie buffs to be the most famous film to never be released.“The promise of being able to bring to the world this unfinished work of Welles with his true artistic intention intact is a point of pride for me and for Netflix,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told The Guardian in a statement.In the early 1970s, after more than a decade in Europe, Welles returned to Hollywood to begin filming “The Other Side of the Wind,” according to Vanity Fair. Although Welles said the movie was not autobiographical, the film, which starred John Huston, Dennis Hopper and Peter Bogdanovich, was about a director who comes back to Hollywood, after spending years in Europe, to film his comeback movie — which is also titled “The Other Side of the Wind.”The film, which was supposed to be Welles’ comeback after the success of his critically acclaimed 1941 film “Citizen Kane,” was only supposed to take a few weeks to shoot. But it actually took years to film, and when Welles died of a heart attack in 1985, it was incomplete.Since then, endless legal battles among rights holders have held up the completion of the project, causing 1,083 reels of negatives to collect dust inside a Parisian warehouse, The New York Times reported in 2014.Yet, with Netflix now involved, perhaps this project will finally see the light of day."
9,POLITICS,Americans Rate Trump’s Tweets Significantly Lower Than Staff Tweets,Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tweet-rating-staff_us_58c98737e4b0934e249cfdaf,Maybe Donald Trump should leave the tweeting to his aides.,2017-03-15,"Analysts say the tweets from the Android are most likely by President Trump, while the tweets from an iPhone are most likely from his staff.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c987a41d00007b2b7ce9b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tweets from President Donald Trump’s account that are registered as being sent from from an Android ― generally a sign that the president wrote them himself ― get significantly worse scores from the public than the more innocuous tweets sent from an iPhone (presumably written by his staff). The YouGov TweetIndex catalogues Trump’s tweets and has a representative public sample rate for each of them. The respondents are asked to rate them in a scale of “great,” “good,” “OK,” “bad” and “terrible” (between +2 to -2) as well as showing the breakdown of Republicans, Democrats, and independents. The Huffington Post collected the data and separated it by whether the tweet came from Trump’s Android or an iPhone. When the tweet came from an iPhone, it scored an average of 8 points in YouGov’s TweetIndex. These tweets were mostly updates on the administration’s staff, meetings that the president had with other world leaders or ended with “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” However, tweets that came from Trump’s Android received an average score of -21 points, 29 points worse than those presumably sent by his staff. These tweets often had random words capitalized, accused the media of “fake news,” or conspiring about what might be true.Trump’s most highly scored tweet ― predictably from an iPhone ― scored a 56 overall. His lowest scoring tweet (want to guess where it came from?) was disliked by all parties. "
10,POLITICS,"Donald Trump’s Agriculture Pick Has Some Serious Ethics Issues, Too",Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sonny-perdue-ethics-nomination_us_58c992bfe4b0be71dcf102ce,"USDA secretary nominee Sonny Perdue's record is raising concerns, but probably won't stall his confirmation.",2017-03-15,Sonny Perdue arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 30. Recent reports have detailed serious ethical issues dating back to Perdue's days as Georgia governor.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c994791d0000f42c7ce9ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Georgia Gov. Sony Perdue, nominee for agriculture secretary, has long been considered one of President Donald Trump’s safe and uncontroversial Cabinet appointments in what has generally been a contentious process.But thanks to a series of reports outlining ethical shortcomings dating back to Perdue’s eight-year tenure as governor, those days just might be over — though the nominee still appears no less likely to be confirmed.Last week, the New York Times reported that 13 ethics complaints against Perdue were filed with Georgia’s State Ethics Commission during his time as governor. He was elected in 2002 and served through January 2011.In 2005, Perdue was fined as a result of two of those complaints, one of which was the result of the commission finding that Perdue had not properly reported the use of a family-owned airplane for campaign-related trip. In the other instance, the commission found that Perdue had accepted campaign contributions that exceeded state limits.The nominee told the Times that those complaints were technical and politically motivated, but the controversies from his gubernatorial tenure don’t end there.As the Environmental Working Group advocacy organization noted in a separate investigation of the former governor’s time in office, Perdue also signed state tax legislation — backed in the state legislature by his personal lawyer — that gave him a $100,000 tax break on a land deal.The tax break was among a laundry list of other “ethical lapses” the EWG outlined in its report. Others included Perdue taking “joy rides” in state helicopters, refusing to put his businesses in a blind trust and appointing political donors and business partners to lead state agencies and boards.Colin O’Neil, the EWG’s agricultural policy director, described these lapses as running counter to Trump’s campaign promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington.“I think the more that we learn about Sonny Perdue’s tenure as governor in Georgia, the more concerns and red flags are raised,” O’Neil told HuffPost. “To anyone looking from the outside, this is not draining the swamp, this is bringing the swamp to Washington.”Perdue has yet to be confirmed as U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary, as long-delayed ethics paperwork required to begin the process of scheduling a confirmation hearing was only received by the Senate Agriculture Committee last week, almost two months after Trump nominated Perdue for the post.Though not yet confirmed to lead the USDA, Perdue has already moved to appoint at least one long-time ally to a high-level position at the agency.As Politico reported Monday, Perdue appointed Heidi Green, a former business partner who he previously appointed to a state government role in Georgia, as a senior USDA advisor in January.And Perdue has already personally profited from the Trump administration’s action on environmental protection regulations, too.The Daily Beast reported Monday that Perdue is already benefiting from the administration’s push to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency’s Waters of the United States rule, also known as the Clean Water Rule. Perdue owns a grain manufacturing company, called AGrowStar, LLC, that fought the rule because the company believed the rule would increase its regulatory compliance costs.According to the paperwork Perdue filed with the Office of Government Ethics last week, the nominee plans to place AGrowStar and his other business holdings into a new trust that “will not benefit me or my spouse,” but his ties to the companies still could, potentially, raise conflicts of interest as other family members could still potentially benefit from USDA or other federal agencies’ policy changes.While these issues raise a patchwork of ethical concerns, Perdue continues to have a wide swath of support and it appears almost inevitable that he will be confirmed by the Senate.In an interview with the Times, American Farm Bureau Foundation president Zippy Duvall, a fellow Georgian and a member of Trump’s agriculture advisory team, described Perdue as “as ethical as they come.” Other influential agriculture groups have previously signaled strong support for the nominee.Key members of the Senate Agriculture Committee also seem unfazed.When asked for a comment on the recent reports on Perdue’s ethics record, a representative of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-North Dakota) pointed HuffPost toward a previous news release stating her support for Perdue’s nomination.Two other committee members did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.Perdue critic Jaydee Hanson, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety, believes the former governor will still be easily confirmed — perhaps as soon as by the month’s end.“These are serious ethical lapses and I’m concerned about them,” Hanson told HuffPost. “I wish I could say these lapses are so awful that members of the Senate are going to stand up and oppose him, but I’m afraid most of them will say this is ‘business as usual.’”For his part, Hanson is similarly concerned about the direction of the USDA under Perdue, which will likely face significant budget cuts to fund the Trump administration’s push for increased military spending. To date, there have been few indications of the nominee’s stances on critical issues like nutrition, food safety, environmental protections and farm policy.“I don’t see in [Perdue] a concern for the environment, a concern for food safety or a concern for the poor,” Hanson added. “These are ethical lapses that get down to what I call a conflict of commitment.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

11,POLITICS,Trump Has Yet To Reach Out To Any Top Democrats On Obamacare Reform,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-democrats-healthcare_us_58c9802fe4b0cb7d28ce49e5,The president eventually will need Democratic votes. He hasn't gone looking for them yet.,2017-03-15,Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has not heard from Donald Trump on Obamacare reform.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9814b1d00007b2b7ce991.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When former President Barack Obama sought to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009, he spent months painstakingly trying to convince moderate Republican senators to support a bill. Now that President Donald Trump is trying his own overhaul of the American health care system, such attempts at bipartisanship are nowhere to be found.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have not heard a peep from the Trump administration regarding health care reform, their offices said. Nor have the House and Senate minority whips, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), according to their offices. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who would be one of the most likely Democratic targets of outreach from this White House, said that although he discussed his support for parts of Obamacare with Trump during a White House meeting in February, he has not received a call to discuss reform efforts more generally. “Nothing. Never. Nobody,” Manchin’s spokesman Jonathan Kott told The Huffington Post. Trump’s refusal to explore the possibility of cross-party collaboration may stand in sharp contrast to Obama’s approach, but it is also an illustration of the widely divergent philosophical approaches each has taken to health care reform. Whereas Obama largely attempted to recreate on a national scale the system implemented in Massachusetts by then-Gov. Mitt Romney ― and frustrated Democrats with his willingness to jettison liberal proposals like a public option ― Trump has stayed committed to a conservative framework of reform, backing a bill that would reduce the size of government subsidies and restrict the expansion of Medicaid despite campaign pledges to do neither. A White House spokesperson noted that the president has met with various Democratic lawmakers to discuss health care policy matters, including a conversation with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) just last week on the topic of prescription drug prices. But with respect to reforming the current insurance market, the spokesperson made clear that Trump’s position was resolute. “Obamacare is a disaster that has hurt the middle class,” the aide said, “and we call on all Democrats to put the American people first.”House GOP leadership has adopted a similar take-it-or-leave it approach to repealing Obamacare. And because their baseline has been the removal of the prior president’s signature domestic achievement, they’ve spent their energy exclusively on shoring up the vote in their own party.“At the beginning of the process the Democrats made it very clear they were not going to support anything that guts Obamacare,” Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the majority whip, said when asked if he’d had any conversations with Democratic counterparts. “So immediately they said, ‘Look, if it involves getting rid of Obamacare, we don’t want to be a part of that discussion.’”While Trump and his Republican allies on the Hill can pass health care legislation without the help of Democrats, there is only so much of Obamacare they can undo. Procedural rules in the Senate dictate that only those parts of the law that have a budgetary impact can be considered through the legislative vehicle known as reconciliation ― which requires a simple majority vote for passage. Other reforms to Obamacare, such as scaling back certain insurance industry regulations, will require 60 Senate votes to become law. Because of this, some Republican voices have begun warning others to reconsider their current approach to repealing and replacing Obamacare. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in particular has warned House members not to vote on the current bill as is because it might not get the necessary 50 votes to pass the Senate and certainly won’t have the 60 votes needed for any follow-up legislation. On Tuesday, Trump ally and Newsmax founder Christopher Ruddy urged the president to ditch conservatives and “rekindle the bipartisanship in Congress that Obama destroyed.” Ruddy’s suggestion: “Empanel a bipartisan committee to report back by year’s end with a feasible plan to fix Obamacare.”Trump may ultimately conclude that this is the one path forward. But if that time ever comes, he will be starting at square one, having not bothered to bring in any Democratic voices into health care discussions during the first critical weeks and months. "

His life was lonely and riddled with pain ― the majority spent working as a janitor, attending mass or working alone in his Chicago apartment.When he died in 1973, he had few companions save for his landlord Nathan Lerner, who, upon clearing out his former tenant’s belongings, made an unusual discovery. Among the possessions of his unassuming lodger, Lerner found thousands of pages of text, disturbing and dreamlike drawings, and one of the longest works of fiction ever made.Darger is now regarded as one of the most exceptional outsider artists of all time. He’s is often described as an “outsider” because he was self-taught, isolated and removed from artistic institutions. It also doesn’t hurt that few details are definitively known about Darger’s life, rendering his violent and visionary works all the more mystifying and retroactively transforming him into a sort of urban legend.In 2000, Intuit ― a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of outsider art ― acquired the contents of Darger’s Lincoln Park apartment, where he lived and worked for 40 years. In 2008, Intuit used these belongings to build an environment meant to mimic Darger’s apartment, thereby offering his fans and skeptics a mediated glimpse into the artist’s world. In honor of the 125th anniversary of Darger’s birth, Intuit has scheduled a year-long string of exhibits and events focusing on the artist and his work. On view until the end of May is a show called “Source Materials,” featuring clippings of children’s books, comics, cartoons and other documents referenced in Darger’s epic, The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion.This verbose title ― often referred to as The Realms, for short ― hardly hints at the overgrown narration that blossoms across Darger’s 15,145-page tale. It’s a book so long that, according to rumor, no one has ever read it start to finish. What’s more, there is an 8,000-page sequel.The story revolves around the Vivian Girls, seven noble, young princesses hailing from the Catholic and moral land of Angelina, as they battle the Satan-worshipping Glandelinians, an evil empire who practices child slavery and torture. Although the girls are framed as the young heroines, they endure plenty of graphic horrors at the hands of their captors ― including strangulation, crucifixion and disembowelment ― along the way. “Little girls, from the ages of nine, eight and even younger, were tied down stark naked and a spade full of red-hot live coals laid on their bellies,” one excerpt reads. “Scores upon scores of poor children were cut to pieces, after being strangled to death ... Children were forced to swallow the sliced fragments of dead children’s hearts ... Their protruding tongues were extracted.’’ The fact that the depictions of darling girls being mutilated, tortured and killed appear in the honeyed, retro aesthetic of old-school bedtime books makes them all the more alarming. The chilling details of Darger’s visuals in The Realms raise a candle to the depths of his imagination. His ambiguities are thought to have mirrored his own inner battles, too ― his simultaneous desire to enact suffering one minute and thwart it the next. Occasionally, Darger inserts himself into the narrative, both as General Darge (a “protector of children”) and as a bloodthirsty Glandelinian. He also drafted two alternate endings: Good prevails in one, evil in the other. Ambiguity is present, as well, in the very anatomy of Darger’s characters, who include young girls drawn with penises. Myriad hypothesis circle this strange detail. Perhaps Darger wasn’t familiar with female genitalia, or felt torn between male and female himself, as did a character in his other book, Crazy Horse. Whatever the personal motivation for Darger’s choice, it speaks to his interest in illustrating the paradoxical, the two-at-once, the eternal in-between.From the little that is known about Darger’s life, it is clear his relationship with the concept of childhood was intense and fraught. Many art historians account for his obsession with childhood because of the traumas endured in his own. At 4 years old, Darger’s mother died during childbirth and his newborn sister was immediately put up for adoption. At 8, his father, impoverished and ill, relinquished Darger to a home for boys. After lashing out in school, he was committed to the “Asylum for Feeble Minded Children,” a nightmarish, abusive institution that Darger eventually escaped at 17. After hopping a train back to Chicago, Darger went on to live what, from the outside, resembled a modest, solitary life. His free time, however, was spent furiously transcribing fears and fantasies into wild and sprawling narratives, formed both from images and words. Because he never went to art school or received technical training, Darger drew heavily from source materials in rendering his picture-perfect girls. He hoarded scraps of imagery that he would trace, copy and collage onto this burgeoning canvases. The resulting works combine the immediately recognizable innocence of sweet storybook illustrations with the fermenting horror of Darger’s carefully inflicted suffering, yielding some of the most difficult-to-digest depictions of all time. “Source Materials” provides a tour through the unwitting accomplices in Darger’s twisted fantasies. Horns from a ram in a coloring book emerge in dragon-like beasts he called called Blengins. And innocent children, pictured stirring cereal and riding swings, end up splayed and bloodied on Darger’s page.

14,BUSINESS,"High-Paying Job Listings Are Written To Attract Men, Study Finds",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/job-listings-study_us_58c990b7e4b0be71dcf100f7,Another reason there aren't enough women at the top.,2017-03-15,"Around the globe, job listings for high-paying roles skew masculine -- except in two countries.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c993772c00002000fee984.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Would you consider yourself a driven, experienced leader eager to get your hands dirty? Then you’re likely a man.Job listings that include words and phrases like “get your hands dirty” and “driven” are more likely to attract male applicants, according to data analysis done by a machine-learning startup called Textio.And these characteristically masculine terms are used even more frequently in postings for higher-paying positions, according to new data from the company, which studies millions of real job listings and related information to find patterns and trends that help companies hire more efficiently ― and without bias.The findings add another layer of explanation for the lack of women at the top in the business world. “It is not super surprising that the listings skew more male, when you look at composition of executive teams,” Kieran Snyder, Textio’s CEO and cofounder told The Huffington Post. Majority-male executives are probably driving the job requirements for these roles and using characteristic language.Textio keeps a database of nearly 100 million real-world job listings, updated constantly. The two-and-a-half-year-old startup also gets information from clients (including CVS, Johnson & Johnson and Cisco) on how long it takes to fill a job, as well as who was hired ― their age, gender, ethnicity, etc. Data is in the aggregate so no personally identifiable information is shared.You’d think that some jobs just naturally attract more women than men ― for example, guys are just are more interested in leadership roles ― but Textio has found that the language in the job post itself is also important.And they’ve tested this theory at a few big companies. Travel company Expedia, for example, rejiggered a job posting for an engineering role to include more feminine toned language and they hired more women, Snyder said. The original job post had skewed male. The company saw similar results with jobs posted by Johnson & Johnson.Other social science research has turned up words and phrases more likely to appeal to women than men. And another startup called Unitive is also a software program that helps analyze job listings for bias.Textio claims to take the research further. By looking at real data, the company was able to turn up some language that isn’t on anyone’s list of gendered words. These include exhaustive, enforcement and fearless (masculine) and transparent, catalyst, and in touch with (feminine). The company has venture backing from a few well-known Silicon Valley investors.For this recent report, the company looked at global job data, comparing listings for lower-level roles with those for executive roles ― including titles with “chief” in them like CEO, COO, CTO, CFO, those with “president,” like vice president and senior vice president, as well as director-level jobs.In only two countries were executive job listings written with a more feminine slant: Australia and Ireland.The company provided examples of male-biased and female-biased executive jobs.Here’s a real female-slanted posting for a chief technology officer at a company, with its name changed to Acme. And here’s a CTO job-listing that skews male:Despite the fact that women now make up nearly half of the labor market, and have for a while, they’re still conspicuously absent from the top of the org chart. Only 5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women. And around the world, women hold only 24 percent of senior roles, according to a 2016 study.In one sense, the reason for the imbalance is simple and boils down to sexism. Women were long dismissed as serious workers or leaders and explicitly not welcome at the top of the corporate ladder.Yet, in 2017, overt prejudice is less likely the driving factor for gender imbalances. Instead, there are more practical obstacles, like a lack of paid leave or the pressure on women to take on the primary responsibility for care taking at home and put their careers on ice. And a variety of implicit biases that play out at work that are harder to see and fight.As this data show: Some of that implicit bias starts before you even land the job. "

The highly venomous snake likely slithered out of its enclosure at a home in Oviedo around 9 p.m. It’s not yet clear whether it escaped the residence, the Florida Wildlife Commission said.The snake’s owner, Brian Purdy, holds a venomous reptile permit. He reported his pet missing just after 11 p.m., wildlife officials said.Purdy said he wasn’t home when the snake escaped. Instead, a man who had been shadowing him to obtain his own venomous reptiles permit opened its enclosure, the Ocala Star Banner reported, citing police.The other man, who was using a shield for protection, opened the enclosure because he couldn’t see the animal inside, Purdy said. The cobra jumped at the man and then slid away. The man said he had made sure that the room was secured.Permit holders are required to confine venomous animals to an escape-proof room, FWC spokesman Robert Klepper told CNN. He said Purdy owns two other snakes ― a Gaboon viper and an African bush viper. Wildlife authorities will investigate whether any violations took place.“Public safety is the No. 1 concern,” Klepper told the network. “We wanted to emphasize that this is a venomous snake and a dangerous animal and should not be approached.”Cobras are not native to the United States, but a number of other venomous snakes are. Those include rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths/water moccasins and coral snakes, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s website.“It has been estimated that 7,000–8,000 people per year receive venomous bites in the United States, and about 5 of those people die,” the website states.In 2015, a 10-foot king cobra went missing from an Orlando man’s home for about a month before it was found beneath a neighbor’s dryer. The snake’s owner was cited for failing to immediately report its escape, MyNews13 reported."

I had just picked her up from an after-school activity as we waited for the bus in our quiet Toronto neighborhood, bundled up in full winter clothing but still feeling the Canadian winter’s chill. After we chatted for around half an hour, trying to kill the time, my daughters’ brown eyes sparkled in happiness as she yelled that the bus has arrived. I don’t know how many seconds it took her afterwards to realize that the bus did not stop for us. All what I remember is that at some point we both started jumping up and down like crazy and waving to the bus driver, who finally made an abrupt stop and waited for us as we ran and hopped in.For an Arab-looking mother wearing a headscarf, this was no passing incident. Yes, it is possible that the bus driver had no bad intentions and he just failed to see us (although I can’t see how given that we were right at the bus stop), but it is also possible he did see us – albeit only from the lens of our being a veiled Arab/Muslim woman and her daughter who were not welcome in his Canada. During the ride home I wondered if it was about my being Arab or my being Muslim or my being veiled or my being an immigrant – or even none of the above. Maybe the bus driver was completely innocent and he never thought about any of this. Maybe my mind weaved all of this because I was negatively influenced by what I see in the news coming from Trump’s America, Canada’s neighbor, and the anti-Muslim/anti-immigrant discourse currently on the rise in several countries. I never knew and I probably never will. I decided not to mention the incident (which is possibly no incident at all) to my girl. She is a child and still innocent; and the negative thoughts and worries that bothered me probably never occurred to her, or so I wanted to believe. I wanted to forget about the issue. After all, we are in Canada, one of the world’s few beacons of freedom and human rights, and we have been truly overwhelmed by warmth and love, and by amazingly welcoming Canadians, since our arrival.The bus incident came back to me today with the unexpected news of the European Court of Justice ruling that permits employers to ban workers from wearing the headscarf. In addition to Canada and a number of European countries, the European Union represents a remaining hope for those who still believe in human rights and freedom. In fact, one of the main reasons I moved with family from Egypt to Canada is that I wanted my children to live in a country that respects rights for all. Luckily, the ruling was issued in Europe and not in Canada. But make no mistake, a ruling like this will serve to shake the faith of many in human rights as universal values; it will prompt many to stop and ask themselves whether there is a single Western country that is true to the principles it promotes. They already do in the country where I come from, Egypt. Hypernationalist supporters of the ruling regime, which has committed a series of striking human rights violations against its own people, defend their rulers on the grounds that human rights do not matter – more so when the state is fighting terrorism and when ISIS is wreaking havoc in one of Egypt’s provinces, Northern Sinai. The attack on rights and freedom also comes from a segment of fellow Muslims who say that no Western power has ever fully respected the values it claims to export to the Muslim world – and that there will always be discrimination against Muslims. Hypernationalist Egyptians say that when Western politicians officially condemn a non-Western government’s human rights record, they are only paying lip service and are actually conspiring against the Egyptian state. Anti-West Muslims say that the West inherently rejects everything Muslim and hates Islam, and therefore there is no such thing as non-discriminatory respect for human rights. I often argue with both camps in defense of human rights, citing the European Union and Canada as role models and living proof that my view is not merely theoretical or expressed from an ivory tower. But with the ECJ ruling, and with every step taken in the same direction in Western countries, my voice is weakened and their voices are strengthened. Sooner or later, and even though I wish that my children could remain children forever and never have to face the reality of our hypocritical world, I will start discussing with my daughter the merits of values like equality and non-discrimination. I will tell her that she should cherish freedom, including freedom of belief and expression. But on the other hand, I do not know what the world will tell her and whether she will be able to have faith in my words in the face of whatever she will see in cruel real life. "

Duterte is widely accused of human rights abuses including murders while Trump has praised him and invited him to visit the Oval Office.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a09802c1f000018004a571a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At recent meetings a number of social studies teachers asked me for suggestions on how to evaluate, with their high school students, Year 1 since the election of Donald Trump. This is especially important because some of their students will be eligible to vote in 2018 and most will be voters in the 2020 presidential election.Most of the teachers I work with are outraged at political developments in the United States. Many agree with New York Times op-ed writer Michelle Goldberg who recently compared Trump’s election to the Biblical Apocalypse and who worries that democracy in the United States may be fatally damaged. But they also believe that their professional responsibility is to involve students in a thoughtful and non-partisan evaluation of Trump and Republican ideas, proposals, and “accomplishments.”Some see hope in the results of Election 2017 with voters choosing Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia. But as Nate Cohn wrote in the Times “The Upshot,” in Virginia especially, “The overwhelming Democratic strength in well-educated areas did not cross the political divides of the 2016 election into white working-class areas.” He felt demographic analysis of the vote did not bode well for Democratic Party prospects in 2018 Congressional elections.I recommend two classroom strategies for evaluating Year 1. One involves a “Face-Off” or simulated debate between pro- and anti-Trump “spokespeople.” The other is to have students select particular current issues, research competing positions, and write an op-ed piece explaining their own point of view supported by evidence. The strategies can be combined and after student complete their research and essay they can stage their own “Face-Off” in class.An initial “Face-Off” between a left-leaning Democrat and a right-leaning Republican might just reinforce partisan positions. I think a more effective approach at this time is a “Face-Off’ between pro- and anti-Trump conservatives. My suggestion is an activity sheet that features quotes from Jeff Flake and Steve Bannon. Students can use the Flake-Bannon “Face-Off” to help identify the issues with the Trump presidency and confronting the United States that they want to research.Teachers often ask if it is advisable for them to present their own views during a “Face-Off” or other classroom discussion. As a general rule, if a teacher’s views introduce students to ideas they would not ordinarily consider, I think it is important that they be included. If they would close discussion down, they should be held back. It is important for teachers, where possible, to model for students what it means to have a reasoned, respectful, position supported by evidence.I do not to play “Devil’s Advocate,” presenting a position I do not agree with as if it were my own. Instead I look for material that offers that perspective for students to examine. An excellent article to review before the Face-Off is David French’s op-ed piece on how Trump supporters are responding to the Mueller investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 Presidential election. French, a senior commentator for the conservative magazine National Review, said they dismiss most criticism of Trump either as “fake news”” or because the “Democrats are worse.” Writing from the “right,” French sees this attitude as a major threat to social cohesion in the United States and Christian values. “The desire to think the best of Mr. Trump combined with the deep distaste for Democrats grants extraordinary power to two phrases: ‘fake news’ and ‘the other side is worse.’ ‘Fake news’ erects a shield of disbelief against the worst allegations and allows a person to believe that Mr. Trump is better than he is.”Face-Off on the Trump Presidency: Flake v. BannonSteve Bannon (age 63) is a former an American media executive and investment banker. During the 2016 presidential campaign and the first seven months of the Trump Presidency, Bannon was Donald Trump’s chief political strategist and influenced Presidential positions and important decisions. Before working with Donald Trump, Bannon was a lead figure at Breibart News, a website he describes as a “platform for the alt-right” in the United States. Bannon’s opinions on Donald Trump and the Trump presidency are assembled from a series of interviews. In the first quote, Bannon discusses why he and Donald Trump work together well. The second quote is about foreign policy. The Third quote discusses his and Trump’s populism.A) I’m a street fighter... I think that’s why Donald Trump and I get along so well. Donald Trump’s a fighter. Great counter puncher. Great counter puncher. He’s a fighter. ... I’m going to be his wing man outside for the entire time, to ... make sure his enemies know that there’s no free shot on goal ... The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.”B) “The geniuses in the foreign policy elite, what they left on President Trump, is essentially the Bay of Pigs in Venezuela, the Cuban missile crisis in Korea, and the Vietnam War in Afghanistan, all at one time. President Trump didn’t do this. The deplorables that voted for President Trump didn’t do this. This is the geniuses of both political parties.”C) “I’m a huge believer in the common sense and decency and judgment of what we call the common man. We were in Fairhope, Alabama, a few weeks ago for Judge Moore in an old barn with a sawdust floor. And I said at the time, I would take the first 100 people that came to that rally than the top 100 partners at Goldman Sachs. I want to reiterate that I would take the top 100 to form our foreign policy than the first 100 at [the World Economic Forum in] Davos.”Senator Jeff Flake (age 54) is an Arizona Republican who served in the House of Representatives and was then elected to the United States Senate. He plans to retire from the Senate in 2018 rather than seek reelection. Flake is author of Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle. The quotes are taken from a speech to the United States Senate where he explained why he was not running for reelection.A) “Nine months of this administration is enough for us to stop pretending that this is somehow normal, and that we are on the verge of some sort of pivot to governing, to stability. Nine months is more than enough for us to say, loudly and clearly: Enough... We can no longer remain silent, merely observing this train wreck, passively, as if waiting for someone else to do something. The longer we wait, the greater the damage, the harsher the judgment of history.”B) “How many more disgraceful public feuds with Gold Star families can we witness in silence before we ourselves are disgraced? How many more times will we see moral ambiguity in the face of shocking bigotry and shrug it off? How many more childish insults do we need to see hurled at a hostile foreign power before we acknowledge the senseless danger of it?”C) “I have been so worried about the state of our disunion that I recently wrote a book called ‘Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.’ I meant for the book to be a defense of principle at a time when principle is in a state of collapse. In it, I traced the transformation of my party from a party of ideas to a party in thrall to a charismatic figure peddling empty populist slogans.”Questions to Consider1) Steve Bannon admires Donald Trump’s combative style and populists appeal? Do you agree with his description of President Trump? Explain. In your opinion, are these good qualities for a President? Explain.2) Jeff Flake describes the Trump Presidency as a “train wreck” and calls on people of goodwill to no longer remain silent. Do you agree with his concerns about the present and future of the United States? Explain.Summary Question: Has Donald Trump unleashed a populist revolution that will restore the United States to prosperity and world leadership, or, are Donald Trump and his followers threats to constitutional government and global stability?

There’s the bronze Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia; the Roger Taney effigy outside the Maryland State House; the Confederate soldier in front of North Carolina’s Durham County Courthouse. This historical regret has inspired a rush to topple sculptures. But the feelings of remorse and shame have also stirred impassioned debate about the ways in which art ought to reflect America’s complex legacy: Who should embody the values of today? What distinguishes art from political propaganda? And which artists will fill the empty plinths?Princeton University has one answer to these questions with a new public-art project that confronts the school’s participation in the nation’s early sins. On Monday, the university unveiled Impressions of Liberty, by the African American artist Titus Kaphar. The sculpture is the conceptual core of a campus-wide initiative that begins this fall and aims to reconcile the university’s ties to slavery. The Princeton and Slavery Project’s website has released hundreds of articles and primary documents about slavery and racism at Princeton, which was once jokingly described as the “northernmost outpost of Southern culture.” There is perhaps no better-suited artist than Kaphar to help the school grapple with past inequities and consider the stains of its founders. His art concentrates on the way history is remembered, highlighting the figures and inconveniences, as one 2009 Art in America review described it, who are “habitually … written out of grand historical narratives.”Princeton is hardly the first college to reckon with the racial injustice that defined its founding, and to seek a kind of rhetorical cleansing. Georgetown, for example, announced last year that it would grant admissions preference to descendants of slaves whose sale it profited from in the early 1800s. Harvard, Brown, Emory, the University of Maryland, and the University of Virginia have also acknowledged their shameful pasts, examining through more traditional academic symposiums how slavery shapes their current environment.RELATED: How Money From Slave Trading Helped Start Columbia UniversityBut Princeton’s decision to deploy art is particularly incisive. It captures the extent to which writing the country’s history is as much an emotional process as it is a practical and cerebral one, particularly at a time when issues of historical record are far from settled. This fall, Princeton may begin confronting the wrongs of a relatively small bucolic campus. But the university presents a case study for better understanding the role contemporary art will play in how America confronts its legacy of slavery and discrimination.Like many American institutions, Princeton shares a raw paradox with its nation: From the start, liberty and oppression were inseparable. Over the last four years, Martha Sandweiss, a Princeton history professor, has mined university and local archives to get a complete picture of the school’s links to slavery. Her research forms the basis of the Slavery Project. On the one hand, according to records, Princeton was a bastion of liberty, educating numerous Revolutionary War leaders and in 1783 hosting the Continental Congress, a pivotal moment in the country’s struggle for freedom and newfound independence. At the same time, Sandweiss found that the institution’s first nine presidents all owned slaves at some point, as did the school’s early trustees. She also discovered that the school enrolled a significant number of anti-abolitionist, Southern students during its early years; an alumni delivered a pro-slavery address at the school’s 1850 commencement ceremony.For the next month, Kaphar’s sculpture will occupy the lawn of Maclean House — the former home of university presidents, including Reverend Samuel Finley, who enslaved people there until his 1766 death. “Art is a language,” Kaphar told me during our first interview in his studio. “There is always a narrative coded in painting and sculpture. When you look at something, ask yourself, who is represented and who is invisible?” Impressions of Liberty, he said, is a direct response to the university’s findings that Finley’s slaves were auctioned at Maclean House. His artwork inverts the mythical hero-figure of a founding father — typical of public monuments — and the human beings Finley enslaved on campus. As with much of his art, Kaphar’s goal is to upend Old Master painting techniques to expose how images endure and shape the country’s idea of truths. RELATED: UVA’s Troubling PastThis summer, I accompanied him on a visit to the Yale University Art Gallery, where we stood before one of his depictions of George Washington (now in Yale’s collection). This three-dimensional painting may be Kaphar’s most aesthetically compelling work yet to challenge ideals in art and U.S. history. Shadows of Libertyemploys a Colonial art tradition — an oil painting of a political leader on his proverbial white horse — but masks Washington with cascading fragments of his slave records and, in a nod to the symbolism associated with African power figures, rusty nails. Kaphar explained how Yale’s classic portraits, by the likes of John Trumbull and Thomas Eakins, inspired his reconsideration as a graduate art student of Washington the patriot and Washington the slave owner. The strips nailed to Washington, according to Pamela Franks, the gallery’s contemporary-art curator, open “new ways of understanding American history” for its museum visitors.In a similar vein, the piece Kaphar has sculpted for Princeton features layered photographs, etched in glass, of Finley and black actors dressed in period costumes to represent the slaves the former university president held in his campus residence. Kaphar created a composite bust in negative relief of Finley, coating it with graphite and encasing it in Sycamore wood to echo the campus’s “liberty trees” nearby, which were, according to Princeton legend, planted to commemorate the repeal of the Stamp Act.“There are no Gods among us. I’m trying to tell the story of America without demonizing or deifying our forefathers,” Kaphar told me over phone in September, weeks after white supremacists converged in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue. His aim, Kaphar explained, is to create an experience akin to that of a manual-focus camera, that now-anachronistic device in which perspectives slide in and out of view. Kaphar does not want his work “to erase history,” but rather to ask viewers to contend with competing images in the foreground and the background — something the eye and brain struggle to do.RELATED: What Ole Miss Can Teach Universities About Grappling With Their Pasts“There’s so much power that happens,” Kaphar said, “when we shift our focus or our gaze — just slightly, momentarily — and confront the unspoken truth.” Asked to describe his reason for back-illuminating Finley’s carved-out bust, he explained, “I’m trying to create a literal space for anyone who passes this sculpture to begin thinking about iconic leaders in history, how glorified images of the past affect the world we live in today.” For generations, slave-owning Christians — including Princeton’s founders — used religious ideas to justify a horrific national practice, he noted; Finley is holding a bible in Impressions of Liberty. But, Kaphar added, “art should never tell anyone what conversation to have. It’s not a didactic sculpture. I want people to sit with the idea that Finley doesn’t represent good or bad.” The sculpture alone is a bold, exquisite way to visually confront what research has revealed about the school’s roots in slavery. But Princeton University is spreading the mission across various pieces of art through a show this fall entitled “Making History Visible: Of American Myths And National Heroes.” At the exhibit’s entrance, viewers begin with Kaphar’s piece Monumental Inversion: George Washington—a sculpture of the leader astride his horse, made out of wood, blown glass, and steel. The sculpture depicts the former president’s dueling nature: He’s glorified within a great American equestrian monument but he’s also sitting astride a charred cavity, surrounded by glass on the ground. In juxtaposing Kaphar’s artwork and a George Washington plaster bust, “Making History Visible” forces visitors, hopefully, to see and feel the contradiction in colonial leaders who sought freedom from tyranny but did not extend that ideal to slaves. It’s a strong lesson for any college in how a painstakingly curated exhibit can, hopefully, prompt questions about the ways society ought to remember the past, and how those decisions affect the way students understand historic truths today.Art is about the power of symbols, according to James Steward, the museum’s director. “The conversation we are having now about monuments and their visual power are about so many of the same issues in this exhibition,” he said when asked about the country’s removed statues. “Part of our job and what Titus does is to make the past visceral.” Some museum visitors, Steward admits, have had a strong, negative response to Monumental Inversion — which he respects, at least, as an opportunity to open a dialogue.Like anybody else, students become inured to historical names and concepts taught in the same, conventional classroom ways or frameworks, according to Bradford Vivian, the author of Commonplace Witnessing: Rhetorical Invention, Historical Remembrance, and Public Culture. A professor of communication arts and sciences at Pennsylvania State University, he described why art can provoke, in an individual, forms of reflection, interpretation, and even feeling that she hasn’t before experienced.Kaphar describes his mission as an attempt to amend history through contemporary art. But not every such effort has succeeded. In 2011, the New York-based artist Fred Wilson met impassioned outcry — from people of all races — for his now-abandoned E Pluribus Unum public-art proposal. Invited by the Central Indiana Community Foundation to create a sculpture for the “Indianapolis Cultural Trail,” Wilson’s design reimagined the only monument in the city’s downtown depicting a black person as a new statue. The design replicated the black man, replacing his manacles with a multicolored flag, and rendering him in an elevated, assertive posture on a plinth of his own; it was to be erected blocks from the original. But local groups didn’t want an artist to critique the city’s visual history with a new sculpture near their old one; a letter published in the Indianapolis Recorder, for example, called for the art to honor one of the city’s prominent black business owners.The University of California, Los Angeles, architecture professor Dell Upton, who wrote the book What Can And Can’t Be Said, has been researching monument building in the contemporary South. He cautions that the impact of Princeton’s art will prove tremendously limited if it can’t show students the vast economic tentacles between past and present. Upton pointed to Hans Haacke’s famous 1971 project, which used photographs and charts to illustrate power structures and financial entanglement in New York real estate as an example of some of the city’s most dubious landlords. Princeton’s racist history enabled it to provide social and political benefits for alumni—an advantage that students will continue to enjoy well into the future.When Impressions of Liberty is removed from Maclean House in December and enters Princeton’s permanent museum collection, its greatest achievement may lie in the realization that no apology or recompense can ever suffice. But the potential of teaching through art is that there is also a central emotional component, an ingredient that can be missing from more standard ways of learning about one’s predecessors. “Each history deserves disruption,” the Chicago-based artist and founder of the Rebuild Foundation Theaster Gates told me, “but atoning for something is very different from grappling with it.”I asked Gates in October about the extent to which art can reconcile with the past. His 2011 sculpture In Case of Race Riot IIwas recently on view as part of the Brooklyn Museum’s “The Legacy of Lynching”—an attempt to spark “an honest conversation” about racial injustice in America today. In Case of Race Riot II is simplistically haunting art, a wood and metal box housing a coiled fire hose, alluding to the high-pressure water hoses police used on peaceful African American demonstrators in 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama.“People receive information and empathy in different ways,” he explained. “No civil-rights project can ever fully redeem anything. But when we stumble upon a piece of artwork—in a museum or anywhere else we find it—we might lean in and see better through a visual language. And that language might create a bridge to understanding.” This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: A Catfishing With a Happy Ending, Death at a Penn State Fraternity"

Carbon-poor soil, however, produces lower crop yields, less forage, and less biodiversity.Carbon farming is a way of restoring these soils to health and simultaneously benefiting the climate. Ranchers and scientists working together in Northern California to establish carbon farming and scale it up believe it has amazing potential to remove millions of tons of carbon from the air in California and billions worldwide.At the helm of the surge in carbon farming activity is the Marin Carbon Project—an ambitious consortium of agricultural institutions, ranchers, farmers, researchers, government agencies, and nonprofits based in Point Reyes, California.Over the past decade, the project has initiated more than $15 million worth of field and laboratory research and demonstration projects that have conclusively linked restorative land management practices with increases in durable soil carbon. These findings have proven instrumental in influencing state agricultural policies in favor of carbon-farming.The project also assembled a statewide coalition of agricultural stakeholders that successfully launched a statewide Healthy Soils Initiative adopted in 2015. State agencies and departments are now collaborating to promote the development of healthy, carbon-rich soils on California farms and ranch lands.Farmers and ranchers around the state are also signing up to adopt carbon farm plans patterned on the Marin Carbon Project’s pioneering work. Participants who embrace the program are part of a new agricultural movement that aims to improve the soil, provide healthy food to consumers, and help stabilize the climate. They can earn tradable California Environmental Quality Act carbon offset credits for the extra carbon that builds up in the soil thanks to their efforts.Carbon farmers enjoy various important on-farm benefits, such as greater forage production that in turn increases livestock production and raises revenues. While the carbon offsets today only bring ranchers and farmers $10 a tonne—too low in itself to make carbon farming profitable—the price will likely rise over time as the state tightens its carbon emissions cap to meet its emission reduction goals.John Wick is co-founder of the Marin Carbon Project and owns the Nicasio Native Grass Ranch. In addition to influencing state policies, Wick’s multi-year lobbying efforts have also culminated in four new California environmental laws that promote carbon farming through regulation of solid wastes, agricultural soil, organic waste, and short-lived climate pollutants, like methane from manure.The carbon farming planning process is currently being taken into the field statewide thanks to cooperation with county Resource Conservation Districts and land trusts. If all goes according to plan, farmers applying for U.S. Department of Agriculture range land subsidies may soon be able to receive funds to defray some of the costs of carbon farming.Among the breakthrough carbon farming research findings that the Marin Carbon Project has been popularizing are several new discoveries. By spreading about a half an inch of dry organic compost in controlled experiments on research plots, Wick and his colleagues found that this natural fertilizer, containing carbon and nitrogen compounds, actually increased the soil’s capacity to capture and hold more carbon. In fact, each 2.5 acres of treated land gained a ton of durable soil carbon that can remain remain locked in the soil for 30 to 100 years, without returning to the atmosphere.The researchers were amazed to see that in each year following that single compost application—the soil gained an additional ton every year during a subsequent four-year study period. The initial compost application had jump started the soil’s microbial community and energized the plants.Plants on the ranch became more robust. Forage yields increased by 50 percent. The larger more vigorous plants tended to be more photosynthetically active, pulling more carbon out of the air. It was, said Wick, “a virtuous cycle.”Adding compost to the soil is just one of several restorative techniques that have been scientifically demonstrated to increase soil carbon. Others include planting cover crops, reducing tillage, leaving crop residues on the land, and managed grazing. Many farmers in the U.S. are already using these carbon-friendly techniques.If carbon farming were widely adopted across U.S. and global range lands, it could help shift the world’s atmosphere toward its pre-industrial composition, with profound climate benefits.California alone has 23 million acres of grassland. By some estimates, global crop and grazing lands cover 9 billion acres. If a tonne of carbon could be stored annually on even a few percent of this land area reasoned Wick and his colleagues, billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide might ultimately be taken out of the world’s atmosphere.The Marin Carbon Project has now been able to create carbon farming planning projects in 33 state Resource Conservation Districts from Northern to Southern California. “In three years, we took a working model, and we scaled up to the state,” Calla Rose Ostrander, Wick’s strategic adviser, reported.Where to StartThe scaling up of carbon farming starts at home, she declared in a recent talk to a daylong carbon farming workshop. “It starts with you, it starts with the people you interact with [and with] me ... it starts with your community.”“Local governments, the participation process ... citizens, governors, assemblymen, mayors, boards of supervisors,” Wick added. “This is the scale at which we can actually change the world.”“In this time when this problem [of climate change] is so overwhelming,” Ostrander added, “just know that there’s this beautiful solution, which is photosynthesis, which is everywhere around us.”John J.

Carbon-poor soil, however, produces lower crop yields, less forage, and less biodiversity.Carbon farming is a way of restoring these soils to health and simultaneously benefiting the climate. Ranchers and scientists working together in Northern California to establish carbon farming and scale it up believe it has amazing potential to remove millions of tons of carbon from the air in California and billions worldwide.At the helm of the surge in carbon farming activity is the Marin Carbon Project—an ambitious consortium of agricultural institutions, ranchers, farmers, researchers, government agencies, and nonprofits based in Point Reyes, California.Over the past decade, the project has initiated more than $15 million worth of field and laboratory research and demonstration projects that have conclusively linked restorative land management practices with increases in durable soil carbon. These findings have proven instrumental in influencing state agricultural policies in favor of carbon-farming.The project also assembled a statewide coalition of agricultural stakeholders that successfully launched a statewide Healthy Soils Initiative adopted in 2015. State agencies and departments are now collaborating to promote the development of healthy, carbon-rich soils on California farms and ranch lands.Farmers and ranchers around the state are also signing up to adopt carbon farm plans patterned on the Marin Carbon Project’s pioneering work. Participants who embrace the program are part of a new agricultural movement that aims to improve the soil, provide healthy food to consumers, and help stabilize the climate. They can earn tradable California Environmental Quality Act carbon offset credits for the extra carbon that builds up in the soil thanks to their efforts.Carbon farmers enjoy various important on-farm benefits, such as greater forage production that in turn increases livestock production and raises revenues. While the carbon offsets today only bring ranchers and farmers $10 a tonne—too low in itself to make carbon farming profitable—the price will likely rise over time as the state tightens its carbon emissions cap to meet its emission reduction goals.John Wick is co-founder of the Marin Carbon Project and owns the Nicasio Native Grass Ranch. In addition to influencing state policies, Wick’s multi-year lobbying efforts have also culminated in four new California environmental laws that promote carbon farming through regulation of solid wastes, agricultural soil, organic waste, and short-lived climate pollutants, like methane from manure.The carbon farming planning process is currently being taken into the field statewide thanks to cooperation with county Resource Conservation Districts and land trusts. If all goes according to plan, farmers applying for U.S. Department of Agriculture range land subsidies may soon be able to receive funds to defray some of the costs of carbon farming.Among the breakthrough carbon farming research findings that the Marin Carbon Project has been popularizing are several new discoveries.

That just changed.",2017-11-13,"Supporters of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam celebrate as results start to come in at Northam's election night rally on the campus of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, on Nov. 7. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0a1a361c0000c018b349c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Tuesday’s election night netted Democrats a flurry of state and local victories. As new HuffPost/YouGov polling shows, the wins also provided a much-needed morale boost for progressive activists nationwide who’d nearly forgotten what it’s like to have a jubilant election night.Progressive activism has been at a fever pitch throughout most of 2017, and supporters of Democrats have held the enthusiasm advantage over their rivals at least since this summer.But they’ve also been battered by the type of political and policy setbacks inherently faced by a party out of power in both the White House and Congress. As recently as late October, Hillary Clinton voters who’d participated in political activism were likelier than not to say they considered their activism ineffective. Many in red states expressed frustration that their voices weren’t being heard, while others in blue states fretted that they were preaching to the choir.“Compared to Trump’s voice,” wrote one 27-year-old California woman, who described herself as “burned out” after protesting, contacting her representatives and signing petitions, “my voice feels very small.”Democrats’ recent sweep (along, perhaps, with the recent indictments against several Trump campaign figures) appears to have turned those worries around. Seventy percent of Clinton voters say they followed last week’s elections at least somewhat closely. And among those who want to see Democrats retake the House next year (which is almost all of them), about three-quarters said it made them more hopeful about the chances that would happen.“There is a lot more work still to do, but as anniversaries go, this was something of a catharsis,” Brian Fallon, Clinton’s campaign spokesman, said the night of the election. Maria Urbina, the political director of the progressive group Indivisible, described the victories as evidence of “an energized, locally led and transformative force.”The results have also strengthened progressive activists’ belief in their own power. A 57 percent majority of Clinton voters who’ve engaged in activism this year now say they believe they’ve been at least somewhat effective, up 17 points since late October. The share who describe themselves as “energized” currently stands at 39 percent, up 12 percentage points. By contrast, the share of politically active Trump voters who think they’ve been effective has remained practically unchanged over the same period of time.Maintaining that sense of enthusiasm will be key heading into next year’s midterm elections ― especially since key Democratic constituencies, including younger Americans and people of color, often tend to turn out less strongly in non-presidential elections. Clinton voters who think their actions have been effective are 35 points likelier than those who don’t to say they’re at least somewhat likely to donate money to a party or candidate in next year’s election, and 33 points likelier to say they’re at least somewhat likely to volunteer. They’re also 20 points likelier to believe that Democrats will retake the House of Representatives in the next election.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Maria Urbina was the director of Indivisible.

The Philippine leader sang a Filipino love song “upon the orders of the commander-in-chief of the United States.”“The show last night, the talent at that show ― I assume mostly from the Philippines ― was fantastic,” Trump continued. “And you were fantastic, also, very much, from the Philippines.”Trump didn’t take questions from journalists following his remarks, but during a bilateral meeting he referred to his trip as “very successful” and lauded his “great relationship” with Duterte. When reporters tried to press the leaders on whether the subject of human rights came up, Duterte ― who has been accused of crimes against humanity― shot them down. “Whoa, whoa,” he said. “This not a press statement. This is the bilateral meeting.”He added: “We will be discussing matters that are of interest to both the Philippines” and the U.S., and, referring to the reporters, “with you around, guys, you are the spies.”Trump laughed in response. In a sharp break from his predecessors, he had also last week declined to take questions from reporters during a joint news conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping ― a decision that was made, the White House said, “at the Chinese insistence.”White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Monday that human rights “briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs.” Duterte’s spokesperson denied that the issue was raised. Last week, the Philippine president had also said that he planned to tell Trump to “lay off” if the president were to press him on the subject. Human rights advocacy groups said they weren’t surprised the issue of human rights wasn’t central to the meeting agenda.“Trump has a well-documented affinity for strongman leaders who abuse the rights of their people and he has, over the months, expressed and made several references to how he supports what Duterte is doing in the Philippines,” said Phelim Kine, deputy director for Human Rights Watch in Asia.Duterte is accused of ordering thousands of extrajudicial killings, both as president and as the mayor of the city of Davao, as part of his war on drugs. He labeled himself “the butcher” earlier this year.Trump told him he was doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem” during a call in April.The meeting between the two leaders comes just days after Duterte bragged to reporters that he had stabbed someone to death when he was 16 ― a comment his spokesman said was made “in jest.”Former president Barack Obama had planned to address the violence during a planned meeting last year during his last months in office, but after Duterte called him a “son of a whore,” the event was called off.This article has been updated to include a comment from Phelim Kine of Human Rights Watch in Asia."

Muhammad’s Shero doll will hit stores in 2018. “I can’t believe this is happening honestly,” Muhammad told HuffPost. “It’s a pinch me moment.” Muhammad first made headlines during the 2016 Summer Olympics when she became the first Muslim-American woman to wear a hijab while competing for the United States. She was also the first female, Muslim-American athlete to win a medal at the Olympics, bringing home the bronze for sabre fencing.  “Barbie is celebrating Ibtihaj not only for her accolades as an Olympian, but for embracing what makes her stand out,” Vice President of Global Marketing for Barbie Sejal Shah Miller said in a press release. “Ibtihaj is an inspiration to countless girls who never saw themselves represented, and by honoring her story, we hope this doll reminds them that they can be and do anything.”Muhammad told HuffPost that this moment is surreal for her since Barbie was such a big part of her life growing up. “My mom made efforts when I was a kid to bring dolls into the house that were only dolls of color,” she said. “So I only had brown Barbie dolls growing up and I think that was an effort made by my parents to see us reflected in the dolls we played with. It’s revolutionary to make all kids ― no matter your skin color, your gender, your ethnicity, your religious beliefs ― feel included.”The 31-year-old added that she’s humbled to be in the company of the famous women in Barbie’s Shero line. “It’s a very humbling experience to even be in the same sentence with these women,” she said. “I feel very proud and good about working with a brand that honors not just powerful women and women of color, but also a brand that honors women who are working to impact the global community, not just today but also in the future.”Scroll below to see photos of Muhammad’s Shero Barbie.

The particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases and other ailments. Hospitals in the capital have seen a spike in the number of patients coming in with respiratory complaints, according to media reports.“Every second we are damaging our lungs, but we cannot stop breathing,” said Arvind Kumar, the head of the chest and lung surgery department at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital in the city.United Airlines said it had resumed flights from Newark, New Jersey to New Delhi, India on Sunday, after suspending the service temporarily over concerns about poor air quality in the Indian capital.State and federal governments decided to reopen schools on Monday after closing them temporarily for a few days last week. The move, however, is likely to add more vehicles on the road. Enforcement agencies said they were also unable to impose a blanket ban on movement of commercial trucks.Aarti Menon, a teacher at a primary school in New Delhi, said her family was wearing mask even when they were indoors during the weekend.“Not everyone can afford an air purifier or air-conditioned car. We are all living in hell,” said Menon, a mother of two teenage daughters.The National Green Tribunal, an environment court, has directed the Delhi government and neighboring states to stop farmers from burning crop residue. But the federal and state governments have not been able to do so yet.A New Delhi-based non-governmental organization, TARA Homes for Children, which supports 60 poor children, said it was seeking donations to buy at least five air purifiers. “Some of the children have breathing issues and couldn’t go to school,” said a volunteer at the NGO."

Two former policemen alleged earlier this year that Duterte, while mayor of Davao City in 2003, paid tens of thousands of dollars to have radio broadcaster Juan Pala murdered. Duterte denied the accusations.Trump and Duterte met Monday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, which is being held in the Philippine capital of Manila. It was the first in-person meeting between the two leaders.“We will be discussing matters that are of interest to both the Philippines and [the U.S.] ... with you around, guys, you are the spies,” Duterte said to reporters on Monday, according to the White House pool report.Trump laughed in response. Although Duterte referred to Trump as a “bigot” last year and holds a longstanding personal grudge against the United States, the two leaders have had a fairly warm relationship since Trump took office. Trump told Duterte during a phone call in April that he had heard the leader was doing “an unbelievable job on the drug problem.”Journalists in the Philippines, on the other hand, have been critical of the abuses in Duterte’s drug war and have been key in exposing the reality of its rampant extrajudicial killings. Philippine media outlets helped bring international attention to the drug war by publishing photos of bodies laying in the streets of Manila, their heads wrapped in packing tape, and of mourners gripping their dead loved ones.Philippine media also plays a crucial role in holding Duterte’s administration responsible as the president targets opposition figures and guts funding for organizations that provide checks on his actions. Earlier this year, the government reduced funding for the country’s Commission on Human Rights from about $15 million to just $20. After a public outcry, lawmakers decided to set the commission’s funding at $12.2 million.Duterte did order a new task force in October 2016 to prevent killings targeting the media, but human rights groups say that it has taken little action. Four journalists have been killed in the Philippines since Duterte took office, and the country ranks fifth on the Committee to Protect Journalists’ list of nations where journalists are killed with impunity.“Just because you are a journalist, you are not exempted from assassination if you’re a son of a bitch,” Duterte said in June 2016. Duterte using the word “spies” to describe journalists is also notable, as repressive governments often accuse reporters of espionage as an excuse to crack down on press freedom.After Trump laughed at Duterte’s remark, journalist Sulome Anderson tweeted about how Hezbollah kidnappers tortured her father, Terry Anderson, and accused him of being a spy while he worked for the Associated Press. The White House said Trump brought up human rights issues related to the Philippine drug war during his meeting with Duterte, but the Philippine president’s spokesperson said no such interaction took place. Former President Barack Obama had a much more strained relationship with the Philippines’ leader. Duterte railed against Obama’s criticism of the drug war, calling him a “son of a whore” and telling him to “go to hell.” The incident prompted Obama to cancel a meeting with Duterte."

Shown here, Rabi Island in Fiji. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0a0a921b00001700376dca.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Robert GlasserThe Kyoto Protocol was adopted 20 years ago and since then we have seen an explosion of extreme weather events which have cost many lives and made the struggle to end poverty more challenging than it otherwise needs to be.About 90 percent of recorded major disasters are now weather and climate related. Extreme weather has played a role in the first rise in 10 years in the numbers of people who go hungry every day.In 2016, the numbers of people suffering from food insecurity rose from 777 million to 815 million or 11 percent of the global population.Problems of acute food insecurity and malnutrition tend to be magnified where natural hazards such as droughts and floods compound the consequence of conflicts. The challenge of addressing this critical issue is underlined by the fact that 20 countries have declared drought emergencies in the last 18 months.Over the last two years, the food security situation has visibly worsened in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South Eastern and Western Asia linked in part to the El Niño phenomenon and climate-related shocks.Since the first attempt to establish an internationally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, under the Kyoto Protocol, those emissions have continued to rise and new records have piled up in terms of hottest years on record, Arctic ice melt, most intense storms to make landfall and widespread droughts.Over the last two years more people were displaced in their own countries by weather events than by conflict, over 40 million.Low and middle income countries are struggling with the quality of the air they breathe and the water they drink. Latest estimates are that pollution is responsible for 9 million premature deaths worldwide, or one in six of all deaths.Fossil fuel consumption has now joined the traditional drivers of disaster risk such as poverty, inappropriate land use, weak building codes, the disappearance of protective ecosystems and lax governance, as drivers of preventable loss of life, displacement and loss of livelihoods.It is a cliché to say that we are in the last chance saloon as the world meets in Bonn for the COP23 climate conference but if the calamitous and unprecedented chain of extreme weather events witnessed over the last year, does not provide impetus for change then one dreads to think what will.The eighth edition of the UN Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report warns that even full implementation of current national pledges makes a temperature rise of at least three degrees Celsius by 2100 very likely.The expectation among the most vulnerable to climate change, represented by the 47 member Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, is that they will leave Bonn with a draft negotiating text for the Paris Agreement work programme which will be finalized in the coming year.The LDC Group are pushing for greater ambition in reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that global warming does not exceed two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and, ideally, is kept below 1.5 degrees.They have called for robust frameworks for reporting, implementation and compliance, and more financial support given that they “face the unique and unprecedented challenge of lifting people out of poverty and achieving sustainable development without relying on fossil fuels.”Reducing emissions now is essential to global efforts to reduce existing levels of disaster risk and to avoid the creation of new risk, often of an unforeseen nature given how much climate change impacts are uncharted territory.The world has experienced many successes in reducing loss of life from extreme weather events and UN Member States committed to substantial reductions in the numbers of people affected by disasters and economic losses when they adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction two years ago.Advances that are being made in risk governance, early warning systems, better disaster preparedness and response, could be overwhelmed if we do not fill the “ambition gap” by increasing significantly existing pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stepping up financial commitments.None of the world’s leading industrial powers are doing nearly enough, let’s hope COP23 provides some impetus to correct this.Robert Glasser is the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction and head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction"

How is this guy about to become a federal judge?",2017-11-13,"Here's Brett Talley posing for a portrait in a cemetery. In addition to being nominated to a lifetime court seat for some reason, he writes horror stories.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a09df1c1b00004800376d06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― One of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees didn’t tell the Senate about a major conflict of interest in his bid to become a lifetime federal judge: his wife is chief of staff to White House counsel Don McGahn, who oversees the president’s judicial nominations.As first reported by The New York Times, Brett Talley, a nominee to an Alabama district court seat, did not disclose in his questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he’s married to Ann Donaldson, McGahn’s top aide.The questionnaire specifically asks Talley, 36, to identify family members who are “likely to present potential conflicts of interest.” He did not identify his wife.Neither Talley nor the White House returned a request for comment. Talley, who is currently a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, has already sparked controversy with his nomination. He has only practiced law for three years. He has never tried a case in court. And he was deemed “not qualified” to be a judge by the American Bar Association, making him Trump’s fourth judicial nominee to earn the rare and abysmal rating by the nation’s top legal organization.Christopher Kang, who oversaw the selection and vetting of President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees for more than four years, said the “insanity” of Talley’s nomination extends to his job at the Justice Department, where he vets judicial nominees and helps them with their nomination paperwork.“It is literally his job to help nominees fill out these forms honestly and completely,” Kang told HuffPost. “If this is how he approached his own nomination, what is he advising everyone else?”Before he was a judicial nominee, Talley also made his political positions clear. In tweets that have since been made private, he said “Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet” and that she belonged in jail. A month after the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, he wrote a blog post titled “A Call to Arms: It’s Time to Join the National Rifle Association.”None of these details stopped the Senate Judiciary Committee from advancing Talley’s nomination last week. All Democrats voted against his nomination.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, said Monday that the Senate shouldn’t hold Talley’s confirmation vote unless he explains why he didn’t tell them about his wife’s role in the White House. She noted that Donaldson is also a witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.“Judicial nominees are required to disclose potential conflicts of interest‎,” Feinstein said in a statement. “Talley’s nomination shouldn’t be considered by the Senate unless he answers questions about this glaring omission and clarifies matters concerning when he would recuse himself.”Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the committee, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he is having second thoughts about supporting Talley given his failure to disclose his wife’s job to the committee.Alabama Sens. Richard Shelby (R) and Luther Strange (R) recommended Talley’s nomination to Trump. Strange said he stands by Talley.“Brett Talley’s record reflects a nominee well-equipped to serve on the federal bench, and he has my full confidence and endorsement,” Strange said in a statement. “As my Deputy Solicitor General in Alabama, he applied his reverence for the Constitution and the rule of law to crucial cases, arguing multiple times before 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and building a reputation for professionalism.”Shelby did not respond to a request for comment.Talley is on track to get his Senate confirmation vote as soon as this month.UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. ET ― White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave no signs that the president is backing off of Talley’s nomination.“Mr. Talley served as Deputy Solicitor General for the state of Alabama, currently serves in the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Policy and was recommended by Alabama’s U.S. Senators,” Sanders said in a statement. “He is more than qualified to serve in the federal judiciary.”Another White House spokesman, who requested to speak anonymously, emphasized that Donaldson “is not involved in this judicial selection or other judicial nominations. The men and women the president nominates should be judged on their own merits.”"

The former vice president appeared at Glamour’s Women of the Year summit in New York with his wife, Jill Biden. After the discussion, BuzzFeed’s lifestyle editor, Rachel Miller, stood up with a question for him. “In the context of changing the culture and women being brave enough to come forward, I’m wondering if there’s anything that you would do differently with regards to Anita Hill, if given the opportunity?” Miller asked.Biden, who long has been an outspoken advocate for women, has been criticized for how he handled Hill when she testified against Thomas to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991. Many people believe Biden didn’t do enough to stand by Hill or shield her from attacks when she accused Thomas of sexual harassment. “Let’s get something straight here, I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas,” he responded to Miller. “The only issue in the Anita Hill case was whether or not there could be information submitted in a record without a name attached to it, anonymously accusing someone of something,” he said, referring to criticisms that he didn’t encourage more women to testify against Thomas. Biden added that he is “confident” that Thomas sexually harassed Hill. “Anita Hill was victimized. There is no question in my mind and every single solitary person on that committee who believed her voted ‘no’” on Thomas’ confirmation, he said.The committee reported Thomas’ nomination to the Senate floor without a recommendation, and he was narrowly confirmed on a 52-48 vote. “What I do feel badly about is the bad taste that got left in the mouth of some of the people around Anita Hill, and maybe even Anita, about whether or not the witnesses should have been called who were called and weren’t called, etc,” Biden said Monday.Glamour’s editor-in-chief, Cindi Leive, who was moderating the discussion, added a follow-up question: “Professor Hill has said herself that she expected a fair process and did not feel that she had one. Given your leadership on these kinds of issues, do you have any message to her now?”Said Biden: “The message I’ve delivered before is I am so sorry if she believes that,” he said “I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through. Think of the courage that it took for her to come forward.”"

Customs and Border Protection confirmed arresting a DACA recipient, and said it was “in the course of a human smuggling investigation.” The recipient’s “status will be reviewed at an immigration hearing,” Border Patrol Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez said in a statement.Amy Fischer, the policy director of RAICES, which is assisting with Abonza-Lopez’s case, said he was not smuggling and has not been charged with anything. “If CBP is trying to criminalize DACA recipients with mixed status families for driving in a car with their undocumented family members, that is wholly unjust,” she said in an email. Abonza-Lopez is one of nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants, often called Dreamers, who held two-year work permits under the DACA program. Those permits and the deportation protections that come with them are supposed to still apply, even though Trump rescinded the program in early September. The president tweeted at the time that people with DACA “have nothing to worry about” — something immigrant rights advocates say is not the case.“We know that ICE will try to detain and deport people who have DACA so long as no one is paying attention to it,” Fischer said.Abonza-Lopez, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 5, had a DACA permit that was set to expire in May 2019, so he should still be protected, Fischer said. It’s possible to lose DACA status for certain crimes or for gang activity, but Abonza-Lopez has no criminal record and his status had not been revoked, she said Monday. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Thursday that it revoked Abonza-Lopez’s DACA protections on Oct. 12, the same day he was picked up by Border Patrol. DACA is automatically terminated for individuals who are issued a “notice to appear,” which means immigration proceedings against them have been opened in court, USCIS said in a statement.Fischer said that neither Abonza-Lopez nor his attorney had received any written notice that his DACA was revoked ― they learned about it in the press this week, more than a month after USCIS says it happened. Abonza-Lopez was shown his “notice to appear” document for the first time a few days ago, but did not receive a copy, and his attorney has not seen one, Fischer said. He has not been charged with a crime, according to Customs and Border Protection.“If the DACA was indeed revoked on the 12th, that would have been a revocation based upon an investigation,” Fischer said Thursday, “meaning that before getting any information, they tried to revoke someone’s DACA.”Customs and Border Protection said in a statement on Monday that the Uvalde County Sheriff’s Office asked Border Patrol for assistance after a citizen reported a suspicious vehicle on Oct. 12. The people in the car were then picked up by Border Patrol and later transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Agents determined that two people in the car had been previously deported and reinstated their orders of removal. They charged an additional person with illegal entry. The other two individuals included a DACA recipient ― presumably, Abonza-Lopez. Abonza-Lopez, who has a prosthetic leg, is now being detained at the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall, Texas. He has struggled with pain in one of his legs, which was amputated when he was a child. He wrote in a Nov. 11 letter that when he went to the medical clinic to ask for help, the medical worker and a guard joked about his leg in English, acting as if he did not understand.The guard said, “You can put a broomstick in his leg and he can use [it to] sweep,” Abonza-Lopez wrote.The clinic worker gave him a pill for his pain but said they couldn’t do anything else, he said. Abonza-Lopez wrote that he is still suffering from pain, but hasn’t gone back because of the bullying from the workers. He is also afraid that someone will steal his leg when he takes it off to sleep, he said.“Please get me out of here,” he wrote. “I do not deserve to be treated so inhumanely.”ICE confirmed on Thursday that Abonza-Lopez is in custody, and said the agency’s Health Service Corps “ensures aliens in ICE custody receive proper medical care.” (ICE also stated that Abonza-Lopez was detained Oct. 11. Both CBP and RAICES have said the arrest was on Oct. 12.) It is rare for DACA recipients to be detained, but advocates say there has been an uptick in detentions under Trump, who also said he would give immigration agents far greater latitude to determine who to detain than former President Barack Obama did.Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan said in June that all undocumented immigrants “should look over [their] shoulder, and... need to be worried,” although he and other officials have said DACA is still in effect for those who have it. In September, Border Patrol detained as many as 10 DACA recipients for hours when they went through a checkpoint about 70 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border before finally releasing them. There have been a handful of other instances in Texas of DACA holders being detained and then released after public pressure, Fischer said.Dreamers are already losing protections based on Trump’s decision to end DACA, but many more will after March 6, which marks six months after the program was rescinded. Trump and members of Congress have said they want to create a more permanent solution for Dreamers by then, but only a relatively small number of Republicans have signed on to legislation that would allow those young people to gain legal status.Until they gain permanent status, Dreamers will remain at risk of being detained and deported.Abonza-Lopez’s case “really highlights the urgency for Congress to act and come up with a solution,” Fischer said.This article was updated Thursday with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ statement about Abonza-Lopez’s DACA status, a response from his advocate and a comment from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Read Abonza-Lopez’s letter below."

But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Thursday that it revoked Abonza-Lopez’s DACA protections on Oct. 12, the same day he was picked up by Border Patrol. DACA is automatically terminated for individuals who are issued a “notice to appear,” which means immigration proceedings against them have been opened in court, USCIS said in a statement.Fischer said that neither Abonza-Lopez nor his attorney had received any written notice that his DACA was revoked ― they learned about it in the press this week, more than a month after USCIS says it happened. Abonza-Lopez was shown his “notice to appear” document for the first time a few days ago, but did not receive a copy, and his attorney has not seen one, Fischer said. He has not been charged with a crime, according to Customs and Border Protection.“If the DACA was indeed revoked on the 12th, that would have been a revocation based upon an investigation,” Fischer said Thursday, “meaning that before getting any information, they tried to revoke someone’s DACA.”Customs and Border Protection said in a statement on Monday that the Uvalde County Sheriff’s Office asked Border Patrol for assistance after a citizen reported a suspicious vehicle on Oct. 12. The people in the car were then picked up by Border Patrol and later transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Agents determined that two people in the car had been previously deported and reinstated their orders of removal. They charged an additional person with illegal entry. The other two individuals included a DACA recipient ― presumably, Abonza-Lopez. Abonza-Lopez, who has a prosthetic leg, is now being detained at the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall, Texas. He has struggled with pain in one of his legs, which was amputated when he was a child. He wrote in a Nov. 11 letter that when he went to the medical clinic to ask for help, the medical worker and a guard joked about his leg in English, acting as if he did not understand.The guard said, “You can put a broomstick in his leg and he can use [it to] sweep,” Abonza-Lopez wrote.The clinic worker gave him a pill for his pain but said they couldn’t do anything else, he said. Abonza-Lopez wrote that he is still suffering from pain, but hasn’t gone back because of the bullying from the workers. He is also afraid that someone will steal his leg when he takes it off to sleep, he said.“Please get me out of here,” he wrote. “I do not deserve to be treated so inhumanely.”ICE confirmed on Thursday that Abonza-Lopez is in custody, and said the agency’s Health Service Corps “ensures aliens in ICE custody receive proper medical care.” (ICE also stated that Abonza-Lopez was detained Oct. 11. Both CBP and RAICES have said the arrest was on Oct. 12.) It is rare for DACA recipients to be detained, but advocates say there has been an uptick in detentions under Trump, who also said he would give immigration agents far greater latitude to determine who to detain than former President Barack Obama did.Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan said in June that all undocumented immigrants “should look over [their] shoulder, and... need to be worried,” although he and other officials have said DACA is still in effect for those who have it. In September, Border Patrol detained as many as 10 DACA recipients for hours when they went through a checkpoint about 70 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border before finally releasing them. There have been a handful of other instances in Texas of DACA holders being detained and then released after public pressure, Fischer said.Dreamers are already losing protections based on Trump’s decision to end DACA, but many more will after March 6, which marks six months after the program was rescinded. Trump and members of Congress have said they want to create a more permanent solution for Dreamers by then, but only a relatively small number of Republicans have signed on to legislation that would allow those young people to gain legal status.Until they gain permanent status, Dreamers will remain at risk of being detained and deported.Abonza-Lopez’s case “really highlights the urgency for Congress to act and come up with a solution,” Fischer said.This article was updated Thursday with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ statement about Abonza-Lopez’s DACA status, a response from his advocate and a comment from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Read Abonza-Lopez’s letter below."

It is my connection with him,” Biden said.Joseph “Beau” Biden III died at the age of 46 after a two-year battle with brain cancer. The younger Biden had served as Delaware’s attorney general from 2007 to 2015 and had planed to run for governor of Delaware in 2016.Biden recounted that his son Hunter had purchased the rosary beads at Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. “We all wore them,” Biden said.“I am a practicing Catholic. Beau was a devout Catholic as well,” Biden told host Megyn Kelly. “Both of us found solace in the elements of the church. It is almost like meditation for us.”Biden has spoken about his Catholicism in the past, often emphasizing his belief that all religions share a common faith.“It’s not about religion, per se,” he said of his decision to wear his son’s rosary beads. “It’s about the connection. It makes me feel good. I know he’s with me, just touching it.”Biden’s interview on “Megyn Kelly Today” comes at a time when many are speculating whether the former vice president will run for president in 2020.Kelly pushed him on the issue. Listing potential arguments from critics, the reporter said: “You are going to be 77 in 2020. You wouldn’t have any new ideas. You have already run twice and lost. You would have to promise it would be one term only. And ... the blue collar Rust Belt-ers, who you would need to get elected, already love [President] Donald Trump.”“They love me more,” Biden responded.“I understand the Rust Belt,” he added. “Donald Trump has no notion of what those people are going through.”Biden has said he currently has no plans to run in 2020, but is not ruling out the option."

44,ENTERTAINMENT,Greta Gerwig's Star Is Forever Rising,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greta-gerwig-lady-bird_us_5a0617afe4b05673aa5939b6,"After ""Frances Ha,"" ""Jackie"" and other career-defining projects, Gerwig's new movie, ""Lady Bird,"" christens her an auspicious director.",2017-11-12,"Saoirse Ronan and Greta Gerwig on the set of ""Lady Bird.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0724ec1c0000f718b345ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"How many people know Greta Gerwig’s name?It’s a question I’ve been pondering over the past few weeks as her new movie, “Lady Bird,” debuts to near-universal praise. Gerwig has been branded an “it girl” time and time again over the past several years, but her highest-grossing movies, “No Strings Attached” and “Arthur,” aren’t known as “Greta Gerwig movies.” No, “Greta Gerwig movies” are things like “Frances Ha” and “Mistress America” ― her collaborations with indie honcho and romantic partner Noah Baumbach ― as well as talky dramedies like “Hannah Takes the Stairs” and “Lola Versus,” both of which belong to the so-called mumblecore genre. None of those topped $5 million at the domestic box office, though last year’s “20th Century Women” did manage nearly $6 million in revenue. Gerwig, 34, has plenty of art-house cred, but do mainstream audiences examine her sensibilities with the same enthusiasm? I think ― and hope ― we’re about to find out.“Lady Bird,” a wonderful coming-of-age tale starring Saoirse Ronan as a middle-class teenager longing to flee California for an East Coast college, has the potential to become a considerable hit as it opens in more theaters across the country throughout November. It heralds Gerwig’s foray into solo directing ― she also made 2008′s “Nights and Weekends” with Joe Swanberg ― and serves as a distillation of her sensibilities. The articulate, witty characters grow up, grow apart, seek contentment and learn lessons not through the manipulation of movie melodrama, but through the natural increments that accompany life’s progress. At indie distributor A24′s offices, I sat down with Gerwig last week to discuss her career evolution, “Lady Bird,” the support she’s received from her industry pals and the movie’s depiction of middle-class weariness. I assume you’ve caught wind of the glowing reviews and tremendous opening-weekend box office. Everything is coming up Greta Gerwig.Everything is coming up “Lady Bird.” It’s thrilling. It’s so meaningful because, really, this was such an act of love by every single person who made the movie, from my cinematographer to all my actors to every single PA, who I adore, who worked on this movie. People really poured themselves into it, so that it’s being received that way just makes me so proud of — I keep saying my kids, even though some of them are older than me. They all feel like my kids! I’m just so proud of the family that made it. It’s really exciting that it’s going this way.Before we dive into “Lady Bird,” I must tell you I’m obsessed with “Jackie.”Oh!I think I’ve seen it eight times.Oh my gosh. I love it too.Playing Jackie Kennedy’s assistant has to be the most un-Gerwigian thing you’ve done so far.It’s true. I was a big fan of the filmmaker, Pablo Larraín. I had loved his films “No” and “The Club,” but I thought of him primarily as a Spanish-language filmmaker. He made movies in [Latin America], and I thought I probably wasn’t going to be in one of his movies because that’s not my skill set. But I admired them greatly, and then I heard he was making it and was interested in me being in it. As an actor, I just go off the director. I never ask how big the part is. I don’t look at it from the perspective of, “Is this going to be good for my career?” I just look for directors, and I think part of that is I knew I always wanted to be a director. For me, working with great directors is not only a great experience as an actor; it’s a great experience as a person who wants to do this.I was already friends with Natalie Portman, and I adored her. So I thought, “Yeah, great.” I remember the first phone conversation we had — I’d read the script, but I knew I was going to do it because it was him. We talked on the phone about it, and he said this thing that was so interesting to me, which was, “To me, it’s a film about objects — all these objects that [Jackie Kennedy] had brought into the White House, and how all these objects left. It’s this tragedy, but it’s also this building of some American dream and having it be taken apart.” He told me he’d seen me in “Mistress America,” and he thought I was very good, but he thought it was nice that I was so much bigger than Natalie because I’m like a protector to her.You mean in terms of your physical stature?Yeah, I’m physically much taller than her, so it felt like I was a safe person for her in the chaos of what was going on around her. I just adored shooting it. We shot on soundstages in Paris. They recreated all these details. It was a French crew, and of course Natalie can speak all of the languages, so she could talk to everyone. I just stumbled my way through. I just loved being around it. I actually saw Pablo and his brother, Juan — they produced this movie “A Fantastic Woman.”Yes! What a beautiful movie.It’s so great. It’s so beautiful. I love that filmmaker, [Sebastían Lelio]. He also made “Gloria,” which had meant so much to me. I saw them at [the Telluride Film Festival], actually, right before “Lady Bird” premiered. Pablo said, “Don’t worry, it’s going to be great. Even if it isn’t, no one will say it to your face.” Which I always thought was pretty great. They watched it, and they were so wonderful about it. So “Jackie” was meaningful to me because I loved making it and I loved getting to play a part where I was completely transformed. That’s how I learned my job. I feel so part of the filmmaking community. It’s amazing how much people support each other.Right, just think about that collective of Chilean filmmakers, like Larraín and Lelio, who all produce one another’s projects. They make such good work.Such good work! It’s always interesting to me how it’s always a small group of people. When you actually get in there and you look at why all these great films are coming out of this place at this time, you realize they all know each other. The first version of that — or not the first version, but a big version — was the French New Wave. Those filmmakers knew each other and were writing about film and thinking about film. It happened again with American films of the ’70s. Scorsese, De Palma, Spielberg, Lucas and Coppola all were friends. They were just kids.Have you seen the Spielberg documentary on HBO?Yeah, I loved it.That footage of those five guys hanging out in the ’70s was stunning. I want an entire movie about that.I know. It’s so fun to watch, too, as a person who is, you know, an aspirational filmmaker and a youngish filmmaker. They were always sort of looking at each other’s work. They were a little competitive, but mostly they were just trying to make what they were doing good, like how Brian De Palma came up with the scroll in “Star Wars” for George, and how they were all talking to each other about “How did you get this shot?” and “How did you frame this?” I think that is such a big part of what I love about communities of artists.Do you feel like you have been able to establish that for yourself?Hugely. And with people you wouldn’t think of.The most obvious version of that — and I know you don’t like this word, so I use it loosely — is the mumblecore movement that started in the 2000s, in which a small group of independent-minded actors and directors, including yourself, quickly became connected.Sure, sure, sure. That was a big part of just taking each other seriously because we were doing stuff that was so off the radar. Still, the people I text with are Josh and Benny Safdie, the directors of “Good Time.” They’re some of my best friends, and they just texted with me over the weekend, like, “Get it, Greta! Get it!” It was just so sweet. And Lena Dunham is part of that group of people. Miranda July. All these different kinds of filmmakers and people. We’re always looking at what one another does. I went and saw “Good Time” in the theater the first weekend, and I think it’s the best thing they’ve made. And I’ve known Ronnie Bronstein for a long time, who co-wrote the script with them and who is married to Mary Bronstein, who directed me in a film called “Yeast,” years ago. It’s just one of those things where I very much sense this community that’s talking to each other. Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost — they directed “Catfish,” and they’ve directed other things since then. And Ry Russo-Young, and what she’s done. And the Dupes. Mark and Jay Duplass.The Dupes? Is that what you call them?The Dupes. The Dupses. But yeah, it’s a very nice thing to feel like that’s all connected.For someone to disappear into a role, that actor usually needs a persona that informs what people expect from them. Maybe a certain genre or style. Yours is something that tends to generate a lot of similar adjectives. Words like “quirky” get thrown around a lot. Do you think people have adequately defined your sensibilities, if that’s something you even care to monitor?Well, for me I just keep making the work. You live through the moment you’re living through in terms of how people see you, but in terms of the project you’re doing, whether it’s acting in something like “Jackie” or writing and directing this film, I can’t control how anyone sees me, so I make no attempt to do so. I just try to keep my eye on the thing that is most challenging and most alive to me in that moment. I figure — knock on wood — I’ll have a long career, and at the end of it the assessment will be whatever it is.You don’t do it until you do it, is the thing. Nobody knows what you have in you until you’ve done it, so I just keep pushing those boundaries, and I figure it will all come out in the wash.Does it bother you when people call something like “Frances Ha” a “Noah Baumbach movie”? You wrote the script together. It was very much a collaboration.I mean, he directed it. He directed the shit out of it, and that’s great. But in terms of the film being something that’s authored by both of us, yeah. It’s authored by both of us, and it’s nice when it’s referred to that way.It very much feels like a movie that has your artistic sensibility stamped all over it, and sometimes, in passing, there seems to be some sort of divide between whether it’s a “Noah Baumbach movie” or a “Greta Gerwig movie.” Of course, I’m generalizing here. You know that band the Traveling Wilburys? It’s Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, George Harrison and Roy Orbison. They were all their own artists, and then when they made an album together it was the Traveling Wilburys. So I think “Frances Ha” and “Mistress America,” for both of us, that’s our Traveling Wilburys. And of course he’s made amazing films on his own. He’s my favorite filmmaker, of course. And then I make films on my own, and also act in other people’s projects. But to me it’s kind of like a side band.What struck me most about “Lady Bird” is its depiction of the middle class, the way Lady Bird envies her classmates’ homes and feels judged based on her material possessions. That’s a sensation that lingers through adulthood, but it feels distinctly adolescent here, how teenagers litigate one another’s social status based on arbitrary wealth. It’s interesting to me because I am interested in it as a question, and I’m interested in how we deal with it and how we don’t deal with it in the art that we make and the conversations that we have. The moment of the film that I wanted to set it in is a little bit after when I was in high school. I wanted it to be in this post-9/11 world. We’ve experienced a national trauma; we’re in the war in Afghanistan; we’re getting into the war in Iraq; the internet and cellphones and all of that are on the rise, but they’re not there yet; the speeding up of the erosion of the middle class has started, which is something we’re really, really experiencing right now. It felt like a way to talk about now without setting it now.I think something about high school students being snobby about how much they have or don’t have is particularly absurd because it’s not theirs. It’s their parents’. So to feel quite good about yourself because you’ve got the fancy house and car doesn’t make any sense — you didn’t earn any of that.It’s circumstantial.It’s circumstantial, and so it is truly just the luck of the draw in that way. I was also just interested, in terms of Lady Bird, in the way she’s always looking at the fancier houses and the girls who have more. They have more access to this stuff that she thinks she wants, and she doesn’t notice that she is the object of envy of somebody else. Her best friend, Julie, would look at her and say, “But she’s got an intact family and she lives in that cute house. Her life is perfect.” Sometimes envy doesn’t allow you to see what you have, and particularly, I think, in America, you’re always looking at the more, more, more. You can’t see what’s in front of you.And the other thing is just this idea that I think started happening in the ’90s, and then it really sped up with the changing technology and the changing workforce and the erosion of the middle class. It’s this idea of your parents’ generation finding themselves in their 50s or their 60s, and suddenly they don’t have the job they’ve had for 30 years. You have to find a new job in your 50s, which is not a thing that your parents’ generation ever really had to go through, but because the economic landscape has changed so drastically and what is required of workers has changed so drastically, you find yourself needing a new career at a point when you thought you’d be winding down in your career. I think all that’s really fascinating, and it’s not as if my film has a response to it. I just wanted to show it.“Lady Bird” is now playing in select theaters. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

I was still with my wife and kids. It was near sunrise. I drove from my farmhouse in Pelham, New Hampshire squeezing my sphincter muscles until the urge to fart left me. If I could only hold out until the white liquid hit my heart—I wouldn’t shit myself.Adams Street, the place I scored heroin, was naked except for a grotesquely thin Puerto Rican kid in his early 20s. He had a teardrop tattoo under his left eye. He was Nieta—an extremely dangerous Puerto Rican jailhouse gang. Of course, I was driving a Mercedes Benz and was built like a jock. He thought I was a cop.I was “jonesing,” and I couldn’t care less what he thought of me. Only my agenda mattered. First, don’t give him the money and let him out of my sight. Second, bite the bag—make sure it’s heroin. Third, get safely to the Burger King bathroom down the street to cook the heroin and stick the needle into my vein.I motioned him into the car. He jumped in and directed me to a house a few streets off Adams Street with hand commands. It was a predominantly Cambodian neighborhood. We didn’t speak. I had a 9-inch screwdriver in the driver’s side compartment of the lower door. My left hand never left the yellow handle.He left the car, expecting me to follow. One knock and it opened. The place was a shooting gallery. Wall to wall junkies sleeping on the floor. I followed him to the bathroom. The mold smell made me gag. He cooked a bag in an aluminum beer-bottle cap, shot it, and handed me a needle and a fresh bag of heroin. His eyes were pitch-black—emotionless. His purple-crimson blood was clearly visible in the bottom of the syringe—maybe a centimeter thick between the end of the needle and the black rubber stop on the stick-push.I carefully poured the tiny bag of heroin into his cooker. Grabbed a cigarette butt out of the ashtray on the windowsill, bite off a small piece of the filter, and spit it into the cooker. I thought about my little boys and what it must feel like to die of AIDS. I turned the cold water on, gathered 20cc of water into the syringe, shot it into the cooker, fired-up a match, and watched it bubble. The Puerto Rican kid watched. He thought I was hesitating because I was a cop. He had no idea I lived on a half a million-dollar farmhouse with a wife and two children.That was 30 years ago.When I look back now, I cannot believe I survived. Nothing mattered to me except heroin. It was my God. Every word that exited my mouth was a lie. Every day I woke up, I wanted to die. Every injection I administered into my veins was my silent attempt to commit suicide.But I survived, caught some luck and became a writer. It wasn’t easy. I did it the hard way: abstinence.I am very thankful for the fact I do not have to enter recovery today. I am not sure that I would have made it. Today the major MOT, method of treatment, for opioid addiction is long-term maintenance. What, back in my day, we referred to as “liquid handcuff.”I kicked methadone once and honestly, I would rather kick heroin cold a dozen times before I went through methadone withdrawal again. I remember praying to God to take my life. It felt like my bones were on fire.PLEASE understand: suboxone and methadone are much-needed drugs to help the addict through the initial physical withdrawal of opioids affect on the human body. However, in​ ​some​ ​ways,​ ​the​ ​physical​ ​tolls​ ​of​ ​substance​ ​abuse​ ​can​ ​be​ ​easier​ ​to​ ​address​ ​than​ ​the emotional​ ​ones.​ ​​In​ ​many​ ​cases,​ ​people​ ​are​ ​driven​ ​back​ ​to​ ​heroin ​by​ ​emotional swings,​ ​not​ ​by​ ​irresistible​ ​cravings.​ ​But I would be a fool to think that my way, abstinence, is the only way for a fully successful recovery from opioid addiction. However, I firmly believe that we are going to lose the war against opioid addiction if we continue with the MOT presently being used to treat opioid addiction. And we are going to lose badly!Big Pharma controls the United States Congress. Big Pharma created this opioid epidemic. Why should we be shocked that Big Pharma does not want the deaths of what many estimate as many as 150 Americans per day to end?It is all about the “Benjamins.” On June 22, 2017, Time Magazine reported the following facts:In 2016, the pharmaceutical companies that make opioid painkillers raked in $8.6 billion in sales for 336 million opioid prescriptions, according to the data firm QuintilesIMS. That’s enough to give pain pills to 9 out of every 10 American adults.Did I mention that Big Pharma controls the United States Congress?On Oct. 26, 2017, President Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national health emergency. Moments before he came on national television, I was on a live MSNBC panel to discuss the epidemic. I mentioned abstinence, and I received an avalanche of nasty tweets and emails.Regardless, what the doctors tell opioid addicts, Big Pharma knows the truth. Suboxone and Methadone are opioid agonists that create a conscious sedation which separates the addict from their present awareness.Again, we will not win the war against opioid addiction by treating opioid addicts with opioids. We must at the very least offer abstinence as a method of treatment for heroin addiction.However, it will not be an easy alternative option, Big Pharma knows that they have created a population handcuffed to addiction.Ritchie Farrell is the author of I Am A Heroin Addict.Follow Ritchie Farrell on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ritchiefarrell1Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

48,POLITICS,How A Literal Shock Inspired A Former Marine To Run For Office As A Democratic Socialist,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lee-carter-delegate-democratic-socialist_us_5a074548e4b05673aa5997fd,A workplace injury and its aftermath were a political wake-up call for Virginia state delegate-elect Lee Carter.,2017-11-12,"Democrat Lee Carter, a democratic socialist, won an election Tuesday to represent Virginia's 50th District in the state's House of Delegates.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0745f01f00003b004a550d.jpeg?cache=emCNhCcjaZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In July 2015, Lee Carter was completing the installation of a lighting control panel on a work site in Peoria, Illinois, when he felt a wave of electricity shoot across his chest. The electrician had incorrectly wired the panel, and when Carter touched it, it zapped him with 245 volts.“It’s like a static electricity shock, but happening 60 times a second throughout half of your body,” he recalled.Carter, a former Marine with fire-truck-red hair, instinctively recoiled from the panel, breaking his fall on his back. He ended up hurting his back so badly that he could not walk more than 50 feet at a time for the next three months.The injury was more than just painful and demoralizing: After Virginia rejected Carter’s application for workers’ compensation benefits, and his employer cut down his hours after he recovered, the situation inspired Carter to get involved in politics.“Coming from that position of working a blue-collar job and being wronged by an employer, it was a very natural transition to say that an economic strategy that puts working people first, ahead of corporate interests, is the way to go to make life better for people,” Carter said.He became a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America and ran for a seat in Virginia’s state House of Delegates ― and on Tuesday, with help from fellow DSA members but virtually none from the state’s Democratic Party, Carter won his race by nearly 9 percentage points.The 30-year-old political newcomer had managed to easily unseat Del. Jackson Miller, the GOP state House Whip, who had outspent him more than 2-to-1.Carter’s unexpectedly big win has been the subject of endless fascination in the press ― and praise from progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) eager to highlight the outcome as a sign that unabashed economic populism can be a winning formula in swing districts.At least equally intriguing, however, is the story of how Carter got involved in politics and embraced democratic socialism. Carter did not learn about socialism from an eccentric family member or through membership in a labor union. He did not get hip to Karl Marx thanks to a charismatic college professor.Instead, he simply had an experience on the job that shattered his faith in unbridled capitalism. Then Sanders’ presidential run as a self-described democratic socialist sealed the deal.Carter is a political novice, but he sounds like a natural. In a phone interview, he spelled out his message with a fluent, polished delivery.But Carter is a rarity among elected officials in that he lacks a college degree. In 2016, one-third of Americans aged 25 or older had a four-year college degree or higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In the U.S. Congress, however, all senators and 95 percent of House members have at least a four-year diploma.Carter is one of just 14 members of the Virginia legislature without a 4-year college degree, according to data collected by the Virginia Public Access Project. And a review of the campaign websites of the 16 new Democratic members who were elected Tuesday shows Carter is the only one who lacks a bachelor’s degree.“There is an ever-growing sector of our economy that’s made up of people in precarious work, people who are living paycheck to paycheck and aren’t 100 percent sure if the next one’s gonna come in ― and I’m one of them,” Carter said.What’s more, Carter, who now makes a living as a project-based information technology consultant, has gone without health insurance for nearly a year.His wife, who is currently the household’s main breadwinner, gets coverage for herself and their daughter through her job managing a small auto repair chain. Carter initially bought coverage on the individual insurance market created by the Affordable Care Act, but found the monthly premiums cost-prohibitive and let his coverage lapse at the end of 2016.At Carter’s election night watch party, he mused to his wife about one of the personal benefits of his win. “You know what I won? Health insurance,” he recalled telling her.Carter grew up in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, a suburb of Norfolk, Virginia. His father was a career officer in the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, so when Carter finished high school, he saw enlisting in the Marine Corps as a natural path forward.Carter served in the Marines from 2006 to 2011 in a division that was special operations-equipped. He was deployed to Haiti in 2010 to assist with the post-earthquake rescue and recovery efforts.After his service as a Marine, he moved to Northern Virginia to look for work. Carter quickly met the woman who would become his wife, and they had a daughter who is now 6 years old.Initially, Carter earned money fixing cancer therapy equipment. But the work was sporadic and labor-intensive, regularly requiring him to toil 80 hours a week.When the Bella Rose Group, a small Georgia-based company, hired Carter to install lighting control panels, it was a major relief. The company paid him a flat salary for 40 hours of work every week, enabling him to spend more time with his family.Then he got injured on the job ― and his dream turned into a nightmare.Carter’s electric shock and fall on his back resulted in the swelling of two vertebrae that pinched key nerves. His employer-provided insurance covered the pain medications and cortisol regimen he needed, but he had to pay a $2,000 deductible. He was also out of work for three months as his back recovered.Every state in the country has a workers’ compensation program in place specifically to provide people like Carter recourse if they sustain an injury or medical condition on the job. Although benefits and eligibility standards vary, employees file claims to the state workers’ compensation body in pursuit of payments from their employer to cover out-of-pocket medical costs and a portion of their lost income. Employers with the means to do so typically purchase insurance plans that adjudicate these claims and pay the workers if the state board rules it is necessary.The most common place to apply for workers’ compensation benefits is in the state where the injury occurred, according to multiple experts in workers’ compensation law.Carter sustained the injury in Illinois and his employer was based in Georgia. But in September 2015, bedridden and on pain medications, Carter decided to file a workers’ compensation claim against the company with the state of Virginia. He reasoned that while Illinois was a resolutely pro-worker state and Georgia was equally pro-business, Virginia was the “Goldilocks” option ― the perfect balance that might make the Bella Rose Group likely to strike a deal with him.“I figured let’s go with the least contentious state,” Carter said.It ended up being a major mistake. For one thing, Carter was not dealing with the Bella Rose Group; he was dealing with the company’s insurer, Hanover Insurance Group. And like any profit-driven private insurance company, Hanover worked diligently within the bounds of the law to avoid paying out claims.Carter called at least four Virginia-based lawyers in search of representation but they all refused, citing the complicated question of whether his claim was even in Virginia’s jurisdiction. He said none advised him to file in another state.Representing himself before the state’s workers’ compensation commission in March 2016, Carter struggled to navigate the complexities of the law. Hanover argued the employer could not be held responsible for claims made in Virginia, where it had no place of business.The commission ruled against Carter’s claim in a May 2016 decision, noting his contract was “consummated” in Georgia, and Virginia therefore had no jurisdiction over Carter’s injury.To make matters worse, Carter believes the Bella Rose Group retaliated against him for filing the workers’ compensation claim by drastically diminishing his role with the company after he was healthy enough to return to the job.The company moved him to a part-time schedule, where he would no longer receive employer-sponsored health insurance. He quickly realized he was not getting enough work to make ends meet, and quit after a few weeks.Stefaney Caro, principal of the Bella Rose Group, denies the company retaliated against him.“Regarding him working part time, we only had one customer that he could do work for and it wasn’t full time,” Caro said in an email.Several attorneys and policy experts that specialize in workers’ compensation law believe Virginia’s decision against Carter was a reasonable interpretation of the law. But they acknowledged his experience reflects some inadequacies of the workers’ compensation system. The system was originally envisioned as a “grand bargain” between workers and employers that would give injured workers financial recourse while protecting companies from multimillion-dollar lawsuits, according to Michael Duff, a labor law professor at the University of Wyoming College of Law.Now it’s so complex from state to state that workers need attorneys to represent them. And the lack of potential profitability of certain cases can make it hard for workers to find an attorney, said Duff, who went to law school following a stint as a unionized airline industry worker.“There’s been this gradual erosion of workers’ compensation benefits, workers’ compensation coverage,” Duff said. “And the problem is, how can it be, that at the end of the day, a person has no remedy for an injury in which somebody certainly must be responsible?”Regardless of the legal details, the experience made Carter furious ― at the law for failing workers, at the insurance company for overpowering him with legal arguments he struggled to understand, and at his employer for treating him like a “liability” rather than a “human.”“It was just this deep-seated rage,” Carter recalled. “I was doing a dangerous job to make their business successful, and when the dangers of that job caught up with me they threw me under the bus.”Carter’s trauma quickly turned into a political wake-up call. He had always voted for Democrats, albeit ambivalently at times. But he decided he needed to get active in progressive politics. He wanted to live in a country where no one ever had to go through what he experienced. He wanted workers to have more power in their workplace. He wanted single-payer health care and an end to corporate influence in politics.As a resident of Manassas, a city in the Washington, D.C. exurbs, Carter realized he was smack-dab in the middle of a state legislative swing district. In February 2016, he announced he would run for the House of Delegates. Around the same time, Carter caught the Bernie Sanders bug, volunteering for his presidential campaign and serving as a Sanders delegate at the Virginia Democratic Party convention and the Democratic convention of Virginia’s 10th congressional district. Sanders’ decision to ignore the stigma on what Carter calls “the s-word” set off another light bulb in the nascent legislative candidate’s head.“Seeing how corporations will try to subvert the political process on both sides and seeing Bernie Sanders come out there and say, ‘I’m a democratic socialist and this is what I’m fighting for,’ those two things together, really made me take a look at exactly what democratic socialism is, and I found it very, very appealing,” Carter said.“Democratic socialism” refers to an array of left-wing economic worldviews that exist within the confines of a liberal democratic political system. Its adherents range from supporters of single-payer health care systems and more generous social welfare states common in other wealthy nations, to backers of more radical economic reforms like granting workers an ownership stake in the means of production.For Carter, democratic socialism is “really just working people having more power in the workplace,” he said. “When you have a workplace that’s run democratically by the people who work there, they’re not gonna vote to ship their own jobs to China, they’re not gonna downsize because of a new piece of technology.”On the campaign trail, Carter was open about his political views and frequently shared the story of the electrical shock that inspired them.His DSA membership proved to be a benefit, rather than a liability: His fellow rank-and-file members of the Metro D.C. DSA chapter provided crucial ground-game support. Carter credits them for knocking on half of the 20,000 doors his campaign reached in the final four days before the election.In addition, Our Revolution, the legacy organization from Sanders’ presidential campaign, sent get-out-the-vote text messages to 3,750 Carter supporters in the district and raised nearly $1,500 for Carter.Forward Majority, a Democratic super PAC devoted to electing state legislative candidates, played a role with digital advertisements and a website slamming Miller. The group’s contributions were worth over $71,000, making it the single-largest donor to his campaign. Carter claimed his victory “would not have been possible” without Forward Majority.For the most part though, Carter won by framing his ambitious progressive platform ― support for statewide single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage, an end to the state’s right-to-work status, a ban on all corporate money in state politics, and opposition to two natural gas pipelines ― as a message to his district’s voters that he would always be on their side.Carter believes that his success in turning out working-class voters from his district’s large and growing Latino community was a key element of his win. Some of the Spanish-speaking old-timers in his district affectionately referred to the ginger-haired Carter as “El Rojo” ― the redhead.“We were able to go out there and tell people that you’re finally going to have a voice in Richmond that will work to make life better for you and your family, day in and day out,” he said.Now Carter is focused on advancing his policy agenda when the state legislature reconvenes in January. As a start on the road to single-payer, Carter hopes Democrats can expand Medicaid to another 400,000 low-income Virginians. Thanks to Tuesday’s electoral wave, the party is due to have a tie in the House of Delegates, which Democratic leaders believe puts expansion within their grasp.But the first bill Carter plans to introduce in Richmond is a measure to strengthen protections for workers against employer retaliation for filing workers’ compensation claims.“It’s kind of messed up that it was easier to run a two-year election and get 11,000 people to vote for me than it was to figure out the workers’ compensation system,” he said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Manassas, Virginia, is part of Prince William County. In fact, it is an independent city. Additionally, a previous version of this story mistakenly indicated there are no public records of the educational attainment of members of Virginia’s legislature."

The footage shows men brutally abusing cows as the bovines cower and duck their heads. In some cases, the cows are unable to get away because they are confined by bars meant to restrain them for the milking process.Larson Dairy was a supplier of Publix Super Markets, which has announced it suspended deliveries from the farm in the wake of the video, the Associated Press reports. Okeechobee County Sheriff Noel Stephen announced Thursday that he had launched a criminal investigation into the farm.Farm owner Jacob Larson said in a Thursday statement, cited by multiple media outlets, that one employee seen in the video has been fired.“We are deeply saddened and appalled by the actions witnessed in this video, which first came to our attention this morning,” read the statement. “The unusual use of force is simply unacceptable on our dairy or on any other farm.”Sheriff Stephen told TC Palm on Friday that two other workers, in addition to the man fired, had been placed on suspension.Though Larson’s statement asserts the violence seen in the video was an anomaly, Animal Recovery Mission alleges that abuse was rampant at the farm. The group’s website states that the cows were regularly “beaten over the head” and otherwise abused “during daily milk collections.”Larson has questioned why the undercover worker didn’t simply report the abuse as soon as it happened, instead of waiting to release a video and report.“I think they have an agenda,” Larson told local news station WPBF. “They want to put farms out of business.”Animal Recovery Mission founder Richard Couto told the Sun-Sentinel that his group had no special reason to target Larson Dairy, but wanted to see what “was happening in a typical, larger scale dairy setting in the state of Florida.”"

Though admittedly not a personal fan of all her peers, the pop superstar said there’s no reason to trash-talk others either.“People always try to gear us — especially women in the industry — against each other,” Clarkson emphasized on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “I’m just not about that.”The multi-platinum singer’s eighth studio album Meaning of Life dropped to critical acclaim Oct. 27. Discussing her debut on Atlantic Records, which “100-percent” supported her move from pop-rock to the album’s more soulful appeal, Clarkson opened up about the pleasure many seemingly derive from public drama. “I like to be sarcastic about all these dumb ‘feuds’ between women in the industry,” the happily-married star confided.“It’s like, ‘Please do not fuel that fire any more,’” said Clarkson of reported bad blood between other female singers. “They already try to do it to us enough.”Since shooting to global fame as the inaugural American Idol in 2002, Clarkson has not been entirely free of rumored “feuds.” Her industry-specific conflicts, though, have been reserved for record labels and executives. Most notably, the singer took entertainment bigwig Clive Davis to task when she felt the label head hampered her artistic growth. Openly sparring with another artist, however, makes no sense to Clarkson.“The only reason I feel like anybody would be that into an argument (with a fellow singer) is because they feel like they need it to survive in longevity in this industry,” she opined.“That’s sad,” said the Nashville resident, who assured those who might feel that way: “We’re going to be fine. We’re all going to be fine!”During her career, now spanning eleven Top 10 hits over a decade-and-a-half, Clarkson admits seeing artist comparisons turn to both real and perceived friction. In fact, the three-time Grammy-winner shared, others have tried to drag her into similar situations — often. “People will be like, ‘Please don’t be like this artist, because they’re naked all the time’ or ‘Please don’t be like this artist; just focus on your music,’” she revealed. “You know what? I don’t want you to compliment me while derailing someone else’s career, because that person is comfortable, doing what they like to do,” the Texan asserted. “If they love showing skin, they love that. That’s how they feel sexy; that’s who they are.”LISTEN: Kelly Clarkson Appears on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ PodcastRather than feeling threatened by other vocalists, Clarkson — who has sent three albums to No. 1 on Billboard charts with an equal number of singles topping the magazine’s “Hot 100” — celebrates the diversity of women in the industry. She said: “Everyone’s different, and it’s supposed to be different.” Clarkson is confounded by societal pressures for musicians to conform to some unspoken sound or standard — or outwardly compete with industry contemporaries. Instead, she defends her chart-topping sisters, going so far as to humorously skewer criticisms lobbed at fellow female superstars.“With Kesha, it’s like, ‘Why does she rap? Why doesn’t she just sing?’ Why do you care that P!nk is flying around?” Clarkson asked. “Maybe she likes doing that? Obviously she does!” she pointed out.“Lady Gaga... She and I are very different,” continued Clarkson.“Where we are very similar, she’s very respectful and one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met!” she shared of the “Born This Way” favorite, “So I think we have a lot in common too.”The examples don’t end there though! From Clarkson’s passionate response, and laundry list of names rattled off for listeners, it appears she’s either been compared to or expected to feel competitive with nearly every major female in music today. She rejects both ideas at every turn.“People will be like, ‘Oh my God! Did you see what Rihanna was wearing?’” Clarkson reported. “And I’m like, ‘Yeah, and she looked frickin hot! Amen! God did good!’” Often, she said, it comes down to fans simply not approving of a star’s choices — whether those be musically or in fashion. Clarkson’s response to such outcry, especially regarding appearance, are rather blunt: If you don’t like it, don’t wear it yourself or don’t watch! “She’s sleeping just fine at night!” the sassy Southerner said of the envelope-pushing “Love On the Brain” star. “Why are you worried about it? She’s not worried about you or your opinion.WATCH: Pollo Del Mar’s Video Review of Meaning of Life“It just boggles my mind when people want people — or crave them — to be something they’re not,” she continued, “Because then you don’t [really] like them.”Clarkson refuses to “down others” who approach their artistry in a different way than she might. Any who want all acts to be the same, she said, “have come to the wrong industry.” Personally, Clarkson values a wide array of musical styles and sounds. The pop, country, rock, blues and dance influences scattered throughout Meaning of Life, which she called the most “authentic” album of her career, are proof. “I have everything from Britney Spears to Imagine Dragons to Nirvana to Andrea Boccelli,” she said of her personal musical library. “I would never expect Andrea Bocelli to do something Britney Spears does, because she’s a different kind of entertainer,” said Clarkson, laughing at the absurdity of suggestions artists should be compared. “I would never expect Nirvana or U2 or any of these artists I love to do something like I do, because we’re not the same,” she said, “And that’s ok.”Unfortunately, Clarkson admitted, the push for musicians to conform is nothing new. Though she feels women in entertainment face criticism and unflattering comparisons at a higher rate than male counterparts, she said the expectation “isn’t limited to any one group.”“Let’s be real; this has been happening since way back in the day,” she stressed. Even greats like Nirvana and Ella Fitzgerald (“way, way back in the day”) faced unfair parallels drawn to others in the industry at their respective times, the mother of four said.“People always want you to fit this box that makes others comfortable,” concluded Clarkson, “But being creative isn’t about being comfortable; it’s about being progressive!”Follow Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl on Twitter.Like Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl on Facebook.LISTEN: Kelly Clarkson Talks New Album, How Being Out Changed One Major Country Star’s Career, More"

Now living in Brooklyn, New York, his heart aches for his loved ones, who are waiting to join him in America from an ocean away.“I need them,” he said. “Sometimes if I think about them, I can’t sleep.”Diallo said he started to fear for his life following Guinea’s 2015 presidential election period, which was rocked by violence and widespread human rights violations. He recalled being harassed, threatened and even tortured by policemen and different ethnic groups over differences in political opinion.“If I continued to live in Guinea, I thought I’d be killed,” he said. “I don’t like to talk about it.”So he began his long journey to the United States, first crossing through South and Central America. After arriving in the U.S. with limited English skills, he struggled to find a job ― one of the greatest challenges for many refugees adjusting to life in America, especially at a time of heightened xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies.Little more than a year ago, Americans elected Donald Trump as their new president following an election campaign that capitalized on fear-mongering and disparaging refugees. Once in power, Trump’s administration swiftly moved to temporarily halt all refugee admissions to the U.S.After his four-month resettlement suspension ended in October, Trump put in place a policy of “extreme vetting,” which will drastically affect immigration for newcomers from several Muslim-majority countries, making it a much slower and more complicated process. He has also announced plans to limit U.S. refugee admission to 45,000 for the 2018 fiscal year ― the country’s lowest-ever cap, down from the 110,000 set by President Barack Obama.“I don’t like politics,” said Diallo, who has tuned out the country’s political developments while adapting to his new surroundings. What matters, he said, is that he feels safe, and he is happy here. He moved from California to Texas, then finally to New York. It was there he connected with Kerry Brodie, a woman he credits with changing his life.Brodie is the founder and executive director of Emma’s Torch, a nonprofit social enterprise that prepares refugees for careers in the culinary industry. Emma’s Torch Classroom Cafe in Red Hook, a neighborhood in southwest Brooklyn, is a small pop-up where refugee chefs-in-the-making complete a paid apprenticeship program. With funding from various foundations and donors, in addition to revenue from the cafe, they learn how to cook and prepare meals while developing their English skills.“I like the tough love at Emma’s Torch,” Diallo said with a laugh. He joined the program as a dishwasher in June, then completed chef training there. His favorite meal he has learned to make is shakshuka, an Israeli dish of poached eggs in spiced tomato sauce.Before leaving Guinea, he worked as a French teacher and didn’t cook very often. He’s in the process of working on asylum applications for his wife and daughter, so they can build a new life in America together. “I’m very worried about them because I’m alone here,” he said. “My daughter is back there, she doesn’t understand why I left. She’s only 6. My wife is waiting for me.”Emma’s Torch held a graduation ceremony in Red Hook on Oct. 19, where Diallo accepted his diploma with a beaming smile. “I’m very excited today, because now I have this certificate,” he said at the event. “It’s a good document. Everywhere I go, I can present this document. Now I’m Chef Boubacar!”Diallo has already landed a full-time job doing food preparation at Little Park, a restaurant in Manhattan’s lower Tribeca neighborhood. He graduated from Emma’s Torch alongside his fellow chef-in-training, Nadia, a 33-year-old asylum seeker from Pakistan.Nadia, who asked to be identified by her first name only for security reasons, came to the U.S. on a visa and is awaiting asylum status. She grew up in the northeastern city of Lahore, where she worked as a broadcast journalist for nearly a decade.She reported on many potentially dangerous stories involving terrorist groups, including the Taliban, but said it was a culture of misogyny that ultimately made her feel unsafe and prompted her departure in 2014.“Most people there don’t like ladies to work. They believe women should stay at home,” Nadia said. “My father allowed me to work. He always said, ‘It’s not your fault you’re a girl. You didn’t fill out an application asking God to make you a female.’”Nadia said she was frequently demeaned and threatened on the job, noting she was one of very few female reporters in her country. She recounted having a disagreement with her male boss in Lahore. She said he told her, “If my wife was arguing with me like this, I’d slap her face.” “I was standing in the newsroom along with at least 35 other people at the time,” she said. “You definitely face a lot of harassment as a female journalist in Pakistan.”Since relocating to New York, she has done some online writing for community news outlets in addition to taking up cooking at Emma’s Torch ― a skill she never learned back home. From all the dishes she made since joining the program in August, Nadia says avocado toast is now her meal of choice. She misses her younger siblings and parents in Pakistan but is still “too scared to go back.”“It’s not easy. I had to leave my profession, my home, my fame and my popularity because I couldn’t take such risks with my life. I was rebellious and resilient.”Now, with her new training and support network, Nadia is in the process of interviewing to launch a career in New York’s food industry.“All of our students have said that Emma’s Torch has drastically changed their lives,” said Brodie. “It’s not just about the paycheck ― they have a job where they are respected, they have a community at work where what they bring to the table matters.” Brodie quit her job with The Human Rights Campaign in Washington, D.C., two years ago and moved to New York to attend culinary school and turn her dream for a refugee kitchen into a reality.“I was really compelled by this idea that there are really huge opportunities in the food space to make a difference,” she said.The pop-up cafe will close in Red Hook later this month and reopen at a new location in Brooklyn early next year. Brodie named the nonprofit after Emma Lazarus, who wrote the poem engraved at the base of the Statue of Liberty. It reads in part: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free.”″[Lazarus] believed that what defined the United States was our ability to welcome in strangers and serve as a place of refuge to those in need,” Brodie said. “We’ve always been a nation of immigrants.”In the midst of what she described as a “push of xenophobia and closing off our borders in a way that’s really troubling,” Brodie says she’s been inspired by an “outpouring” of public support and solidarity.“It’s not the political climate that I thought we’d be working in,” she said, “but we’re still here, and it motivates us to work harder.”"

In just one year, Trumpism has tested our country’s moral fiber, pitted Americans against each other and turned our global allies against us. It’s been a dark year for America, and that’s putting it mildly.But this past Tuesday injected a much-needed boost of hope and optimism into the hearts and minds of the American people ― myself included. In red states and blue states, Americans cast their ballots in droves, denouncing Trumpism and all the hate and division that comes with it.Love conquered hate in Virginia, where voters propelled Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam to victory over Republican Ed Gillespie, who embraced Trump-style tactics only to see his strategy backfire on election day. In fact, 34 percent of Virginia voters said they voted in part to express opposition to Trump, according to exit polling. Virginians also rebuked Trump’s and Gillespie’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, electing the first ever Latinas to the House of Delegates.This election day was a referendum on Trump’s anti-LGBTQ policies, from the transgender military ban to discriminatory bathroom bills. Virginia elected its first openly transgender lawmaker, Danica Roem, who unseated “chief homophobe” and 13-year incumbent Robert Marshall. This wave of inclusion also spread westward, where the Minneapolis City Council elected the first openly transgender Black woman to its city council; and all the way to Seattle, which is celebrating the election of its first openly-lesbian mayor[A1] .It was also a day full of historic firsts for women in cities like Charlotte, North Carolina, which elected its first African-American female mayor; in Manchester, New Hampshire, which elected its first female mayor; in Topeka, Kansas, which elected the city’s first Hispanic mayor; in Milledgeville, Georgia, which elected its first female mayor, and in Santa Barbara, California, which elected its first Latina mayor.Democrats rode the anti-Trump wave to victory in the Garden State, where Democrat Philip Murphy trounced Republican Kim Guadagno by a 13-point margin. They shook things up in Hoboken, where residents elected New Jersey’s first Sikh mayor. And one of the proudest victories of the night took place in Maine, where the governor’s antipathy to the Medicaid program lost bigly: 59 percent of Mainers voted for a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid access to 70,000 low-income people across the state. After a year where Republicans have tried non-stop to repeal the ACA and decimate Medicaid, voters stood up and showed that what people really want is more access to quality affordable health care, not less. Trump’s anti-health care policies were even a liability in red states like Georgia, where Democrats backing Medicaid expansion picked up three seats, and in swing states like Florida, where the mayor of St. Petersburg, an outspoken supporter of the ACA, won his re-election bid.From coast to coast, these stunning victories should be a wakeup call for Republicans and Democrats alike. It’s only been a year, but a new CNN poll tells us what we already know: Americans are fed up with Trump’s divisive rhetoric and hate-driven policies, and we’re taking our grievances from the streets to the ballot box.Last Tuesday, grassroots organizers ― everyday people like you and me― stood up against hate and fear. We broke down barriers, defended our values, and sent the GOP a clear warning: Americans are not willing to stand idly by while the GOP attempts to tear holes in our social safety net, gutting programs that working families depend on ― like SNAP and Medicaid ― to line the pockets of billionaires through massive tax cuts. We reject their attempts to erase the progress made by the Affordable Care Act and other achievements of the Obama era. It’s time for Republican lawmakers to wake up and remember who they work for: not industry lobbyists and special interests, but the American people. If the GOP continues to push its repeal-and-replace efforts, its draconian budget and its heartless tax reform bill, they can expect an even more embarrassing defeat next November.Because we are taking our country back, one seat at a time.Wendoly Marte is a field organizer for the Center for Community Change Action."

Television Group has terminated Andrew Kreisberg’s employment, effective immediately,” the studio said in a statement. “We remain committed to providing a safe working environment for our employees and everyone involved in our productions.”PREVIOUSLY:Andrew Kreisberg, a leading force on some of Warner Bros. biggest television productions, has been accused of sexually harassing women for years, Variety reported Friday. Variety corroborated accounts from 19 anonymous sources ― 15 women and four men ― who said that Kreisberg made sexually inappropriate comments and harassed female employees. The writer and executive producer has run a number of the studio’s DC Comics television adaptations, including “Supergirl,” “The Flash,” “Arrow” and “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow.” The Variety article stated: According to sources who either witnessed this behavior or were subjected to it, Kreisberg is accused of frequently touching people without their permission, asking for massages from uncomfortable female staff members, and kissing women without asking. Almost every source cites a constant stream of sexualized comments about women’s appearances, their clothes, and their perceived desirability.Kreisberg is accused of creating a toxic work environment and has been suspended pending an investigation by the Warner Bros. TV Group. “We have recently been made aware of allegations of misconduct against Andrew Kreisberg,” Warner Bros. TV Group said in a statement. “We have suspended Mr. Kreisberg and are conducting an internal investigation. We take all allegations of misconduct extremely seriously, and are committed to creating a safe working environment for our employees and everyone involved in our productions.”Variety said that all 19 sources requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. None of the women reported Kreisberg to human resources, but a high-ranking female producer said she related her concerns about the show runner’s behavior to Berlanti Productions in 2016 but saw no results, Variety reported.Berlanti, which oversees Kreisberg’s shows, issued a statement Friday, saying, “We were recently made aware of some deeply troubling allegations regarding one of our showrunners. We have been encouraging and fully cooperating with the investigation into this by Warner Bros.“There is nothing more important to us than the safety and well-being of our cast, crew, writers, producers and any staff. We do not tolerate harassment and are committed to doing everything we can to make an environment that’s safe to work in and safe to speak up about if it isn’t.” One woman who worked closely with Kreisberg told Variety that the producer would send her texts that made it clear he wanted more than a professional relationship, making her feel uncomfortable. Two other women claimed they heard the producer discussing hiring staffers based on looks, calling prospective hires “dogs.” A colleague said he tried on numerous occasions to talk to Kreisberg about the situation, including writing him an email six years ago, but then Kreisberg would ignore him for several days afterward. Kreisberg denied the allegations to HuffPost, calling them “patently false.” The writer told Variety that he often mentored both male and female colleagues but did not offer unwanted attention.“I have made comments on women’s appearances and clothes in my capacity as an executive producer, but they were not sexualized,” Kreisberg told Variety. “Like many people, I have given someone a non-sexual hug or kiss on the cheek.”"

The proposed removal of the deduction has generated much uproar among research advocates who argue that it will discourage people from getting advanced degrees.But ending the deduction would also hurt university employees who benefit from tuition waivers if they or their children attend the university where they work, noted a Friday blog post by Sam Brunson, a professor of tax law at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, and Michael Austin, executive vice president of academic affairs at the University of Evansville.For well-paid university administrators or star professors, paying taxes on this benefit is likely a manageable, though significant, burden.But for secretaries, janitors and security guards on the university’s payroll receiving free college tuition, ending the exemption would be financially onerous. That’s especially disconcerting because being able to pay for a free college education often enables the children of these working-class employees to move up the socioeconomic ladder.“Tuition waivers can be a life-changing opportunity for some of our lowest-paid employees,” Brunson and Austin write.To make matters worse, Brunson and Austin write, the income tax on the tuition waiver would tax the “full sticker price of tuition” rather than the discounted rate universities provide for most students. As a result, low-earning university employees could find themselves paying taxes on income that is worth far more than the university tuition would cost in practice.The two experts cite as an example an administrative assistant earning $30,000 a year. If she sends two children to college courtesy of the university, and the school’s “sticker-price” tuition is $35,000 a student, the government will tax her as if she earned $70,000 more than her salary ― for a total of $100,000 in taxable income.“What this means is that fewer college employees, and fewer of their children, are going to have the opportunity to attend college because the life-changing benefit of a tuition waiver will become too expensive for them to afford,” Brunson and Austin write. “Of course, just as it does with graduate students, this limitation applies only to those without personal or family resources. Those with such resources will be fine.”“And this is why it matters: access to higher education remains the only thing standing between the current United States and a society of hereditary privilege and permanent class divisions,” they add. “The proper term for such a society is an ‘aristocracy,’ and it is precisely what our country was founded not to be.”University employees still have some hope: The Senate’s version of tax bill kept the deduction for tuition waivers in place. But if the Republican Congress is able to hash out a compromise between the two bills, there is no guarantee the provision will make it into the final legislation that heads to President Donald Trump’s desk."

That’s not in the script.’ And he’s like, ‘Look, I’ll just pull down my pants, you just stick your finger up my butt, it’ll be a really funny bit.’”A representative for Baron Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.During another unwanted experience with a Hollywood figure, Wilson said, a “top director” invited her to his hotel room for what she thought would be a professional meeting. Wilson fled the encounter when she overheard the man’s wife calling and getting angry with him for “sleeping with actresses.”Wilson noted that she was grateful she was able to get out of both incidents.“I realize not everyone is as lucky,” she said.Read her full tweets below:This article has been updated to include mention of Wilson’s 2014 radio interview."

Plastic forks, disintegrating shopping bags, fragmented blocks of Styrofoam and a seemingly endless amount of drinking bottles are just a few examples of the debris swirling around the seas and washing up on our shores. Take another look at this plastic soup, and you’ll likely spot something few people have ever heard of: nurdles. Unlike microbeads, which are used in consumer products like face scrub, nurdles are basically the building blocks for other plastics. Companies buy nurdles by the billions every year to make nearly all the plastic products we buy. Residents in Durban, a city on South Africa’s east coast, are learning about this industrial raw material the hard way. Last month, a container full of nurdles washed off a ship belonging to the Mediterranean Shipping Company into port waters during a thunderstorm ― an event so destructive it’s been compared to an oil spill. The city’s beaches are now overrun with the pellets.Nurdles pose significant dangers for wildlife. Marine animals ― including fish, turtles and birds ― mistake the pellets for food, leading them to become malnourished or starved. They also attract chemical pollutants, releasing toxins into the animals that eat them and increasing the risk that those toxins will enter the human food chain.Trawling beaches for small plastic pellets might sound daunting, but that isn’t stopping Durbanites from getting involved. Local resident Anelda Keet and her family have been out on one of the affected beaches helping sift through the sand. “It’s awesome to see so many people on the beach helping to clean up, but it’s going to take a long time and a lot of people to get it done,” she said.Hayley Bevis took part in the cleanup effort at Durban’s Vetchies Beach after her son’s primary school organized a cleanup get-together for parents and students last weekend.“We were determined to collect as many as we could,” Bevis said. “I’m sad at the state of our beaches and feel the company responsible should be doing more to help clean up the spill. The general public are doing what they can, but are overwhelmed, and some feel their efforts won’t make an impact.”While spills such as the recent one in Durban and past spills in Hong Kong and the U.K. grab headlines, the bigger issue is the constant trickle of pellets into the environment when they’re produced, transported and manufactured into plastics. These leaks can be the result of bad practice. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined California-based plastic manufacturer Canyon Plastics $19,000 after authorities found spilled nurdles throughout the facility’s waste management area and loading docks. “This is an issue for industry, and it’s industry’s job to clean it up,” said Dr. Jeremy Conkle, head of the Coastal Health and Water Quality Lab at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.One scheme to prevent plastics like nurdles from entering the marine environment is Operation Clean Sweep, an international, industry-devised initiative. Its voluntary nature and lack of auditing, however, makes it hard to know what progress has been made since it began more than 25 years ago, said Sarah Archer, project manager for the environmental charity FIDRA. “We would like to see governments taking action by putting in place legislation that will ensure pellet loss is prevented across the entire supply chain,” Archer said.There isn’t a huge amount of legislation around plastic pollution in the U.S., especially when it comes to making the producers responsible for plastic waste. However, California passed a law in 2008 which specifically names nurdles as a pollutant and bans their discharge into waterways in the state.Nurdles are just one example of how the global economy is addicted to plastic ― and how we ignore the terrible damage it causes. Some 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic have entered the global waste stream since large-scale production began in the 1950s, and around 79 percent of that is now in landfills or scattered across the oceans.“We have an economic system that’s built on making a profit,” said Julie Andersen, global executive director of Plastic Oceans Foundation, “so we need to work out how to engage businesses to bring them into a dialogue to make better decisions, and also how to engage the public so they can understand the economics and use their money wisely.”There is reason to be positive, according to Antonia Gawel, head of the World Economic Forum’s Circular Economy initiative. “There is a model for economic growth that can reverse these trends. We need to migrate to a circular economy where sustainable resources are not just used but re-used,” she said.This model ― in which resources serve a constant purpose through reuse, repurposing and recycling ― is already taking hold, Gawel said, but the challenge is to ramp up the public and private sectors’ progress.For more content and to be part of ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Brunton told The Hollywood Reporter that the actor assaulted him while he was unconscious.,2017-11-11,Actor George Takei has been accused of sexually assaulting a model in 1981.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0675b61f00003b004a547f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former model Scott R. Brunton told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that actor George Takei sexually assaulted him 36 years ago. Brunton, then 23, told the news outlet that Takei groped him without his consent during an evening in the actor’s condo in 1981. Brunton was just begining his career when he met Takei, who was in his mid-40s, saying the men had exchanged numbers and would occasionally run into each other. After breaking up with his boyfriend, Brunton said, he was invited by Takei to dinner and a show. “He was very good at consoling me and understanding that I was upset and still in love with my boyfriend,” Brunton told The Hollywood Reporter. “He was a great ear. He was very good about me spilling my heart on my sleeve.”Brunton said he was invited back to the “Star Trek” actor’s home for a drink, and that’s when Brunton says the assault happen. After Brunton’s second drink at the condo, he said, he began to feel disoriented and dizzy, then passed out.“The next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,” Brunton told The Hollywood Reporter. “I came to and said, ‘What are you doing?!’ I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He goes, ‘You need to relax. I am just trying to make you comfortable. Get comfortable.’” Takei’s representative did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Attempts to contact Brunton were not successful.Brunton said that the incident left him feeling betrayed. He said he told multiple friends about the incident, thinking the media wouldn’t believe his story, but thinks things have changed recently.Brunton’s accusations come in the wake of numerous allegations of sexual misconduct by Hollywood celebrities, including industry mogul Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Louis C.K. The former model says it was actually Takei’s comments after the Spacey accusations that made him come forward publicly.Takei offered a scathing condemnation of Spacey, who was accused of sexual misconduct with a then-14-year-old Anthony Rapp when Spacey was 26.Spacey, as part of his initial statement in response to Rapp’s accusation, said he chose to “live as a gay man,” a move that Takei and many others saw as an attempt to distract attention from the allegation.“When power is used in a non-consensual situation, it is a wrong,” Takei told The Hollywood Reporter in October. “For Anthony Rapp, he has had to live with the memory of this experience of decades ago. For Kevin Spacey, who claims not to remember the incident, he was the older, dominant one who had his way. Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight — that is a deflection. They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.” UPDATE: Takei responded to the allegation on Saturday morning, saying, “The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now.”"

On Friday, Scott R. Brunton recounted in detail the night of the alleged assault, saying that he woke up to find Takei groping him without his consent.Takei responded to Brunton, whom he claims not to remember, in a string of tweets posted Saturday morning. “The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now,” the actor wrote. “I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do.”“But I do take these claims very seriously, and I wanted to provide my response thoughtfully and not out of the moment,” Takei added. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, said he had developed a friendship with Takei, then in his mid-40s, through the gay nightlife scene. One night, he said the two went back to the actor’s home for a drink, which left him feeling dizzy. Brunton claimed he came to with Takei “groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off.”He said he quickly left the apartment and ceased contact with Takei, except for a coffee meet-up years later. The former model said he was “too uncomfortable” at the time to confront the actor. While Brunton said he’s shared the story with friends over the years, he said he chose to come forward now because of Takei’s strong condemnation of Kevin Spacey, who’s at the center of his own sexual misconduct scandal. “Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago,” Takei continued on Twitter. “But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.”The 80-year-old went on to note his appreciation for the support of his partner of more than 30 years, Brad Altman, during this time.

Davis opened the op-ed with a sampling of this week’s news headlines, about the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs that left 26 dead, as well as other shootings in Plano and North Austin.The Sutherland Springs and Plano mass shootings both involved domestic violence in some capacity.“While gun safety may not seem like a feminist issue at first blush, it doesn’t take too much digging to see that women are uniquely vulnerable to and disproportionately the victims of gun violence,” Davis wrote.She cited the harrowing statistics that show how seriously women are affected by gun violence (54 percent of mass shootings, for example, involve domestic violence), and wrote about how important it is that women to take their rage to the ballot box. “Virginia and New Jersey voters just kicked a whole string of NRA-ass-kissing elected officials out of office and replaced them with governors and legislative members who are committed to common-sense gun-safety measures,” she wrote about Tuesday’s elections. Those voters, she said, were “propelled by” women-led groups that work to end gun violence, like Moms Demand Action and Americans for Responsible Solutions, led by former Congresswoman and mass shooting survivor Gabby Giffords. “A wise lawmaker once said to me, ‘Change happens when mama bear gets mad,’” Davis wrote. “Well, in the face of repeated mass shootings around the country and the human carnage left in their wake, mama bear is fire-engine-red mad right now. And she’s not backing down.”Head over to Cosmo to read the whole piece.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Texas city in which there was a recent mass shooting. It is Sutherland Springs, not Sunderland Springs."

Steve Daines (Mont.) and Mike Lee (Utah) announced their decision Friday evening.,2017-11-10,"Roy Moore, the GOP Senate nominee in Alabama, is under growing pressure to step aside amid allegations of sexual misconduct with minors.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0631e01c00002600b344f9.jpeg?cache=vYA6gnmano&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Update: Sen. Bill Cassidy (La.) withdrew his support of Roy Moore on Saturday, joining Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.) and Mike Lee (Utah).Earlier: Two Republican senators withdrew their endorsements of Roy Moore on Friday evening, becoming the first prominent politicians to drop their support for the Alabama Republican nominee in the U.S. Senate race. Moore has been under fire since The Washington Post published a report Thursday detailing allegations from four women who said Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. The most serious story came from Leigh Corfman, who said she was just 14 when Moore sexually assaulted her. While some GOP politicians have said Moore should step aside, Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.) and Mike Lee (Utah) are the first Moore backers to do so. Daines made his announcement on Twitter.Lee revealed his decision to a writer for The Washingtonian, citing both the accusations of Moore’s misconduct and his response to the allegations.The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP, also severed financial ties with Moore on Friday.Moore, a far-right social conservative twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders, was never the so-called Republican establishment’s preferred candidate to fill the Senate seat vacated by the appointment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But with the backing of Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, Moore defeated interim Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) in the GOP primary in September. Trump had endorsed Strange, and a super PAC associated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) spent millions trying to quash Moore’s bid.Moore has drawn the ire of civil rights groups for his extreme positions. Among other stances, Moore has argued that homosexual intercourse should be illegal and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress.Once Moore became the nominee, however, the national Republican Party mostly embraced him, with at least one GOP lawmaker offering that he thought Moore would support tax cuts, a key Republican priority. Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, in a Dec. 12 special election.Since the Post published the accusations of sexual misconduct on Thursday, most GOP leaders have remained hesitant to completely disavow him. McConnell and other prominent Republican senators insisted on a wait-and-see approach on Thursday, arguing that Moore should drop out if additional proof emerges verifying the accounts of the women who spoke to the Post.In Moore’s more detailed response to the accusations on Friday ― the comments that rankled Sen. Lee ― he only firmly denied assaulting Corfman, who claims he engaged in unwanted kissing and groping when she was 14.“It never happened, and I don’t even like hearing it,” Moore said on Sean Hannity’s radio show on Friday.He conceded in the interview that he knew two of the other women, who were 17 and 18 when they say Moore tried to date them, but claimed he never gave them alcohol and he didn’t remember trying to date them.Asked by Hannity if he remembered dating teenagers when he was in his 30s, Moore said, “Not generally, no.”“I don’t remember that, or dating any girl without the permission of her mother,” he added.This article has been updated with more details on the accusations against Roy Moore and his denial Friday."

There, he represents many of the funniest names in the business. He has more than 100 production credits to his name, too, including for the hit shows “Master of None,” “Insecure,” “Broad City” and “Bored to Death.”Becky is also the longtime manager of Louis C.K., whom The New York Times reported on Thursday has a history of masturbating in front of women without their consent. In The New York Times piece, Lee Kernis, a former manager of one of Louis C.K.’s accusers, makes a disturbing claim about Becky, as well: Becky once told Kernis he was upset that Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, two of the Times’ sources, had spoken openly and audaciously about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of them without their consent in a hotel room. Becky told The New York Times that he “never threatened anyone,” but Robert Schroeder, who was Goodman and Wolov’s agent at the time, and Charna Halpern, who runs improvisational comedy clubs, both said the women “felt they had been warned to stop talking,” as The New York Times put it. In the years since then, they didn’t even try to attach themselves to projects associated with Becky, potentially hindering their careers.We reached out to about 20 people we believe to be Becky’s clients ― through their agents, publicists and sometimes via text ― to find out if any of them were considering dropping Becky. So far we’ve gotten radio silence, minus one publicist who told us that she had purposefully ignored our email when we called to follow up.These clients include prominent comedians Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari and Amy Poehler, who is also the co-founder of Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls, an organization dedicated to empowering young women.Additionally, we tried to reach Pamela Adlon, Nasim Pedrad, Horatio Sanz, John Mulaney, Paul W. Downs, Nick Thune, Tom Papa, Bill Burr, Betsy Sodaro, Issa Rae, Paul Brittain, Matt Besser, Dave Attell, Maya Rudolph, Natasha Lyonne, Jake Johnson and Bo Burnham. Journalists who have tried to talk to Becky’s clients in the past about Louis C.K.’s reported behavior have been shut down. During an interview with The Daily Beast’s Marlow Stern in 2015, Ansari spoke passionately about paying attention to women when it came to issues of harassment, sexism and “creepy dudes.” But when the Stern asked him about Louis C.K.’s alleged sexual misconduct, he replied, “I’m not talking about that.”That same year, journalist Megan Koester asked Hart about the rumors. She later wrote that he “responded with incredulity before his handler escorted him away from me.”Amid the seemingly endlessly growing list of harassment and assault allegations in Hollywood, many of the industry’s most famous names have publicly said the industry must take a stand against powerful men behaving badly and the people who protect them. But apparently, Becky’s clients don’t consider themselves among the latter ― at least not yet.Sara Boboltz, Leigh Blickley and Katherine Brooks contributed reporting.

His older brother is Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball, who so far has drawn attention for his poor shooting.But that’s no excuse for the endless stream of puns and references to the incident as TNT analysts broke down the highlights of the Lakers-Wizards game in Washington.

Now the party is embracing it.",2017-11-10,"Virginia Governor-elect Ralph Northam speaks after his election night victory at the campus of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, Nov. 7, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a05fef91c00003b00b3446d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seven years ago, the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act helped doom Democrats to a historic midterm drubbing. Like much of the political landscape pre-Donald Trump, that now feels like ancient history.Back then, the nation’s opinions of the bill were deep underwater. But after Trump’s election as president and a subsequent brush with repeal, the Democrats’ health care law has emerged, for the first time, as a political asset. On average, Americans’ support for the law now outstrips opposition by nearly 8 points, according to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate.While the GOP has never polled especially well on health care, they’re currently running an 18-point deficit on the issue, per Pew Research tracking, up from 7 points in 2010. It’s Trump’s worst issue, according to surveys. A recent release from ABC and The Washington Post found barely over a quarter of respondents impressed with his handling of the health care system, thanks to a combination of universal antipathy from Democrats and relatively tepid support among Republicans. Trump’s score on the economy was 18 points higher.Now that the country is in a period of robust growth, health care has toppled the economy from its usual perch as the nation’s top concern. Democratic voters in particular cite health care as the issue most important to them.Following the attempt at repeal, Democrats, realizing the reforms they’d achieved were subject to reversal, “rallied around the ACA in a way that they hadn’t before,” said Mollyann Brodie, executive director for public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. For the party, she said, “it’s an issue that you don’t have to hide from anymore.” “Health care is as divisive an issue as it’s ever been ― that hasn’t changed,” Brodie said. “What the threats against the ACA show Democrats is that the gains that they’ve made on health care could go away. It makes it an issue that Democratic candidates can embrace as they’re trying to rally their base to turn out. But I wouldn’t expect the Republicans to shy away from it either.”Voters aren’t always reliable narrators of how they made their decisions, but exit polling from Virginia’s gubernatorial race at least suggests that the issue was a rallying point for many Democrats on Tuesday. In that race, a 39 percent plurality of voters told exit pollsters that health care was their top issue. Among that bloc, Northam won more than three-quarters of the votes. (In Virginia’s gubernatorial election of 2013, just 27 percent of voters picked health care as their top issue, with those who did almost evenly split between the Democratic and Republican contenders.)Fox News, which conducted separate election polling of the state, found health care close to tied with the economy in importance, but also highlighted Virginia’s support for the Affordable Care Act. Fifty-eight percent of those polled said the law either was about right or didn’t go far enough; those voters went for Northam by a wide margin.“Health care was central to our campaign,” Northam’s pollster, Geoff Garin, told HuffPost. “The best known fact about either candidate was that Ralph is a doctor. Even in our negative ads, the disclaimer showed Ralph as a pediatrician... In our ads criticizing [Republican nominee Ed] Gillespie for lobbying for the Trump agenda, health care was one of the prime examples we used.” Further north, residents of Maine voted overwhelmingly to expand Medicaid in the state, in the face of national efforts to scale the program.Health care, of course, wasn’t directly on the ballot in most races. And it’s certainly not the only thing lifting Democrats, whose success Tuesday seemed buoyed by a hostility toward Trump that transcends any one issue, not to mention their structural advantage as the opposition party.It’s also unclear what role health care will play in the national debate a year from now. The bill’s failure likely blunted the edge of what might have been a reckoning for Republicans along the lines of what Democrats faced in 2010 after the passage of the Affordable Care Act. But Democrats, who once ducked discussion of the issue, now seem more than happy to let it take center stage."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0620ce1b00004800376929.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One year ago, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood before an audience at a Ritz-Carlton hotel in California and dismissed the idea that misinformation spread on Facebook could have influenced the outcome of the exhausting, divisive election the U.S. had just experienced.“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook ― of which it’s a small amount of content ― influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said at the time. What a difference a year makes. Zuckerberg has since said he regretted his earlier statement, explaining in a Facebook post in September, “This is too important an issue to be dismissive.”And we’ve learned that the misinformation in question was more than just misguided white lies: It was actively planted on Facebook (and on Twitter, Google, Instagram, YouTube and Reddit ― hell, even on Pokémon Go) by Russia-linked actors looking to sow division. More troubling still, the people behind those lies knew exactly what buttons to push to have the greatest effect. Odd as the ads were, some had shockingly high response rates ― as much as 24 percent in some cases, according to data released by the House Intelligence Committee.In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, for instance, we’ve learned that Russia paid Facebook to display highly targeted ads to precise demographics in key areas of the state. The ads didn’t endorse one candidate over the other. Instead, they pushed divisive, issue-based messages intended to outrage Americans and turn them against each other. A Facebook analysis in September specifically mentioned ads that touched on gay rights, race issues, immigration and gun rights.Donald Trump went on to win Wisconsin (which, prior to 2016, had voted for a Democrat in every presidential election since 1984) by just 22,748 votes. And at 10,704 votes, his margin of victory in Michigan was closer still ― indeed, the closest presidential race in Michigan’s history.Ultimately, Russia paid Facebook (in rubles, no less) $100,000 to run 3,000 targeted ads around the country, buying an audience of around 10 million people ― a population roughly equivalent to that of the entire state of North Carolina.We’ve also learned that Russia’s digital reach extended far beyond paid ads alone. On top of the 3,000 ads, an additional 80,000 Facebook posts, linked to 120 actively managed Facebook pages, have so far been linked to the Russian government.Those posts were seen by around 29 million Americans, who helped spread them to at least 126 million Americans overall. An additional 20 million encountered the content on Instagram.Thanks to Facebook alone, more than half of all eligible voters in the U.S. were exposed to and interacted with Russian propaganda between January 2015 and August 2017. So far, Facebook has resisted calls to notify those who were exposed.To be fair, it’s unclear just how much influence Russia’s content had, especially in light of the Trump campaign’s own substantial digital advertising push. But the sophisticated targeting should have everyone concerned ― not the least of all Facebook, whose services made it possible.Yet despite these revelations and Facebook’s repeated pledges to do a better job of self-governing, the internet behemoth still continues to downplay its frightening power both at home and abroad. (For example, human rights groups have denounced Facebook for failing to take down posts that promote violence against Rohingya Muslims, a persecuted minority in Myanmar.)This is nothing new for Zuckerberg and company. In 2011, Facebook was outraged when the Federal Election Commission considered implementing rules that would have helped avoid the very scenario that played out in last year’s election. At the time, Facebook lawyer Colin Stretch warned the government not to “stand in the way of innovation.”As recently as this month, Facebook dispatched Stretch to deflect scathing testimony from lawmakers who are once again pursuing regulations, this time with a bit more urgency. The legislation in question, known as the “Honest Ads Act,” would force online advertisers like Facebook to adhere to the same disclosure rules for political ads as traditional media companies.Stretch (and his counterparts at Twitter and Google) conceded that they could have done more to weed out the deliberate falsehoods peddled on their platforms, and they acknowledged that the foreign interference represented “an existential threat to our democracy.” But once again, they stopped short of actually embracing government regulation itself."

Most notably, Democrats stood as one against the GOP’s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The question is whether he can do it again on tax reform.In August, Schumer wrote a letter to President Donald Trump and GOP leaders in the Senate about the Democratic conditions for working together on a bipartisan tax bill. In particular, he said they could not support tax reform that delivered tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent or added to the deficit. The entire Democratic caucus joined Schumer on the letter, except for three senators ― Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.), all moderate members up for re-election in 2018. The White House has been courting these senators too, sensing that they might be open to a deal. In an interview with HuffPost this week, Schumer said each member will vote as he or she likes, but he’s warning them that going along with the GOP tax bill will not help them politically. “Every member will vote his or her conscience, but I’m telling our members that this bill is not going to be a popular bill,” he said. “In fact, for the Republicans, it’s a lose-lose. They either lose the bill, and that creates some chaos here, or they lose because they passed a bill that’s unpopular with the American people and can be used as a pretty strong weapon against them.”“Schumer has been very helpful on this issue,” Manchin spokesman Jonathan Kott said. “He meets and speaks regularly with Manchin to point out the problems with the bill, but gives him the room to do what he thinks is best.”The tax plan that Senate Republicans unveiled on Thursday benefits corporations and the wealthy. It calls for cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.“The public seems to be opposed to it, by the polling data,” Schumer said of the GOP framework. “So I think our unity is staying strong, both on the basis of what we believe and on the basis that it’s not getting a great reception. Now, the Koch brothers and the others will spend millions on ads. But so far, that hasn’t had much effect.”Schumer has tried to work with Trump. The president notably sided with him and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in September on a deal to raise the debt ceiling and continue funding the government, over the objections of Republican leaders in Congress. Schumer and Pelosi also thought they had a deal with Trump in September on extending protections for young undocumented immigrants, although Trump later backed off what they said he promised. As a fellow boisterous New Yorker, Schumer is known to have a rapport with Trump that many other politicians in Washington don’t. But it doesn’t mean that they’re best friends. Trump often slams Schumer, and after an attack in Manhattan, the president essentially blamed the senator for the terrorist’s entry into the United States.“When he tweets ― and he either praises me or calls me names ― not only does it not affect me in terms of what actions I take ... it doesn’t even bother me,” Schumer said. “It’s Donald Trump. He tweets ridiculous things all the time.”Schumer said he’s still willing to work with Trump ― but only if it doesn’t compromise the Democratic Party’s values. “I’m not going to obstruct him for its own sake, nor am I going to compromise for its own sake,” he added. “If we can keep our values and get something done by working with him, fine. So far, he’s been so hard right it’s been impossible. If it changes, it’s welcome. But even when you cut a deal with him, he backs off the next day ― like with the [undocumented immigrant] kids.”"

On Tuesday, a wave of anti-Trump sentiment propelled a middling Democrat to Virginia’s",2017-11-10,Supporters listen and look on as Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie delivers his concession speech.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a060ee71c00003b00b344ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"First published in The Boston Globe.On Tuesday, a wave of anti-Trump sentiment propelled a middling Democrat to Virginia’s governorship and wiped out GOP legislators across the state. Trumpism was on the ballot — desperate to win, the GOP’s gubernatorial candidate stoked the passions of Trump’s base, inflaming racial anxieties and defending Confederate monuments. This proved to be a kamikaze mission.Now Republicans across America must confront an existential question: Will President Trump become an electoral poison pill? The immediate implications are clear – trouble for the GOP’s legislative agenda, and its congressional candidates in 2018. But the larger issue is what lies beyond.Within the GOP, whispers intensify: In the 2020 presidential race, would it fare better without Trump? But with whom? Indeed, who would brave the anger of the base? In the wake of Trump, what has the GOP become? And would an effort to replace him tear Republicans apart.A survey of potential candidates illustrates this dilemma. All have real problems — because of who they are, or how the party has devolved. Republican politics are increasingly tribal instead of ideological: The base hews to Trump because they loathe his enemies. Just ask Senators Bob Corker or Jeff Flake.In 2016, Trump sacked the GOP establishment by inflaming its restive base. Little suggests that their unruly passions are easily transferable to a more decorous successor.Start with Vice President Mike Pence. His talents are those of a servile schemer, faking ostentatious loyalty while awaiting Trump’s fall. His electoral appeal is dubious – prior to becoming Trump’s running mate, he struggled for reelection as Indiana’s governor.Pence is a pious phony — an advocate of strict morality who rose by providing craven testament for the libertine Trump. The GOP’s blue-collar legions may have swallowed Trump’s fake populism, but Pence’s donor-friendly platitudes will never fly. The Koch brothers own him.He also exemplifies how Trump diminishes all who serve him. Witness Pence’s latest pantomime of fealty — a showy exit from a professional football game, under orders from Trump, because players knelt in protest during the national anthem. Trump has exposed him as a sock puppet, not a president.But at least Pence can hope to become president by default. His potential rivals may be forced to challenge Trump directly.Not that Ted Cruz would mind. The role of Brutus suits him — there is no pretender more contriving than the dank Prince of Darkness.A sequence of transparent calculations doomed his 2016 campaign. He began as a tribune of the Tea Party, precipitating a government shutdown while castigating Republican leaders as cowards. Unremarkably, his colleagues loathe him.A second misstep was embracing retrograde social conservatism, angling to monopolize evangelicals. But Trump stole them in droves. His subsequent decimation in northern primaries exposed the narrowness of his appeal.He surfaced anew as the sanctimonious skunk at Trump’s convention, climaxing a self-aggrandizing speech about political conscience with his refusal to endorse — until opprobrium within the base compelled him to re-orient his conscience. But the apostasy lingers.His more recent calculations include calling the Russia probe a “political circus” while decrying racism in Charlottesville. But he is stuck with the oleaginous manner of a second-tier televangelist, complete with histrionics and an air of sincerity that is transparently insincere. No candidate so repellent can heal a wounded party — let alone inspire the electorate at large.But in 2016 Marco Rubio established the limits of inspiration.Instead of substance, Rubio offered us ... himself. His campaign resembled a perpetual Fourth of July, featuring a touching origin speech — complete with humble parents who achieved the American dream — delivered so movingly that tears welled in one’s eyes. Until one heard it for the 50th time.But who was Rubio, really? A too-young man in far too big a hurry, forever shape-shifting in pursuit of the ultimate prize. As a Senate candidate, he took a hard line on immigration reform; as a budding presidential aspirant, he became a leading sponsor of an immigration reform bill. Until, confronted with anger within the base, he sold out his cosponsors and repudiated his own bill. Climbing was the only meaning of Rubio’s American dream.There was no real Rubio constituency because there was no real Rubio. Trounced by Trump, he reversed his prior insistence that he was done with the Senate. Now he is re-taking old ground as a defender of national security and human rights. But these are not burning issues in Trump’s nativist GOP.Then there’s Trump’s dour understudy, Tom Cotton.Here’s Cotton in a nutshell: A 40-year-old senator from Arkansas. A hardliner on immigration. A foe of criminal justice reform. A favorite of right-wing ideologues and evangelicals. An opponent of equal pay for women.Of the would-be’s, Cotton fares best at echoing Trump. He defends Trump against the Russia probe. He parrots the cultural resentments that animate Trump’s followers. He shares Trump’s fervor for the Wall. And so on.Like Cruz, he is an educated man who caters to fear and ignorance — and is as charmless as an undertaker. Should Trump go down, Cotton may wrest the hard right from Pence and Cruz. But he lacks Trump’s gift for mass provocation, and one doubts the general electorate will cotton to a flavorless facsimile.In contrast, John Kasich has the most potential in a general election, for the precise reasons he will probably never get there. He is a son of the working class who acts like one. He praises decency and compromise. He advocates free trade yet cares about struggling workers. But he is a relative moderate who opposed Trump throughout, and that will damn him among a primary electorate whose animus Trump channels. So, also, with Corker, Flake, or Senator Ben Sasse, all alien to the unmoored outrage that is crack cocaine for the base.In retrospect, Trump was an electoral freak – he galvanized blue-collar voters suspicious of the GOP establishment while holding Republicans to whom Hillary Clinton was anathema. Trump’s base is shrinking but stalwart — recent polling among Republicans shows Trump slaughtering Pence, Cruz, and Kasich. Absent a full-blown scandal or economic or foreign disaster, the GOP is stuck with an irredeemable narcissist indifferent to its plight. To replace him would probably fracture the party, leaving a survivor with diminished Republican support yet tarred by Trump among the general electorate. Having given the GOP a stunning victory, Trump has become its future — and its fate.Richard North Patterson’s column appears regularly in the Boston Globe.

More than a dozen states have purchased some type of cyber insurance to protect themselves and taxpayers if they are victimized by hackers.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a05bc9b1f000017004a5288.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In recent years, hackers and cybercriminals have taken aim at state and local government networks, and online activists have hijacked government computer systems, defaced websites, and hacked into data or email and released it online.By Jenni BergalAs the threat from hackers and cybercriminals intensifies, a growing number of states are buying cyber insurance to protect themselves — and taxpayers.“It’s expensive. It’s a big budget item for us. But it’s absolutely worth it,” said Michael Hussey, Utah’s chief information officer. “You’re seeing breaches now that cost companies and states millions and millions of dollars.”More than a dozen states now have cyber insurance policies, which cover losses and expenses if a computer network is hacked. Insurers typically pick up the cost of investigating and restoring data, notifying those whose information may have been compromised, and providing legal and public relations services and credit monitoring. Hussey said Utah first bought a policy in 2015, three years after a data breach of a Department of Health server exposed 780,000 residents’ personal information to hackers. The state wound up spending millions of dollars to deal with the aftermath, including paying for credit monitoring and legal fees and conducting a security assessment of all state servers.Utah now pays $230,000 a year for $10 million in cyber coverage and has a $1 million deductible. The policy covers every agency in the executive branch.So far, the state hasn’t had any big data breaches that would require filing a claim, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future, Hussey said.“We check what we’re supposed to be checking,” he said. “But with cyber, if one little thing is overlooked or you have bad luck and leave something undone, you’d hate to be left holding the bag to cover that.”A Growing MarketIn the wake of massive data breaches like those involving Yahoo last year and Anthem the year before, many businesses have scrambled to buy cyber insurance. Last year, insurers wrote $1.35 billion in premiums, a 35 percent jump from 2015, according to Fitch Ratings.States have been following in their footsteps. In a survey of state CIOs this year, 38 percent reported having some type of cyber insurance, compared to 20 percent in 2015.Even some small cities, such as Cody, Wyoming, have purchased cyber coverage this year.Hackers and cybercriminals in recent years have taken aim at state and local government networks, which contain information such as Social Security, bank account and credit card numbers on millions of people and businesses. And online activists have hijacked government computer systems, defaced websites, and hacked into data or email and released it online.In 2016, state information technology officers ranked cybersecurity as their top priority for the third year in a row.James Lynch, chief actuary for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, said selling cyber insurance to states is especially challenging.“What states do is so diffuse and sprawling, and they deal with so many types of people and circumstances that it’s difficult for an insurance company to fully get a grasp on what those risks are and underwrite them all,” he said.It can be equally challenging for those purchasing cyber insurance, he added.“When you buy an auto policy, you have a pretty good idea what’s in it. The terminology is highly standardized. It’s been vetted through the courts,” Lynch said. “You don’t have that in cyber because the product is so new. The actual things being covered also vary greatly from policy to policy.”And government agencies sometimes don’t understand the risks or what kind of coverage they’ll need, cyber experts say.“Some states and local governments don’t even know where their data is or what they’ve got,” said Dan Lohrmann, chief security officer for Security Mentor, a national security training firm that works with states. “So when you start having to give the insurer a list of how many servers you have and what systems are included, it gets pretty complicated.”Lohrmann said many state IT security officials initially were wary of cyber insurance, figuring they’d rather spend their limited resources on prevention. But many now take a different view, he said, because they realize that having the insurance will ensure that they are keeping their security programs up to snuff. Insurers won’t sell states policies unless they meet certain standards, including regularly training staff, encrypting sensitive data and updating servers.In Georgia, Chief Technology Officer Steve Nichols said he was skeptical about cyber insurance at first, but when he saw how many giant companies had breaches and the financial impact, he changed his mind.In July, Georgia bought comprehensive cyber insurance, which covers about a hundred state agencies, he said.Nichols said he thinks Georgia has the largest amount of cyber coverage of any state — $100 million. It pays a $1.8 million-a-year premium and has a $250,000 deductible per incident.The state relied on a broker to guide it through the “very confusing and complicated” process and put together a deal with a consortium of insurers, he said.Using Cyber InsuranceMontana was the first state to get cyber insurance, in 2011, said Lynne Pizzini, chief IT security officer. And it’s glad it did.Three years later, hackers gained access to a server that contained Department of Public Health and Human Services data, including clients’ names and Social Security numbers and some health information. The state mailed letters about the incident to more than a million people who could have been affected.Pizzini said the insurance company helped with the mailings, set up a call center, and provided forensic investigation, legal and communications assistance, and credit monitoring.“We used all of the services in our insurance policy,” she said. “It would have cost us a ton more than the premium we pay.”The state has a $2 million policy, which covers all agencies, including the university system, she said. It pays an $88,200 annual premium and has a $100,000 deductible per incident and a 10 percent copayment for credit monitoring.But Pizzini and IT officials in other states caution that having cyber insurance shouldn’t make states complacent and view it as a substitute for a comprehensive security program. While the coverage can be a big help after the fact, they say, states need to invest in security, keep their technology updated, and be prepared for hackers and cybercriminals.“It’s like brushing your teeth,” Georgia’s Nichols said. “You need to do it every day.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"

74,POLITICS,Democrats Sit Back And Let Republicans Struggle With The Roy Moore Scandal,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-democrats_us_5a050b13e4b01d21c83da8bf,GOP senators had to face questions about whether they will stand by the Alabama Senate candidate.,2017-11-10,Four women say Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore sexually pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0512581c00002600b342aa.jpeg?cache=FwgaVRNbEi&ops=crop_10_383_5147_3055%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican senators spent Thursday afternoon fielding reporters’ questions about whether they stand behind a man who is accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Democratic senators, meanwhile, stepped back and watched the whirlwind consume them.The Washington Post reported Thursday that four women have said Roy Moore, the GOP’s nominee for senator in Alabama’s special election, sexually pursued them when they were between the ages of 14 and 18 and he was in his 30s.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was one of the only GOP politicians to come out and say, unequivocally, that Moore needs to step aside. Most of his colleagues said that “if” the allegations are true, they would disavow Moore. All four women in the Post story were on the record, with their names and photographs in the story. The senators did not say what additional proof they need.Moore called The Washington Post’s story “fake news” and “intentional defamation.”Some state politicians and conservative pundits defended Moore. They gave him a pass by claiming that the interactions were consensual and that he didn’t do anything but kiss the 14-year-old girl. (The Washington Post, by the way, reported that Moore did far more to Leigh Corfman than kiss her.) Republicans now face some uncomfortable questions: Do they cut ties with Moore? What does the Republican National Committee do with its joint fundraising agreement with Moore? Do they back a write-in campaign for someone else? And does it all get awkward considering the president has also been accused of sexual assault by a number of women?Democrats were more than happy Thursday to let Republicans deal with this mess on their own. The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee were conspicuously quiet. The campaign of Democrat Doug Jones, Moore’s opponent, put out nothing but a short statement that read: “Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.”The Alabama special election, scheduled for Dec. 12, had already been attracting national attention. Moore was known for being the deeply conservative chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, where he ordered state probate judges to ignore the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on marriage equality. Over the past few weeks, HuffPost talked to Democrats far from Alabama ― in New York, Washington, D.C. and Alaska ― who all held small-dollar fundraisers for Jones. “After Hillary Clinton lost, I told myself I’d do anything I can to make sure the right candidates win,” said Betsy Qualls, who is originally from Alabama but now lives in Alaska.Kindred Motes, an Alabama native who now lives in New York City, said he was shocked when he heard that Moore, a man who had been twice removed from the bench for flouting the law, could be the state’s next senator. “There’s a real groundswell of support for progressive politics in Alabama. It’s just not being covered, and it’s only happening largely in the major cities ... That struck us all as a place where we can have an impact. We can’t be on the ground there, but it doesn’t mean we’re any less Alabamian,” Motes said. Democrats acknowledge that even with the new Moore revelations, the race is tough for them in the conservative state. There is still a real chance that Moore will be the next senator. There remains a significant amount of debate within the party about whether the national committees should get more involved, and whether such activity would help or hurt Jones. Party officials did not immediately jump in and announce a change of strategy on Thursday.Democratic senators did, however, start to step up some of their fundraising for Jones. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) all sent out or tweeted solicitations for Jones after the scandal broke.Moore, meanwhile, also sent out an email and used the report that he sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl to raise money from his supporters.

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-duterte-meeting_us_5a03707ee4b0f76b05c32244,Thousands have been killed in the Philippines president’s war on drugs. The White House says Trump has a ‘warm rapport’ with him.,2017-11-10,"Catholic nuns participate in a protest in Manila on Nov. 5, 2017, calling for an end to killings in Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a037d271f00003b004a4e27.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has been accused of ordering the killings of thousands of his citizens in his “war on drugs.” He has told human rights activists he will have them shot, too, if they protest. He has imprisoned his critics.And in the coming days Duterte will get a face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump as the U.S. president wraps up his current trip to Asia. The two leaders, according to the White House, have established “a warm rapport.”“It’s incredibly troubling,” said Joanne Lin, an Amnesty International official. “If you look at Duterte’s record, he has overseen this campaign of extrajudicial killings. The evidence is overwhelming.”It’s evidence that Trump’s own State Department cited in its annual human rights report released earlier this year, which found that Duterte targeted government officials, police, members of the military and judges, accusing them of being drug dealers.Duterte’s government, the report said “has not revealed the source” of the information backing up the drug-dealing accusations, “and the accuracy and legitimacy of the lists has been questioned.”“Some individuals named on the lists were subsequently killed in either police operations or suspected vigilante killings,” the report said.A senior administration official nevertheless said Trump was eager to meet with Duterte.“They’ve had exchanges of letters,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “I think there’s a warm rapport there, and he’s very much looking forward to his first in-person meeting with President Duterte.”Duterte is only the latest in a line of authoritarian leaders accused of human rights abuses with whom Trump has met and ― more to the point ― praised. The others:Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who according to human rights groups, imprisoned thousands of dissidents and sanctioned the killings of some 800 protesters in a single day after seizing power in a coup. Trump said Sisi had done “a fantastic job in a very difficult situation.”“He keeps congratulating authoritarians for doing non-democratic things,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a top official at the Pentagon and the State Department under Obama. “You don’t make congratulatory calls for purges. You make congratulatory calls to people who win democratic elections.”Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said Trump does bring up human rights concerns, just not in public remarks. “We’ve seen him do it quietly in every relationship,” McMaster said. “And so how much does it help to yell about these problems? It hasn’t really delivered in recent history, anyway.”Lin, the Amnesty International official, said that publicly calling out human rights abusers has been something that U.S. presidents have been doing for decades. “This president has shown little interest, to put it mildly,” she said. “Human rights and refugee protection are not top of mind for him at all.”Duterte on Wednesday bluntly answered Filipino reporters who asked how he would respond if Trump questioned his human rights record during their meeting.“Lay off. That is not your business,” Duterte said he would tell Trump. “That is my business. I take care of my country and I will nurture my country to health.”Lin said Trump’s meeting with Duterte is a particularly galling because the Filipino president has been so open about his lack of interest in following social norms. “He’s even said he would pardon police who are convicted of crimes,” Lin said, but then laughed. “Which sounds so ludicrous, except that’s what our president has done.”Lin was referring to Trump ally and former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court but was then pardoned by Trump. That willingness to override the rule of law, said Goldenberg, suggests that the core problem may be that Trump relates more with authoritarian rulers than he does with democratically elected ones.Goldenberg pointed to a recent interview in which Trump complained that he is not permitted to direct the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate his political enemies. He added that Saudi King Salman’s creation of an “anti-corruption committee” to justify his recent purge probably piqued Trump’s interest.“You can imagine Trump reading that and thinking: ‘That sounds like a good idea,’” Goldenberg said. “ ‘Why can’t I do that?’”He also said that the damage to America’s standing around the world from Trump’s attitude will be considerable. “When there’s no difference between us and Russia and China in these democratic values, what do we have?” he said. “That is the one thing we have to offer. And when we lose that, what is our advantage?” "

The Justice Department had first called for RT America to register as a foreign agent in September. Such a registration would require any reporting to be labeled as being financed or influenced by the Russian government, among other restrictions. Russian news media and social media actors have come under scrutiny after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia sought to interfere with the U.S. presidential election to help Donald Trump win.  In its January report, U.S. intelligence called RT “the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet,” saying it was part of “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine,” which had “contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging.”RT denies that it is an agent of the Russian government and says on its site that it offers “stories overlooked by mainstream media” and “alternative perspectives.”“We believe that the demand does not only go against the law, and we will prove it in court,” RT’s editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said Thursday, according to the website. “The demand is discriminative, it contradicts both the democracy and freedom of speech principles.” The Russian embassy fired back at the DOJ’s request in a statement on Facebook Thursday:“The Russian side has repeatedly warned that any measures limiting activity of the Russian mass media in the United States will inevitably trigger an immediate symmetrical response,” the Russian embassy posted.
