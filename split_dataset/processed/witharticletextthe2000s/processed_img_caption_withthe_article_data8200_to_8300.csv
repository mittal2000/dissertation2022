Shaw - Professor of Women, Gender, & Sexuality Studies, Oregon State University",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57768e861900001800218f96.jpg?ops=100_100,"No sooner had the vile words flooded the airways than did some prominent evangelical leaders step forward to reiterate their support for Donald Trump. Ralph Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition and now chair of Trump’s religious advisory committee, and Robert Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, assured us that despite Trump’s lewd comments, he is still the best candidate.I’m not surprised. Misogyny is a recurring theme of much of evangelical history—much of Christian history, actually—and sacrificing women to supposed higher religious truths, both literally and metaphorically, is a longstanding tactic of religious men in power. We can look to the witch burnings in Europe and the United States, of which 75 percent of the victims were women, for a literal example. A metaphorical example comes from my own tradition—Southern Baptists.In 1984, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution excluding women from pastoral leadership “to preserve a submission God requires because the man was first in creation and the woman was first in the Edenic fall.” In 2000, the Convention amended its confessional statement, “The Baptist Faith and Message,” adding a section on the family that states, “A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband.”Evangelicals who hold to these beliefs will argue they are rooted in biblical truth—yet the Bible also says husbands and wives are to submit themselves to one another and offers multiple examples of women who served in ministry—from Mary Magdalene to Phoebe to Lydia. What these particular evangelical interpretations do is provide a self-serving justification for men’s power over women in church and home and society.And a number of Christian men do worry about women’s power. Just do a quick google search to see all of the hand-wringing over the “feminization of Christianity.” The response to this supposed problem has been the revival of “muscular Christianity”—an association of Jesus and his male followers with masculine qualities of toughness, athleticism, competitiveness, and power. In other words, Christianity for a certain kind of evangelical man rests on the repudiation of everything associated with women—especially their supposed weakness.The male-bonding rituals of muscular Christianity, then, are not all that different from Trump’s locker room banter. They may not use his vulgar language, but they still rally around their male identity. Let me give you another example from my own experience. I was teaching at an evangelical Christian college when the chair of the religion department was arrested for making sexually harassing phone calls to a woman. In our next department meeting (I was the only woman on the religion faculty), the men suggested we pray for the chair. I responded that perhaps we should pray for the woman he had sexually harassed (we did not). After the meeting, one of my colleagues pulled me aside to tell me he was concerned that I was becoming “too feminist.”I’m also not surprised some evangelicals are still supporting Trump because I’ve witnessed the ways some evangelical leaders have been more than willing to believe that the end justifies the means. In this case, they believe supporting Trump will ensure appointments to the Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v. Wade and marriage equality. I witnessed leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention in the 1980s use any means necessary to seize power from the more moderate forces that had led the Convention for decades. I was in seminary at the time when they had students record faculty lectures which they would then excerpt and publish out of context to demonstrate a faculty member’s heresies. They used their power as moderators of Convention discussions to prevent the public expression of dissent. They bent the rules to ensure they attained and retained absolute power, and then they set out to purge the Convention’s seminaries and agencies of those they deemed as “liberals.”Another reason I’m not surprised that some evangelicals are still supporting Trump is that some of them have a record of willingness to sacrifice real people for abstract principles. This isn’t surprising from people who think ideas are more real than individual human beings and that theological orthodoxy is more important than the practice of lovingkindness to the people right in front of them.I’m also not surprised because some evangelicals have embraced a kind of civil religion that sees the government as a conduit for imposing particular interpretations of Christian faith on all Americans through law and public policy. Instead of using evangelical tools of witness and persuasion to win people to faith, they have resorted to trying to use the government to coerce all citizens into a theocracy of their own making.Is this all evangelicals? Of course not. In fact, quite an impressive list of them has signed onto a letter denouncing Trump, drawing from their own understandings of the Bible, theology, and their own practices of Christian faith.But as for those who remain steadfastly loyal to Trump, again, I’m not surprised. I’ve seen this side of the story up close and personally before. Even when couched in Paul Ryan’s language of the need to “revere” women, it’s still misogyny. And it’s still deeply rooted in one subculture of evangelical Christianity."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,'Star Trek: Discovery' Has Plenty Of Room To Exist In The 'Prime' Timeline (Spoilers),"S. Daniel Carter, ContributorCampus Security Consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/star-trek-discovery-has-plenty-of-room-to-exist-in_us_57facaf7e4b090dec0e71699,"While I enjoy the Star Trek films that have been released since 2009, it was good to hear that the next TV series Star Trek",2016-10-09,"S. Daniel Carter with the original filming model of the U.S.S. Enterprise at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57facc63170000f409aca9d0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While I enjoy the Star Trek films that have been released since 2009, it was good to hear that the next TV series Star Trek: Discovery would be set in what is known to fans as the “prime” timeline. For those who do not know, the current movie series is set in an alternate timeline from all of the TV series that proceeded it. There is an interesting theory among some fans that in creating the alternate timeline the “prime” one no longer exists which would be problematic for Discovery. I believe, however, that there is significant precedent for timelines to coexist alongside each other in Star Trek.In the 2009 Star Trek movie it is revealed that Ambassador Spock, of the crew of the original U.S.S. Enterprise, traveled back in time from 2387 taking his Romulan nemesis Nero with him. Nero, captain of the mining vessel Narada arrived in 2233 having sworn vengeance on the entire United Federation of Planets and destroyed the Federation’s U.S.S. Kelvin creating an alternate timeline. Upon Spock’s arrival 25 years later, Nero continues to further change the timeline by destroying Vulcan and attacking Earth before being defeated by the crew of what is a very different U.S.S. Enterprise. This suggests the adventures we followed on the original series and all that followed it, sans possibly Enterprise, never happened or certainly as we saw them. I include Enterprise because it features references to the events of Star Trek: First Contact in which the crew of the Enterprise-E go back in time to the mid 21st Century to stave off a Borg attempt to change history, something that would presumably be affected if their 24th Century timeline itself no longer exists.The history of Star Trek is replete with stories where our heroes must “fix” the timeline once it has been altered so that it returns to the way things are supposed to be. The best known is perhaps the classic “The City on the Edge of Forever” in which Dr. McCoy accidentally travels back to 20th Century Earth changing history so that Germany wins World War II and there is no United Federation of Planets. Captain James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock have to follow and fix this damage. Upon their return history is restored and all is as they knew it suggesting that other timeline is simply gone.Other stories, however, suggest things might not quite be this simple. In “Trials and Tribble-ations” the crew of the 24th Century U.S.S. Defiant follows a disgruntled Klingon agent determined to assassinate Captain Kirk back to the 23rd Century. Of course they prevent his treachery and return to their own familiar timeline. For the first time though there are cracks in everything being exactly the same, due in part simply to production necessities and a plot that intelligently recognizes the incongruity of things going perfectly back to normal like nothing different happened at all.Using footage from the original series “The Trouble With Tribbles”, the 24th Century Defiant crew interact with the 23rd Century Enterprise crew. They are present at some very notable historical moments including an epic bar fight on Space Station K-7 between Enterprise crew-members and Klingons, and some Defiant crew, including Chief Miles Edward O’Brien, end up replacing Enterprise crew members when being interrogated by Captain Kirk about the brawl. The original series episode features the original scenes while Deep Space Nine features the new scenes suggesting both timelines coexist.While this could easily be chalked up to not tinkering with a classic episode of the original series even when there was a chance to re-edit it for re-release, the story actually introduces a perfect explanation. Defiant Captain Benjamin Sisko, upon his return to the 24th Century and his post aboard Deep Space Nine, is subject to a review by Temporal Investigations. Their job is to identify changes to the timeline (although exactly what they do with such information is unclear), and upon being informed that Captain Kirk was involved the investigators call him a “menace” with “seventeen separate temporal violations”. By this time the Federation is clearly sophisticated enough to recognize alternate timelines are being created, something they would expand on in the 29th Century as seen on Star Trek: Voyager and the 31st Century as seen on Star Trek: Enterprise with a wide-ranging “Temporal Cold War” where factions actually fought to create alternate timelines.The strongest argument for co-existing timelines though is found in The Next Generation episode “Parallels”. In this episode, Lt. Worf finds himself accidentally moving from one parallel universe to another. In each case subtle and sometimes not so subtle differences exist based on outcomes of previous events being different. In the end at least 285,000 versions of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D are brought together in a successful effort to get Worf back to his timeline.Finally, because Discovery is set 10 years before the original series, placing it around 2255, it exists in a timeline that in any case still exists at least as an echo. If the “prime” timeline did in fact come to an end in 2387 what came before would still exist as a past reality (albeit presumably inaccessible from the outside). The Ambassador Spock that arrived from the future in 2258 had to come from somewhere, as did a photograph of him with the crew of the original Enterprise from 2287 that was passed along to the new timeline’s younger Spock upon Spock Prime’s death in 2263 as seen in Star Trek Beyond. There was much we never saw of that timeline, giving Star Trek: Discovery ample room to further explore the deep history of Star Trek no differently than watching an episode of Star Trek on Netflix is not invalid because of a timeline change."

Bolduc -- The Real Donald, The Real Tough Guy","Robert David Jaffee, ContributorNovelist, journalist, mental-health activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brig-gen-donald-c-bolduc-the-real-donald-the_us_57fac8e2e4b0d786aa52b6ce,"Donald Trump likes to be hailed as the Donald, but the only thing definite about him, besides his hatred, pathological lying",2016-10-09,"Robert David Jaffee - Novelist, journalist, mental-health activist",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5787c4911a00001c00dd15d9.jpeg?ops=100_100,"Donald Trump likes to be hailed as the Donald, but the only thing definite about him, besides his hatred, pathological lying, stupidity and sadism, is that he is a fraud as a man and a fraud as a tough guy.He likes to surround himself with people like Bob Knight, the former Army, Indiana University and Olympic basketball coach, and Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight boxing champion, but Donald Trump is not and never has been a warrior or a fighter for anything except his own preening, solipsistic needs for trumpeting his name, extending his 15 minutes of infamy and gaining contracts so that he can build shrines to the Trump brand all over the world.Trump’s fraudulence, to say nothing of his sadism, has never been more apparent than when he denigrates the health of other people.By now the list is pretty familiar, so here are just a few highlights:He mocked Serge F. Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter with a disability, a rare congenital disorder that affects, among other things, his ability to use his hand.He ridiculed Hillary Clinton for stumbling as she got onto a van when she had pneumonia.And he questioned whether or not our troops are tough enough if they “can’t handle” life when they come back to this country after serving in combat.Of course, as I have written before, Trump himself got a medical deferment, as well as four academic deferments, which allowed him to duck the Vietnam War.Yet he had the gall to cast doubt on whether John McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for some five years, was a true war hero.With all that in mind, I was thrilled to see that the New York Times ran a story this weekend, a Saturday profile, in which its reporter, Dionne Searcey, wrote about Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, who has served eight, eight!, tours in a war zone and who is a leading advocate on behalf of troops with PTSD.As Searcey wrote, General Bolduc, a Green Beret, has endured countless traumas on the battlefield, including a helicopter crash and the detonation of a 2,000-pound bomb right by him. The signs of his trauma have included headaches, lack of balance while walking, insomnia, undoubtedly nightmares, and a “bullet-sized spot on his brain.” According to Searcey, it took General Bolduc 12 years from the first signs of his trauma to seek help for his PTSD.Now, the combat veteran, who leads our Special Operations Forces in Africa, “has become an evangelist for letting soldiers know that it is all right to get help for brain injuries and mental health problems.”As Searcey wrote, one of Bolduc’s missions is to convince soldiers that there is nothing weak about having a mental illness, such as PTSD or depression, and that there is nothing weak about seeking help for such an illness or injury.I could not agree more.Through my own articles and speeches, I have been trying to de-stigmatize mental illness for more than a decade, and I have written over the years about the need to support our troops with mental-health and other resources, particularly when they come back from a combat deployment.In a piece I wrote for the Huffington Post in 2010, titled “Macho Men Get Depressed, Too,” I noted that tough guys from Terry Bradshaw, the Hall of Fame quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, to Winston Churchill, a combat veteran and wartime leader of Great Britain, have suffered from depression.I pointed out that the high rate of suicides in our military required us to acknowledge the problems of PTSD and depression among our troops, and, at minimum, to send condolence letters to the families of those who have taken their lives.Of course, the best solution of all is to eliminate the stigma of mental illness and brain injuries, so that our troops seek treatment well before they become suicidal.Most military suicides occur not in combat but when servicemen and women are back in the United States, when they lack the camaraderie of being in a unit, when some of them no longer feel that they have a sense of purpose in their lives.General Bolduc is a true American hero, not only because he has served eight tours in combat; he is a true hero to the planet because he is proving that those who grapple with mental illness, whether they are in a combat zone or not, whether they have served in the military or not, should not be viewed as weak, lazy, incompetent or any other negative stereotype out there.Many people with mental illness have historically been afraid to speak up because of bullies like Donald Trump, who a few years ago castigated President Obama as a “psycho” for his handling of the Ebola crisis. I know that it is beyond the intellect of Trump, an ignorant man, to recognize the difference between psychosis, a treatable medical condition, from which I have suffered and which entails hallucinations and delusions; and psychopathy, a lack of remorse for the planning and commission of violent acts.Whatever word or meaning Trump intended, he used the term, “psycho,” to demean, insult and tar President Obama, a healthy man, with a diagnosis that he does not have.Thankfully, General Bolduc has demonstrated that even if a leader has a diagnosis, like PTSD or depression or psychosis, he or she should not fear coming forward and seeking treatment.Kudos to the New York Times for running this profile, and kudos to General Bolduc for showing what it means to be a real human being, a real mensch, a real hero, and, yes, the real Donald.

Here are some of the things I have learned over the years that may help your thought process as you formulate your own decision for whom to cast your vote.· Character and integrity are not situational. Good leaders live their lives as if they were on CCTV 24/7. They are examples that inspire others to raise themselves up to be the best they can be. The presence of, or lack of, character and integrity are pervasive and ever-present. It is not possible for someone of character and integrity to act without them. In addition, these are two aspects of who someone is that cannot be improved by coaching.· Intelligence can become toxic. Unalloyed by common sense, intelligence can create existential threats, e.g., the technology meltdown in the stock market and the financial crisis, as well as the failure of many companies including Enron and others too numerous to list here. All of these situations were products of toxic intelligence, which leads us to the next point.· The curse of the alphas. Alphas are smart, driven, accomplished, and talented people. The curse they all live with is what psychologists refer to as self-enhancement bias, which in everyday life looks like this: Sometimes they think they know more than they actually do or they think they are more capable than they really are. When an alpha does not have the self-awareness and discipline to see this and hold it in check, bad things can happen, which leads us to the next point.· Intellectual curiosity coupled with humility. Good leaders are always in search of the truth. Period. Ideology and dogma are anathema to the good leader in the 21st century. Change, whether potentially good or bad, comes too quickly and from far too many directions in the 21st century. Good leaders know they must be open to new thinking and new approaches. They must be humble enough to recognize their limitations, to encourage those around them to speak up, and to listen, even when the message is counter to a current belief. Leaders who are devoid of intellectual curiosity and humility soon find themselves surrounded by people who have nothing to say.· Caring. We know through many studies that have been done that the most reliable predictor of a lasting relationship, one that nurtures, inspires and endures the trials and challenges of life, is one that has caring at its core. Good leaders realize this and demonstrate it daily. I once asked the CEO of a very successful global financial services company what his personal vision was for the company. I will never forget what he said. “I want this institution to be a place that my employees want their children to work and for us to offer products and services they would want their parents to use.” This is caring.This election deserves all the critical thought one can muster in deciding for whom to cast one’s vote. We must force ourselves to go beyond the obvious, easy, and attractive explanations to uncover the truth as best we can. I’ll close with a quote from a distinguished 20th century historian and diplomat that I think elegantly describes the situation in which we find ourselves today and serves as a clarion call for critical thinking.“The truth is sometimes a poor competitor in the market place of ideas – complicated, unsatisfying, full of dilemmas, always vulnerable to misinterpretation and abuse.” ― George F. Kennan"

However, I have been having the same problem for the past several weeks.I have called Aabaco many times and spent hours on hold. Despite many promises, my emails have not been restored. On the contrary, additional messages have disappeared. Can you help me get in touch with someone at Aabaco who can help? -- Dennis Tucker, Stockton, Calif.Answer: This isn't your first problem with Yahoo and Aabaco, nor is it the first time I've written about your email troubles. Back in 2014, Yahoo even closed your account and you contacted me for help reopening it.You would think that after all that, you might have second thoughts about doing business with Yahoo and Aabaco. But no, you were a loyal customer.Let me pause for a moment to admire that kind of devotion. You pay $9.95 a month for email and a suite of other small business products, and you have for years. Presumably, it's because Aabaco offers services you need. Noteworthy, too, is the fact that it didn't have to cajole you into this with a gimmicky loyalty program. (If it had, imagine how much more difficult it would be to let Aabaco go.)A look at Aabaco's terms of service reveals an unprecedented rights-grab. By saying ""yes"" to its service, you're also expressly granting the company permission to send you unsolicited emails and text messages. Its limit of liability means it'll never have to worry about those missing emails and that you pretty much have no recourse.It's hard to say how much Yahoo has veered from its ""core values"" by offering you a buggy email account that defies repair. The company's original mission statement, which alluded to these values, is scrubbed from the website, replaced with platitudes about being ""focused on informing, connecting, and entertaining our users."" But an image of the Yahoo offices on its ""about"" page with an enormous banner that says ""Be Awesome"" says it all.Simply put, Yahoo is not being awesome.You might have reached out to one of Yahoo's executives to remind them they aren't living up to their promises. I list the names, numbers and email addresses on my site.In an earlier story, I recommended that you consider a new email service that would be less likely to lose your messages. Not to repeat myself, but I would really suggest that you find another email service.Our advocacy team reached out to Yahoo on your behalf.

Next to her, a well-dressed man flaunts an expensive-looking watch as he negotiates with a caller on his iPhone. Two tattooed women behind you talk passionately in hushed voices, you can’t hear what they are saying, but it sounds significant. A young woman sitting nearby beams at a giggling baby girl. A man sits alone in silence, gazing vacantly at the space between his shoes. A couple looks agitated, they hold hands, but they are clearly eager to arrive at their destination.The exterior of a person is something that, within limitations, is able to be changed. This alteration of appearance means the opinion others have of you is subject to change based on the actions you decided to take; you are in control of the message you craft and you can be very strategic about it. If appearance can be changed so easily, why do we put weight on appearance at all?If you don’t really know what’s inside someone, how could you realistically make an estimation of what those qualities might be? Until you truly know, both possibilities exist simultaneously. In physics, this is called the quantum theory of superposition. You’ve all heard of it; it’s Schrödinger’s cat.In the instance of the cat, the cat is both dead and alive simultaneously, while it is inside the box. We do not know the condition of the cat until the box is finally opened. With humans, it is the same. We can make all the guesses we like, but we do not know whether a quality exists in a human, until we get to know what is inside the person before us.Speaking of physics, let’s talk about Stephen Hawking. If he had never been given a speech synthesizer, and we were unable to know his genius, would you judge him as being unintelligent due to not knowing definitively whether he was or not?This notion applies to all people; you really do not know whether a quality exists inside a person until you get to know them.The man opposite you, consistently checking his phone, might be the father of a boy on life support in ICU. The woman applying winged eyeliner expertly may be doing so in order to avoid being told she looks tired, because she does double shifts to bring in enough money to support her family.The well-dressed man flashing his expensive-looking watch may be deep in debt and trying to find a way to keep his head above water. The two tattooed women behind you could be talking about the tech startup they are planning.The young woman smiling at the baby girl may be a bereaved mother, having just lost a baby of her own. That little smile may just help her on the darkest of days. The man sitting alone in silence, staring at the floor, may just be wondering when his car will be fixed so he can stop taking public transportation.The agitated couple might be going to their 12 week scan, to find out if their latest IVF round was a success or another failure ― which would break their hearts.You just never know.All people have something unique within them that can only be found once you get to know them. A person may appear to have it all, but this does not indicate what they have. Conversely, someone may appear to have nothing material, but on the inside they feel full of gratitude for their immaterial possessions.The problem today is that we’re scared to show the things that make us truly human.

This, a man who impersonated a publicist, just to brag about himself. The overwhelming majority of the Republican establishment stood by their man after he accused our nation’s first Black President of not being a citizen; they powered through him talking about his penis size during a Republican primary debate; and they let it slide when he refused to disavow white supremacist David Duke -- but PUSSY, now that’s beyond the pale. John McCain supported Trump despite the fact that he essentially called him a loser for being captured, Ted Cruz endorsed him even though he intimated that his father was involved in JFK’s assassination and Ben Carson pledged his support after Trump compared him to a child molester. And then there are his ‘ride or dies’, Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani. Talk about being grabbed by the pussy. But in the wake of BillyBushgate, Hugh Hewitt, Carly Fiorina John McCaine, Condoleeza Rice, Rob Portman, John Huntsman and throngs of other Johns have withdrawn their support for Trump. And after Mike Pence’s fortuitously timed, (comparatively) solid debate performance, several others including Mike Lee, John Thune and Dennis Daugaard are now calling for Trump to step down in favor of his anti-abortion, religious freedom crusading running mate.They want credit for condemning this maniac in the eleventh hour, now that it’s become clear that the SS Trump is sinking. They’re not morally outraged. They’re just rats jumping ship, hoping to remove the Donald Trump stink from their navy blue suits before it’s too late. He’s going down in flames and now they want to burn their Trump cards along with him. Try as you will, but we will not forget how you stood by and allowed this cancer to metastasize.

My third was that life was going to be a bit different from now on, and secretly that was both a little bit daunting and a little bit exciting.Then the doctor spoke: his voice apologetic and careful, he asked if I’d like to be referred for further testing with the option of a termination if our baby did have Down’s Syndrome.

Several friends suggested testing, and if our baby did have Down’s Syndrome, a termination would be the kindest way forwards... for our other two young children, for the load on the NHS, for our sanity. It was depressing: It was as if people saw our baby as a monster that needed “dealing with.”Doctors were very subdued with me. Did they feel sorry for me, or were they subconsciously expressing their disapproval at me for not accepting diagnostic screening tests? Maybe I’d imagined it. At 32 weeks I was informed I could still have diagnostic testing and, if my baby did have Down’s Syndrome, I could terminate right up to birth if I wished. The reason being that Down’s Syndrome counts as a “severe disability.”My personal understanding and experience of Down’s Syndrome wasn’t one which included the words “severe disability.” It included “different,” “challenges” and “unknown,” but I didn’t consider it to be “incompatible with life,” a life filled with pain or fear, or a lack of ability to enjoy life.We all age, but many of us don’t complete our lives when we would wish to. Many of us die too early, many of us need extra care for some period of our lives, some of us live on well into the later years and then need gentle on going care… some of us choose to live a life of crime, or drink ourselves to death. One thing we all have in common, we all expect a degree of care from others, if and when we become unable to care for ourselves.None of us can predict anything to do with either our, or our children’s futures. Pathways can suddenly turn, very cruelly or unexpectedly, which has happened to two wonderful families I know. Suddenly we’re the lucky ones.If you were to be told your child would have speech difficulties (as ours has), might need a heart operation (as ours did, not all do), may learn to walk late (ours was two and a half and that was with a lot of coaxing), or that you may need to feed your child using a tube down their nose, (which we did for a short time), or may need extra support at school (which ours does)… you may throw up your hands in horror and say, “that’s what I’m talking about! I don’t want that for my child!” or “I just don’t want that for my family. I couldn’t cope with that.” All of these things have occurred to my friends children too. Their “normal” children have needed heart operations, to be tube fed, to need on going speech and language therapy, and one to one support at school. I personally have needed expensive cancer treatment.But this isn’t about that. What is it about having a “differently abled” person in the family, school or workplace that’s such a bad thing? Is it the extra care they may need? Is it fear for their health, well-being or quality of life? Is it all a big inconvenience and worry? Is it a fear of not coping? Is it just wanting more for our children? What is “more”? What does “more” look like?I told my nine and eight year olds about Sally Phillips’ Documentary “A World Without Down’s Syndrome,” and explained about the screening program and one of the potential outcomes. Our eight year old looked confused, and our nine year old leapt out of her chair and in a raised voice with balled fists she said, “Why would anyone want to get rid of people with Down’s Syndrome? I don’t understand why? Tell me why!”Something I’ve learnt through having a child with Down’s Syndrome, and from meeting families with children with other disabilities too, is that life very much goes on. It properly goes on.Our son with Down’s Syndrome is “different” and it’s hard to explain how. His body moves slightly differently, his facial expressions are more pronounced, he learns things in a slightly different way and more slowly, but he still learns. He’s more advanced than his peers in some ways, and delayed in others. He’s five years old and walks, runs, jumps, climbs trees, plays with nerf guns, eats properly with a knife and fork, negotiates, problem solves, argues, sleeps like a log, likes spicy food, makes suggestions for days out, rides a bike with stabilizers, reads and writes a bit, loves helping, has tantrums and refuses to co-operate at times… it’s all rather boringly normal in many ways. He needs support in others.Sometimes it seems as if he’s part of a movie rolling in slow motion. I’ve learnt so much more about how humans develop and learn. I find it utterly fascinating.To us the key thing is that he’s perfectly happy and is a valid and equal member of our family. He makes us laugh from the bottom of our boots, as well as cry with frustration… just as his brother and sister do. He’s the centre of our world, as all our children are, but our lives don’t revolve around him. My husband and I have both started businesses since he was born, and we do everything that all families with children do.All children have different abilities and it took a while to work out what our boy needed. Once we’d addressed his diet (partly normal for many children with Down’s Syndrome, and mainly to do with my family history of food intolerances) and his sensory processing needs, (which again he must get from me), he started to really thrive.All the hard bits have been like a blip in time. They’re there and then they’re gone again.I do feel as if I’ve been stretched and challenged. But by having children full stop. To be challenged and to have to look inside oneself and work at things you don’t find easy, teaches you many things. It teaches you empathy and patience. It changes your focus on life and shows you that you can achieve more than you thought. It teaches you to appreciate and indeed love a view you haven’t seen before. It teaches you to slow down and with that, you see the most amazing things. Your world fills with a color you didn’t realize existed.Until you’ve lived in a certain situation, or with a child or adult with Down’s Syndrome, you can’t really imagine what it’s like. You project what you imagine it to be like. Fear of the unknown will almost certainly play a part. Just know that there are many, many families living in a way you perceive to be a nightmare. But as a wise and experienced friend of mine says, ‘there are far worse things that can happen than having a disabled child’. Families adapt and are genuinely and properly enjoying life. They’re not pretending to, or saying so for your sake, nor to convince you…They genuinely are.You might also like to read: A Cancer Diagnosis: Driving Away The FearFollow Emily on Facebook, Twitter and her Blog.Visit the International Elf Service to find out more about receiving exclusive news from the North Pole."

McCartney kicked off his set on Saturday with the Beatles classic “A Hard Day’s Night,” followed by “Jet,” a track from his post-Beatles career. For the rest of his performance, the music icon played a mix of Beatles tracks and solo songs. The most memorable moment, though, had to be when McCartney brought Neil Young out on stage. Young had finished his own energetic set, but seemed more than happy to play with his friend. The two played “A Day in the Life” first, before going into the anti-war movement anthem “Give Peace A Chance.”Finally, they performed “Why Don’t We Do It in the Road?” complete with a killer solo by Young.The rock icons have shared the stage plenty of times, with one of their more recent performances in London’s Hyde Park in 2009. Saturday’s performance was part of the first weekend of Desert Trip music festival, dubbed “Oldchella” due to its lineup of classic rock acts like McCartney and Young along with The Who, The Rolling Stones, Roger Waters and Bob Dylan. All the acts will return to the stage for the festival’s second weekend starting Friday."

If the band mates had accepted his proposal, the one-time show would have been their first appearance since abandoning life on the road after their August 29, 1966, swan song at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park.As history well knows, the Beatles turned Bernstein down flat. Within two years, they had disbanded, playing one last time in public during their impromptu rooftop concert on January 30, 1969. But as it happened, Bernstein’s 1967 offer was only the beginning of the reunion rumors that would hound the group through John Lennon’s senseless murder in December 1980 and, amazingly, even beyond his untimely death.More often than not, Bernstein was behind the ongoing effort to reunite the estranged band mates in concert. The famed promoter originally booked the Beatles for $6,500 for a twin bill at the normally staid Carnegie Hall in February 1964, only scant days after their legendary appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In August 1965, Bernstein broke even greater barriers with the band when he staged their Shea Stadium appearance before nearly 56,000 fans, taking rock music beyond the confines of dance clubs and concert halls. In so doing, Bernstein ushered in a new era in big-time pop music promotion that lingers into the present day.But by October 1967, with the drudgery of their touring years behind them and having enjoyed the artistic heights of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the band had become immune to Bernstein’s advances. The situation was no doubt compounded by the recent death of manager Brian Epstein, the architect of Beatlemania who had found his mettle during their heyday on the road.The Beatles’ mystique—and, likewise, the record-buying public’s hunger to see them back together again—would only increase exponentially after their breakup in September 1969. With the release of the Abbey Road LP that same month, they quite literally departed the world stage forever. The following April, Paul McCartney would confirm the awful truth about the band’s demise in the global media, but the discerning fan would have already glimpsed the writing on the wall: an album that closes with a song called “The End” makes for a truly prophetic note, if ever there were one.But in many ways, the rumors of a Beatles reunion were only just getting started. Things reached a fever-pitch by 1976, when the group was deluged with increasingly lucrative offers—with one notable exception, that is.In January 1976, promoter Bill Sargent floated the figure of $50 million for a Beatles reunion—a steep increase from his own $10 million offer just two years earlier. Not to be outdone, Bernstein tendered the staggering sum of $230 million in September 1976 for a one-shot charity reunion. McCartney would later admit that the band mates briefly considered Bernstein’s gambit. After all, if you could net that kind of money and wrap it up in a charity effort to boot, how could anyone pass up such an unprecedented opportunity?Ironically, that very same year Lennon and McCartney had considered a far less rewarding offer during the April 24, 1976, episode of Saturday Night Live. Producer Lorne Michaels offered a comparative pittance for the group to reunite on his program, famously remarking that NBC “has authorized me to offer you . . . a certified check for $3,000.” Michaels added that “you can divide it anyway you want. If you want to give Ringo less, that’s up to you.”Years later, Beatles fans would learn that Lennon and McCartney had been watching SNL at that very moment at John and Yoko’s apartment building just across town. As Lennon later recalled, McCartney “was visiting us at our place in the Dakota. We were watching it and almost went down to the studio, just as a gag. We nearly got into a cab, but we were actually too tired.”In September 1979, the stakes became even higher when United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim attempted to stage a Beatles reunion as a charity effort on behalf of the Vietnamese boat people. Bernstein rallied to support Waldheim, taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times in which he entreated the Beatles to consider the UN’s offer. “The music you created in the 60s is still heard in every corner of the world in the 70s,” Bernstein wrote. “The joy that you gave to people everywhere . . . gives you a unique place in history. It also gives you an importance and a voice to make a difference in the lives of many human beings who need our compassion and immediate help.” By Bernstein’s own estimation, the UN’s proposed reunion had the capacity to generate some $500 million in relief on behalf of several hundred-thousand refugees from war-torn Vietnam. But as with the other reunion attempts throughout the 1970s, the Beatles simply couldn’t quite make their way back to the world stage. Years later, the surviving band mates would suggest that the pressure to reunite for humanitarian causes was understandably beginning to register with them, although Lennon’s 1980 assassination seemingly ended that possibility forever. Even still, rumors would continue to persist throughout the 1980s and 1990s—at times, suggesting that the surviving band mates might reunite with Julian Lennon or his younger brother Sean sitting in for their fallen father.In a 2012 Rolling Stone interview, McCartney admitted that the group seriously considered the various opportunities to reunite, observing that “they were kind of nice when they happened—‘That would be good, yeah’—but then one of us would always not fancy it. And that was enough, because we were the ultimate democracy.”But the decision against reuniting often came down to the simple fact, McCartney admitted, that their legacy was once and truly complete, that they had come full circle as an artistic unit. Worse yet, a poor showing in concert was loaded with potential risk. What if they weren’t any good as live performers after having subsisted for so many years in mothballs? “It could have spoiled the whole idea of the Beatles,” said McCartney. Or perhaps not. The world will never know.Ken Womack is an internationally renowned Beatles authority regarding the band’s enduring artistic influence. His latest book, Maximum Volume: The Life of Beatles Producer George Martin (The Early Years: 1926-1966), is forthcoming in 2017.

It was on October 28, 2008. He was 3 ½.It didn’t happen because he was unattended in a shopping cart or running around the playground. It was while he slept, tucked safely in his bed. We awoke to his screams and found him soaked in urine. The next morning, a child who physically looked like Ezra woke up. He had Ezra’s blond hair, big green eyes, and long eyelashes. But he didn’t have his personality, compassion, or wit. He was no longer sweet-natured, inquisitive, loving, and incredibly verbal. Instead he screamed for hours, stuttered, made repetitive noises, and became very selective in the foods that he would eat. He was angry, defiant, and raged for hours. We used to snuggle, now he wouldn’t let me hold him — his body stiffened each time I reached out for a hug.His pupils were huge and dilated, with a confused and vacant look. Ezra had violent, angry, intense tantrums about everything. We were raising a boy that we didn’t recognize, a boy that my husband and I jokingly named Ferdinand—after the storybook bull who looks intimidating but is actually kindhearted.My background is in behavior therapy—I knew not to give in to his rages because it would reinforce the behavior. So I did what my education and training had taught me, and what I recommended to my clients’ parents. I encouraged him to “use his words.” I used time outs, sticker charts, praise, and positive reinforcement. Nothing worked.What was wrong? My husband and I agonized over the cause. I’d started back to work—it must be that. His baby bother started to crawl and need more attention—maybe that’s it. Or maybe he’s so intelligent that he knew how to manipulate us. Others suggested it was because he was our first child—or that we weren’t strict enough with him. Most felt that he’d outgrow it.When we went to the pediatrician—I laid out my observations: Ezra awakens with night terrors, wets the bed, has accidents during the day, and seems to have to urinate all of the time. His pupils get huge, and when they do, he is incredibly hyper and defiant. He is obsessed with having things his way and the tantrums go on for hours. On particularly bad days, he will eat nothing but Cheerios.And it all started at the end of October, just after that strange rash appeared on his torso—just days before he came down with a very high fever. The pediatrician was stumped.Our lives continued on eggshells until Ezra was 4 ½. I was giving him a warm bath, which usually calmed him. I drained the tub and asked him to step out. He put one leg out and then put it back in. He did it again and again, crying that “it wasn’t right.” He stood there, cold and shaking, repeating the step over and over. I let him go on and on as my heart sank. This was OCD! I wrapped a towel around him and carried him out of the bathroom. He kicked and screamed, begging me to let him do it again until it was right. It started to make sense to me. Everything had to be “just right.”But OCD didn’t explain the huge pupils, frequent trips to the bathroom, deterioration in fine motor skills and cognitive ability, or tics. It also didn’t explain his frustration and fits of rage. More trips to the pediatrician were fruitless. I started searching the internet for answers.The keywords? OCD, dilated pupils, urinary frequency. The result pointed me to a page on PANDAS: Pediatric, Autoimmune, Neuropsychological, Disorder, Associated with Streptococcal Infections. It listed symptoms of a newly-discovered and controversial disorder where Strep bacteria trigger an autoimmune attack on the brain. Ezra had nearly every symptom on the list.I called the doctor immediately and asked if Ezra could have PANDAS. She had never treated it before but agreed to administer a blood test to check for elevated strep titers. The levels were high. We were given an antibiotic and sent to a neurologist for an official diagnosis.I was excited for that neurology appointment—anticipating that it would bring resolution to our problem. I knew in my gut that PANDAS was the cause and I just needed the neurologist to tell me how to fix it. In my mind, the doctor would provide a key to unlock Ezra from his captor, ridding us of Ferdinand once and for all. My hope was short-lived. We were told that a neurologist won’t ever diagnosis PANDAS because neurologists don’t believe that it is a real disorder. Instead, it was suggested that Ezra was having seizures. An EEG was ordered.The neurologist became the first in a long line of people my husband and I called “hostage negotiators”—people who we had to work through, and with, as we tried to secure our son’s return.Meanwhile, my mind was racing. Maybe if it was seizures—and maybe if he took medication we’d get Ezra back. The EEG came back “abnormal” with spikes and waves in the frontal lobe, but not in a typical seizure pattern. Nothing could be done for him—we were told that some kids just have abnormal EEGs and are fine with them. We were advised not to worry about it.But Ezra was not fine, and his brain waves were not normal. Why didn’t anyone in the medical field seem concerned?Meanwhile, Ezra continued to slip away. He’d been a toddler who met every milestone early and talked circles around his peers. Now he was quiet and withdrawn with “Autistic-like features.” At the age of two, he could read hundreds of words and loved math. But as he made his way through first grade, Ezra no longer wanted to go to school, play sports, or attend cub scouts. He didn’t want to leave the house. I had to carry him into school, where staff would hold him back as the doors closed behind me. In school, his handwriting was slow and messy, and he crumbled under the pressure of timed math tests. He was distracted, zoned out, and wouldn’t respond when his name was called.We would wait months to see a new doctor, only to be told that they didn’t believe in PANDAS. I kept thinking—my child has been stolen—this boy is not him. Where is the AMBER alert? Why is it just me, alone in the middle of the night, searching the internet for answers?We saw five Pediatric Neurologists, three Cognitive Behavior Therapists, a Developmental Pediatrician, Occupational Therapists, Chiropractors, an alternative healer, and a Naturopath. They suggested diagnoses including anxiety, bipolar, mood disorder, ADHD, Transient Tic Disorder, and Tourette’s. We were told to medicate him with Ritalin, Zoloft, and Clonidine. We were put on waiting lists to get appointments with any doctor that I thought could help.On February 8, 2015, Ezra came inside after playing in the snow. He sat on the couch with a vacant look in his eyes. He turned his head to the side and touched his chin to his shoulder. Then he did it again. And again. I felt his head. He had a low grade fever. The fever was gone by bedtime, but the head-turning tic did not stop. Every 3-5 seconds he turned his head, no matter what he was doing.The head-turning tic evolved quickly into a full-body twist and facial grimace. Eventually he lost all fine motor control. Ezra stopped eating and went from a skinny 60 pounds to an emaciated 55 pounds in just two weeks. His body never stopped moving, wiggling and swaying in the few seconds that he had between tics. Ezra could not focus and often forgot what he was doing—he began falling off of chairs and walking into walls. He couldn’t dress himself or get his shoes or coat on for school. I’d kiss him goodbye and sit in the idling car, watching him hop, tic, and even fall down in the doorway of the school. I called the pediatrician. The results of a blood test for elevated strep titers came back very high, and Ezra was placed on antibiotics.Tears poured down my cheeks as I sat there. I was a mess, still in my pajamas, and completely exhausted by the task of getting a toddler in a 9-year-old’s body off to school. I was told to accept that Ferdinand was now my child and Ezra was just gone. I was even advised to get counseling myself, to help me to come to grips with the situation.In every free second, I read medical journals and watched YouTube videos of PANDAS medical conferences. The PANDAS doctors on YouTube seemed as though they were talking about Ezra specifically. Every symptom matched up. They even spoke about the abduction. They would believe me, and they could get him back. I searched for the names of the speakers, and found one who could see us the following week. It was going to be about one thousand dollars just for answers and possibly tens of thousands to get him back. It was a huge financial outlay—but how could I say no? To get a child back from an abductor, you often have to pay a ransom.We drove for six hours to meet the 14th and final hostage negotiator, a pediatric neurologist who is a PANDAS expert. He listened to my extensive list of Ezra’s symptoms with an understanding that no other doctor had. As I sat, listing the symptoms that had stolen my son’s childhood, I realized the gravity of my words. If I said the right things, the doctor may deem Ezra worthy of one of the rarely given “magic cures” I’d read about. My voice began to crack and tears welled up in my eyes. I could tell that my emotions were making the doctor uncomfortable so I fought to stay strong—like a grief-stricken parent on TV begging for their child’s safe return.We left the appointment with a script for blood tests so long that it had to be divided into four separate draws. If it showed what the doctor predicted, it would be possible to help Ezra. If not, I would need to accept the fact that he just had OCD, ADHD, anxiety, Tourette’s, and abnormal EEGs. The doctor called two weeks later with the results. Ezra had all of the markers for PANDAS and PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome). His immune system was overreacting to Strep bacteria (causing PANDAS) and the Coxsackie virus (causing PANS). He was to continue on antibiotics and have a tonsillectomy. If needed, he’d receive an IVIG treatment. IVIG floods the body with healthy plasma and overrides the misdirected antibodies that cause the PANDAS symptoms.Finally, we had plans for a cure and not just a band aid.This doctor provided the key I’d been trying to find for six years. It took thousands of dollars, months of antibiotics, a tonsillectomy, and IVIG. Two days after that magic plasma dripped into Ezra’s veins, my son, the real Ezra, looked into my eyes again. His pupils were small—I could see the beautiful green of his eyes. The cold darkness was gone. This was my child—the one I had lost so many years ago. The one that no one else had noticed go missing.Ezra wasn’t returned to me in a dramatic police handover. He came back much like he was taken—in the night while he slept. In the weeks and months that followed, he regained coordination and cognitive abilities. The tics have stopped. Ezra has nearly replaced Ferdinand—though the storybook bull does appear occasionally.I go to bed every night knowing that there is an abductor that lurks outside my children’s bedroom doors— one that I can’t keep them safe from. So I make homemade barricades with prophylactic antibiotics, vitamins, consistent hand washing, and a healthy diet, but I live in fear that he will be taken again at any moment. Every morning I look into his eyes to make sure that it is still Ezra looking back at me.For now, I have my sweet, funny, brilliant boy back. Tears of joy roll down my face every time that I think about it, but it doesn’t give me those years of mothering back. It doesn’t give Ezra those years of carefree childhood back. Like all families whose children who were returned home after an abduction, we are all left with the scars of this journey. I hope that they continue to fade for us and that one day PANDAS will become just a small part of our family’s life story—not the story that defined it."

I shaped my culinary career path in my mid-20s. During and after college I had been working as a model in Manhattan doing live shows, photography, and catalogue work, but was totally unfulfilled. After a four-year college education, I knew that I needed to use my brain, not my bod. On a whim, I attended a ""conscious raising"" course at a local YWCA and was asked what I wanted to do with my life. The instructor asked me to write down 20 things I looked forward to doing daily. I listed: ""sauté, braise, poach, stir-fry..."" You get the picture? I most certainly wanted to cook, but more importantly, I wanted to write about cooking as well as become a restaurant critic. I had studied cooking for years but up until this awakening, I didn't know I could do it professionally. I was told by the teacher to softly interview a local newspaper editor, tell her about my skills, and describe how I could help the local paper expand its food department. Within nine months, I was free-lancing for several publications, including The Village Voice. I enjoyed spending my time writing and it allowed me to cook, write, and be a wife and mother without stress. By the time Peter and I moved to Los Angeles in 1977, I was writing for Bon Appétit and then tried my hand at cooking on television. I loved my career. It was not just a job for me, it was a vocation. I was truly lucky. Many a job doesn't align with one's core values. Often the hours of a job are difficult and don't fit with child care. Most jobs are not challenging and don't bring out your best qualities, but you must perform them to survive. I was incredibly fortunate that I loved my job. I adored cooking. I loved writing about cooking. I loved teaching cooking on television. I adored testing recipes and writing cookbooks. It was a happy period in our lives. When I got letter after letter asking how I cooked and still stayed so thin, I ventured into healthful cooking, just at the time that light cooking was catching on. Peter wasn't happy that my cooking had to be healthy. The man loved his meat and potatoes, and anything nutritious made him cringe but because my books were selling, he kept his mouth shut. I didn't have a job, I had a vocation that I loved.When Peter died, the only thing that kept me sane was writing about grief. Blogging about grief morphed into my new vocation. I recognized that by spewing out my emotions with honesty, I was helping others which meant it was work that made me satisfied. This was my new vocation. This was my new calling and it didn't feel like a vocation at first, it was what I had to do to get through the day. Putting my thoughts on paper significantly reduced the intensity of my loss. When I examined the word vocation, I realized it is something you want to do all the time. A vocation is something you enjoy on weekdays and weekends. A vocation is authentic work. There are no performance reviews or job ladders to climb. I know that my family and friends are proud of my writing and know that it makes me happy. They know that the creativity I expound in my blogs will help me find my way to my new normal. But especially, my heart tells me that Peter would have been bursting with pride and would have been vociferously bragging about me to all who would lend an ear.I have truly come to look forward to putting my thoughts into the computer. I love researching quotes. Writing is my form of mediation. I still can't meditate without sobbing but I can write, with a few tears hitting the keyboard. I can blog about my pain in the hope that the words will give me some release, and more importantly, they might resonate with others.""Writing is a form of therapy; sometimes I wonder how all those who do not write, compose, or paint can manage to escape the madness, melancholia, the panic and fear which is inherent in a human situation."" ― Graham GreeneEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

But it is something to watch carefully.",2016-10-09,"Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speak simultaneously during their first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, U.S., September 26, 2016. REUTERS/Rick Wilking",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb82f622500008e013a1cf1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Supporters of Hillary Clinton can thank their lucky stars that Julian Assange leaked excerpts from her Wall Street speeches the same day that another leaked recording showed Donald Trump descending to new lows in his loutish bragging of his sexual exploits.Happily, the Trump revelations knocked the Clinton speeches out of the headlines, and produced reverberations in the form of other Republicans withdrawing their support as well as demands for him to quit the campaign -- demands that will keep cascading and dominating the news cycle for days.By contrast, Clinton's closed-door comments, ingratiating herself with Wall Street donors, are not all that surprising. They demonstrate what is well known -- she is basically a centrist Democrat, with a pro-business view of trade, inclined to cut bankers a lot of slack in assigning blame for the 2008 financial collapse, and still stuck in the budget-balance folly.As recently as the first presidential debate, Clinton repeated the canard that tax cuts (rather than deregulation) were the primary cause of the 2008 meltdown, and embraced budget balance as a measure of virtue. She has moved into a more critical stance on trade, mainly because of shifting public opinion, pressures from the Sanders campaign, and to counter Trump's pseudo-populism.Probably the most damning single line in the transcripts -- if in fact they are authentic -- was her comment that it's necessary to have both ""a public and a private position"" on contentious issues.How damaging will these leaks be? They would have been a lot more damaging had they surfaced during the closely fought Democratic primaries against Bernie Sanders. They will surely put the more progressive wing of the Democratic constituency even more on guard against Clinton backsliding, as they should be anyway. On the whole, it's salutary to have this stuff out. Now that it's out there, it's pretty tame compared to the latest Trump bombshells, which will put Trump on the defensive for another week, after his terrible previous week trying to explain away his tax dodging. (Assange does claim that he has even more damaging stuff to release, but he is not exactly the most reliable guy in the world.)On balance, it's constructive for progressives to have some concrete ammunition to keep the pressure on Clinton. Wall Street really has no place else to go. Bankers and investors are appalled by Trump. The real-time movements of stock futures during the first presidential debate suggest that financial markets consider the prospect of a Trump presidency a disaster in the making. Whenever Trump seemed to score points off Clinton, stock futures fell. When Clinton did well, they rose. Financial markets like predictability and competence. A Trump presidency would be anything but predictable and far from competent. His reckless policies could set off a global depression, at a time when the global economy is far from robust.As for Clinton, the challenge is to push her not to pursue more of the same -- a recovery that still doesn't fully reach Main Street and a financial industry even more concentrated than it was before the 2008 crash.As president, Clinton would have the leverage to complete some of the unfinished financial reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act through tougher enforcement, to move trade policy in a very different direction, and to break with the budget balance orthodoxy -- if only she would use it. Some of this would require congressional assent, but executive power is extensive in the area of financial regulation, enforcement, and trade.Democratic progressives have been keeping a close eye on key economic policy positions to be filled by Clinton, and pressing for commitments from her to reject the usual suspects who either come from Wall Street or support light regulation and fiscal conservatism.These posts include not only the highly visible ones of treasury secretary and head of the National Economic Council, but second-tier power positions such as head of the Office of Management and Budget, director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), and chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Under Obama, these jobs went to regulatory and fiscal conservatives and to allies of Wall Street. Under Clinton, they had better go to far more progressive appointees, or Clinton will stay stuck on the pro-Wall Street track that defined the last two Democratic administrations.Compared to the risks of a Trump presidency, of course, making sure that Clinton appoints progressives to the key economic posts is a nice problem to have. But it is something to watch carefully.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University's Heller School.

Apparently unaware that a microphone was recording his statements, the real estate mogul described how he liked to “grab [women] by the pussy” and said he could get away with it because “when you’re a star, they let you do it.”These comments, which The Washington Post published on Friday afternoon, have provoked a sharp backlash, with even high-ranking Republicans denouncing the rhetoric and some pulling their endorsements of his candidacy.Melania Trump, who was apparently pregnant when her husband made the comments, is echoing the condemnations ― but not the calls to abandon the nominee’s bid for the White House.“The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me,” she said in her statement. “This does not represent the man I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope that people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing the nation and the world.”Donald Trump actually has a long history of making crude, denigrating comments about women. He has also faced multiple allegations of lewd behavior, even sexual assault, although he has strongly denied assaulting anybody and suggested other accounts of his statements and behavior are inaccurate.The new recordings elicited a rare (and possibly unprecedented) public apology from the GOP nominee. He said in a videotaped statement, which his campaign released Friday night, that he was sorry for making the comments. However, he added that the controversy is a “distraction” and that Bill and Hillary Clinton had done worse.He has since indicated, in a series of interviews, that he has no intention of withdrawing from the race ― and that he is getting “tremendous support.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
16,POLITICS,Some Republicans Worry Donald Trump Won’t Change One Bit If He Wins,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-president-demeanor_us_57f7c248e4b0e655eab3afe9,"If the plan to make him stick to his script succeeds and he becomes president, then what?",2016-10-08,GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump visits a mockup of the Oval Office at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum last month. Some Republicans worry that Trump will not change his demeanor or focus if he is elected.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f7c3171b0000e218ef547b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s advisers have been loading up his teleprompter with Republican boilerplate and insisting that he stick to it. His supporters have been warning he has to act more thoughtful, more deliberative and more knowledgeable if he wants even a chance of winning the presidency.All of which raises the question: What happens if Trump heeds this advice and wins?“That’s such a scary proposition that I’ve blocked it out of my mind,” said John Weaver, who worked for GOP nominee John McCain in 2008 and Ohio Gov. John Kasich during this cycle’s primaries.Weaver points to the 1972 movie “The Candidate,” the story of an unqualified, unprepared political neophyte who wins a Senate seat. Amid all the election night excitement, a frightened Robert Redford asks his campaign manager: “What do we do now?”“Trump would be a horror movie version of that scene,” Weaver said.Weaver is not alone. A common thread among Republicans who are voting for a third-party candidate, not voting at all or even supporting long-reviled Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is the conviction that Trump’s lack of knowledge of foreign affairs, domestic policy or the military, combined with his mercurial personality, would make him an incompetent president and a dangerous commander in chief.Mark Salter, also a McCain aide in 2008, said it is absurd to think that Trump at age 70 will change his fundamental character in the next few weeks and actually become more thoughtful, more deliberative or more knowledgeable. “Those qualities are alien to him. You might as well hope that he’ll be fluent in Mandarin Chinese in time for the inauguration,” Salter said.Yet that fundamental change is exactly what Trump’s supporters predict will happen, once Trump realizes the weight of the responsibilities on his shoulders and the challenges he faces.Morton Blackwell, a Republican National Committee member from Virginia who supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primaries, said Trump’s business experience would serve him well. “Any entrepreneur who succeeds greatly over a long time through major ups and downs learns from experience,” Blackwell said, pointing to new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and running mate Mike Pence as proof of Trump’s ability to learn and make smart decisions.Randy Evans, an RNC member from Georgia, said he’s seen Trump in his business mode, when he’s exactly the opposite of how he acts at his rallies. “In the business world, he has a different persona. There’s the business Trump. When he’s on TV, there’s the entertainer Trump,” Evans said.He said all presidents tend to act more presidential once assuming the job. “I expect the Oval Office will have that effect on him,” Evans said. “The office itself tends to impose a level of decorum.”Even some Republicans not embracing Trump hope that winds up being true. Matt Mackowiak said that winning the presidency could help Trump calm down and grow up. “He may find inner peace in finally achieving the kind of respect that the office unquestionably affords and which he has been personally seeking much of his adult life,” said Mackowiak, a Texas-based consultant. “I recognize he has not demonstrated self-control, personal growth, or increased policy depth over the past year and it troubles me deeply.”And if Trump does not in the end calm down or grow up, the massive federal bureaucracy and the constitutionally designed system of checks and balances will block Trump’s worst impulses, Mackowiak said, reflecting a view shared privately by a number of Republicans who are reluctantly supporting Trump because he is their party’s nominee.In any event, the final, go-to rationale for Republicans uneasy with Trump’s qualifications as well as those who enthusiastically support him is the makeup of the federal bench.“The 20-plus lawyers and jurists who might be considered for various federal judgeships gives most Republicans confidence President Trump has conservative roots,” Arizona RNC member Bruce Ash said.But that confidence, the anti-Trumpers say, borders on insanity.“Nothing he’s done in the past year suggests he is capable of being thoughtful and deliberative for more than about five consecutive minutes in a row,” said Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire GOP chairman. “I feel the same way about those who say it’s about the Supreme Court. Why would anyone believe his pledges to appoint conservative judges, on or off the list he released? This is willful self-delusion.” As for those who believe Trump will bring in respected experts and then take their advice, Salter suggests looking at those he is listening to today. “Given the quality of people running his campaign and giving him policy guidance now, from Steve Bannon and Dave Bossie to General [Michael] Flynn, I think it’s just as plausible that his government would be staffed by crazy people,” Salter said.Al Cardenas, who ran 1996 nominee Bob Dole’s campaign in Florida and later served as the state party chairman, said that even if Trump were to persuade quality staff to serve in his administration, there was no reason to believe he would take their advice.He said Trump’s lack of any real friends means that no one is close enough to him to give him unvarnished criticism ― a situation that will only worsen if he wins the presidency. “I have less confidence that he will listen to others if he is sworn in as president than he does now as a candidate,” Cardenas said. “In other words, when it comes to advice: He is hopeless.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Donald Trump should not be President,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “He should withdraw. As a Republican, I hope to support someone who has the dignity and stature to run for the highest office in the greatest democracy on earth.”Rice, who served as secretary of state and national security adviser to former President George W. Bush, is the latest in a growing list of prominent Republicans who have condemned, unendorsed or called on Trump to withdraw from the race within the past 24 hours. The wave of revolt against the GOP nominee was prompted by a 2005 video The Washington Post released Friday, which shows Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without consent because “when you’re a star, they let you do it.”Rice, who is now a professor at Stanford University, has been noticeably quiet this campaign cycle, declining multiple interview requests on national security issues related to the election. Her chief of staff, Georgia Godfrey, did not immediately respond to an email asking if she would vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ― or why she waited to distance herself from Trump until it was too late for the candidate to be removed from the ballot.As Trump gained momentum in the GOP primary race earlier this year, party strategists reportedly tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Rice to make an independent bid for president. Rice said she wasn’t interested in serving as Trump’s running mate, but phrased her statement in a way to suggest that her lack of interest was related to the job itself, not the man at the top of the ticket.“Dr. Rice has repeatedly said in past cycles as well as this one, she’s not interested in being vice president,” Godfrey said in June.

He said he saw one female officer who appeared to be wounded lying on the ground as fellow officers tried to resuscitate her.“I think he’s still inside,” Graciano said of the suspected gunman.According to the local Desert Sun newspaper, witnesses reported hearing between 10 and 20 gunshots during the incident.(Reporting by Sam Mircovich in Palm Springs; Writing and additional reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernard Orr, Toni Reinhold)"

But most of the elected officials indicated they were not withdrawing their support of the real estate mogul.Trump had claimed he pushed a married woman to have sex with him and said he could grab women “by the pussy” because he was a celebrity. A recording of his conversation with then-”Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush was published by NBC News and The Washington Post on Friday.“No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever,” Priebus said in a statement released that night.Priebus was scheduled to appear alongside Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) at a fundraiser in Wisconsin on Saturday. Late Friday, however, Trump’s campaign announced the nominee would no longer be appearing, and would instead be participating in a debate prep session in New York.Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), who chairs the House Republican Conference, also admonished Trump in a statement.“It is never appropriate to condone unwanted sexual advances or violence against women. Mr. Trump must realize that it has no place in public or private conversations today or in the past,” said the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress, who had previously endorsed Trump.Other top Republicans also issued condemnations on Friday.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called on Trump to “apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility” for the comments. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said was “sickened” by the remarks.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the GOP presidential primary earlier this year, called the remarks “reprehensible” on Twitter.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, another former Trump primary rival, echoed the sentiment.Mitt Romney, the Republicans’ presidential nominee four years ago, condemned his successor’s remarks as “vile degradations.”Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the 2008 GOP nominee, denounced Trump’s “offensive and demeaning, adding that the GOP nominee “alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences.”Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who is facing a hotly contested re-election battle, called Trump’s comments “totally inappropriate and offensive” in a statement released Friday. The senator did not, however, renounce her support of the GOP nominee. Earlier this week, Ayotte walked back comments in which she called Trump a role model for children.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), another vulnerable Republican facing re-election this year, labeled Trump’s remarks “completely unacceptable.”Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is fighting to keep his seat this year, went with “outrageous.”Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) also made their feelings known on Twitter.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called Trump’s comments “vulgar, egregious and impossible to justify.”AJ Spiker, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, called on Trump to resign as the GOP’s nominee.Those withdrawing their endorsement of Trump included Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah.)This story has been updated with condemnations from Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey.

20,POLITICS,"Trump’s Comments Hurt Efforts To Combat Sexual Assault, Advocates Say",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hurts-efforts-to-combat-sexual-assault_us_57f96bf7e4b0b6a43032f1b7,"As president, the proud groper could shape policies that directly affect survivors.",2016-10-08,A leaked video of Donald Trump boasting about groping women without consent in 2005 has shaken his presidential campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s boastful comments about groping and kissing women without consent undermines efforts to end rape culture, according to advocates for sexual assault survivors.If a man who could become president casually discusses his penchant for groping women without their permission, they say, that makes such behavior seem more acceptable. “It normalizes a culture in which sexual assault goes excused,” said Anna Voremberg, managing director of End Rape on Campus, which works to prevent sexual assault on college campuses.Ashley Harrell, a senior family advocate at the DC Children’s Advocacy Center, where she assists minors who have been sexually assaulted, worries that Trump still enjoys the respect and support of a sizable portion of the country. “It is really dangerous because as much as it blows my mind, there are a lot of people looking up to this guy,” Harrell said. “When people in power think that is normal, it trickles down in a real way. It is infuriating.”Hearing comments like Trump’s may also be traumatic for survivors, as it can trigger memories of their own harrowing experiences and make them feel less comfortable coming forward to seek the help they need.Harrell used to work with the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, and remembers receiving calls to the help hotline from people experiencing flare-ups of emotional distress due to stories of sexual assault in the news.Voremberg worries that Trump’s comments about kissing and groping will particularly hurt survivors who have experienced unwanted sexual contact similar to what he described.Survivors who haven’t experienced penetrative rape often “feel bad when they experience PTSD symptoms or depression because they think what happened to them is ‘not bad enough,’” Voremberg said. “A lot of them have come a long way in their healing. Bringing this up brings back those feelings all over again.” A President Trump would have authority over higher education policy at a time when students across the country are challenging their universities to properly address cases of campus assault. Activists praise the Obama administration’s Department of Education for taking steps to ensure universities are held accountable when they mishandle cases of assault on their campuses.EROC is prepared to work with whomever wins the general election, Voremberg said, but Trump’s comments don’t inspire confidence in his grasp of the issue.“We wonder how seriously he would take sexual assault,” she said.The Republican Party writ large has complained that Title IX ― the law requiring gender equity in educational programs that receive assistance from the federal government ― is being used too broadly to challenge universities’ sexual assault policies, Voremberg said.House Republicans also introduced the Safe Campus Act in July 2015, which virtually all survivor advocy groups have condemned. Critics of the law argue that it improperly shifts responsibility onto survivors by requiring them to report assault before police can investigate.Fatima Goss Graves, a senior vice president of the National Women’s Law Center, nonetheless believes that advocates should take advantage of the attention Trump’s remarks are receiving to accelerate ongoing efforts to increase awareness of sexual assault and the cultural norms that allow it to exist.“Any time people are using this weekend to talk to their children about being a good bystander, about consent, that’s a good thing,” Goss Graves said.“We have seen over the last few years that student activists have worked really hard to make these issues visible, to change policies, culture and move their institutions to a place where they are ready to implement bystander campaigns,” she added. “It is really hard work, so to have this conversation is a good thing.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Need help?

21,POLITICS,Trump's Scandal Could Cost House Republicans Big,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-scandal-gop-house-vote_us_57f86d8ee4b0e655eab497d9,Races that were once tilting toward Republicans could suddenly swing in the direction of the Democrats.,2016-10-08,"With GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's lewd remarks about women coming to light, there seems to be a real turning point in this election.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f8e85e1a000067145b7f4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump’s lewd comments about women present him with a tough challenge roughly one month before Election Day, and it’s also landed House Republicans in trouble.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pounced on the GOP presidential nominee’s hot mic incident late Friday night, recognizing that the problem Trump presents House Republicans with has suddenly been exacerbated.“We have never taken our foot off the gas with tying Republicans to Trump,” DCCC national spokeswoman Meredith Kelly told The Huffington Post Friday night, “and these comments prove why that strategy was right on the money.”The DCCC’s thinking has always been that Republicans were in a bind with Trump. Support him and you could ostracize swing voters. Resist him and you signal to Republicans that they should stay home. Plus, there’s a whole segment of Trump supporters who are truly excited about the brash businessman. Stand up to him and you risk GOP voters skipping over your name.But House Republicans seemed confident recently that they weren’t suffering the down-ballot effects that Democrats had expected. “We’re in a much stronger position than anybody thought,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters on Sept. 26, adding that he hadn’t seen a race that had a single GOP incumbent down.That is almost certainly an exaggeration. Look no further than Rep. Bob Dold’s Illinois district, or Rep. David Jolly’s Florida 13th, or Rep. Frank Guinta’s New Hampshire 1st district. But Republicans no doubt were feeling better than they had expected, largely because they were able to avoid the Trump tarnish. Voters just weren’t connecting Trump with their incumbent GOP Representative.That was, until Friday.With Trump’s remarks about women coming to light ― comments that, more than just being vulgar, suggest Trump has made unwanted sexual advances on women ― there seems to be a real turn in this election.Already, five House Republicans have either withdrawn their endorsement or called on Trump to drop out of the race: Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.) and Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah). Now that those members have taken a stand, there could be other Republicans who feel the need to revoke their support. Which is not to say those Republicans can just escape the Trump taint.As another DCCC spokesman, Tyler Law, said early Saturday after news that vulnerable Coffman was calling on Trump to abandon his presidential bid, “this political charade changes nothing.”“Donald Trump’s true character became clear when he attacked a Gold Star family, said he knew more about the Islamic State militant group than Army generals, called women slobs and pigs and labeled Mexicans as rapists and murderers. Coffman has had more than enough time to find some moral conviction and stand up to Trump,” Law said, conveniently laying out the game-plan against Republicans who suddenly find the courage to stand up to Trump.Coffman’s case is particularly poignant. He’s in a heavily Latino district. For Colorado, at least, that looks apt to support Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He had already expressed unease with Trump, suggesting that he couldn’t endorse the GOP nominee, but that unease awkwardly manifested itself Friday night.After his Democratic challenger, Morgan Carroll, slammed him for his silence, Coffman told the Aurora Sentinel newspaper that Trump’s comments on women were “deeply offensive and disgusting.” Hours later, with the paper noting that Coffman still hadn’t said who he’d vote for, Coffman upgraded his discontent by calling on Trump to “step aside.” And this seems like the major shift. Republicans are suddenly going to have to account for their Trump support, even their lack of opposition to the former reality TV personality, in a more direct way. House Republicans may finally own Trump. And if, as many expect, the nominee’s support craters because of these comments, Republicans would be facing a difficult climate anyway ― forget a lack of split-ticket voters.As another Democratic aide said late Friday night, “Who comes out unscathed in this?”The DCCC seems to think what makes these comments especially damaging ― on top of being vile ― is that voters are finally paying attention.“Not only are these comments beyond the pale, but their timing is particularly troubling for House Republicans,” Kelly said. “Given the heightened voter engagement at this point in the cycle, we expect to see real impact from this story and Republican failure to denounce Trump as a result.”Kelly added that Democrats are, of course, tailoring their message to the district. But the DCCC’s strategy has always been to get earned media with Trump, and use paid money on whatever issue polls best in each area.For most of these races, Democrats had thought Trump would be a weight on the GOP ticket, particularly in suburban, educated, and affluent districts. But there had been plenty of concern that the Democratic Party had put up too many weak candidates who couldn’t get within striking distance of incumbent Republicans, and that Trump wasn’t the anvil that strategists expected, especially in Rust Belt areas.Still, almost everyone expected the Democrats to pick up seats. It was just that gains of 10 seats, maybe 15, were looking far likelier than 20, 25, or the 30 needed for them to take back the majority.Democrats were looking at the map, and even with more than 50 seats held by Republicans that have a Partisan Voting Index score of R+4 or better ― with seven seats actually having a Democratic PVI ― the Cook Political Report was rating two-thirds of those seats as either “Safe Republican,” “Likely Republican,” or “Lean Republican.”But now, if Clinton actually does wipe the floor with Trump, there are a whole host of other seats that could suddenly come into play. Seats like Kevin Yoder’s Kansas district, which is an R+5. Or an open seat race in Virginia’s 5th district, another R+5 that wasn’t really on anyone’s radar.And those races that were once tilting toward Republicans could suddenly swing in the direction of the Democrats. Twenty seats suddenly doesn’t look so far-fetched, and who controls the House come the 115th Congress isn’t such a ridiculous question anymore, if this scandal turns out to be as big of a deal as the early traction seems to indicate.This could be the scandal that finally lands on Trump. And House Republicans who saw no signs of a Democratic wave could get pulled down by the undertow.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.This article has been updated to include the latest House Republicans to withdraw their endorsement or called on Trump to drop out of the race."

23,POLITICS,"Sorry GOP, Mike Pence Can’t Save You From Donald Trump",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-donald-trump_us_57f93a8ae4b0b6a43032c94e,The guy who has campaigned with Trump for months can't offer a clean break from his toxicity.,2016-10-08,Elected Republicans want Mike Pence to be the GOP nominee if Trump leaves the race.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During last Tuesday’s vice presidential debate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence systematically denied that his running mate, Donald Trump, had said many of the controversial statements that have plagued the GOP nominee this election cycle. Pence painted a picture of Trump that simply didn’t exist ― one without the sharp policy edges and routine disparagement of minority groups. It was substantively deceitful. But from a stylistic perspective, it was effective. The consensus of the pundits was that Pence won the debate. Public polls showed a narrow victory too. Three days later, that debate is virtually irrelevant after video emerged of Trump, caught on a hot mic, discussing his propensity to force himself on women, even by grabbing them by the crotch. Once more, Pence has been forced to construct an alternate reality, one in which he only just became aware of Trump’s character flaws. “As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,” Pence said in a statement. “I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people. We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.”As elected Republicans begin to urge Trump to depart the ticket, Pence’s name keeps being mentioned as a savior. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H) said she would be voting for the Indiana governor. Other Republicans have asked him to replace Trump on the ballot, arguing that it gives them a chance of actually winning. The possibility of making such a switch is somewhere between nil and terribly remote. But the notion that Pence would somehow emerge from the trash heap of the Trump candidacy intact enough to defeat Hillary Clinton is also far-fetched. After all, he, as much as anyone else, enabled Trump. It wasn’t just by creating a fantasy version of Trump’s candidacy and selling it to the American public during that vice presidential debate. Pence praised Trump well before he was chosen to be his running mate. When it came time to endorse a candidate in the Indiana Republican primary, Pence chose Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ― but not before delivering a lavish throat-clearing praise of the real estate mogul. When he was put on the ticket, Pence was tasked with serving as a character witness for the presidential nominee. And he did it with vigor. Pence said Trump was fun to watch.He said he was happy to defend him.The day that the hot mic video surfaced, he praised Trump’s “leadership” and “vision.”He said Trump was a “truly remarkable man.” He called Trump “a fighter” and “a winner” with whom he was “united.” When Trump was criticized for incendiary remarks, he called him “plain-spoken.”“I’ve gotten to know this good man,” Pence said of Trump, calling him “like no American leader in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan. He’s never forgotten the men and women who work with their hands. ... Donald Trump gets it.” Naturally, it goes on and on. Now, Pence could conceivably argue that this was all an elaborate act ― a servile effort for the larger good of the party. He could correctly note that he comes from a different wing of the GOP than Trump ― one based around the tenets of social conservatism and not, say, white nationalism. And he would be right in pointing out that on a variety of critical policy points, he didn’t subscribe to Trump’s worldview. But if Trump were to depart the race ― though he said he’s not going to ― and Pence try to grab the baton, the pushback will be immense, perhaps even un-traversable. He would have to contend with his past praise along with the reams of footage of him literally standing by Trump’ side. And he would have to answer the question of why it was that hot mic moment and not, say, a Muslim ban, birtherism, the attacks on a Mexican-American judge, the questioning of a war hero’s service or the repeated degradation of women that finally was too much for him and the rest of his party. More than that, he would have to answer why he got his judgment of Trump’s character so fundamentally wrong.Pence, in short, faces the exact same hurdles now that the Republican Party writ large is bound to face in the aftermath of the election. The stench of Trump isn’t easily rubbed away; certainly not if, for months, you willfully did your best to help him get elected.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Schumer is the heir apparent to now-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.Control of the Senate had been perhaps the toughest forecast to make in this unpredictable election season, with the Category 5 orange fury named Donald Trump completely roiling the normal political order.Still, HuffPost Pollster’s latest predictions gave the GOP about a 65 percent chance of holding on to Congress’ upper chamber.That is all based on modeling state polling, but there can also be some logic applied. Lots of people who vote against Trump might not want to give Hillary Clinton ― a candidate who is also not especially popular ― a Democratic-controlled Senate. It makes a pretty good argument for ticket-splitting: People could at least balance out their vote if they’re not too fond of Clinton.But then America learned that Trump was willing to boast, while wearing a microphone, about being a serial sexual predator.Republicans were quick to condemn the remarks ― but not to ditch Trump.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) seemed to think that he could deflect attention from his own support of the GOP nominee by putting the focus back on Trump.“He alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences,” McCain said in a statement Friday night.Some Republicans began to realize on Saturday morning exactly how toxic most Americans find Trump’s remarks.Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who called Trump a role model on Monday, was one of the GOP senators in a tight race to finally pull the plug.Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.), who is vying to replace the retiring Reid, took a similar step.“I can no longer look past this pattern of behavior and inappropriate comments from Donald Trump. Therefore, I cannot, in good conscience, continue to support him nor can I vote for Hillary Clinton,” he said in a statement. “My wife, my daughters, my mother, my sister and all women deserve better. The American people deserve better.”Heck’s opponent, Catherine Cortez-Masto, isn’t buying this apparent change of heart.Even McCain, who had defended the GOP nominee earlier this week, decided to dump Trump later Saturday, after his Friday remarks proved insufficient.But with just a month to go until Election Day, Democrats think such words are simply too late in coming. Trump, after all, has spent an entire campaign insulting women and minorities, supporting racists and enthusing about dictators.Democrats don’t think voters will buy a conversion this late in the game ― even if they aren’t excited about Clinton, they will have seen Republicans stand by Trump for too long.Indeed, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised that argument almost immediately after Ayotte finally disavowed her party’s standard-bearer.“Just days after calling Trump a ‘role model’ she is now attempting the most politically craven effort at self-preservation that we’ve seen,” the DSCC’s Tom Lopach said. “The time for courage has passed, and Sen. Ayotte solidified her role in Trump’s party long ago. New Hampshire voters won’t be fooled by this stunning example of politics at its worst.”But most of the GOP Senate slate still has not jumped from the Trump train, and Democrats are taking full advantage.“This is someone my opponent fully supports,” former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) said of Rep. Todd Young (R-Ind.).Former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) put it to his opponent, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, this way: “Donald Trump’s comments are indefensible. So is his candidacy. So one question remains for Sen. Johnson: Sen. Johnson, will you vote for Donald Trump to be President of the United States of America?”Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.) said the response from her foe, McCain, was “absolutely inexcusable and disgusting.”“Any responsible leader would see that Donald Trump should not be president,” Kirkpatrick added.Pennsylvania Democrat Katie McGinty had similar words for Sen. Pat Toomey (R). “The only thing worse than Donald Trump’s comments are the people who should stand up to him but instead do nothing,” McGinty said. “Pat Toomey likes to say he’ll stand up to Donald Trump, but every time something like this happens, he runs and hides.”The DSCC released a statement before some Republicans started unendorsing Trump, arguing that such a move would not matter.“Even if they do make the purely political calculation that now is the time to run for the fences ... it’s too little, too late,” the statement said.“Republicans have stood by Trump as he has insulted women, immigrants, African Americans, people with disabilities, Gold Star families, veterans and more,” the statement continued. “The question they can’t answer if they decide to jump ship is: Why only now?”If Clinton wins the White House, the Democrats need to win just four seats to retake control of the Senate.The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not return a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

26,POLITICS,What Advice Is Roger Ailes Giving Donald Trump About His Sexual Assault Comments?,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-ailes-donald-trump_us_57f85ae0e4b0e655eab48353,"After Ailes was ousted from Fox News over sexual harassment allegations, he quickly found a home with the Trump campaign.",2016-10-08,Multiple women who had worked at Fox News stepped forward to share stories of sexual harassment by Roger Ailes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f85e09170000bc16aca5f8.jpeg?ops=crop_6_120_2994_1625%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump found himself in his biggest campaign crisis to date Friday after audio emerged of him bragging about groping and sexually assaulting women in 2005. “When you’re a star they let you do it,” Trump says in the recording, which was captured on a hot mic aboard the bus of “Access Hollywood” and first published by The Washington Post. “You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”Trump swiftly faced denunciations from top Republicans, and his weak non-apology did nothing to stop the bleeding. But Trump does have someone in his corner who has gone through similar troubles and could presumably offer him some advice or bucking up. Former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes has been advising Trump around the presidential debates since he was ousted as chairman of Fox News this summer. Former host Gretchen Carlson had sued Ailes for sexual harassment, leading multiple other women at the network to come forward with their own stories.Those allegations were no problem for Trump, who swiftly brought Ailes into his orbit. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately return a request for comment Friday night on whether Ailes was still advising Trump and whether he offered any guidance around the current controversy.Trump’s offensive views on women have long been known. He has criticized women for gaining weight, said they can’t be a “10” if they’re flat-chested and argued that Hillary Clinton can’t satisfy America because she “can’t satisfy her husband.” Beyond those words, multiple women who have worked with him have said that he frequently made inappropriate comments or pursued them with unwanted physical advances.Carlson’s lawsuit against Ailes portrayed a similarly misogynistic culture at Fox News: None of that behavior was enough to make Trump condemn Ailes or decide he shouldn’t be someone he brings into his circle. And after Friday, it’s a bit clearer why.

In this historically red area, some Republicans are concerned.",2016-10-08,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pauses as he speaks at a campaign town hall event in Sandown, New Hampshire, on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f84899170000bc16aca5d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GETTYSBURG, Pa. ― This is the heartland of what should be Donald Trump’s America.In a town where the anti-slavery Republican-led North won the Civil War, where Abraham Lincoln eulogized the dead and Dwight Eisenhower lived, the lifelong GOP faithfuls who dominate local politics are trying hard to stick with Trump.But it’s not easy ― and a newly surfaced tape of the GOP presidential nominee bragging about his sexual predations as a married man doesn’t make it any easier.As a new wave of Republicans across the nation abandon Trump altogether or decline to appear with him at events, local leaders here in Adams County are caught in the maelstrom.“Well, my first reaction is to say that it’s just one alpha male bragging to another alpha male,” said Elizabeth Hower, the Republican chair of Adams County and its historic town of Gettysburg. “It’s what guys say all the time when they are alone, isn’t it?”But Hower, a feisty 70-year-old part-time school teacher and dedicated conservative, objected to Trump’s decision to fire back at his critics on Friday by attacking former President Bill Clinton’s history of marital infidelity and Hillary Clinton’s responses to it over the years.“That’s not smart,” she said. “I don’t want him to do that, and hope he doesn’t. Bill Clinton is not running for office, and her attitudes about what he did or didn’t do are beside the point.”“I wish that Mr. Trump would just concentrate on giving substantive, direct answers the questions and stating his positions,” Hower said over lunch the Blue Parrot Bistro near the town square. “He can’t get distracted by the emotions and attacks.”And she lamented Trump’s late-night Twitter insults about Miss Universe Alicia Machado that had preceded the latest revelations. “That was terrible,” Hower said.“I am 70 years old ― the same age as Mr. Trump,” she said. “People can change at that age. I know that I have. He can, too.” But he is nearly out of time to do so, even by the reckoning of this place.For a century and a half, the GOP tradition here, from Lincoln to “Ike,” has been tolerant, globalist and moralistic in a low-key way ― nothing at all like Trump’s inflammatory xenophobia and provocations on race, religion, ethnicity and sexual attitudes.With one month left until Election Day ― and with early voting already underway in several states ― it is hard to determine whether Trump supporters such as Hower really expect him to be the next president, or instead see him as a symbol of what amounts to a separatist movement in the making.Since Trump’s disastrous performance in the first debate and subsequent self-destructive tweets and all-but-incoherent speeches, the GOP nominee has fallen behind in the polls and Electoral College projections.Even before the latest revelations about his attitudes toward women, The Huffington Post’s own big-data projections estimated that Democrat Hillary Clinton had about an 80 percent chance of winning. Hower says Trump has raised some legitimate issues. They include trade agreements, immigration, terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, America’s long-running and fruitless military engagement in the Middle East and the fundamental notion that Washington must change.But it often seems that his real purpose is to stoke the fear and alienation of his supporters ― mostly white, rural and older ― by playing to racial, ethnic and religious concerns at home and proposing to essentially withdraw from diplomacy abroad.At a rally in a Gettysburg motel on Thursday, Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, proudly told the large crowd that he had visited battlefields on the rolling hills near town. He recalled that soldiers from his home state had fought and died to end slavery, preserve the United States and save “freedom.”But he then went on to praise Trump, whose list of nearly violent resentments ― against Muslims, Mexicans, “eating machine” women and others ― is almost too long to summarize.The virtually all-white crowd cheered when Pence vowed that he and Trump would “make America great again.” But what that seemed to mean in that room was a yearning to be left alone.There were no stories of Trump’s great life and achievements. Indeed, he has done what he can to hide the real story (in numbers) of his only claim to achievement ― his business career. There were few, if any, details of grand proposals to build that great America. Resentment was deep; the game plan shallow.In the end, given its history, Adams County will probably vote for Trump.But unless Trump can show a deeper and more serious side of himself during the second presidential debate on Sunday, it is doubtful that Pennsylvania ― or the country as a whole ― will want to do the same.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
28,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton's Paid Speeches Were Totally At Odds With Her 2016 Platform,Zach Carter and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-paid-speeches-austerity-trade_us_57f91902e4b0e655eab4c393,The Democratic nominee supported fiscal austerity and unfettered trade in remarks to bankers.,2016-10-08,"Hillary Clinton stands alongside Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs in Sep. 2014. Clinton's ties and paid speeches to major financial institutions have drawn scrutiny.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f91e451b0000e218ef5854.jpeg?cache=0cvQe8kK8e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In private, paid speeches to Wall Street elites, Hillary Clinton endorsed an austerity program and trade agenda that she has repudiated in her 2016 presidential campaign. Clinton has refused to release transcripts of her speeches at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, General Electric and other corporate heavyweights that preceded her presidential run. The whistle-blower website WikiLeaks posted the newly disclosed excerpts, which BuzzFeed’s Ruby Cramer first reported. Hackers working for the Russian government are the ultimate source of the emails, according to the FBI.In a paid speech to Morgan Stanley in April 2013, Clinton hailed the austerity platform proposed by former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) and Morgan Stanley director Erskine Bowles, the co-chairs of a debt reduction commission that President Barack Obama convened in 2010.The plan, which had Obama’s blessing, would have significantly cut Social Security benefits while raising tax revenue by closing loopholes.Simpson and Bowles “put forth the right framework,” Clinton told Morgan Stanley during remarks she was paid $225,000 to present. “Namely, we have to restrain spending, we have to have adequate revenues, and we have to incentivize growth. It’s a three-part formula.”Cutting benefits to the elderly is never popular on the American left, and the Simpson-Bowles plan landed at a time when the economy was particularly weak. Tax increases and spending cuts would have made the recession worse. But the elite consensus at the time declared that the problem with the economy was the budget deficit, rather than the fact that most people didn’t have enough money in their pockets. Progressives reviled Simpson-Bowles, but the Beltway chattering class was enraptured by it.During her primary battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), however, the former secretary of state reversed her position on austerity. She came out in support of expanding Social Security and has vowed never to cut it. Her official policy platform calls to significantly expand government spending on infrastructure, paid for with higher taxes on the rich.The newly disclosed speech excerpts do not show a corrupt Clinton willing to say one thing to private donors and another to the public. Rather, they underscore her reputation as a creature of the American political center, whose ideas and beliefs float with the elite current.Though the idea of austerity was popular in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, today it is widely acknowledged that premature spending cuts ― particularly at the state and local level ― stunted the recovery from the Great Recession. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, a Republican appointee, has made that point. In a speech last week, Jason Furman, Chair of Obama’s White House Council of Economic Advisers repudiated the deficit hawk consensus that many prominent Democrats, including the president himself, had embraced during the president’s first term in office. The current thinking among elite economists is much more in line with what progressives at the time had been calling for ― expanded government spending to bolster a weak economy. Clinton’s current policy platform largely reflects that consensus.Liberal elite support for free trade has also eroded of late, another pro-business position that divides the Democratic Party’s donors from its rank-and-file voters. And here too, Clinton’s public views have shifted from those she presented in private to bankers just a few years ago.In a 2013 speech to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau, Clinton called for a radical expansion of the economic vision established by the North American Free Trade Agreement and other recent trade pacts.“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere,” Clinton said.The “open borders” reference is an endorsement of unfettered migration between different nations, akin to the system currently in place in the European Union. Clinton has taken many different positions on immigration during the past decade, and even the past year. She has at times called to deport child refugees from Latin America, and at others presented herself as a champion of the undocumented. Her official 2016 platform includes a path to American citizenship for those here without proper paperwork.But Clinton’s shift on trade has been more directed. Though she helped negotiate Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership pact with 11 other Pacific nations ― including many in the Western Hemisphere ― she now rejects the plan.And she isn’t alone. For the past three decades, the prevailing view inside the Beltway held that free trade was good for American and foreign workers alike. The devastation of U.S. manufacturing communities and the inconsistent benefits to workers abroad have caused many to reevaluate their prior support, however. Clinton confidante Anne Marie Slaughter, a former State Department official who now heads the centrist New America Foundation, expressed concerns in September about the globalization status quo. She suggested that the United States had been overly sanguine about the potential foreign policy problems posed by expanding trade with rogue regimes. Prominent financial columnist Martin Wolf was even more explicit about his rethinking, suggesting that current free trade order has bolstered profits for corporate elites at the expense of democracy itself."

Journalist Joy Reid pressed Springer on why the leaking of this particular tape was “so much more incendiary for Republicans,” compared to Trump’s past vulgar and derogatory comments.“I don’t think these are just words,” Springer replied. “In this tape, he is not just using bad language or insults. In this tape, he is describing what he does. This suddenly becomes action, not just words. And this is what took it over the line.”Springer, an outspoken supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, added that what Trump said isn’t locker room banter. “This is admitting on tape what you do to women,” Springer said.Even if the tape wasn’t released, Trump “has no business being president of the United States,” Springer said.“He’s never run anything that has to do with delivering social services,” he added.

If Obama wanted, they might have just minutes instead.Today, the coalition officials deciding where to drop the bombs can rely on intelligence from U.S. surveillance systems, the most powerful in the world. If Obama wanted, they might run fewer bombing missions because they would have to rely on their own limited targeting data.At present, the bombs the Saudis and their allies are dropping on hospitals, schools, crowded markets and vital factories are in plentiful supply, and the jets that deliver them are perfectly serviced. But if Obama wanted, those bombers’ capacities could suddenly be severely limited.Using U.S. support, the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed rebels in Yemen has been responsible for the majority of the 10,000 deaths there since the conflict began 18 months ago ― and a brutal attack on Saturday that has reportedly killed hundreds. It has left more than 28 million people on the brink of famine. And it has allowed militant Islamists ― notably Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is focused on targeting the U.S. ― to seize more influence and room to operate than they have had in years.In the public consciousness, this brutal conflict blurs into the other bloody wars across the Middle East, each of them marked by its own complicated mix of players, incentives and grievances that make peace unlikely. But Yemen is different. Here, Obama could single-handedly cause a major drop in the bloodshed, experts say. He simply doesn’t seem to want to do it. Per Obama’s orders, planes belonging to the Saudis and others involved in their coalition currently receive aerial refueling from American planes, a defense official confirmed to The Huffington Post this week. U.S. military personnel stationed in Saudi Arabia offer intelligence and logistical support to the coalition, but don’t decide where it bombs, the official said. And the Obama administration has greenlit three new transfers of weapons ― ammunition, bombs, air-to-ground missiles and tanks ― to the kingdom to replenish stocks used in Yemen, according to arms trade expert William Hartung.Obama could stop all of that at any time.(The White House did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment on this proposition.)“There’s no question that American refueling, providing tankers, greatly enables the bombing of Yemen. If the Saudis had to do it without our tankers, the level of bombing would be enormously reduced, probably by a factor of three,” former Pentagon official Pierre Sprey told HuffPost. Tanks of U.S. fuel for the coalition’s jets could be moved out of the area in a handful of hours, the defense analyst estimated.Without U.S. refueling in the air to the Saudis and coalition allies such as the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and others, the coalition would have significantly less time over Yemen and its jets could carry far fewer bombs. Sprey, who helped design and launch the F-16 and A-10 jets in the 1970s, estimated that the Saudis’ F-15 jets would have five to 15 minutes over the closest rebel territory if they were flying from a base in southwest Saudi Arabia, near Yemen. Were they to target rebel-held cities along Yemen’s southwestern coast, they would have only five minutes in the air. And if the Saudis choose to fly most sorties from a base farther from Yemen — and therefore less vulnerable to rebel attacks — they would have to make even shorter bombing runs, the analyst said.Nations working with the Saudis choose whether to base their jets in the kingdom or at their own home bases. For those that fly from home because they are relatively nearby, like the UAE, U.S. aerial refueling is critical, Sprey said ― which means the coalition would have to rethink its ranks and would likely fly fewer planes for some time.Right now, the analyst estimated that U.S. support means each coalition mission can carry up to six bomb units or cluster bombs, munitions widely banned by most countries other than the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and fly for between one and three hours.“Without the refueling, they certainly couldn’t carry on a campaign on this scale,” Hartung, the arms trade expert, said.The next step would be to pull U.S. personnel who are currently assisting the coalition. The Obama administration already reduced the number of Americans aiding the Saudi-led coalition to under five in June, the defense official said, following an attempt at a ceasefire in the spring. Though the ceasefire faced problems almost immediately and has now fully collapsed, the U.S. believes that the group of fewer than five Americans is still enough to meet the coalition’s needs, the official told HuffPost.Were the president to fully shut down that joint cell, the coalition might cause more civilian casualties in the short run, Sprey said. But its general capacity to pick out targets would be more limited and the perception of a strong U.S. hand behind the war could start to recede ― granting the U.S. more legitimacy in its calls to strike more carefully, reduce the violence and ultimately move toward peace. To better limit the Saudis’ capacity, the administration could also review the kingdom’s contracts with former U.S. military personnel now working as contractors and try to reduce private assistance to the campaign, Sprey suggested. A final move for Obama would be to put conditions on future arms sales to the Saudis and their partners in the controversial coalition. The president has sold more weapons to the kingdom than any previous holder of the Oval Office. He presents this as a key part of his Middle East strategy ― a way to reassure the Saudis while he has pursued successful nuclear diplomacy with their archrival, Iran. However, Obama’s approach seems to have only enabled Saudi aggression by making the kingdom paranoid about abandonment by the U.S., encouraging it to deal with its own problems however it chooses (U.S. and international standards be damned) and providing it with the most advanced weaponry in the world.Rights advocates say Obama or a future president should leverage the weapons deals to which the Saudis and the U.S. seem so committed.Shocked by the reports out of Yemen, lawmakers who have a chance to approve or block Obama’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia seem more willing than before to use those deals to encourage changes in Saudi behavior, according to Cole Bockenfeld, deputy director on policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy. A recent effort in the Senate to vote down a deal providing the Saudis with fresh tanks was seen as “kind of a proxy vote to show some displeasure,” Bockenfeld said.The Obama administration could also take less drastic measures like preventing the flow of spare parts for U.S.-made machinery involved in the war, like the F-15 bombers, or suspending deliveries on existing contracts that have yet to be fulfilled.Under U.S. law, credible reports of human rights abuses by the holders of U.S. weaponry require the executive branch to suspend security assistance until it can investigate whether international law has been violated, the American Bar Association pointed out in a recent letter that encouraged lawmakers to block the tank deal.This means Congress also bears responsibility for the killing. It could pressure the Obama administration, if it chose, to take any of these measures and demand that the executive prove that the Saudi-led coalition is following international conflict standards before any more help of any kind is offered. Parliamentarians in London and Brussels for months have been putting pressure on their governments over the help Britain and European Union member states like France have been providing to the coalition.Opponents of such actions to wind down the war have used the same arguments for the last 18 months: A U.S. role helps prevent even greater civilian casualties; the Saudis could become even more anxious and lash out more brutally if the U.S. failed to support them in a region that they consider their backyard.That logic has less and less appeal on Capitol Hill, Bockenfeld said. “I think we’ve turned the corner on that and are now looking at how complicit we want to be in this. The answer is as little as possible, while still telling the Saudis, ‘We’ve got your back,’” he said, describing the thinking among lawmakers and their staff. “Just compare how [the war] is going now to how it was going a year ago, when the U.S. was even more involved and we weren’t having the influence we should.”Observers who say only the way to encourage a settlement to the conflict is to have a stake in the coalition have been proven wrong, Bockenfeld argued.Of course, pulling the U.S. out of the war won’t end it entirely.The rebel group fighting the Saudi-backed Yemeni government has proven that it’s willing to target civilians and commit major human rights violations as well, sometimes with arms provided by Saudi nemesis Iran. That group, the Houthis, and its ally, former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh, may become emboldened if the U.S. backs away. They could launch fresh offensives against the parts of the country that the Saudi-led coalition is defending.Meanwhile, the kingdom has shown no desire to back down or even accept greater accountability for its actions in Yemen. Asked how Saudi decision-makers would react to an Obama administration turnaround, Gulf politics expert Bilal Saab said it would be perceived as a stab in the back.“The Saudis are determined to gain further leverage through battlefield advances,” the Atlantic Council scholar told HuffPost Wednesday in an email. “Don’t rule out a limited ground invasion.”Still, ending U.S. cooperation with the Saudis’ misadventure in Yemen could help on three big fronts: by reducing the scale of the violence; by reducing the risk that U.S. complicity in the killing will spur greater anti-Americanism in the region; and by moving the situation toward what Saudi expert Greg Gause of Texas A&M University has suggested ― using American “influence over Saudi Arabia to help it find an exit ramp” out of an unpopular war.But that all depends on whether the president wants to stop the slaughter. Right now, it certainly seems like he doesn’t.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

There’s no telling what Trump’s legal fate is over the next few years, but the first chance that the American public will have to cast judgment comes at the ballot box.And that judgment holds the potential to be devastating: The American people are within striking distance of delivering the most brutal rejection of a major party candidate in U.S. history. That title is currently held in the modern era by Democrat George McGovern, who won 37.4 percent of the vote in 1972 against Richard Nixon, a defeat so thorough that it marked the beginning of the end of the liberal wave that had begun with FDR and the New Deal. Trump, according to HuffPost Pollster’s analysis, is now pulling in 42.5 percent of the vote. That was before he was caught on audio boasting about his penchant for sexual assault. Trump supporters can do their part in driving Trump down to 37 percent by abandoning him in droves, as at least some elite Republicans are starting to do. But there’s also a role for people who were planning on sitting this one out because the Democratic alternative is less than inspiring, or because they don’t live in a swing state. Helping make Trump the biggest loser in American history doesn’t require you to vote for Hillary Clinton. A vote for anybody other than Trump ― Green Jill Stein, Libertarian Gary Johnson, writing in your own name ― drives down Trump’s overall national percentage by driving up the total turnout. Pushing his number down to 37 percent ― just 5 points below where he is now ― sends a signal to the rest of the world that America has not lost its mind, that we don’t stand for or with what Trump represents. It lets our children know that his behavior is deplorable. It’s a message to immigrants, to women, to Muslims, to the disabled, to veterans, to everybody he has humiliated or assaulted that Americans are on record declaring that Trump does not represent the values of this country.No matter what state you live in, or which of the many candidates you want to vote for, get out and cast a ballot, and send that message.

You can do anything.”*Later that evening, C.K. appeared at a panel discussion at The New Yorker Festival with a story that captures the GOP presidential nominee’s remarkable selfishness and insatiable desire to satisfy his whims ― be it for material wealth or attention from attractive women ― he simultaneously feels no need to respect as human beings.C.K. explained how, as a struggling comedian, he worked at a casino that Trump owned and witnessed its day-to-day operation. “I saw this thing happening where buses would show up but with little old ladies. They would show up from places like Ohio and Tennessee to Atlantic City on a bus ― like some of them would’ve died on the way,” joked the comedian, who wrote a strong letter against Trump earlier this year. “They have nothing! And they take that little, tiny nothing, and they turn it into chips,” C.K. said. “As an employee, he watched guests file into the casino and “pour buckets of money into his [Trump’s] machines.”When Trump appeared at the casino, however, his demeanor was striking in its contrast to the environment around him. For one, he didn’t acknowledge any of the guests patronizing his business.“It wasn’t like, ‘Hi, folks, thanks for coming!’ It wasn’t like that at all. That’s not what he represented; that’s what was fascinating to me. He didn’t say ‘thank you’ to anybody. He just walked around.”Still, C.K. observed people around them greeting the brash businessman excitedly. He recalled Trump’s expression while riding the same elevator later. “It was just miserable,” C.K. said. Certainly, anyone who’s been vaguely following the presidential election can picture Trump’s expression:The comedian’s time at the casino left on him a lasting impression of the former reality TV personality.“They’re giving him everything. And he has everything, right? And they’re leaving on the same bus with nothing. They’re ruining their lives. And I saw this, like, a reverse charity,” he said, to laughs from the audience, before adding, “He needs it!” “He has a $10 billion deficit in his heart, so if he doesn’t have that much money, he’s nothing. ... Now, of course, he’s running for president. So he was like, ‘Thank you for your money. Now, I need control over your lives.’”At least it’s some kind of thank-you.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”Trump goes on to explain to Bush that women do not resist his uninvited advances, since he is a “star.”“Grab them by the pussy,” Trump says. “You can do anything.”Tic Tacs are apparently the reality TV star’s breath mint of choice before making unwanted, aggressive passes at women.On Friday night, CNN host Erin Burnett recounted the story of a friend who Trump had reportedly tried to kiss without consent. The real estate mogul popped a few Tic Tacs before moving in for the kiss, according to Burnett.This may be the first presidential election in which multiple consumer brands have felt obligated to dissociate themselves from comments made by a particular candidate or campaign representative.Wrigley Americas, the parent company of Skittles, last month expressed its unequivocal disagreement with a comment Donald Trump Jr., the GOP nominee’s son, had made. Trump Jr. compared refugees to a bowl of Skittles that included some poisoned candies.“Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don’t feel it’s an appropriate analogy,” Denise Young, Wrigley Americas’ vice president of corporate affairs, said in a statement.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss, I don’t even wait,” Trump said in a 2005 conversation with “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush. “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”Republican leaders rushed to condemn his remarks ― as they have time and time again. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said he does not condone the candidate’s comments but is “grateful that he has expressed remorse.”Trump admitted the conversation with Bush was “wrong” but quickly pivoted to talk of Bill Clinton’s affairs. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) responded to the newly released footage by saying, “I am sickened by what I heard today.”“Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” Ryan said, while continuing to support the GOP nominee. “I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on Trump to “apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility.” But he also stopped short of telling Trump to drop out of the race.Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus said, “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.”Priebus is also continuing to support and fund Trump’s campaign.Two former Trump rivals-turned-Trump backers, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), also weighed in. Although Rubio said it was “impossible to justify” Trump’s offensive comments, he did not withdraw his endorsement.Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who has also endorsed the GOP nominee, said the comments were “lewd & insulting.”Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), who chairs the House Republican Conference, said, “It is never appropriate to condone unwanted sexual advances or violence against women. Mr. Trump must realize that it has no place in public or private conversations today or in the past.”Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney who is running for Congress in Wyoming, also condemned Trump while declining to pull her endorsement.But for some prominent Republicans ― who had already stuck with Trump through repeated instances of sexism, fat-shaming and casual pedophilic remarks ― enough was enough.Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), however, said the media’s obsession with Trump’s comments are as offensive as the comments themselves. “Disgusting, shameful, totally disrespectful ‘locker room’ garbage, privately shared between two Hollywood playboys over a decade ago, is now made to be ‘the crudeness heard ‘round the world.’ The old Bush and Trump braggart comments were beyond abhorrent and offensive, though both boys apologized for them,” she wrote in a Facebook post. She also wrote that she was sure Hillary Clinton had made comments that were more crude while in private.

37,ENTERTAINMENT,NBC Is Starting A Program To Hire More Female Directors,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nbc-female-forward_us_598392d4e4b0cb15b1bd7df7,The network is bringing aboard 10 women who will eventually direct episodes of their TV series.,2017-08-03,"With Female Forward, NBC hopes to help women get into the director's seat. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598394cf1a00009bc1dc1fc5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The dearth of female directors in the TV and film world remains one of Hollywood’s more glaring problems. But NBC is doing what it can to tackle the problem head on. The network is partnering with director Lesli Linka Glatter to create a program called Female Forward, which will be dedicated to getting women into the director’s chair on television sets. Glatters’s directorial credits include episodes of “Homeland,” “The Walking Dead,” “True Blood” and “Mad Men,” among many others. “It’s been a collective and urgent goal of ours to identify more female directors,” NBC President Jennifer Salke said in a statement. “We strongly believe women can and should be at the forefront of telling compelling stories, and I hope the guaranteed directing component will have real impact on our shows as well as the industry.”Starting in the 2018-2019 TV season, NBC will bring aboard 10 female directors to shadow directors for as many as three episodes of an NBC show. Then, they’ll direct at least one episode of the show themselves. That experience should provide some much-needed help for getting some deserving feet in the door. As of the 2015-2016 TV season, only 17 percent of TV episodes were directed by women, according to the Directors Guild of America. “It shouldn’t be harder for our daughters to direct than for our sons. It should be an equal playing field,” Glatter said in a statement. “I’m truly optimistic that with this kind of commitment from the incredible Jen Salke and NBC Entertainment, we can actually make a difference. A program like this is a game changer and it’s an honor to be a part of it.”NBC hopes to expand the number of women in the Female Forward program after its first year, it said in a release. The program was reportedly announced at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Thursday. "
38,POLITICS,Why A Local News Station's Decision To Live-Stream A Potential Suicide Is Dangerous,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-5-new-york-potential-suicide-attempt-live-stream_us_59821844e4b09d24e994d707,Fox 5 in New York used Facebook to post a live video of a man threatening to jump from a bridge. Experts say this kind of coverage is irresponsible.,2017-08-03,"A screenshot from Fox 5's live video on Wednesday, showing reactions to a man threatening to jump from a bridge. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59831c4f1500007d208b4dd0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For over an hour on Wednesday morning, a local news helicopter hovered above a New York City bridge, its camera aimed at a man hanging off the side and threatening to jump. Fox 5 broadcast the scene live on its Facebook page as police tried to talk the man down. At least 60,000 people watched, sending thumbs-up and laughing emojis streaming across the bottom of the video; some commenters suggested the man should just go ahead and jump. He didn’t. The man voluntarily climbed back onto the bridge and was taken into police custody hours after Fox 5 ended its livestream, according to several local media reports.The video has since been removed from Facebook, but suicide prevention experts have expressed concern over the news organization’s decision to broadcast from the bridge in the first place. Dozens of academic studies have linked this type of news coverage to an increase in the likelihood of suicide attempts by vulnerable individuals.Fox 5 did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment specifically on the Fox 5 livestream. Dr. Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told HuffPost that Fox 5′s video concerned her for a number of reasons. First, she said, it’s insensitive.“Even though it’s a public event, it’s still a very personal event to the person involved and to their families,” she said, adding that footage of a suicide attempt “can be very upsetting and stigmatizing.” Second, she said people who have experienced suicidal ideation in the past could be “retraumatized” by watching Fox 5’s video, potentially triggering suicidal behavior. And finally, Harkavy-Friedman said: “We worry about contagion and copycat behavior.” A substantial body of evidence shows that sensationalized media coverage can lead to both people mimicking a particular suicide and an increase in the actual suicide rate. Dan Reidenberg, executive director at the suicide prevention group SAVE.org, agreed.“I would not recommend that media share any live-streaming, let alone reposting or replaying of a suicide attempt,” he said, adding that “whether there’s a save or not, we don’t want news stations broadcasting those things.” There was “no good reason” for Fox 5 to broadcast the scene from the bridge Wednesday, Reidenberg said. The Associated Press updated its style guide ― used by journalists worldwide ― in 2015 to include direction on how to cover suicide. “Generally, AP does not cover suicides or suicide attempts, unless the person involved is a well-known figure or the circumstances are particularly unusual or publicly disruptive,” the style guide reads. “Suicide stories, when written, should not go into detail on methods used.” The AP also collaborated with multiple suicide prevention organizations in 2016 to develop a report on coverage of suicide. “Risk of additional suicides increases when the story explicitly describes the suicide method, uses dramatic/graphic headlines or images, and repeated/extensive coverage sensationalizes or glamorizes a death,” the report warns. The report also suggests including resources for help. About halfway through its livestream Wednesday, Fox 5 pinned a comment to its Facebook video that included the number of a suicide hotline. If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also text HELLO to 741-741 for free, 24-hour support from the Crisis Text Line. Outside of the U.S., please visit the International Association for Suicide Prevention for a database of resources."

The rear-seat dummy is hurled forward into the back of the front seat, forcing the driver-seat dummy into the airbag and steering wheel. Research shows that in a frontal collision, the driver is more likely to be killed if the rear-seat passe<em>nger</em> is unbelted.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598241ba1500002a008b4ce1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Cheryl Jensen, FairWarningPeople who don’t buckle up when they ride in the rear seat because they think it’s safer back there are wrong. Instead, they pose a serious danger to themselves and those riding up front, according to a new study and crash test video by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.The video of that crash at 35 mph shows the unbelted test dummy flying forward and slamming into the rear of the front seat, which then forces the belted driver dummy into the air bag and steering wheel.“That absolutely can have fatal consequences for both the rear seat passenger and the driver,” said Jessica Jermakian, a study co-author and senior research engineer with the insurance institute. Safety research shows that drivers are more than two times as likely to be killed in a crash if the occupant behind them is not wearing a seat belt, she said.Seat belt use in the rear has consistently been lower than in the front seat for the last decade, Jermakian said.Seat belts are proven lifesavers: When lap/shoulder belts are used, they reduce the risk of death to front seat occupants in a car by 45 percent. That increases to 60 percent in a light truck such as an SUV, pickup or van, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Similar figures are not available for the back seat.However, almost half (400) of the 883 deaths of rear-seat passengers who were not wearing their seat belts could have been prevented by buckling up, estimates a 2015 study by the Governors Highway Safety Association.‘The front seat is there to stop me’It hasn’t been clear why fewer people buckle up in the rear seat because most research has focused on attitudes of people in front who don’t wear their seat belts. To find out, the insurance institute conducted a telephone survey of 1,172 people who had been rear-seat passengers in the past six months.Of those, 91 percent said they always buckled up in the front seat, but only 72 percent said they always buckled up in the rear. The study focused on the 28 percent who said they used seat belts in the rear only some of the time or never.The number one reason that people gave for not wearing their seat belt was that the back seat is safer so they don’t need to wear it, Jermakian said. Some surveyed said, “The front seat is there to stop me.” Others said, “I’m not going to go through the windshield.”“When that front seat is stopping you, it’s also the front seat occupant that is stopping you,” Jermakian said. Historically, it has been safer in the back seat, she said, but that’s if people are belted in. “We did the simulated crash test because we wanted to show people what happens when you’re not belted. It not only puts them at risk, but it also impacts other people in the vehicle.” Shrinking safety advantageIn the last few years some studies have shown that the relative safety advantage of riding in the back has begun to shrink, particularly for adults and in newer vehicles.The reason the safety advantage is shrinking is that improvements have focused on the front seat, where most people ride. These include changes to front seat belts that reduce chest injuries, the addition of seat belt reminder chimes and structural improvements to better protect passengers in a frontal crash.Some of the same improvements could migrate to the back but progress has been slow. Seat belt reminder systems, for example, have been credited with helping to increase belt use in the front. They are not required by the federal government for the rear seat, however, and few vehicles have them.In the telephone survey, about three out of five people said they would be more likely to buckle up in back if there were an audible or visual reminder system like the one in front.Yet it has been seven years since safety advocates petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to require rear seat reminders, and five years since Congress directed the agency to develop a rule that would require the safety feature. Federal regulators have yet to begin that process.“This is part of our ongoing regulatory review,” NHTSA said in an email to FairWarning. “The safe movement of the traveling public remains our top priority.”This story was reported by FairWarning (www.fairwarning.org), a nonprofit news organization based in Pasadena, Calif., that focuses on public health, consumer and environmental news.

Andrew Cuomo’s behest and then pushed out the writer of the piece after the writer complained. “It’s a complete lie,” Bennet said in a statement Wednesday to HuffPost.The anonymous accusation has been hotly debated this week among Times veterans, along with the decision to publish the charge on an alumni Facebook page, which, while technically private, has more than 2,400 members. The group is primarily for alumni but also includes current staffers such as Bennet, who rejoined the Times last year as editorial page editor. On Monday night, former Times reporter Matthew Wald published the account from a “well-informed newsroom colleague” who alleged that Bennet forced out Lawrence Downes, a member of the editorial board since 2004, after he “took exception to changes Bennet made” in a May editorial Downes had written about renovations to Penn Station. “These changes, Downes believed, were made after the editorial had gone through the normal editing cycle” and appeared ready for publication, according to the post, which was obtained by HuffPost. The anonymous writer charged that Cuomo, who has a reputation for responding aggressively to editors, contacted Bennet about the editorial before its publication. “All the excised material was critical of the governor,” the post read. “Downes saw the revised editorial only after it had been published. He wrote an angry email to Bennet, who responded by suspending him immediately. When Downes returned to work a few weeks later, Bennet told him he was out.”Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said by email Wednesday night, “It’s simply untrue that the editorial was softened in response to pressure by the Governor.”The Times just completed a round of buyouts, which has led to the departures this past week of high-profile journalists including James Risen and Michiko Kakutani. Poynter’s list Friday of who took buyout packages includes Downes but reports he accepted the package in May. Downes declined to comment when reached by HuffPost. It’s unclear what, if any, pre-publication edits were made to the piece. But the published version, “Let Penn Station Breathe,” placed the primary responsibility to fix the train station on Cuomo and included criticism of the governor’s efforts. The editorial, which like most at the Times are unsigned, suggested that Cuomo’s plan to fix Penn Station fell short of “radical intervention” and urged the governor to do better. “Instead of defending his plan, Mr. Cuomo would be better off fixing it,” it read.Downes, who is not a member of the Facebook alumni group, saw a copy of the post and requested that it be taken down. But Wald, who updated the post with Downes’ request to remove it, did not comply as of Wednesday night. Wald could not be reached for comment.Downes’ abrupt departure in May added to uncertainty inside the Times about the future of the editorial board, according to staffers who asked to remain anonymous because they are unauthorized to speak publicly. While Times management is putting additional resources into the paper’s opinion section, including beefing up video and graphics, the ranks of the editorial page staff have dwindled in recent months, with several departures among the latest wave of buyouts. The opinion and editorial staffs are also in the process of moving from the Times building’s 13th Floor ― where they were separate from the newsroom ― to closer quarters on the 5th Floor. The author of the Facebook post described the ranks of editorial staff as “depleted” and suggested deputy editorial page editor Terry Tang, who left the paper in May, was also pushed out. The Times recently announced that Kathleen Kingsbury, the Boston Globe’s managing editor for digital, will join the paper in August as deputy editorial page editor. Dozens of Times alumni commented on Monday’s post, several of whom praised Downes ― who joined the paper in 1993 ― as a skilled editor and beloved colleague. Some expressed concerns about Bennet’s stewardship if the accusations were true that he softened the piece in response to the governor’s objections, which would also mean he discussed it with the governor before publication. And the decision to publish triggered a broader ethics debate given Wald’s decision to run the anonymous accusation without first approaching the parties involved. Randall Rothenberg, a business executive and former Times reporter, commented on the Facebook page that the post made him “very uncomfortable.”“It’s second-hand hearsay, with lots of serious charges of heavy moral weight, without a request for a response from the accused parties,” he wrote. “Yeah, okay, this is a Facebook group, not the newspaper of record. But it’s also kinda like a small town paper in a way…. Doesn’t seem right.”In a reply on Facebook, Wald defended publication and suggested that a Times staffer might only be able to question the decisions of a high-ranking editor like Bennet if provided anonymity. He also wrote that buyouts have “changed the atmosphere of the newsroom” and that staffers may now be more reluctant to challenge editorial decisions out of fear they could be urged to leave in the next round. Former Times Executive Editor Max Frankel suggested to the group not to post “anything anonymously.”“Do not post anything ‘off the record’ or ‘confidentially,’” Frankel wrote. “An audience of 2400 is never ‘private.’ Do not reflect on the performance of Times colleagues, past and present, without requesting their direct comment.”Do you know more about what happened?

The opinion and editorial staffs are also in the process of moving from the Times building’s 13th Floor ― where they were separate from the newsroom ― to closer quarters on the 5th Floor. The author of the Facebook post described the ranks of editorial staff as “depleted” and suggested deputy editorial page editor Terry Tang, who left the paper in May, was also pushed out. The Times recently announced that Kathleen Kingsbury, the Boston Globe’s managing editor for digital, will join the paper in August as deputy editorial page editor. Dozens of Times alumni commented on Monday’s post, several of whom praised Downes ― who joined the paper in 1993 ― as a skilled editor and beloved colleague. Some expressed concerns about Bennet’s stewardship if the accusations were true that he softened the piece in response to the governor’s objections, which would also mean he discussed it with the governor before publication. And the decision to publish triggered a broader ethics debate given Wald’s decision to run the anonymous accusation without first approaching the parties involved. Randall Rothenberg, a business executive and former Times reporter, commented on the Facebook page that the post made him “very uncomfortable.”“It’s second-hand hearsay, with lots of serious charges of heavy moral weight, without a request for a response from the accused parties,” he wrote. “Yeah, okay, this is a Facebook group, not the newspaper of record. But it’s also kinda like a small town paper in a way…. Doesn’t seem right.”In a reply on Facebook, Wald defended publication and suggested that a Times staffer might only be able to question the decisions of a high-ranking editor like Bennet if provided anonymity. He also wrote that buyouts have “changed the atmosphere of the newsroom” and that staffers may now be more reluctant to challenge editorial decisions out of fear they could be urged to leave in the next round. Former Times Executive Editor Max Frankel suggested to the group not to post “anything anonymously.”“Do not post anything ‘off the record’ or ‘confidentially,’” Frankel wrote. “An audience of 2400 is never ‘private.’ Do not reflect on the performance of Times colleagues, past and present, without requesting their direct comment.”Do you know more about what happened?

44,QUEER VOICES,Drag Queen's Dream Of Reading Stories To Kids Sparks Outrage In North Carolina,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drag-queen-library-outrage_us_5982110ce4b0353fbb346154,"Brandon James says he wanted to open minds to ""tolerance and acceptance.""",2017-08-03,"Brandon James, who has been doing drag for almost 11 years, told HuffPost that he was “completely caught off guard” by the backlash his plan received. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59822c6f1a00009bc1dc1c69.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A drag queen’s plan to encourage diversity by reading to children at a North Carolina library backfired this week after residents complained.Brandon James, who goes by the drag name Princess Onya Mann and has been performing for 11 years, told local NBC affiliate WCNC last week that he’d applied to host a drag queen story hour at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library in Charlotte, North Carolina. James, 30, appeared in a pink dress reminiscent of Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty” and told WCNC that he was eager to host a story hour for kids because it would “open their minds to diversity, tolerance, and acceptance.” (Watch the full WCNC interview above.) The colorful concept of drag queens reading to children in libraries, bookstores and schools reportedly began in San Francisco in 2015, and has since become a popular event in New York and Los Angeles, according to The New York Times. James’s hope to offer something similar to youngsters in the Tar Heel State, however, were dashed shortly after the WCNC segment aired July 27.A conservative citizen group called Keep NC Safe blasted the news in a July 28 tweet.The group also posted a story to its Facebook page, where it had received over 70 comments as of Thursday, many of them negative. “Males dressing in women’s fashion or in a feminine manner is shameful and that sort of shameful behavior should not be sanctioned by public libraries, and least of all with a child audience,” one person wrote. Added another, “It will be like taking kids to gawk at the mentally ill in a circus. We need to help the mentally ill, not participate in the delusion.” The news also caught the attention of Mecklenburg County Commissioner Matthew Ridenhour, who said he was “appalled” by James’s plan in a comment beneath Keep NC Safe’s Facebook post. The 30-year-old James, who currently resides in Pacolet, South Carolina but performs mainly in North Carolina, is gearing up for the release of his first children’s book, Auntie Bulli, this fall. He told HuffPost that he was “completely caught off guard” by the backlash that his plan received. “I was truly oblivious,” he said. “I mostly find it sad. I understand that super religious people would not be there supporting it, but to go the extra mile to fight it when you could just not come kinda shocked me!”In an email to HuffPost, Charlotte Mecklenburg Library’s Director of Marketing, Communications & Advocacy Cordelia B. Anderson said that the drag queen’s original proposal simply didn’t meet programming guidelines. “We have a very specific way that story times are delivered, following best practices in the library industry,” Anderson wrote, “and these are typically delivered by trained staff, following those practices.”She noted that the library “offers programs other than story times,” and that James would be invited to present Auntie Bulli as part of the next Presenter Showcase, in which authors, artists and other specialists offer suggestions for future events, in January 2018. WCNC had never contacted the library before airing the story, she added. “The Charlotte Mecklenburg Library, in its mission to improve lives and build a stronger community, believes in the value of programs as a way to improve literacy skills, support educational success, and bring people with diverse backgrounds and experiences together in a welcoming space,” she said. Given how drag has infiltrated mainstream pop culture through “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” James believes it’s “essential to create events that not only inspire the [drag] community, but also involve them.” “I never once considered that people might see [the story hour] as unsafe, because these events are held in a public area with parents in the room,” he added. “I now see that these groups are using fear and propaganda to scare parents away from bringing their kids... [it’s] a great opportunity for kids and their parents to experience diversity in a safe space as well as ask questions to become more comfortable and accepting.”Catch the latest in LGBTQ news by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

45,TASTE,"Cooking Off The Cuff: Yes, It’s About The Season, But It's Also About The Pasta Shape","Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-yes-its-about-the-season-but_us_5981049de4b02be325be0201,"Here in New York, we’re at that point in the summer when peppers – both hot and mild – have turned up in the farmers’ markets",2017-08-02,<p>A chopped peeled tomato will add savoriness and moisture</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598105231a00001b00dc19b9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here in New York, we’re at that point in the summer when peppers – both hot and mild – have turned up in the farmers’ markets, but not yet at the moment when green peppers ripen and turn red. And it is red peppers that Jackie and I find most appealing: I use them even when tradition calls solely for green ones, as in my big annual batch of Hungarian-style lecsó.In the meantime, we’re not neglecting the peppers heaped up in the market, such as the glossy black-green poblanos we bought last weekend. While it is foolhardy to make assumptions about the heat of any batch of capsicums, these tend to be mild, but with plenty of flavor, a slight prickle and a good level of bitterness; they’re a fine pepper to hold us over until green turns to red.Their flesh is thin compared with that of standard bell peppers, and it seems natural to cut them into narrow strips – say, an eighth of an inch (a bit more than 3 mm) wide. The juicy young onions in the market may be similarly sliced, and this week I allowed that to determine the shape of pasta I used in our dinner. (Yes, more pasta with vegetables – take advantage of the season’s produce while you can!)What I used for the usual two portions was 175 grams (just over six ounces) of trofie, a vermiform pasta from Liguria whose shape echoes the julienned vegetables. I bought mine in a bag, dried, but it is among those flour-and-water pastas you can make from scratch if you’re of a mind to (in this video by a Boston-based cooking teacher you can see a clever way to form them – and a few other shapes made from the same dough).Once that important decision had been made, I blanched and peeled a ripe medium-sized tomato, diced it, placed it in a bowl with salt and a teaspoonful of good olive oil and set it aside. Then, I halved a medium new-season onion (sweet and juicy, though a regular one would be fine) and sliced it thin, putting it to sweat over low heat in olive oil with a whole peeled clove of garlic and a sprig or two of fresh mint. And salt, of course.As the onion softened, I halved two poblano peppers lengthwise, removed the seeds and pith and sliced them thin. One of them was pretty hot, but that was no deterrent: by the time the dish was done and other ingredients added, the flavor would have softened. I added this to the onions and still over low heat continued to cook until the peppers were almost overcooked, with a very soft texture and intensified flavor. This took a quarter of an hour, but start checking after eight minutes.The store-bought trofie would take twelve minutes to cook, in boiling salted water. When they were under way, I added the tomato and all its juice to the onion-pepper mixture, brought it up to the simmer and cooked it over medium-low heat for a couple of minutes. The aim was to concentrate its flavor a bit while retaining plenty of moisture.When the trofie were not quite done, with the slightest hardness at the very core, I drained them and stirred them into the sauce, where they simmered until done, about 30 seconds. I needed to add some of the pasta-boiling water to keep everything moist; you probably will too.Finally, I stirred in a good handful of fresh mint leaves, transferred the pasta to a warmed serving bowl and folded in a fistful of shredded ricotta salata – a cheese with marked but gentle flavor; extra cheese was brought to the table to top our individual portions. If you didn’t have ricotta salata, you could use grated pecorino here, but add it not by the fistful but by the tablespoon: it is much more assertive. Likewise, lacking fresh mint, you could use sage or parsley or basil.This is a hearty yet still summery dish with a particular feel in the mouth: the long-cooked peppers develop a seemingly mucilaginous texture that binds and lubricates all the elements. But because of the tomato and pasta water, the pasta never grows cludgy.And yes, this will work with other not-hot peppers: regular bell peppers of any color or so-called frying peppers would be delicious – so long as you cook them long enough for their flavor and texture to become intense. The trofie can be replaced by cavatelli or indeed by another short shape of dried pasta, though the latter will not be quite the same either visually or on the tongue."

While Qatar’s neighbors also engage in some practices that are counterproductive in the fight against terrorism, no other Gulf monarchy has a counterterrorism record as bad as Qatar’s in so many different regards. Those pivotal issues include legal impunity for terror financiers, providing a safe haven for terrorists, allegedly paying large ransoms to terrorist groups, and enabling religious and media incitement.Some observers erroneously argue that the anti-Qatar quartet – comprised of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain – has no grounds for criticizing Doha because its conduct has been functionally equivalent. That view is wrong. For example, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who has put a hold on all lethal U.S. military sales to the Gulf monarchies until the current crisis is resolved, argues that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi “live in glass houses” and “shouldn’t throw stones at Qatar” regarding terror finance. On the other end of the spectrum are those who seem to give Qatar’s neighbors a free pass. For instance, President Trump tweeted that when he met with Muslim leaders in Riyadh to discuss the funding of extremism, “all reference was pointing to Qatar.” He later added that “I won’t name other countries” in the region involved in spreading hate or intolerance. This glosses over other inconvenient facts, such as that Trump’s Saudi hosts have continued to publish state textbooks for children that encourage fighting against infidels (such as Jews or Christians) and perceived polytheists (such as Shi’ite Muslims). Rather than giving Qatar’s neighbors carte blanche, the U.S. should press all of its Gulf allies to improve their counterterrorism practices. And while Washington should seek a timely resolution of the current crisis, it should do so on enforceable terms that address Qatar’s dangerous conduct, including in all the following regards:Private Terror FinanceIn March 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department’s then-Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen stated that Qatar “has for many years openly financed Hamas.” By and large, however, Washington’s concerns about Qatari conduct have focused more on the granting of impunity to terror financiers than on allegations that the state directly funds terrorist groups.For example, Cohen described Qatar and Kuwait in 2014 as “permissive jurisdictions” for terrorist finance, and he later accused Doha of granting legal impunity to Qatari citizens who are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions for alleged terror finance, including Khalifa al-Subaiy and ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Nu’aymi.Qatar had never convicted a single terror financier before 2015. Since then, it quietly pressed charges against five Qatari nationals who were under U.N. sanctions for allegedly funding al-Qaeda. According to former Treasury officials Katherine Bauer and Matthew Levitt, those five were Subaiy, Nu’aymi, Ibrahim al-Bakr, Sa’d bin Sa’d al-Ka’bi, and ‘Abd al-Latif al-Kawari. All but one are still believed to be in Qatar, but as of July 7, 2017 AP reported that they were still “not imprisoned” despite some of them having been convicted.Last year, the State Department indicated in its Country Reports on Terrorism that private Qatari entities continued to fund al-Qaeda through at least the end of 2015. In February 2017, a recently retired senior Treasury official stated that designated terror financiers were still “operating openly and notoriously” in Qatar and Kuwait. Former Under Secretary Cohen added this July that Qatar is “markedly worse than others in the Gulf” on terror finance but “not that much worse than Kuwait.”Like Qatar, it seems Kuwait has yet to take effective legal action against certain U.S. or U.N.-designated terror financiers on its territory. Several individuals sanctioned by the anti-Qatar quartet on charges of terror finance are actually based in Kuwait. Several preachers still listed as faculty members on the website of Kuwait’s flagship public university are currently under counterterrorism sanctions by the U.S., U.N., or anti-Qatar quartet.The aforementioned cable signed by Hillary Clinton in 2009 strikingly asserted that private donors in Saudi Arabia constituted “the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” But Saudi and Emirati policies for combating terror finance have also significantly improved in past years, to the point where they are held up by Washington as model Gulf partners versus terror finance. Still, Saudi Arabia recently has erred in providing safe haven to two Yemenis under U.S. counterterrorism sanctions. Additionally, the UAE needs to make further progress on combating Iranian sanctions violations on its territory by tightening the regulation of economic free zones across the federation’s seven emirates.Safe haven for terroristsQatar and Kuwait have yet to publicly issue lists of banned terrorist organizations. Lists issued by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain since 2014 have significant gaps, most notably the absence of Hamas and the Afghan Taliban. Yet only Qatar brazenly provides safe haven to members of terrorist groups, in spite of President Trump’s call for Muslim leaders to “drive out” terrorists and extremists from their midst.For over half a decade, Qatar has provided a safe haven to Hamas leaders. At least two individuals accused of directing and financing Hamas terrorist cells still appear to be based in Doha. In addition, Qatar hosts senior Taliban leaders. This was originally approved by the Obama administration, but it has not yielded obvious benefits and should be reassessed by the new U.S. administration. Qatar is also home to several leaders of the U.S.-sanctioned terrorist group Gama’a Islamiya, some of whom were personally sanctioned by the anti-Qatar quartet in June. Qatar allegedly has even paid for the operating or living expenses of many of these individuals. For example, the New York Times reported in July that Doha is now “home to about 100 Taliban officials and their relatives, who live comfortably at Qatari state expense” according to an Afghan official.Taliban officials have reportedly spent time in Saudi Arabia and the UAE as well, but never with such open impunity. Saudi Arabia reportedly released several Hamas financial operatives from jail in 2015, which Qatar reportedly did that year as well.Alleged Ransoms to TerroristsIn the last five-and-a-half years, Qatar has been described in press reports as a negotiator for at least eighteen different episodes of hostage talks. In most instances, the kidnapper has been identified as a U.S.-designated terrorist group. In some cases, a multi-million dollar ransom was allegedly paid, often allegedly by Qatar. To a lesser degree, Oman has also been accused of paying ransoms to terrorist groups or making payments akin to ransoms for prisoners held by Iran.According to a Gulf source cited by the Financial Times, the “straw that broke the camel’s back” and sparked the current crisis with Qatar was an enormous alleged ransom payment by Doha for roughly two dozen Qatari nationals, including members of the royal family. According to FT’s sources, Qatar allegedly paid over $100 million to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (a Syrian armed group dominated by al-Qaeda), tens of millions to Ahrar al-Sham (a Syrian jihadist group designated as a terrorist group by the UAE), $300 million to Iran-backed militias in Iraq (including Kataib Hezbollah, which the U.S. lists as a terrorist group), and $400 million to the government of Iran. State-Enabled IncitementAll six Gulf monarchies pledged in 2014 to repudiate the ideology that underpins IS and other terrorist groups. Yet Qatar hosted a preacher at its Grand Mosque in 2015 who called for God to “destroy” “the Christians,” “the Jews,” “the Alawites,” and “the Shia.” That same preacher, Saad al-Ateeq, made similar remarks there in 2013. Qatar pledged since Ateeq’s repeat performance to keep him off state television but broke that pledge this year.Ateeq was also permitted to host a 29-part series of clips this year on Saudi state television, despite having made remarks to a Saudi state broadcaster in 2015 that could be interpreted as calling for ethnic cleansing in Yemen. This June, Dubai’s government hosted a preacher who had apparently endorsed a fundraising campaign that reportedly backed Ahrar al-Sham (which the UAE says is a terrorist group) and another cleric who once said that Osama bin Laden died with more honor and dignity than any non-Muslim.Finally, there is Qatar’s Al Jazeera, which the U.S. recently described as state-owned and subsidized. Its flagship channel, Al Jazeera Arabic (AJA), frequently gives favorable airtime to terrorists, including but not limited to leaders of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and al-Qaeda in Syria. It regularly publishes what it calls a tally of Palestinian “martyrs” since 2015, but most of the individuals on its list were reportedly killed in the act of trying to kill Israeli civilians or security forces.ConclusionOn all these different dimensions, Qatar’s record has been as bad – if not worse – than its Gulf neighbors. It is encouraging that Qatar and the U.S. signed a memorandum of understanding last month on combating terror finance. While its contents remain private, it will reportedly place two U.S. officials inside Qatar’s state prosecutor’s office.But given Doha’s failure to honor its past counterterrorism commitments to the U.S. as well as to its neighbors, the Trump administration will have to keep focused on ensuring this memorandum’s full implementation and enforcement. Further, there has been no indication whether this agreement does anything to stop Qatar from continuing to grant safe haven to terrorists, allegedly paying ransoms to terrorist groups, and enabling incitement by state-backed media and religious figures.Resolving the current Gulf crisis is important, but doing so without ensuring that Qatar turns over a new leaf on these various fronts could be counterproductive, consolidating a major counterterrorism problem for years to come.Follow David Andrew Weinberg on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidaweinberg"

Further, there has been no indication whether this agreement does anything to stop Qatar from continuing to grant safe haven to terrorists, allegedly paying ransoms to terrorist groups, and enabling incitement by state-backed media and religious figures.Resolving the current Gulf crisis is important, but doing so without ensuring that Qatar turns over a new leaf on these various fronts could be counterproductive, consolidating a major counterterrorism problem for years to come.Follow David Andrew Weinberg on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidaweinberg"
48,WORLD NEWS,Resistance Builds To Proposed Israeli Boycott Bill,"Stephen Zunes, ContributorProfessor of Politics and Coordinator of Middle Eastern Studie...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/resistance-builds-to-proposed-israeli-boycott-bill_us_59825bc9e4b03d0624b0abf9,A disturbing number of Congressional Democrats have joined their Republican counterparts in co-sponsoring a bill (S. 720,2017-08-02,<p>This proposed anti-boycott bill is unprecedented and particularly dangerous. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59825be12100001400fc9e78.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A disturbing number of Congressional Democrats have joined their Republican counterparts in co-sponsoring a bill (S. 720/H.R. 1697) effectively criminalizing support for boycotts against Israel or companies doing business in the country or its occupied territories.If passed, the legislation would make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at Israel or the Israeli occupation supported by any entity of the United Nations, the European Union, or other “international governmental organization.”And the penalties are draconian, including fines of up to one million dollars and up to twenty years imprisonment.Introduced by Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the bill thus far has 46 Senate supporters, including fourteen Democrats; and it has 63 Democratic cosponsors in the House.The bill’s House co-sponsors include Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts, Colleen Hanabusa of Hawaii, and California Representatives Ted Lieu, Adam Schiff, Jimmy Panetta and Eric Swalwell. Senate support supporters besides Kirsten Gillibrand and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Richard Bennet of Colorado, and Maria Cantwell of Washington.The American Civil Liberties Union has come out strongly in opposition, saying the bill “would impose civil and criminal punishment on individuals solely because of their political beliefs about Israel and its policies”; that it would “include penalties for simply requesting information about such boycotts”; and therefore “seeks only to punish the exercise of constitutional rights.”David Cole, the ACLU’s national legal director and a Georgetown law professor, says the bill would “prohibit even the act of giving information to a U.N. body about boycott activity directed at Israel.” The bill “threatens severe penalties against any business or individual who does not purchase goods from Israeli companies operating in the occupied Palestinian territories and who makes it clear—say by posting on Twitter or Facebook—that their reason for doing so is to support a U.N.- or E.U.-called boycott.”As a result of pressure from critics, some of the bill’s supporters may be backing down. Confronted about her support for the measure by constituents attending a town hall on July 31, Senator Gillibrand stated that she had not understood the implications of the bill and would urge them to rewrite it to be sure it “does not apply to individuals” and only targets companies.Boycotts have been used for decades to target governments which engage in occupation and repression and corporations which support them. Such campaigns have at times been successful in forcing policy changes, and have drawn opposition from Washington. But this proposed bill is unprecedented and particularly dangerous.For forty years, it has been illegal for U.S. companies to honor the Arab League boycott of Israel—and no U.S. company does so. Disturbingly, the proposed legislation redefines “Israel” to include “territories controlled by Israel”—that is, the West Bank and other Arab territories under Israeli occupation. Even moderate pro-Israel groups like J Street—which strongly opposes boycotts targeting Israel—has come out in opposition due to the bill equating “Israel” with the occupied West Bank. The group says the bill would “undermine decades of U.S. policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, bolster the settlement enterprise and harm the prospects for a two-state solution,” in addition to “giving Attorney General Jeff Sessions the power to prosecute any American who chooses not to buy settlement products for a felony offense.”The bill appears to target Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Quakers, and other religious groups as well as colleges, labor unions, and others who have supported or could potentially support boycotts or call for divesting from companies supporting the occupation and settlements—even if they do not endorse boycotts of Israel itself.The bill is an apparent response to resolutions passed last year by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) over U.S. objections that addressed Israeli violations of international humanitarian law in the occupied territories and called for companies to “avoid, identify, assess and address any adverse human rights impacts related to their activities.”The bill text states that, in so doing, “the UNHRC targeted Israel with a commercial boycott” even though there is actually no mention of a boycott in these resolutions. And while the UNHRC resolutions re-affirm Israel’s right to exist, the bill accuses UNHRC of “systematic, politically motivated assaults on [Israel’s] legitimacy designed to stigmatize and isolate Israel internationally.”Interestingly, Congress has had no objections to the UNHRC’s far harsher criticisms of domestic human rights abuses by Syria, Sudan, and other countries not allied with the United States.Stephen Zunes is a professor of politics and coordinator of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of San Francisco."

This is real life, and it’s costing billions of dollars in frivolous lawsuits and lost business opportunities.With an average lawsuit costing $1.6 million, the deceptive actions of patent trolls add up quickly. In 2015 alone, trolls robbed companies of $7.4 billion. One study puts the number much higher, costing companies $29 billion per year.Fortunately for Richard, he outsmarted the troll and got his case dismissed. But too many of our small businesses and young entrepreneurs are falling prey to patent trolls.One such company is Carbonite, a startup based in Boston that offers data backup and storage on the cloud. As the CEO, Mohamad Ali, told the state Senate in testimony on July 20, Carbonite spent well over $5 million fighting a troll that falsely claimed the company was infringing certain patents.Only after winning the case in front of a jury did Carbonite learn from the U.S. Patent Office that the patents the trolls claimed were not even valid.Congress, which traditionally regulates intellectual property, has sat on their hands. There are still no federal rules in place to protect innovators from trolls.In the vacuum, more than 30 states have stepped in to protect intellectual property and defend their startup businesses. It’s time for Massachusetts to act.In the State Senate, Sen. Richard Ross and I have filed legislation that would prohibit a person from making a bad faith assertion of patent infringement. The legislation would also create a legal means for companies to defend themselves from such claims. If the bill passes, patent trolls in Massachusetts could be held liable for damages such as lost business opportunities when a company is forced to shift resources and attention to fighting fraudulent lawsuits.There is clear evidence that laws like these prevent business losses and promote growth, both for the tech industry and for individual companies.The first published study of the effects of anti-patent troll laws showed that these state laws led to an increase in employment at small firms in high-tech industries, who are often the targets of trolls.The same study showed that anti-troll legislation leads to fewer business bankruptcies and more investment in startup firms.Once the threat of a lawsuit is removed, venture capital firms are more willing to invest in startups because they no longer have to worry that the companies will fold under the expense of legal battles.This is particularly important for Massachusetts, the number two state in the country for tech innovation. The Bay State economy relies on young college grads tinkering, with the hopes of developing the next Microsoft, Facebook or Vertex.Patent trolls might have stopped Bill Gates from creating Microsoft or prevented Mark Zuckerberg from creating Facebook.They should be tamed before they kill the next great innovation that transforms our economy.Senator Eric P.

50,POLITICS,Democrats Add Trade Reforms To Their New Economic Agenda,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-trade-reforms-a-better-deal_us_59822239e4b0353fbb347fa1,It's an attempt to steal the high ground from the trade hawk in chief.,2017-08-02,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks during a press conference announcing new trade policies on Aug. 2, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598222d815000021008b4c63.jpeg?cache=Van0T1Jd5W&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senate Democrats unveiled a slate of trade policy proposals aimed at benefiting American manufacturers and workers on Wednesday, adding to the party’s new economic agenda, which it’s calling “A Better Deal.”The proposals, announced by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and five senators from manufacturing-heavy states, include plans to create a new international trade prosecutor to fight foreign countries’ alleged violations of trade agreements; establish a new board to review how foreign purchases of American companies will impact American jobs; penalize federal contractors that offshore domestic jobs; and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.Crucially, the press conference offered Senate Democrats an opportunity to show their determination not to be outflanked by President Donald Trump on trade policy, an issue that helped Trump pick up Democratic votes in Rust Belt states.“Nothing is more central to creating jobs and increasing take home pay, than rewriting our backward trade laws that have put foreign workers ahead of American workers, that have put big multinational corporations ahead of the needs of hardworking average American families,” Schumer said.Schumer fused some of the anti-corporate rhetoric more common in Democratic speeches with a smattering of the nationalist tropes Trump has championed. At the start of his remarks, for example, Schumer praised his assembled colleagues for “putting American workers first.”He later dubbed China “rapacious” for helping its corporations and investors gobble up American companies even as it failed to reciprocate by letting in American products like Hollywood films.Schumer’s vow to put “American workers first” arguably echoed Trump’s promise to put “America First” in his inaugural address. At the press conference, the senators made overtures to Republicans to collaborate on various pieces of legislation, including a bill Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) introduced in March that would require American-made steel and iron to be used in drinking water infrastructure projects.“We need Republicans to stand with us, and with our manufacturers and with American workers,” Baldwin said.Even Baldwin’s reference to her own “Buy America” bill, however, was an opportunity to call out Republicans for failing to uphold President Trump’s promises to pursue trade policies aimed at helping American workers. Trump said in April that he supported Baldwin’s legislation.Yet House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) stripped similar language out of a water bill last year, a development Baldwin attributed to the fact that “foreign steel companies bought Washington lobbyists to kill it.” (At the time, Ryan argued that the provision could unduly obstruct companies from getting federal contracts.)“Congressional Republican leadership continues to stand in the way. America and their workers deserve a solid commitment from us on a strong Buy America standard that rewards their hard work,” Baldwin said.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Trump planned to demand that congressional Republicans pass the bill.More than once, the Democratic senators disparaged Trump for failing to deliver on his ambitious promises to crack down on foreign trade practices that violate existing agreements.“President Trump has talked a good game on trade but done virtually nothing on trade but study it,” Schumer said.Indeed, on the campaign trail, Trump routinely fulminated against China, Mexico and other nations with which the United States has a trade deficit. He promised to act swiftly to rebalance trade, including by labeling China a “currency manipulator” and threatening it with tariffs. But since arriving in office, Trump’s attempts to rectify those imbalances have consisted mostly of commissioning studies to examine them. An executive order in April calling for a review of how well the U.S. government adheres to “Buy American” preferences when it issues federal contracts, for example, was due to last 220 days before action could be taken. Many trade experts believe the president has the authority to act much sooner.In addition, the administration gave Congress a 90-day notice in May that it would renegotiate NAFTA.But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has stated that the starting point for reform would be expanding NAFTA’s removal of trade barriers for digital commerce and intellectual property ― something Canada and Mexico agreed to as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade agreement that former President Barack Obama brokered and that Trump shelved upon taking office.That has raised fears among skeptics of recent trade agreements that the Trump administration plans to make changes to NAFTA that actually increase offshoring, so long as they can formally brand them “reform.”“We need to focus on ... renegotiating NAFTA, but seriously renegotiating NAFTA ― not just some kind of a rewrite of TPP,” said Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.).The Democratic Party’s embrace of more enforcement-focused trade policies is an extension of the larger economic platform it introduced last week that earned plaudits from progressive leaders for embracing strong new antitrust regulation and efforts to lower prescription drug prices.In the wake of Trump’s surprising victory, Democratic leaders are convinced that reclaiming their 20th-century mantle as the party of the working class is essential to their future electoral success.Trade is long an issue that has divided Democrats, with business-friendly members supporting international trade accords that representatives of industrial areas and left-leaning activists often bitterly oppose.Many labor unions, American manufacturers and economists argue that the United States has failed to prioritize the interests of domestic workers in recently negotiated trade deals. They criticize the federal government for advocating for the intellectual property rights of prescriptions drug companies and software firms, while failing to aggressively enforce other trade rules that disproportionately benefit American workers. China’s questionable trade practices, for example, contributed to the loss of 3.4 million American jobs from 2001 to 2015, according to the Economic Policy Institute.Obama’s relentless advocacy for the TPP made it harder for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to credibly oppose it in her 2016 battle against Trump. Prior to Clinton’s 2016 run for office, she had spoken about the accord supportively.“Senate Democrats have put forth a solid plan to help America’s factory workers through better trade policy,” Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement to HuffPost. “We look forward to working together to producing real change that will grow manufacturing jobs in the United States.”"
51,POLITICS,A Party In Danger Of Denial And Decline,"William S. Becker, ContributorEnergy & Climate Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-party-in-danger-of-denial-and-decline_us_59823b1de4b094ff5a3f0b91,We have reached the point where the Republican majority in Congress must act to protect the integrity of its own party.,2017-08-02,<p>President Trump tweeted this photo during his first month in office. Now it seems to foretell an Administration that is all thumbs rather than all thumbs up.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59823fcd15000027008b4cd7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It seems like a lifetime ago that candidate Donald Trump assured the media that he would be very different if he became president. “I’ll be more effective and more disciplined,” he said. “I will be so presidential, you will be so bored.”It has not turned out that way. Instead, Trump and his White House have been far from disciplined and even farther from boring. The President and the presidency seem out of control in a very dangerous time.For that reason, every member of the United States Congress should take a few minutes to read an article posted this week by Sen. Jeff Flake. Flake, a bona fide conservative, wants to shake his fellow Republicans out of their “unnerving silence” about the instability Trump is creating.The entire article should be mandatory reading, but the headline sums it up: “My Party Is In Denial About Donald Trump. We created him, and now we’re rationalizing him. When will it stop?”For the good of the Republic as well as the Republican Party, it had better stop soon.The dangers of the Trump team’s performance range from subtle to stupefying. A subtle danger is that Trump’s tweet storms and soap-operate twists will distract us from the damages he is doing to the standards we should expect from a president. Trump has shown little regard for decency, honesty, accuracy and ethical conduct. In his White House, nepotism, conflicts of interest, profiteering, falsehoods, rumor mongering and bullying are presidential prerogatives.His base doesn’t seem to mind. Flake has something to say about that: “We shouldn’t hesitate to speak out if the president ‘plays to the base’ in ways that damage the Republican Party’s ability to grow and speak to a larger audience.”In regard to the exercise of power, Trump has squandered international respect for the United States and the strength of its influence around the world. By thumbing his nose at the Paris accord and revoking reasonable regulations on fossil energy production, he is positioning us not only to regain the title of the world’s biggest carbon polluter but also to become the largest carbon exporter. Trump wants America to be the world’s dominant producer of fossil fuels despite warnings from scientists that most fossil energy reserves must remain in the ground. He is betting our future and that of our children on his unsubstantiated and irresponsibly uninformed belief that climate change is a hoax.Trump’s team is methodically dismantling decades of bipartisan progress on environmental stewardship. Unfortunately, most of those decades were long ago. Now Scott Pruitt’s “back to basics” plan for EPA is actually pushing America back to the 1950s. Those were the days when polluters used the environment as a dump, a sewer and an unofficial laboratory for seeing what pollutants do to people. As TIME recalled earlier this year, rivers stank and burst into flames, hundreds of New Yorkers died from smog, and automobile exhaust was high enough to cause birth defects.EPA has become an easy foil for those who believe that government should not tell them what they can and cannot do. It would be comforting to believe that an unregulated fossil energy industry would do everything right to protect the environment, public health and the nation’s long-term energy security. Unfortunately, history shows that many companies want to do everything that is profitable, not everything that is right.As the EPA was being created in 1970, President Richard Nixon gave an explanation that other Republicans would do well to embrace today:Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions. It has become a common cause of all the people of this country…Clean air, clean water, open spaces-these should once again be the birthright of every American. EPA went on to achieve some of the nation’s most important wins for public health and safety, including the discoveries that several of the industrial products and byproducts we considered important to progress were actually silent killers, among them lead, asbestos, mercury and now the greenhouse gases that lead to deadly changes in the world’s climate.The most irresponsible of Trump’s behaviors, however, is his reaction to the hacking of our democratic process. Rather than welcoming a thorough investigation into Russia’s influence on last year’s election, Trump keeps trying to scuttle it, firing the head of the FBI, berating the objectivity of the special counsel and his team, and subjecting his own Attorney General to public humiliation in an apparent effort to make him resign so that he can be replaced with an AG who will do the President’s bidding. Trump has arguably crossed the line into obstruction of justice – one of the charges on which the House voted to impeach President Clinton.All in all, Trump is making history by being on the wrong side of it. The White House is a multi-ring circus right now, a spectacle of tweets, turmoil and potentially impeachable behaviors. It is easy for the media and the American people to watch the circus while missing the deeper and more lasting damages that Trump and his team are doing.So, what does Sen. Flake say about this to his fellow conservatives? He points out that Congress’s constitutional duties include the obligation to “do something about an executive branch in chaos”.“Too often, we observe the unfolding drama along with the rest of the country, passively, all but saying, ‘Someone should do something!’ without seeming to realize that that someone is us,” Flake writes. “(Our) unnerving silence in the face of an erratic executive branch is an abdication, and those in positions of leadership bear particular responsibility.”Trump has had ample opportunity to become more disciplined, effective and presidential. Instead, we have reached the point where the Republican majority in Congress must act to protect the integrity of its own party, and the Republic itself, from a White House in ongoing disarray, presidential appointees who oppose the missions of the agencies they lead, and a president whose ethical standards and conduct are beneath the office he holds."
52,LATINO VOICES,The Silent Raids That Are Tearing Families Apart,"Center for Community Change Action, ContributorSocial justice organization",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-silent-raids-that-are-tearing-families-apart_us_5981f514e4b02be325be0296,"By Thomas Kennedy In South Florida, people are disappearing from our community, as undocumented immigrants are being detained",2017-08-02,<p>Protesters rally in support of keeping families together outside the Miramar ICE facility. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598210d41a00003800dc1c07.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Thomas KennedyIn South Florida, people are disappearing from our community, as undocumented immigrants are being detained and deported during scheduled check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Standing outside the Miramar ICE facility in Broward County, the machinations of Trump’s deportation force are in plain sight. At the Miramar facility, a line of people waiting for hours under the hot Florida sun for their immigration check-in is a daily sight. Most of them are immigrants who have committed no crime other than overstaying their visa or an unauthorized border crossing. Others are seeking asylum or are in the country with work visas.The Trump administration is using what immigration activists call the “silent raids” to deport immigrants like those who show up to the check-ins at the Miramar center. According to statistics from ICE, 41,318 undocumented immigrants were arrested and scheduled for deportation in the first four months of 2017, marking a 38 percent increase over the first four months of 2016. Of those 41,318 immigrants detained, over 10,800 have no criminal record, marking a 153 percent increase from last year.Here in South Florida, real families are feeling the impact of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies. After following the law and showing up to his ICE check-in at the Miramar ICE office, Espilvio Sanchez-Benavidez was detained. Espilvio had immigrated to the United States in 2013 to flee political violence and persecution in Nicaragua, where two of his family members were murdered due to their opposition to the ruling government and where Espilvio received death threats.In 2015, Espilvio’s asylum was denied and he was order to check-in regularly with ICE, but last March he was detained when he showed up to his appointment at the Miramar ICE office. Espilvio was later deported, leaving behind his wife and children.Memos issued by the Department of Homeland Security and signed by then Secretary John Kelly, show the broader focus which the Trump administration has on arresting and deporting any undocumented immigrant living in the United States, even those without a criminal record. The memos show that any immigrant living in the U.S. without authorization and who has been convicted, charged or even suspected of a crime, even a minor traffic violation, is an enforcement and deportation priority.The Miramar ICE office is an example of just how effective Trump’s deportation force can be in its mission to deport and break up immigrant families. South Florida activists have taken notice however, and have been organizing to call attention to what’s happening in our community. Rallies and press events have repeatedly forced the Miramar building to shut down operations, and every Thursday a group of activists show up to talk to those waiting in line for their check-in and keep record of those who are detained if they don’t come back out. I was present last week and saw several people crying after their check-in because a family member or friend was detained.“I’m from Argentina. During the military dictatorship there in the 1970’s, there was a peaceful movement of resistance led by Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo, who demanded justice for the children who were disappeared by the military secret police,” said Maria Bilbao, an organizer with the organization United We Dream. “Members of our community are literally disappearing from our community and families are being broken up, we are going to be outside this sinister ICE building demanding justice for our loved ones.”There are over 450,000 undocumented immigrants in South Florida who could be impacted by Trump’s policies. The activists are hoping to uplift the stories of those who are under threat of detainment and deportation when they follow the rules and show up for a scheduled check-in. “There are so many irregularities and suspect activity happening at the Miramar ICE office, it shows the importance of building our own circles of protection within our communities,” said Yaquelin Lopez, a member of the immigrant rights group Women Working Together USA. “Rain or shine, we are at Miramar every Thursday because, now more than ever, it’s important that our community stays informed of their rights and abuses perpetrated by ICE agents.”Another activist named Maria Perez expressed her pain when encountering the family members of those who don’t come back out from their check-in: “It pained me to see a young girl come out of the building crying because her mother was detained and transferred to a detention center. I could see her desperation and I’m glad that we are there offering our support and prayers. That’s what humanity should be about, supporting one another.”Rosana Araujo, also a member of Women Working Together USA puts it more bluntly: “The Miramar ICE office reflects a silent and oppressive immigration system that separates families and destroys the hopes and dreams of many.”Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change.

We started the day with a press conference at the National Press Club, where I called on Trump and Pruitt to “stop pandering to polluters with deep pockets and do their job of protecting local water supplies from industrial coal sludge that is spewing out of power plants across our country.” We then moved to EPA headquarters for a public hearing, which was dominated by people who opposed the weakening the protections.According to the EPA, coal-fired power plants are the single biggest source of toxic water pollution in this country, more than all other industrial sources combined. Every year they release millions of pounds of toxic metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury into our streams, rivers, and lakes. This poses a real and present danger to millions of Americans, because these toxins are linked to health problems ranging from cancer to birth defects, and nearly 40 percent of all coal plants dump their toxic wastewater within five miles of a downstream community’s drinking water intake.During Monday’s hearing the EPA heard first-hand from people on the receiving end of this dangerous pollution, who made long trips to Washington, DC specifically for the hearing. They called on the EPA to not delay the strengthened protections put in place back in 2015, which hadn’t been updated for more than 30 years. Scott Pruitt proposed the delay shortly after coming into office, loyally doing the bidding of his polluter buddies as heartbreaking stories flooded the EPA pleading for the new rules to stay in place. These stories were on full display this week, and they are both moving and infuriating.Dáilan J Long, a Tribal citizen from Burnham, New Mexico, spoke during the press conference (you can watch the press conference here) and testified later in the day. “The dry coal ash blows through the air around us. The health disparities are long-reaching,” said Long, noting that billowing clouds of coal ash make it difficult to drive on some days. “Many of our neighbors have even lost livestock as a result of the poisoning in our waterways.”Dulce Ortiz of the Clean Power Lake County Campaign in Waukegan, Illinois, also spoke and testified. “Our community and lakefront are still being polluted everyday by the release of toxic wastewater from the NRG coal plant on our shoreline,” said Ortiz. “It is the largest point source of water pollution in Lake County and dumps over 8 millions gallons of dangerous sludge ― including coal ash sludge ― every day into Lake Michigan. How coal corporations have been allowed to freely pollute our waterways for decades is shocking to me as a citizen, as a mom, and as a resident of Lake County. This attempt to delay [the standards] is disheartening.”Sarah McCoin’s property in Harriman, Tennessee, where she’s the ninth generation on her family farm, was affected by the devastating coal ash spill at TVA’s Kingston coal plant in 2008. She’s saddened and surprised by how polarized environmental issues have become. “Why is clean water political? This isn’t a left or right thing ― it’s a people thing,” she said at the press conference. “There is no justification for keeping power companies from meeting these reasonable safety and public health guidelines.”Numerous Waterkeepers from across the nation traveled to the hearing to testify, including Catawba Riverkeeper Sam Perkins, who spoke at the press conference about the many coal ash sites threatening the drinking water of Charlotte, North Carolina. Waterkeeper Alliance President Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., also attended and gave a rousing speech, quoted here by the Associated Press:“They have no right to poison our fish,” said Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who is a son of the former attorney general and senator and a nephew of President John F. Kennedy. “They have no right to poison our children. EPA can’t give them that right. ... The waterways of this country belong to the people.”The public fought for these common-sense safeguards for many years, and as finalized by career scientists and policy experts at the EPA in 2015, they would reduce more than 90 percent of the toxic heavy metals that coal plants dump into bodies of water that local families use for everything from drinking water, to outdoor recreation, and fishing. Now Trump and Pruitt are forcing the EPA to do an abrupt about-face and trying to take those protections away from the American people.All through the public hearing, I heard testimony from people who made long journeys from so many places urging EPA to not delay these water standards ― from Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, New Mexico, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and the Navajo Nation.

We started the day with a press conference at the National Press Club, where I called on Trump and Pruitt to “stop pandering to polluters with deep pockets and do their job of protecting local water supplies from industrial coal sludge that is spewing out of power plants across our country.” We then moved to EPA headquarters for a public hearing, which was dominated by people who opposed the weakening the protections.According to the EPA, coal-fired power plants are the single biggest source of toxic water pollution in this country, more than all other industrial sources combined. Every year they release millions of pounds of toxic metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury into our streams, rivers, and lakes. This poses a real and present danger to millions of Americans, because these toxins are linked to health problems ranging from cancer to birth defects, and nearly 40 percent of all coal plants dump their toxic wastewater within five miles of a downstream community’s drinking water intake.During Monday’s hearing the EPA heard first-hand from people on the receiving end of this dangerous pollution, who made long trips to Washington, DC specifically for the hearing. They called on the EPA to not delay the strengthened protections put in place back in 2015, which hadn’t been updated for more than 30 years. Scott Pruitt proposed the delay shortly after coming into office, loyally doing the bidding of his polluter buddies as heartbreaking stories flooded the EPA pleading for the new rules to stay in place. These stories were on full display this week, and they are both moving and infuriating.Dáilan J Long, a Tribal citizen from Burnham, New Mexico, spoke during the press conference (you can watch the press conference here) and testified later in the day. “The dry coal ash blows through the air around us. The health disparities are long-reaching,” said Long, noting that billowing clouds of coal ash make it difficult to drive on some days. “Many of our neighbors have even lost livestock as a result of the poisoning in our waterways.”Dulce Ortiz of the Clean Power Lake County Campaign in Waukegan, Illinois, also spoke and testified. “Our community and lakefront are still being polluted everyday by the release of toxic wastewater from the NRG coal plant on our shoreline,” said Ortiz. “It is the largest point source of water pollution in Lake County and dumps over 8 millions gallons of dangerous sludge ― including coal ash sludge ― every day into Lake Michigan. How coal corporations have been allowed to freely pollute our waterways for decades is shocking to me as a citizen, as a mom, and as a resident of Lake County. This attempt to delay [the standards] is disheartening.”Sarah McCoin’s property in Harriman, Tennessee, where she’s the ninth generation on her family farm, was affected by the devastating coal ash spill at TVA’s Kingston coal plant in 2008. She’s saddened and surprised by how polarized environmental issues have become. “Why is clean water political? This isn’t a left or right thing ― it’s a people thing,” she said at the press conference. “There is no justification for keeping power companies from meeting these reasonable safety and public health guidelines.”Numerous Waterkeepers from across the nation traveled to the hearing to testify, including Catawba Riverkeeper Sam Perkins, who spoke at the press conference about the many coal ash sites threatening the drinking water of Charlotte, North Carolina. Waterkeeper Alliance President Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., also attended and gave a rousing speech, quoted here by the Associated Press:“They have no right to poison our fish,” said Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who is a son of the former attorney general and senator and a nephew of President John F. Kennedy. “They have no right to poison our children. EPA can’t give them that right. ... The waterways of this country belong to the people.”The public fought for these common-sense safeguards for many years, and as finalized by career scientists and policy experts at the EPA in 2015, they would reduce more than 90 percent of the toxic heavy metals that coal plants dump into bodies of water that local families use for everything from drinking water, to outdoor recreation, and fishing. Now Trump and Pruitt are forcing the EPA to do an abrupt about-face and trying to take those protections away from the American people.All through the public hearing, I heard testimony from people who made long journeys from so many places urging EPA to not delay these water standards ― from Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, New Mexico, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and the Navajo Nation. Of the almost 70 people who testified, only three supported delaying the standards, and they all represented coal plant operators – the very polluters that have refused to clean up this pollution for the last three decades.Fed up, I testified as well, which you can see here.As I told the EPA panel, the Sierra Club will fight this attempt to delay and weaken these vital clean water protections every step of the way, with every tool at our disposal.

He and his team recently discovered evidence of a plastic garbage patch in the South Pacific that he says could be 1.5 times larger than Texas.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59819cc815000021008b4ad1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A decade ago, while sailing across a rarely traversed area between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland, oceanographer Captain Charles Moore stumbled upon the now-infamous North Pacific garbage patch, an enormous swathe of plastic pollution floating in the sea.Now, Moore has confirmed the discovery of a second garbage patch in the same ocean, located in the South Pacific. Moore, who made the disturbing discovery during a six-month research trip, estimates that this polluted patch of plastic could span as much as a million square kilometres. That’s 1.5 times larger than Texas, and more than two times the size of California.Moore, founder of the Algalita Research Foundation,  told ResearchGate that his team would conduct lab analysis on the plastic they’d found, but based on initial impressions, the garbage patch uncovered in the South Pacific could contain “millions of plastic particles per square kilometer,” he said. Like the North Pacific garbage patch, the one in the southern part of the ocean is a nebulous swarm of pollution made up of tiny plastic fragments, known as microplastics, which can be hard to see with the naked eye and even harder to clean up. “We found a few larger items, occasionally a buoy and some fishing gear, but most of it was broken into bits,” Moore told ResearchGate of the discovery. The news that the South Pacific is choked with plastic should not come as much of a surprise.About 19 billion pounds of plastic waste ends up in our oceans every year, according to a 2015 paper. And a lot of that refuse is getting trapped by natural ocean currents, referred to as gyres, at five locations around the planet. The North Pacific is one of these locations; the South Pacific is another. Henderson Island, an uninhabited coral atoll located at the edge of the South Pacific gyre, was recently discovered to be one of the most polluted areas on Earth. Researchers found the island smothered in around 38 million pieces of plastic trash ― all of which had arrived there via the seas. “[M]y thought was the remarkable remoteness of Henderson Island would have afforded it some protection,” researcher Jennifer Lavers told the Guardian in May. “I was totally wrong.” "

58,POLITICS,Trump's Approval Ratings Look Like They're Taking Another Dip,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-approval-rating_us_59820fbee4b09d24e994c92a,"Possible culprits: White House chaos, polling anomalies, the GOP's health care failure.",2017-08-02,"President Donald Trump at the White House July 31, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59821a3415000021008b4c43.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After months of relatively stability, President Donald Trump’s numbers are again showing signs of a downward shift in the latest polls.Trump’s average approval rating has slumped to a new low of less than 38 percent as of Wednesday afternoon, according to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate of publicly available surveys. More than 58 percent say they disapprove.Trump’s exact numbers vary from survey to survey. But national polls released this week ― including Quinnipiac, Gallup, Rasmussen, and YouGov ― all show he’s now faring worse than he was at the end of June and beginning of July.What’s behind the drop? Trump’s White House has certainly seen its share of chaos in the past few weeks. And tracking polls may sometimes exaggerate the degree to which the president’s approval is shifting, due both to random noise and to a phenomenon called “differential partisan nonresponse” ― people’s reduced tendency to take surveys when the politician they like isn’t doing so well.But there’s one obvious possible culprit for the drop in Trump’s numbers: the GOP’s failed attempt to repeal Obamacare.Unlike the other controversies that have surrounded Trump’s administration without obvious effect, health care seems to have taken a toll on the president. Back in March, Republicans’ initial inability to pass a bill in the House coincided with a significant dip in Trump’s approval. (More recent wrangling in the Senate had previously seemed to have less effect, possibly because, up until last week’s showdown, media coverage had been far more subdued.)Beneath the top-line approval numbers are several other troubling trends for the president in this week’s surveys.Quinnipiac’s latest poll shows concerns about the president’s relationship with Russia have failed to pick up much steam, and have been holding steady all year. But perceptions of his strength have diminished. Just 34 percent say Trump has good leadership skills, down from 44 percent in June, and 56 percent immediately after the election in November.Although Trump’s base remains largely behind him, enthusiasm appears to have taken a noticeable dip in the past week, according to at least one survey. While 85 percent of Trump voters approve of the president, according to the Economist/YouGov poll, just 43 percent say they approve of him strongly. That’s down from a majority who said so in most of the outlet’s past surveys. "

I loved the baby boy I had just brought into this world, but instead of my days being filled with joy, I felt anxious and alone.I was used to being in control. I was a project manager for some substantial businesses. But you can’t be in control of an infant.My dad had battled depression for many years in an age when doctors didn’t treat mental health issues as a medical illness. In my case, a combination of social, psychological, and biological factors became the “perfect storm” that served to deepen my depression.There was one day when I couldn’t get out of bed and pulled the sheets over my head. I thought, “I can’t take care of this child,” and I didn’t think it was going to get better.My husband took me to the ER, but I was sent home with only a prescription for anxiety pills. Fortunately, my father’s psychiatrist recommended a therapist who specialized in postpartum depression. I started on antidepressants, and my family helped out in any way they could.Within a couple of months I felt stabilized and human again. I could engage with the world and take care of my son.When we were planning to have a second child, I spoke with my doctor and changed my medication to one safe for pregnancy. My symptoms never returned and given my family history, I opted to remain on antidepressants. My oldest son is now studying pre-med, and my youngest is on the honors track and a talented athlete in high school.Postpartum depression is an illness just like any other illness.

60,POLITICS,Trump's Boy Scout Lie Makes It Harder For America To Trust Him On Anything Else,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-boy-scouts-lie_us_59824524e4b00f0084adeb36,"“If he's willing to lie about the Boy Scouts, what won’t he lie about?” asks one GOP consultant.",2017-08-02,"President Donald Trump speaks during the National Boy Scout Jamboree at Summit Bechtel National Scout Reserve in Glen Jean, West Virginia, on July 24.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598245c415000021008b4cef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just as President Donald Trump most needs to be believed, the country’s top Boy Scout is making him out to be a liar.Trump has been trying to get Americans to take his word that he did not mislead them about his son’s meeting with Russians last year. He’s also been working to convince them that he did not attempt to discredit U.S. intelligence agencies ― which say Russians helped him win the election ― by spreading a conspiracy theory about the death of a Democratic Party staffer.Both assertions, though, rest on Trump’s credibility ― credibility that took another hit Tuesday when his claim about a laudatory phone call from the Boy Scouts of America was denied by the organization.“I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal last week, one day after speaking to some 40,000 Boy Scouts and troop leaders at their quadrennial “jamboree” in West Virginia. But the Boy Scouts say they have no knowledge of any such call. Instead, they refer back to the statement by chief executive Mike Surbaugh apologizing for Trump’s speech as inappropriately political. While addressing a crowd largely made up of 12- to 18-year-olds, the president boasted about his election win, ridiculed Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and called the news media dishonest. “I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree. That was never our intent,” Surbaugh wrote in a statement released July 27. “We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program.”White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Tuesday acknowledged there was no phone call, but argued that Trump was not lying.“I wouldn’t say it was a lie,” she said. “Multiple members of the Boy Scout leadership following his speech there that day congratulated him, praised him, and offered quite powerful compliments.”Sanders also defended Trump’s statement to the Journal that the president of Mexico called him to thank him for the drop in undocumented immigrants crossing into his country through the southern border. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, however, on Tuesday denied having called Trump recently. Sanders said Trump was referring to a conversation the two leaders had at the G-20 meeting in Germany early last month.“The conversations took place, they just simply didn’t take place over a phone call,” she said. “He had them in person.”The apparent whole-cloth fabrications ― which come as special counsel Robert Mueller is likely investigating whether the president committed obstruction of justice, and as Trump would greatly benefit from appearing credible to the American people ― flummoxed even some insiders who generally defend Trump.One Republican consultant said the episode should serve as a warning to other groups that might want to invite Trump to their events.“If he’s willing to lie about the Boy Scouts, what won’t he lie about?” said the consultant, who asked to remain anonymous in order to be able to speak candidly about his party’s leader. “It’s another reminder that any organization that associates with President Trump risks damage to their reputation.”Trump’s history of falsehoods goes back decades, from changing details about his businesses during sworn depositions to inventing a sexual relationship with an Italian supermodel (and making up a spokesman to pitch the story).Fact-checking site PolitiFact found Trump to be the most falsehood-prone candidate of the 2016 election cycle, by far. Of the 433 statements checked from the start of his campaign through Tuesday, 69 percent have been rated “false,” “mostly false” or “pants on fire.”White House counselor Kellyanne Conway recently said on CNN that Trump is not technically lying when he says false things because he often isn’t aware that what he’s saying is not true. Trump “doesn’t think he’s lying about those issues,” she said.But how that theory might hold in this instance is unclear, given the close proximity of the speech and the Journal interview the following morning ― with the supposed phone call having had to have come in those intervening hours.Republican National Committee member Shawn Steel, a regular Trump defender, suggested that Trump may have simply misremembered who praised him and how. “What upsets liberals is that 40,000 kids were boisterously supportive of Trump,” he said.Dignitaries speaking at youth events typically focus on the value of perseverance and hard work, but Trump’s remarks seemed more like a campaign speech.“You know, I go to Washington and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. In fact, today, I said we ought to change it from the word ‘swamp’ to the word ‘cesspool’ or perhaps to the word ‘sewer,’” Trump said, while calling journalists at the event “fake news.”The address drew outrage from scouts, parents of scouts and former scouts who do not support Trump, and Surbaugh posted a lengthy statement that included the apology only three days later.The White House has acknowledged Trump’s latest falsehoods while it also tries to downplay two new problems for Trump on the Russia front.Trump personally crafted a misleading statement that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., released last month about meeting with Russians at Trump Tower last year, The Washington Post reported Monday. Trump and his lawyer initially denied that the president had anything to do with the statement, but Sanders said Trump had “weighed in” on it while it was being drafted ― “as any father would,” she added. And a new federal lawsuit says that Trump personally approved a since-retracted Fox News story claiming that a Democratic staffer who was later fatally shot had given party emails to WikiLeaks. The story undercut U.S. intelligence agencies’ consensus that Russian hackers had stolen the emails and released ones they thought would help Trump win the election. The White House acknowledged that it hosted a meeting with Fox and its sources prior to publication, but denied that Trump knew of the story."

I couldn’t get over that he lied to you from the very beginning. I made arguments in vain; we both said things about each other’s person that we aren’t proud of now; our friendship was strained to a torturous point . . . and then you married him anyway.And you wanted me to be glad for you, to celebrate with you, to give him a chance.

He won’t even try.He disrespects you.When I think of how you’ve lived your life, the moral compass that has guided you, the beautiful faith that has sustained you, it makes me want to cry watching how he makes a mockery of those things. He takes pleasure in upsetting the apple cart of a peaceful, honest, productive existence. That seemed exciting before – he was an irreverent and electric rebel – but being in an adult committed relationship requires a different approach, one with dignity and purpose. He is dangerous.His reckless and aggressive outbursts are getting more and more agitated. There are consequences for these actions. I know you still see the good in him; you want to think that those good things can outweigh the bad things. You want to think that he can change. Of course people can change – if they think they need to. But he never takes responsibility for any mistake; whenever he is called out he seems determined to double down on his unfortunate exploits.It’s getting worse.I’ve tried to think of how I’d want to hear this, if the shoe was on the other foot. I can tell you that I’ve experienced a similar betrayal, and it was heartbreaking. I am so sorry that this is happening.

The new data is just slightly more encouraging for women, who rose from 33 percent to 35 percent, globally, and from 17 percent to 19 percent among its technical workers, those whose roles are related to math, engineering or science. The growth in Facebook’s annual diversity data is minimal, at best, but the company’s global director of diversity, Maxine Williams, is far from discouraged by the slow progress despite the significant amount of time, money and energy invested in the effort over the years.“We do want to do more,” Williams told HuffPost on Tuesday. “It’s true, I would love to see much more. I would also say that it should not be disregarded when you see those percentages, particularly on a growing base, because it means the hiring of those underrepresented groups has to outpace the hiring of the majority groups. That is a very challenging thing given that you inherit a lot of stuff from society.” She added that while not trying to put the blame on society, she feels issues like the low number of women in computer science majors make it difficult for Facebook to increase their female workforce due to the “percentage of people graduating with the skills we need.” Still, data has shown that more Hispanic and black students are majoring in computer science and engineering than are being hired. Williams says external obstacles have motivated the company to look internally for solutions, and she hopes that the small growth reported this year and all the company’s efforts will send the right message to underrepresented candidates looking to work at Facebook.“That is what I hope comes out of any positivity around seeing some change, is that people will know how desperately we want them here, how much we believe that they will add value to us and how much we believe that we are at a disadvantage now for not having more of them,” Williams said. “So we are putting everything behind trying to tell that story so that more people come because, yes, we want more as well and we are trying as hard as we can to do that.”Facebook has invested in increasing diversity in tech externally as part of its efforts ― including committing $15 million over five years to Code.org, which focuses on getting underrepresented students interested in engineering and computer science. In April, the company also mandated that women and marginalized groups make up at least 33 percent of the outside law firms they work with.Internally, Facebook has focused its initiatives around recruitment and retention. In 2013, the company started Facebook University, an eight-week immersive program for rising college freshmen in underrepresented communities that now touts over 500 graduates. Some students have since returned to Facebook as interns and even full-time hires, according to the company.Williams said the company has also worked on retaining diverse hires by owning and reducing bias as much as possible, “on the assumption that there is bias in every system because all human beings have bias. We want to own what is ours.” Facebook’s publicly available Managing Unconscious Bias class is now complemented by the Managing Inclusion program, which teaches how to manage diverse teams, and Be The Ally, which gives all employees the tools to support each other. Similarly, Facebook hopes to build internal support systems with events like its Women’s Leadership Day, Black Leadership Day and the upcoming Latin@ Facebook Leadership Day.But Williams says the company’s most impactful short-term initiative would probably be its Diverse Slate Approach in recruitment. The strategy, which is akin to the NFL’s Rooney Rule, “is an expectation that for open job roles you are seeing underrepresented people in the interview process,” including having them on-site for interviews. DSA began as a pilot project in 2015 and is now used globally within the company.As far as obstacles, Williams feels one of the biggest challenges has been operationalizing every initiative within Facebook’s “decentralized culture.” This is particularly true, she says, for efforts that aren’t mandated. Managing Unconscious Bias, for example, isn’t required because Williams says company research has shown people are more receptive when they take the course willingly.In January, Bloomberg reported that diversity efforts within Facebook were being undermined by high-ranking engineers who were vetoing diverse candidates near the end of the hiring process. Williams said the article was written without any input or research from the company and that the source, an anonymous former recruiter, did not have the information to make the claim.“We have never ever verified all the claims that that person made,” Williams said. “We don’t know exactly what they shared to come up with the conclusion that they came up with, but that is an individual conclusion that was never corroborated by us.”In spite of the challenges, Williams is passionate about the benefits that true diversity can bring to Facebook, and says it will ultimately show in every “single discussion, every single meeting [and] every product roll-out.”“Our focus here is on cognitive diversity,” Williams explained. “And cognitive diversity means having people who think differently, because we know from our data that if you have people who think differently you will get better results because people will push each other in different directions, they will expose things. One of the biggest issues is not doing what you don’t know.”“The more different people you have in a room who are focused on solving complex problems, the better results you get, because people are looking at it from different angles,” she emphasized. “And we know from the research that who you are, what your background is, what your identity is influences how you think.”Williams points to the custom gender option from 2014 as an example of a Facebook decision that was linked to an employee’s identity. The idea, she says, came from the LGBTQ community at Facebook, who said it didn’t make sense for users to only be allowed to choose from the binary labels of male and female.Facebook released data on its LGBTQ workforce for the first time in 2016. This year the voluntary survey, with a 67 percent participation rate, found that 7 percent of employees self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender or asexual.Looking forward, Williams hopes that a more inclusive Facebook will continue to help the company reach its overarching goals.“We want to help people be connected and build strong communities and we can only do that if we continue to increase the people in our own community who reflect the world,” Williams said. “So I just want to keep having more and more [diversity] and making sure that when people are here, our inclusive culture allows them to leverage cognitive diversity so it can deliver its potential.” "

65,POLITICS,Republicans Want To Defund The Commission That Fights Voting Machine Hacking,"Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, ContributorDemocratic Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives & Represe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eliminating-the-election-assistance-commission-would_us_5981f0e0e4b0b35d274c5f1c,There is absolutely no justification for abolishing the Election Assistance Commission.,2017-08-02,"Hackers try to access and alter data from an electronic poll books in a Voting Machine Hacking Village during the Def Con hacker convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. on July 29, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59820fb815000021008b4c1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This past weekend, hackers gathered in Las Vegas with a simple mission: break into America’s electronic voting machines and take control. Within minutes, some had already succeeded – but that’s a good thing. These hackers were part of a workshop held to identify vulnerabilities so they can be fixed well before any Americans cast actual votes next election. This exercise underscores the very real danger posed by outdated and insecure voting-machine software – as well as the important mission our government must continue undertaking to close these vulnerabilities and safeguard our elections.However, in their FY2018 funding proposal, Republicans are going after the small but highly successful agency that protects the integrity of our voting systems: the Election Assistance Commission. In June, House Republicans included a provision in their Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill that would abolish the Election Assistance Commission.Many Americans may not have heard of the Election Assistance Commission, a four-member bipartisan agency that Congress established in 2002 as part of the Help America Vote Act, but nonetheless they benefit greatly from its work. Created to address the flaws in our nation’s voting infrastructure, which contributed to the dispute surrounding the 2000 presidential election, the Election Assistance Commission protects Americans’ votes by helping to ensure that state and local authorities adopt best practices and uphold the highest standards of security for voting technology.I was proud to be the lead Democratic sponsor of the bipartisan Help America Vote Act legislation that established the Election Assistance Commission and charged it with helping state and local election officials ensure free, fair, and safe elections. Today, in a measure of the Election Assistance Commission’s success, forty-seven of the fifty states rely on its voting machine certification process and for monitoring of reported issues. The Election Assistance Commission is critical in facilitating the sharing of information among states with regard to best practices and rapidly identifying and addressing flaws.Never has the Election Assistance Commission’s work been more important than it is today, with Russia seeking to undermine our voting systems and those of other democracies. The kind of interference seen in our most recent election may not have altered the outcome, but it raised serious questions about vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to cybersecurity. The Election Assistance Commission provides one of our strongest built-in protections against cyberattacks on our voting infrastructure. During the 2016 election, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security worked closely with one another and with the Election Assistance Commission to identify cyber threats and provide states with the information needed to counter them. Now, the Election Assistance Commission is working to draw lessons from that election and use them to strengthen the security of states’ voting systems before Americans head to the polls again in 2018.Given these threats and the Election Assistance Commission’s role in protecting American voters, abolishing the Commission would be downright foolish. For several years, extreme right-wing Members of the House have been determined to abolish the Election Assistance Commission, without success, as a strong bipartisan majority has continued to recognize its benefits. With the inclusion of the dangerous provision to end the Election Assistance Commission’s work now included in one of the most important government funding bills the House will consider, it is now up to senior appropriators and the Election Assistance Commission’s bipartisan supporters to step up and demand the provision’s removal.The reasons the Election Assistance Commission’s opponents have given for abolishing the Commission have ranged from an insistence that it costs taxpayers too much to the claim that it has become a bloated bureaucracy to the conviction that the Election Assistance Commission intrudes on states’ rights. None of these reasons hold water. For one, the most Congress has ever funded the Election Assistance Commission over the course of a year was $10 million, and that was early in the agency’s existence when it was focused on initially implementing Help America Vote Act. In recent years, the agency’s annual appropriation has roughly been $5 million. Furthermore, at its peak, the Election Assistance Commission employed just 60 individuals; nearly all of those working at the Commission are experts in the field of election law and voting technology. With regard to the question of its impact on states’ rights, the Election Assistance Commission has virtually no rule-making authority and, therefore, has practically no authority over how state and local election officials carry out their elections.There is absolutely no justification for abolishing the Election Assistance Commission. Even the Trump administration included $9.2 million in funding for the Commission in its FY2018 budget proposal. While it’s very disappointing to see this provision abolishing the Election Assistance Commission included in the initial version of House Republicans’ funding bill, there is still ample opportunity to correct this error. That’s why I’m calling on all those from both parties who voted for Help America Vote Act in 2002 and who have supported strengthening our election systems in the years since to do everything in our power to have that provision removed and to enable the Election Assistance Commission to continue its critical work.With adversaries intent on undermining Americans’ faith in our voting systems, Congress ought to be providing the Election Assistance Commission with even greater resources to meet these new threats, not pulling the plug. It’s one thing for patriotic hackers to break into our voting systems in order to strengthen them; it’s another when foreign adversaries break in for the purpose of sowing chaos or manipulating the results. We must not allow that to happen."

Renewable energy skeptics have long used Cape Wind’s failure as proof that turbines were too costly, dangerous and unpopular to serve as a top power source for the country. Rhode Island-based Deepwater Wind has already succeeded in getting a five-turbine wind farm up and running off Block Island that began producing electricity last November. It’s also built or gained approval for farms in New York and Maryland. Now the company plans to submit an official bid next year to build its fourth wind farm, off the coast of southern Massachusetts.Named Revolution Wind ― a heavy-handed reference to turbines in a state culturally obsessed with its colonial past ― the proposed project would have 144 megawatts of electricity-producing capacity, with the option of going bigger with 288 megawatts or smaller with 96.The firm plans to pair the turbines with a 40 megawatt-hour Tesla battery storage system that would collect excess energy late at night, when the wind blows but fewer lights are on, and deploy it during peak hours of the day, offering the kind of reliability that burning fossil fuels provides. “This battery-offshore wind storage combo, we’ve seen it in some projects pairing batteries with solar and a few with batteries with onshore wind,” Deepwater Wind CEO Jeff Grybowski told HuffPost by phone. “But we’ve proposed here the biggest offshore wind-battery combo in the world.” It’s an ambitious plan, especially in Massachusetts. Cape Wind’s failure to build its namesake project, after applying for its first permits in 2001, came to symbolize the renewable energy industry’s woes and set the offshore sector back years, even as wind turbines proliferated off the shores of Europe and East Asia. Cape Wind sought to put 130 turbines in Horseshoe Shoal, part of Nantucket Sound. That drew opposition from rich people with last names like Kennedy and Koch, who didn’t want windmills obstructing their beachfront views. Environmentalists, too, feared that noise from the construction would disturb migrating whales and that the blades would kill seabirds.Revolution Wind will likely attract similar scrutiny. “The question in our mind is whether or not these things are being done in a way that exercises responsible resource protection,” said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which successfully sued Cape Wind for violating the Endangered Species Act. “In the case of Cape Wind, it was in the middle of important flyways and would have Cuisinart-ed a lot of important birds.” Piledriving the bases of offshore turbines produces loud noise that disturbs fish and sea mammals, but Deepwater Wind worked closely with whale surveyors and wildlife officials to avoid disrupting migrating creatures when building the Block Island Wind Farm last year. The noise from completed turbines, however, remains relatively low, a 2014 review of studies published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found. Though some seabirds collide with turbines, 99 percent “steer clear,” according to a 2014 Scottish government study.To quell the criticism from well-heeled homeowners, Grybowski said the company plans to build Revolution Wind 30 miles from shore, roughly two to three times farther out than Cape Wind’s proposed project. “We’re building a project out in the middle of the ocean as opposed to a location like Cape Wind, in the middle of the sound,” he said. “This is a project that can be sited in a way that it will avoid controversy.”Deepwater Wind’s other advantage comes from how it’s pitching the project. Massachusetts put out two requests this year ― one for general clean energy proposals and another specifically for offshore wind ― as part of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s push to slash climate-altering emissions. Revolution Wind’s yearlong construction would begin in 2022 and the project could meet up to 10 percent of the state’s outlined needs.It could also boost the number of jobs available for the region’s struggling mariners. Overfishing and climate change have decimated the cod population in New England, forcing federal regulators to dramatically lower the annual fishing quota. Fishing jobs have disappeared. Skills like hauling nets and sorting fresh catch may not transfer to work on offshore wind turbines, but Grybowski said the company plans to build an upkeep facility in New Bedford, a fishing hub roughly 60 miles south of Boston, and he wants workers with experience on the water.“There will be several hundred people employed in New Bedford, either through construction or long-term maintenance,” Grybowski said. “We’re going to need vessel captains, mates, people who are going to work outdoors and get on the water. People in the fishing industry today, they’re ideal candidates for those types of jobs.” In the United Kingdom, where offshore wind is booming, marine industries are drawing new funding and attention, said Keegan Kruger, a London-based wind analyst at the data firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But he said most workers have come over from the offshore oil and gas industry. Deepwater Wind’s turbines, for example, are built on the repurposed bases of offshore oil rigs. “There’s been a resurgence in investing in port infrastructure and setting up apprenticeships and training colleges,” he told HuffPost.For now, Deepwater Wind remains the primary offshore wind developer in the United States. In December, Norway’s state-owned oil company Statoil won a $42.5 million bid to lease 79,350 acres of federal waters off the coast of Long Island. Bay State Wind, a joint venture between Danish wind giant DONG Energy and a local firm, is taking steps toward building in Massachusetts waters, too.Deepwater Wind’s Block Island farm already shut down the vacation spot’s diesel-fueled power station this year. Now the company is working on a 90-megawatt project, dubbed the South Fork Wind Farm, 30 miles southeast of Montauk, New York, with plans to start providing power to Long Island utility customers in 2022. In Maryland, the firm is under contract to build its Skipjack Wind Farm by 2022. Revolution Wind would be its fourth location. Offshore wind will provide 17,575 megawatts worldwide this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data, with 14,740 megawatts in Europe, 2,805 in Asia and just 30 in North America, thanks to the Block Island Wind Farm. But the industry has tremendous potential. Wind off the coast of the U.S. could generate 4,223 gigawatts of electricity ― four times the power that’s currently produced by all sources in the country, according to a 2012 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. So the ghost of Cape Wind may not haunt the U.S. wind energy industry for long. “Ten years ago, it was effectively onshore turbines that they put out at sea,” Kruger said. “Now that’s completely changed. First and foremost, this is a marine sector before it’s a wind sector. Things are very, very different than they were back then.” "

Skills like hauling nets and sorting fresh catch may not transfer to work on offshore wind turbines, but Grybowski said the company plans to build an upkeep facility in New Bedford, a fishing hub roughly 60 miles south of Boston, and he wants workers with experience on the water.“There will be several hundred people employed in New Bedford, either through construction or long-term maintenance,” Grybowski said. “We’re going to need vessel captains, mates, people who are going to work outdoors and get on the water. People in the fishing industry today, they’re ideal candidates for those types of jobs.” In the United Kingdom, where offshore wind is booming, marine industries are drawing new funding and attention, said Keegan Kruger, a London-based wind analyst at the data firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But he said most workers have come over from the offshore oil and gas industry. Deepwater Wind’s turbines, for example, are built on the repurposed bases of offshore oil rigs. “There’s been a resurgence in investing in port infrastructure and setting up apprenticeships and training colleges,” he told HuffPost.For now, Deepwater Wind remains the primary offshore wind developer in the United States. In December, Norway’s state-owned oil company Statoil won a $42.5 million bid to lease 79,350 acres of federal waters off the coast of Long Island. Bay State Wind, a joint venture between Danish wind giant DONG Energy and a local firm, is taking steps toward building in Massachusetts waters, too.Deepwater Wind’s Block Island farm already shut down the vacation spot’s diesel-fueled power station this year. Now the company is working on a 90-megawatt project, dubbed the South Fork Wind Farm, 30 miles southeast of Montauk, New York, with plans to start providing power to Long Island utility customers in 2022. In Maryland, the firm is under contract to build its Skipjack Wind Farm by 2022. Revolution Wind would be its fourth location. Offshore wind will provide 17,575 megawatts worldwide this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data, with 14,740 megawatts in Europe, 2,805 in Asia and just 30 in North America, thanks to the Block Island Wind Farm. But the industry has tremendous potential. Wind off the coast of the U.S. could generate 4,223 gigawatts of electricity ― four times the power that’s currently produced by all sources in the country, according to a 2012 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. So the ghost of Cape Wind may not haunt the U.S. wind energy industry for long. “Ten years ago, it was effectively onshore turbines that they put out at sea,” Kruger said. “Now that’s completely changed. First and foremost, this is a marine sector before it’s a wind sector. Things are very, very different than they were back then.” "

Note: this article originally appeared in the East-West Center’s Asia Matters for America/America Matters for Asia initiative on August 2, 2017. On July 20, 2017, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that for the first time ever, the United States will be able to export rice to China. China, which every 13 days consumes an amount of rice equivalent to the total annual U.S. rice crop, is expected to import 5.3 million tons of rice from the United States in 2017-18.One of the six rice-producing U.S. states is Louisiana. The third-largest rice producer, it exports roughly 60 percent of its rice annually. In 2016, Louisiana’s exports of rough rice and milled rice totaled $444 million and $252 million, respectively. The opening of the Chinese market to U.S. rice exports represents a boon for Louisiana, which boasts the largest trade surplus with China of any U.S. state. This surplus is largely due to agricultural exports, which has also led to China becoming Louisiana’s largest export market; exports were valued at $8 billion in 2016.There is also the possibility that Louisiana will benefit from the Trump administration’s “100 day plan” discussions with Chinese leadership that would allow for US exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China. China is the 3rd-largest market for LNG exports, and although competition from other suppliers remains a factor, the United States is poised to be a major player in the field. Louisiana is uniquely suited to capitalize on this growing relationship as it is home to the first and only big LNG export facility in the lower 48 states, located at Sabine Pass. Another export facility is also expected to come online in Louisiana 2022.In addition to the strong trade relationship, Chinese investment in Louisiana is growing. In 2014, China’s Yuhuang Chemical became the first major foreign direct investment (FDI) by China in the Bayou State. The manufacture of methanol in the complex in St. James Parish will provide 2,365 indirect jobs, 2,100 construction jobs, and exports both to China and North American customers. In April 2017, Louisiana gained its second-largest Chinese FDI project from Wanhua Chemical Group, which will create 170 direct jobs and 945 indirect jobs as the chemical manufacturing plant is built."

NASA has a job for you.The federal space agency is seeking to hire a Planetary Protection Officer who would help thwart the spread of extraterrestrial life ― “intentionally or unintentionally” ― on Earth and to outside solar systems. “Planetary protection is concerned with the avoidance of organic-constituent and biological contamination in human and robotic space exploration,” the job listing states. That basically means preventing extraterrestrial life forces ― no matter their size ― from spreading during space travel.The position offers an annual salary between $124,406 and $187,000. It also comes with benefits.According to Business Insider, the role is super exclusive, with there being only two full-time like roles in the world — one with NASA and the other with the European Space Agency.Catharine Conley, NASA’s current PPO, pointed out that the role, which has a five-year maximum duration, was created to help meet an international agreement that space missions must have a less than 1-in-10,000 chance of contaminating an alien world.“It’s a moderate level,” she told Business Insider in an interview in March. “It’s not extremely careful, but it’s not extremely lax.”Before you start sharpening your Space Invader skills, it should be addressed that ― contrary to what Hollywood films may lead you to believe ― NASA’s not going to take just anyone.Applicants should have broad engineering expertise and an “advanced knowledge of Planetary Protection,” according to the job description.If selected, the applicant would not only get an impressive title, but also a mid-level security clearance.Not entirely qualified, but still intrigued?NASA is offering a Planetary Protection Course to 14 students in November on a first-come, first-served basis.The course is designed for “managers, engineers, designers, lab technicians, and others interested in the theory and application of planetary protection principles.”"

I think one of my lowest moments in parenthood to date was when my husband was away for a weekend. At one point I found myself calling my senior priest near midnight looking for his wife to share some wisdom about how to get a screaming 18-month-old to go to sleep. In our current situation, my family and I live in a community-oriented college town where we regularly find ourselves relying on friends, neighbors, and other parents to make our lives manageable.It is hard to accept offers of help. It is even harder to reach out and initiate the call for a little extra assistance from time to time. No one likes to admit that we have limitations to what we can manage on a day-to-day basis. That desire to be self-sufficient is a powerful force.There has been no shortage of commentary on the perceived heartlessness at the core of so much legislation (or, at least, attempted legislation) coming out of Washington, D.C. at the moment. Selfishness and corporate greed seem to be the benchmarks that define the agenda of the current White House administration—whether on issues such as the utter refusal to address the reality of climate change, the push to overturn Net Neutrality protections, or the current battle to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Even President Trump himself has infamously referred to the Republican-backed heath care plan as “mean.”No doubt self-interest does feed into our political situation at the moment. Both our elected representatives and the voters who put them in office are out to ensure their own well-being. Individuals push against environmental protections because they seem to put restrictions on how freely we can live our own lives. Young, healthy people push against health care reform, demanding to know why their costs should increase to offset the astronomical rates charged to someone with a long-standing chronic condition. It is impossible to deny that our “selfishness” fuels so much of the toxic nature of our current political reality.That said, as easy as it is (especially for those of us who champion progressive causes) to rail against the “selfishness” we perceive in our political opponents, I cannot help but wonder if there is something else at work in the American political landscape. At the core of American rugged individualism is not just a desire to protect what is our own, but also to prove to ourselves and to one another that we can make it on our own. The notion of accepting anything perceived as “charity” from friends or family is challenging enough for someone raised on the “can-do” entrepreneurial spirit of the American Dream to accept. The notion of accepting anything given for free from an entity as faceless or remote as the bureaucratic arm of the state is to many minds unthinkable.There is certainly nothing immoral about having a strong, positive work ethic and a sense of personal responsibility. But there is something broken about a culture that has bought into an “everyone for themselves” mentality that leaves the most vulnerable without necessary safety nets and renders large segments of the population distrustful of one another. Especially when that distrust leads to fear of anyone perceived to be outside the “norm” or a “threat to our way of life.” We cannot deny that the culture of self-reliance and lack of concern for others has a disproportionately negative impact on people of color, immigrants, and religious minorities (particularly Muslim Americans).The ironic reality is actually that the more we cling to our own sense of independence and autonomy the more precarious and impoverished our lives become. The more I am determined that I can go it alone as a parent, the more exhausted and frustrated I become with my life and with my daughter (who is a wonderful kid, if very… energetic). On the other hand, when I actually let go of my own pride and sense of self-sufficiency in order to accept the help that so many people in my social circle offer willingly, my life becomes so much more manageable. Most importantly, though, acknowledging my need for others and accepting that help does not just make my own individual life better. It does not just give me the freedom to be a little bit more relaxed and a little bit put together. It also gives me the freedom to turn around and give that help to other people. A sense of self-satisfaction that assures us that we can take care of ourselves is great. But it pales in comparison to the freedom and capacity to turn around and be able to offer help to our neighbors when the time comes.What type of world might we live in if we could all move past the “I can do it myself” mentality and trust that others are looking out for us? And how would the world be transformed if we moved past the “I’ve got mine” mentality, and started to think about how we can ensure that we all—us, our neighbors, our fellow citizens, our fellow human beings—have what we need?Previously published as ‘What We Need’ in Rachel’s SOUL MATTERS column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comThe Mental Workload of a Mother by Jami IngledueTrump’s Web of Lies by Maria BehanHow Women Can Help Each Other By Sharing by Irena Ioannou"

I’ll even admit he will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don’t expect a reply.”Scaramucci replied: “You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.” He later went on to tell the prankster (thinking it was still Priebus) to “Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello.”Scaramucci was also sucked into an exchange with a fake Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor who was chosen last month to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia. The real Huntsman was also tricked by a fake Eric Trump, and the real Eric Trump was emailed by a fake Donald Trump Jr., although the younger son of the president later said he forwarded the messages to authorities.The prankster was able to successfully pose as President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in an email sent to homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. The message from a fake Kushner included an invitation to “a bit of a soirée” alongside promises of “food of at least comparible [sic] quality to that which we ate in Iraq.”“Should be a great evening,” the note ends.“Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can’t refuse,” Bossert wrote back, according to the email obtained by CNN. He also included his personal email address, which CNN redacted.CNN obtained the emails from the prankster and confirmed their authenticity with the White House. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded that the White House was investigating the cyber-spoofing.You can read the full exchanges at CNN."

In doing so, the IOC clearly showed its preference for the country that elected Emmanuel Macron to preside over the games, instead of the one that chose Donald Trump, despite a strong bid by L.A. and the city’s history in hosting successful games.On paper, the City of Angels had the stronger bid than the City of Lights. Los Angeles had hosted two successful Olympic Games: 1932 and 1984. In fact, unlike so many recent financial failures, cost overruns, abandoned facilities and inadequate venues, the California city demonstrated that it is a perfect site for the 2024 Olympics.“Los Angeles, however, is almost a model Olympic city,” wrote Travis Waldron on HuffPost. “It turned a small profit in 1984, and even Olympic skeptics have said that the city’s bid is financially sound and unlikely to lead to the kind of massive cost overruns that so many other hosts have experienced.”Paris, meanwhile, has not hosted an Olympic Games since 1924. It had lost out on several earlier Olympic bids, and was beginning to look like a persistent “also-ran” or “frequent candidate” in the race to host the international games.Yet Macron is the one flashing the thumbs up, while Trump, who tweeted about his work to land the 2024 Olympics, isn’t. And their politics may have a lot to do with that.As Adam Taylor with The Washington Post noted, Macron touted his country’s values at the Olympic meeting in Lausanne, something Trump skipped. “We need multilateralism, the structures that provide agreement among nations…and tolerance, which the Olympic movement illustrates well,” the French President said. “Olympic values are our values.” If he’s reelected, he’ll play the host to the 2024 Olympic Games.As Michael Bastasch with The Daily Caller added, “Macron is determined to bring the games to a country that embodies ‘openness, tolerance and respect for the environment,’” an open reference to his country’s support for the Paris Agreement, something President Trump openly rejected, claiming he was dedicated to protecting Pittsburgh, and not Paris.Trump’s verbal attacks on Mexico and his decision to build the wall and put travel bans on several countries, is unpopular worldwide, and even in America as well. He has clashed with many world leaders, even backing Macron’s ultranationalistic rival. His “America First,” slogan might play well in Ocala, Florida, might not in the Olympic Committee, which likely cringed at the prospect of a Trump in his last year in office (if reelected) giving a long speech similar to the Boy Scout lecture in July.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti seemed to understand the importance of international cooperation in his city’s bid to host the Olympics. As Taylor with the Washington Post reported “Garcetti stressed that the city aims to make the games economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. The mayor vowed to protect Los Angeles taxpayers’ money and to use the event as a way to create long-lasting access to sports for children throughout the city.” And Garcetti noted his city’s support for the Paris Climate Agreement. As a result, L.A. was awarded the 2028 Olympics, much earlier than many such bids are usually given.It seems as though the IOC really wanted the Olympics to return to Los Angeles as soon as possible, on the anniversary of the highly successful 2024 games. But they couldn’t swallow the specter of Trump calling for the crowd to boo domestic rivals, bragging about this big electoral win, and making inappropriate references or nationalistic appeals.John A.

With events like the three year siege of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, Stalinism, the Cold War, and traumatic privatization still in living memory, it would be a massive understatement to say that Russians have seen and survived far worse. Since March 2014, mere weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine's Crimea, the European Union has progressively been inducing harder and harder economic sanctions upon Russia. As of the 28th of June 2017, sanctions will continue until January 31st 2018, some four years after original sanctions were introduced. Still Russia stands. Crimea has been annexed and Russian maps include it in the Russian Federation. If the goal of these sanctions was to cripple the Russian economy, many can say that they succeeded, as they largely contributed to the 2014 Russian financial crisis. If the goal of these sanctions was to force President Vladimir Putin or the Russian population to capitulate, they failed. As President Donald Trump prepares to sign into law sanctions against Russia, President Vladimir Putin has demonstrated just how much this worries Russians. Not at all. Instead of conceding to Western wishes, President Putin has promised to expel 755 American diplomats. More than anything, Russians see this current round of sanctions as a misguided and uninformed attempt at intimidation and Western domination. Pravda.ru, one of the largest Russian online newspapers and the son of the infamous premier Soviet news source, called the sanctions “hysterical.” In a recent interview, President Putin voiced his regret over the degeneration of relations between the two countries, but stated that the situation will not be left unanswered. Officials with the Russian embassy in Washington said it best: ""Washington has never understood that methods of pressure on Russia do not work, and sanctions cannot help improve the relations."" Russians and their government alike want their reprisal to hurt. These sanctions, like many previous Western sanctions, will likely not garner the desired response. This is not the first time the Russian Federation has faced such punishment and we can look at the myriad sanctions imposed upon Russia after their 2014 invasion of Crimea as an example of how successful this current set may be. In order to understand Russian foreign policy, one must first understand Russians. They are a people particularly conscious of history. The dissolution of the Soviet Union reduced Russia from a global power and regional hegemon to a failing capitalist state. It might feel to Russians as if great turns in history take them out of the frying pan and into the fire, as the era of privatization in the 1990s was marked by widespread social upheaval and suffering that left many nostalgic for the era of the Soviet Union. President Putin’s ascension to power in 2000 brought about stabilization, growth, and progress as he cut down oligarchs and mafiosos alike. Arguably more importantly, during his presidency he has assuaged the great sense of loss that Russians feel surrounding the fall of the Soviet Union. This is not to say that all Russians remember the Cold War years fondly, but many miss the cradle-to-grave security of Communism and the sense that they were the bastions of a global ideology, an axis on which the world spinned. Perhaps the British can sympathize with this traumatic loss of empire, which some claim motivated Thatcher’s invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982. Although almost universally condemned internationally, President Putin’s invasion of Crimea actually caused a spike in his approval ratings. Crimea has historically been a Russian imperial territory and Russians saw the invasion as a return to empire, a reclaiming of what was once and rightfully theirs. In the face of history, sanctions mean little. Russians have survived far worse economic conditions and know well how to weather a storm. After all, most Russians remember living in the USSR. As the ruble fell in 2014, rather than see their savings dwindle in value, Russians preemptively invested in iPhones, luxury cars, and Ikea furniture, so much so that Ikea had to cease operations because they couldn’t keep up with demand. Generally, Russians take sanctions as a challenge. Where a Western population might crumble in the face of rapid inflation and disappearing consumer goods, Russians take pride in holding their ground. With their eyes always on history, this current round of sanctions from Congress can’t look like more than a bump in the road. A better question is, can the West handle their response?"
