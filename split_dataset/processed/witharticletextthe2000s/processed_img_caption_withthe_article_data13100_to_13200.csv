Eruptions of smoke and steam that began Saturday have triggered the country’s highest level of alert. Although about 40,000 people were evacuated to shelters over the weekend, authorities are facing resistance from residents who want to stay behind to protect their homes and livestock.“Not all villagers in the dangerous radius are willing to evacuate,” the agency wrote. “Until now there are still many people who remain in their houses.”Airports were shut down for a second day as air conditions worsened. More than 400 flights have been canceled, and 59,000 travelers have been stranded, the BBC reported.Australian students who had just finished final exams and were prepared to fly home reported being denied aid from their travel insurance, according to The Australian Associated Press. Emily Martin, 19, on her first trip without her family, said she was worried about running out of money as she waited to go home.“They don’t really tell you that you’re not covered by the insurance for the volcano. You’re just left in the dark,” Martin told the AAP in Bali.Authorities warned that Mount Agung could violently erupt at any moment. Plumes of volcanic ash have risen nearly 5.6 miles into the air. Water and rock have streamed down Mount Agung, a mixture called lahar in Indonesian, that can damage the environment. "

As tested, such a weapon would be able to travel more than enough distance to reach Washington, D.C., or New York City.Experts say it’s unlikely the missile would be able to deliver a nuclear bomb that far just yet, as it appeared likely that Tuesday’s launch carried a lighter mock warhead. But many say such a reality is one step closer, and the test advances North Korea’s weapon program despite efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to quash Kim’s ambitions.“It’s the next logical step that we were expecting,” said David Wright, a physicist and the co-director of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “North Korea knows what they’re doing. They have an engineering team that knows what they’re doing. It’s hard to say if it’s six months or two years before they can deliver a nuclear warhead, but it’s heading in that direction.”Tuesday’s launch was the first for North Korea in more than two months, and it came amid some reports that the country may have been scaling back its weaponry tests for the winter or been signaling it was ready to open diplomatic negotiations. Experts say those reports now appear misguided. “We now have to assume the entire continental U.S. is within range of the North Korean Hwasong-14,” Vipin Narang, an associate professor specializing in nuclear proliferation at MIT, told HuffPost in an email. “It’s one hell of a way to break the testing pause.” Van Jackson, a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, said the test confirmed that Pyongyang was preparing to launch missiles under real-world conditions.

The videos purported to show Muslims committing violent and anti-Christian acts. One is called “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches,” another is called “Muslim destroys a statue of Virgin Mary” and the third is called “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!”The legitimacy of the videos hasn’t been verified, but the Embassy of the Netherlands in the United States has already offered a correction regarding the first one. That clip originally appeared online months ago, and at the time, it was reported that the attacker didn’t appear to be a Muslim or an immigrant. On Wednesday, the embassy confirmed in a tweet that the attacker was born and raised in the Netherlands, and that he has already received and completed a sentence under Dutch law. The second video was reportedly taken in Syria in 2013 and shows a man belonging to the al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra. The third video reportedly shows a mob of Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Egypt throwing teens from a rooftop in 2013. It was apparently taken during the political unrest that followed the ouster of President Mohammed Morsi.Spreading misinformation about Muslims, and conflating political extremism with Islam’s spiritual tenets, is Britain First’s bread and butter ― and the fact that Trump is amplifying one of the group’s leaders has raised concerns on both sides of the pond. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May condemned Trump through a spokesman on Wednesday, saying it was “wrong for the President to have done this.”“Britain First seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tension,” the spokesman said. “They cause anxiety to law-abiding people. British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far-right which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents: decency, tolerance and respect.”Britain First is a registered political party in the U.K. that formed in 2011 as an offshoot of the far-right and now-defunct British National Party. The group is led by co-founder Paul Golding, a longtime figure in Britain’s far-right movement, and by Fransen, who was elected to her current post in 2014. Britain First describes itself as a “patriotic resistance and ‘frontline’” for the U.K.’s “long suffering people.” Their motto, “Take our country back,” hints at their radical goals ― to severely restrict immigration, promote Christianity above other religions in the U.K., and pull Britain away from the United Nations and other international groups. The group claims Islam is threatening the U.K.’s Christian heritage. Their policies call for a comprehensive ban on Islam in the country ― which would mean jailing or deporting anyone “promoting the ideology of Islam,” shutting down mosques, banning the Quran and prohibiting Islamic headscarves.The group has been denounced by every major Christian denomination in the U.K.Britain First has been unsuccessful in electoral politics. Golding campaigned to become London’s mayor in 2016, but only earned about 1.2 percent of the vote.Britain First has used social media to get its message out to Islamophobes in the U.K. and abroad. The group boasts a Facebook following of nearly 2 million fans. In contrast, Britain’s Labour Party has about 1 million, while its Conservative Party has about 650,000. The group is known for posting viral videos of staged anti-Muslim stunts. In the past, they’ve stormed mosques and a halal slaughterhouse, threatened to bury a pig on a proposed mosque site and spread false stories about Islam in the U.K. In January 2016, Golding and Fransen staged what they called a “Christian patrol” with a group of about 20 Britain First members in the town of Luton. Carrying white wooden crosses, they filmed themselves handing out leaflets and intimidating local Muslim residents. As a result, Golding and Fransen were banned for three years from entering mosques throughout England and Wales. Golding defied the court order nine days after it was handed down, the BBC reports. He was sentenced to eight weeks in prison. Fransen also faced repercussions from the Luton march. In November 2016, she was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment after verbally abusing a Muslim woman who was wearing a hijab. The convictions don’t seem to have hindered Golding and Fransen’s campaign for Britain First. Both were charged with religious harassment this September, and on Nov. 18, Fransen was arrested in London for having used “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour” at a far-right rally in Northern Ireland over the summer. She’s due in court on Dec. 14.In June 2016, Labour politician Jo Cox was shot dead by a Nazi sympathizer who reportedly shouted “Britain First” during the attack. Fransen attempted to distance her group from the assassination, telling Reuters it had nothing to do with Britain First.Jo Cox’s widower, Brendan Cox, criticized Trump via Twitter on Wednesday for promoting Britain First.Fransen, meanwhile, expressed elation over Trump’s attention.“GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP! GOD BLESS AMERICA!” she wrote on Twitter. She later posted a video message saying she was “delighted” the president “took the time out to retweet three of my videos.”Tell Mama, an organization that tracks Islamophobia in the U.K., has expressed serious concern over Trump’s decision to retweet Fransen. Fiyaz Mughal, Tell Mama’s founder and director of the group Faith Matters, told the BBC that the president’s actions have “re-energised far right groups by simply pressing three clicks of a button.” “They have effectively felt that their work is bleeding into the White House and so there is serious damage over what has happened today and there will be repercussions felt sadly over the next few months,” Mughal said. “And for those Muslims who think there is a clash of civilisations taking place it confirms their warped view. So what the President has done today is to actually strengthen the hand of extremists.”This article has been updated to include information from the Embassy of the Netherlands in the U.S."

The critics said the president’s retweets gave her a much bigger platform on which to spread anti-Muslim hate.Britain First is a fringe political party in the U.K. known for spreading hoaxes about Islam online. Although it claims to be defending Britain’s Christian heritage and promoting Christian values, the anti-immigrant group has been thoroughly denounced by every major Christian denomination in the U.K.On Wednesday, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England, called on Trump to “remove his Britain First retweets and make clear his opposition to racism and hatred.”“It is deeply disturbing that the President of the United States has chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists,” Welby wrote on Facebook. “Britain First seeks to divide communities and intimidate minorities, especially our Muslim friends and neighbours. Britain First does not share our values of tolerance and solidarity. God calls us as Christians to love our neighbour and seek the flourishing of all in our communities, societies and nations.”The Board of Deputies of British Jews, one of the country’s leading Jewish advocacy groups, echoed Welby’s call for Trump to delete his retweets. And the Muslim Council of Britain said that Trump’s retweets were the “clearest endorsement yet from the US President of the far-right and their vile anti-Muslim propaganda.”“We cannot give such bigotry a free pass,” the council’s statement read.The three videos that Trump retweeted purport to show Muslims committing violent and anti-Christian acts. Fransen’s tweet claimed that one of the videos depicted a Muslim migrant beating up a Dutch boy on crutches. The Dutch Embassy in Washington, D.C., discredited that claim, confirming in a tweet that the attacker was born and raised in the Netherlands. The two other videos appear to be from Syria and Egypt in 2013 and show the actions of violent political extremists.The videos are part of Britain First’s long-running campaign to stoke fears about Muslims and conflate the ideology of extremists with the way that the vast majority of the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims practice their faith. Fransen herself was convicted in 2016 of religiously aggravated harassment against a Muslim woman. Muslim and interfaith allies in the U.S. have also criticized the retweets, warning they could encourage those who seek to harm Muslim Americans. The Anti-Defamation League released a statement arguing that Trump’s retweets are just another example of how he continually provides “his millions of followers a gateway into the world of extremism, hatred and anti-Semitism.” Jonathan Greenblatt‏, CEO of the Jewish advocacy organization, said this kind of anti-Muslim propaganda will “embolden bigots in the US and abroad.” Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America magazine, compared the president’s tweets to tactics used by the Nazis to increase division and foment hatred against Jews. Other interfaith allies in the U.S. also chimed in on Twitter.Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Trump’s actions put “the lives and safety of American Muslim children and families at risk.”“Hate speech leads to hate crimes. When hate speech and conspiracy theories against American minorities go unchallenged, they foster an atmosphere that causes hate crimes,” Awad warned. Trump wasn’t living up to his promise to be a president for all Americans, said Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council.“You can’t claim to be a President for all Americans if you scapegoat any group of Americans. In fact, you can’t claim to be President at all if you promote conspiracy theories about any minority,” Al-Marayati said in a statement. “If moral leadership will not come from the White House, we will need others ― religious leaders, political leaders, and everyday Americans ― to step up and condemn this behavior and fill the gap.”"

An invitation for a state visit has been extended and accepted. Further details will announced in due course,” the spokesman said.London Mayor Sadiq Khan in June asked that Trump’s visit be canceled, after the president criticized Khan’s response to a London terror attack. May bit back at Trump at the time, saying the mayor was “doing a good job and it’s wrong to say anything else.”U.K. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday encouraged his government to condemn Trump."

Their promised Affordable Care Act repeal failed – again and again and again. Their Muslim ban was, well, banned by the courts. And now, in the waning days of November, their infrastructure bill, big beautiful border wall and brand new NAFTA are all missing.Republicans have lost so much, they’re downright desperate for a win. And that’s why they’re pushing a tax scam supported by a mere 25 percent of Americans, according to the latest Quinnipiac Poll. They’ve just got to rack up a win, consequences and American workers be damned. They’re so desperate that GOP Sen. Bob Corker, a self-described deficit hawk, agreed in committee Tuesday to send the bill to the floor for a vote after he got promises for changes. What he wants is cancellation of the bill’s tax breaks if they don’t stimulate economic expansion as Republicans say they will. The GOP keeps swearing the cuts will cause growth despite the fact that the Bush tax breaks didn’t and despite the fact that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects the cuts will add $1.44 trillion to the deficit. Some deficit hawk. But, hey, anything for a win. Republicans are so desperate that they’re shoving this scam through what is supposed to be a deliberative process without any of that deliberation – without, for example, routine hearings or assessment by the Treasury Department or Joint Committee on Taxation. So there’s no bipartisan government evaluation of the GOP assertion that the tax breaks will generate economic growth sufficient to account for the massive revenue losses they’ll cause. Americans hate this scam for good reason. And they do hate it. The latest Harvard-Harris survey showed 54 percent oppose it and the same percent say the scam is likely to hurt them financially. They know a swindle when they see one. But Republicans feel like they’ve got to have a win. No matter what. Poor people, working people, old people be damned. And damned they are by the GOP scam. The GOP bill delivers massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. The House version, for example, eliminates the estate tax. This is charged only on estates worth $5.49 million or more. So only the richest of the rich, the top 0.2 percent pay. And among the tiny number nationwide that owe estate tax in 2017, the average effective rate paid is less than 17 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s because the rich employ experts to exploit loopholes so they never pay the official rate of 40 percent. In addition to generating essential funds for the federal government for more than a century, this tax prevents America from reverting into a kingdom dominated by royal dynasties whose pampered scions thrive by the merit of their grandfathers rather than by the sweat of their brows. This was the system Americans fought a revolution to escape. But Republicans are voting to bring it back. Anything for a win. Their scam also bestows on corporations the privilege of paying zero U.S. taxes on the profits of their foreign factories. So instead of the current 35 percent, or the new, low 20 percent rate that Republicans plan to award companies in their tax scam, corporations will pay nothing at all if they move manufacturing from Iowa to India or from Idaho to Mexico. This will kill American manufacturing and American jobs. Factories will flee even faster to low-wage, high-pollution countries like China where Republicans will absolve them from paying any U.S. income taxes at all! Those Michigan and Ohio auto parts factories – gone. Those Pennsylvania and Illinois steel mills – gone. Those family-supporting jobs – shipped overseas by Republican tax policy. Republicans are appeasing fat-cat CEOs and shareholders to get themselves a win on taxes. Family-supporting jobs be damned.The fattest of those cats, the richest 1 percent, rake in 62 percent of the benefits of this tax con by 2027. Many in the middle class will get tax cuts in the first few years too, but by 2027, their rates rise back up. At that time, this GOP tax fraud would stick 87 million families making less than $200,000 a year with tax increases. But by then, by 2027, many of those Republicans will have left Congress to become overpaid lobbyists – the kind now demanding income redistribution from the pockets of the poor and middle class up and into the treasure chests of the wealthiest. The tax scam seems like a win for Republicans now, and secure job offers from lobby firms later. The CBO has estimated that those tax breaks in the Senate GOP bill will dig a $1.44 trillion deficit over 10 years. This hole will be dredged by the party that spent 8 years while President Barack Obama was in office decrying anything that would increase the deficit by a penny. But policy consistency be damned. Anything for a win.To keep the deficit “down” to $1.4 trillion, Republicans slash and burn programs vital to workers and the elderly like Medicare and the tax credit for student loans. Democrats have estimated the tax scam will slash $470 billion from Medicare over 10 years. The CBO has estimated those cuts will start next year with $25 billion. Worse though, is the real potential for Republicans to contend by year five or six, as their tax cuts for the rich and corporations gin up government debt, that programs workers cherish like Social Security and Medicaid must be gutted as well.So what looks like a Republican win in 2017 could be a tragic loss to American workers by 2027.Ok. The American people get it. Republicans have had a rough year. They are aching for a win. But doing the wrong thing just to do something is not a win. It’s a scam perpetrated on American workers."

The threat is real and that is what the president is talking about.”Sanders did not elaborate on what the threat was, exactly, but emphasized the need to secure America’s borders.The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Meanwhile, the British government denounced Trump’s casual retweeting of Fransen’s posts, saying the president was “wrong” to share videos from a group that “peddles lies” and is “overwhelmingly rejected” by the British public.Britain First is notorious for spreading hoaxes about Islam and conducting aggressive “mosque invasions.” The group has also campaigned for an outright ban on Islam in the U.K., which would entail jailing or deporting anyone found to be “promoting the ideology of Islam,” closing mosques, banning the Quran and prohibiting Islamic headscarves."

Susan Collins (R-Maine) was sounding more optimistic about the tax reform bill on Tuesday, saying, “I’m encouraged by the response to my proposals on property tax deduction and mitigating the impact of the individual mandate repeal.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1de09e150000036485a51f.jpeg?ops=crop_240_73_4586_2939%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans made significant progress on their tax proposal Tuesday, with the Budget Committee advancing it to the House floor and senators coming close to agreements on a debt trigger, the individual health care mandate repeal and complicated business tax provisions that some Republicans think are too restrictive.President Donald Trump came to a Senate GOP lunch on Tuesday, and while Trump didn’t exactly cut any deals himself, he apparently said he would sign a bipartisan agreement on Obamacare Cost Sharing Reductions ― the so-called Alexander-Murray deal worked out between Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) ― as well as a bill providing $2.25 billion a year to states to subsidize the costs of individuals who require the most medical attention.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) sounded substantially less pessimistic about the tax bill Tuesday after Trump’s commitment, telling reporters that her first preference was still to not include an individual mandate repeal in the tax proposal but that if it were included, she was happy that Trump at least said he would support the Alexander-Murray deal and her subsidy bill with Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).“I’m encouraged by the response to my proposals on property tax deduction and mitigating the impact of the individual mandate repeal,” Collins said.(Collins has also expressed opposition to the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes, offering proposals that would at least let taxpayers write off some of what they pay in property taxes.)Although she has never come out against the tax bill, Collins has looked like one of the toughest votes to get in the Senate, especially if Republicans really wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which requires those who don’t get health insurance to pay a penalty. But with Trump telling Collins during the Tuesday lunch that he would support those other pieces of legislation, Collins now seems gettable, and her ally in keeping the individual mandate, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), has already indicated that she could support the bill.One of the other toughest votes during the tax debate, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), also appears to have softened over the last 24 hours. Corker told reporters Monday night that he “very possibly” could vote against the budget for tax reform in committee on Tuesday. But after working with leadership for a “trigger” that would claw back tax cuts if certain revenue targets weren’t being hit, Corker supported the bill, with the proposal advancing out of the panel on a party-line vote.“We’ve got an outline of an agreement at every level that matters in the Senate,” Corker told reporters on Tuesday.While Corker was careful to note there wasn’t yet legislative language for the trigger, he said he and other Republican senators concerned about how much debt the tax bill could produce had a commitment that puts them “in a pretty good place.”Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), another member of the Budget Committee who threatened to vote no in committee but ended up voting yes, also seems to have come around, at least somewhat. The Senate bill would allow businesses known as “pass-throughs” ― because their earnings are taxed when they pass through to their owners’ individual tax returns ― to deduct 17.4 percent of their qualified business income from their overall income, reducing their tax bill. The bill also imposes complicated restrictions on the deduction for pass-through owners earning more than $500,000 annually.Johnson and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) have said they oppose the Senate tax bill because it wouldn’t benefit small businesses as much as it would large corporations. Specifically, their complaint is that, while corporations would get a big tax cut, pass-through businesses would still be subject to the higher individual income tax rates.One possible change under discussion would be to increase the deduction to 20 percent of qualified business income, though Daines and Johnson have been cagey about whether that would win them over. “I want to see that moved up,” Daines told reporters on Tuesday morning, referring to the value of the deduction. “That would be significant progress.”Trump reportedly told Johnson during Tuesday’s lunch that he ought to withdraw his objection to the Senate bill now and instead try to amend the measure to his liking on the Senate floor ― or perhaps wait until there’s a conference with the House.Spokespeople for Johnson didn’t respond to a request for comment, but Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) suggested that Trump said they could work out Johnson’s concerns.“I believe we gonna get us a tax bill,” Shelby said.Senators are speeding to a potential floor vote on the tax proposal by the end of this week, setting up either a quick conference between the House and Senate ― either officially or unofficially ― or for the House to just take the Senate bill and pass it. If, as expected, all Democrats vote against the bill, Republicans can lose only two votes (with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a 50-50 tie).Again, there are a number of outstanding concerns, but the overall direction of negotiations suggests this is a bill that will become law. Republicans have thus far overcome just about all their reservations in the name of a legislative victory, and even though it could be very tricky ― read: expensive ― to open up the pass-through provisions so that more small businesses pay less, the Republicans raising these concerns aren’t usually the ones who would stymie a GOP win.Arthur Delaney contributed to this report."
10,BLACK VOICES,Memo Suggests FBI Secretly Monitored Black Lives Matter Protests,Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-black-lives-matter-fbi-monitoring_us_5a1f02dce4b0d52b8dc24597,The agency feared “black supremacist extremists” would disrupt the 2016 political conventions.,2017-11-29,"An FBI document said it was concerned about protests that followed the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f39ec1400004f7750feca.jpeg?cache=tFoJwGelAg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently released documents from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security show that government officials feared “black supremacist extremists” had plans to disrupt the 2016 Democratic and Republican national conventions.An internal email, obtained by Al Jazeera, was sent the day after Micah Johnson killed five Dallas police officers during a July 2016 Black Lives Matter march. The FBI noted that Johnson, a black man who was later killed by a police bomb, acted alone and had no ties to Black Lives Matter. However, it expressed deep concern over potential violence from other “black supremacist extremists” in the document.“Due to the sensitives surrounding recent police shootings, the threat of copycat attacks against law enforcement exists,” one email reads. “There is a threat of black supremacist extremists attempting to violently co-opt the upcoming DNC/RNC.”The phrase “black supremacist extremist” is used a second time in the memo when it points to several movements in the Dallas area, “the most prominent is the New Black Panther Party (NBPP), which has numerous offshoots.”Much of the memo’s text about a plan of action has been blacked out. However, Al Jazeera notes that the language in the documents they obtained allude to Black Lives Matter protests being monitored. Activist DeRay McKesson told Newsweek that FBI agents visited his and other black activists’ homes in 2016. He said before the summer conventions they left a business card with a note outside his home.“We knew that there were likely people watching,” McKesson said. “We knew that we were on the right side of justice. We were not afraid.”A spokesperson for the FBI sent a statement regarding the claim that they monitored activists to HuffPost:“The FBI investigates activity which may constitute a federal crime or pose a threat to national security and cannot initiate an investigation based solely on an individual’s race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of First Amendment rights. The FBI remains committed to protecting those rights for all Americans. Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and other criminal acts. Furthermore, the FBI does not and will not police ideology. When an individual takes violent action based on belief or ideology and breaks the law, the FBI will enforce the rule of law.”In October, Foreign Policy obtained an FBI document that said the agency was targeting “black identity extremists” for fear that they’d use “premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement.” The report, titled “Black Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers,” says it was prompted by the widespread anger after a Ferguson, Missouri, cop killed Michael Brown in 2014.“The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,” the report reads, using an acronym for “black identity extremists.”Civil rights leaders note that the label puts a dangerous and racist target on the backs of black activist groups and is reminiscent of the bureau’s COINTELPRO (counterintelligence program), which aimed to disrupt the efforts of civil rights leaders and groups in the 1960s. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) previously told HuffPost that the report needs to be disowned and thrown “in the trash can.” “I think it’s just the racism, frankly, not because they’re loosely organized or anything like that. I think that what has happened in our country a lot is that if an African-American commits a crime, then the entire group is responsible,” Bass said. “Black people’s general response to a crime is ‘Was it a black person who did it?’ Because we know if there was a black person who did it, then everyone is responsible and accountable.”"
11,POLITICS,The FBI's Major Crime Report Is Missing Critical Info And Experts Are Sounding The Alarm,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-2016-crime-report-missing-data_us_5a1f25c4e4b0392a4ebad4a3,The 2016 Crime in the United States report omits key data about homicides and drug arrests.,2017-11-29,Criminologists are sounding the alarm about data that is missing from the FBI's most recent crime report. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f263b1400004f7750fe8a.jpeg?cache=rA7kW8Hv7r&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump loves to talk about crime. In his nomination acceptance address, he vowed that he would “liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.” In his inauguration speech, he swore to put an end to “American carnage.”But despite his apparent interest in the topic, the first exhaustive report on crime issued during his presidency is missing a colossal amount of data. And now criminologists are sounding the alarm.On Wednesday, an organization representing more than 5,000 criminal justice scholars and researchers issued a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, expressing its concerns about the FBI’s 2016 Crime in the United States report, which came out in September. Each year for the past eight decades, the FBI releases a comprehensive report that criminologists rely on to analyze and understand crime trends. It’s an essential tool. This year, the report looks very different from past versions. It contains 64 percent fewer data tables than the 2015 version ― 52 tables are just simply gone. In a statement on its website, the FBI noted that it “strategically trimmed the amount of tables and refined the presentation of data in this year’s publication” in an effort to streamline the report.Peter Wood authored the letter on behalf of the Crime & Justice Research Alliance, a joint project of the American Society of Criminology and the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. Wood, the chair of the alliance, said the FBI’s explanation is sorely lacking.“This has significant implications for the justice research community that relies on this trusted information for a broad range of research activists, including evaluation and assessment of trends in crime, arrests, clearance rates and related matters,” he wrote. “Given this administration’s public statements about addressing violent crime, victims’ rights, the opioid epidemic and terrorism, it is unfortunate that the 2016 report removes key data about these topic areas.”Among the missing statistics in the 2016 report is information on the relationship between victims and offenders ― which is of particular interest to those studying domestic violence homicides. Katie Ray-Jones, the CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said the 2016 report makes it much more difficult to identify the number of women murdered by their partners.“We want answers to a key question: ‘Why would critical data that helps us fight the scourge of violence against women be removed from this annual report?’” she said. “We are fighting every day to end domestic violence and without this needed data it is now nearly impossible for The Hotline and our fellow advocates to gauge how dire the problem and how successful our efforts are to combat it.”The report is also missing data that allows researchers to separate out arrests relating to specific drug types. In practice, that means researchers cannot, for example, easily distinguish arrests for heroin from those for marijuana. “Yet, of course, we are in the midst of a very serious opioid epidemic,” said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, who studies drug-related homicides and arrests. “The 2016 report makes it impossible to continue to monitor trends.”He urged the FBI to immediately release the missing tables.“The policies that tend to work are based on good, reasoned, accurate, reliable evidence,” he said. “Without that evidence, we are in a policy blind alley.” Adam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project of The Pew Charitable Trusts, said he found the decision to whittle down the number of tables in the report strange, especially given the recent uptick in some types of violent crime, including homicides. “There’s an even greater need for the data to try to understand what is going on, and how to combat it,” he said. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "
12,RELIGION,We’ve Been Here All Along,"Funie Hsu, ContributorAssistant professor of American Studies, San Jose State Univer...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weve-been-here-all-along_us_5a1324d7e4b0bfa88c1c1dc3,The exclusion of Asian and Asian American Buddhists from conversations on American Buddhism is cultural appropriation.,2017-11-29,"The congregation of Bakersfield Buddhist Church in Bakersfield, California, November 19, 1925.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a13280a180000aa09f6d1eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This crossposting is dedicated to the legacy of Angry Asian Buddhist, Aaron Lee.Somewhere in the soil of California’s Central Valley lies buried treasure. Scholar and Soto Zen priest Duncan Ryuken Williams tells the story of 10-year-old Masumi Kimura and her family. Like many other Japanese American families living in California before World War II, the Kimuras were farmers, tilling soil and developing irrigation systems for land that had long been dismissed as inarable by white Americans. They were also Buddhist, part of the earliest organized Buddhist community in America. Because of their ethnic and religious background, especially Mr. Kimura’s leadership role at the local temple, the family was deemed suspect by the FBI following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.Williams details the day that Masumi came home “to find her father pinned on the ground and an agent holding a gun to her mother’s head.” After further questioning by the FBI, the agents left. Mr. Kimura, anxious to protect his family from further violence, instructed Masumi to prepare a fire in the bath furnace. He gathered all of the family belongings that had Japanese writing or any trace of Japaneseness and threw them into the fire. “However,” Williams writes, “her father hesitated with a few items.”Masumi remembers that her father set aside minutes from board meetings and other temple documents from the Madeira Buddhist Temple, the family’s bound edition of the Buddhist scriptures…Wrapping the Buddhist scriptures and the temple records in the kimono cloth and placing them in the tin boxes, Masumi’s father carefully lowered them into the hole and covered them with dirt. It was safer to bury these items than to keep them. -“Lessons from the Internment of Japanese-Americans,” Dharma World MagazineGiven the hostile anti-Japanese sentiment sanctioned by the federal government, the Kimuras were left with little option but to burn or bury any signs of their spiritual and cultural difference.The Kimura family’s experience demonstrates merely one historic example of the ways in which Asian and Asian American Buddhists have long been viewed with violent suspicion for our cultural and spiritual differences. Though our communities are diverse and complex ― including Central Asians, South Asians, Southeast Asians, East Asians, and Pacific Islanders ― our experience of exclusion in regard to the representation of our spirituality is shared. For Buddhists of Asian ancestry living in the United States, being Buddhist has historically been tied to racial assumptions that have marked us as “perpetually foreign.” These differences have been used to systematically violate our civil rights and exclude us from society in significant ways.White supremacy, the system of power behind the suspicion and exclusion of Asian and Asian American Buddhists, is the same system that justified the founding and building of the U.S. through the genocide of indigenous peoples and the labor of enslaved Africans. Undeniably, America has been created by excluding people whose differences were deemed inferior ― a process known as racial othering ― so as to establish a seemingly natural superiority of white people.White supremacy has systematically alienated Asian and Asian American Buddhist communities and diminished the validity of our relationship to Buddhism in the U.S. The erasure and exclusion of our communities is not merely about a lack of inclusion; to put it so simply would be dismissive of the facts of history. The exclusion of Asian and Asian American Buddhists from conversations on American Buddhism is cultural appropriation. It renders invisible our foundational role in establishing and maintaining Buddhism in America despite white supremacy. Thus, such erasure denies our right to claim our deep and specific connection ― indeed, our centrality ― to American Buddhism. It appropriates our historical authority in order to promote the white ownership of an indigenous Asian practice for liberation.The same process of white supremacy has created an American culture in which other practitioners, namely white practitioners, have been granted the freedom to be Buddhist in safer and more public ways. Moreover, instead of facing systemic injustice for embracing a spirituality that departs from the Judeo-Christian norm, white Buddhists are often lauded for this difference. They may attain a certain cultural capital for their practice, for donning Buddhist symbols and using dharma names in Asian languages, all of which mark them with distinction as “interesting,” perhaps even “worldly”—anything but “suspect” or “foreign.”This is white supremacy and privilege in Buddhism.Most conversations about cultural appropriation in Buddhism revolve around the outward symbols and signs of the practice: beads, tattoos, statues, and so on. But an important element of the appropriation occurs through the assumed occupation of white authority status, often legitimized through the intellectual study of Buddhism. In a Fall 2000 special issue of Turning Wheel: The Journal of Socially Engaged Buddhism dedicated to addressing the underrepresentation of “Buddhists of Asian Descent in the U.S.,” guest editors Maia Duerr and Mushim Ikeda shared the following reflection:Not long ago, a prominent European-American Buddhist related that during a trip to Japan, she discovered that she knew more about Zen than most Japanese. This innocent remark reflects some all-too-common perceptions often held by non-Asian Buddhists: that they are “more knowledgeable” about Buddhism, that they practice “real” Buddhism, as opposed to “folk” Buddhism.Indeed, Asian and Asian American Buddhist practices have often been dismissed as superstitious, inauthentic (yet authentically exotic!) forms of Buddhism. In mainstream white American Buddhist conversations, white Buddhists are often heralded as the erudite saviors and purifiers of Buddhism. This perspective exemplifies the subtle enactments and overwhelming hubris of white supremacy. In positioning a certain type of Buddhism (white) as better than other kinds of Buddhism (Asian, “folk,” “baggage Buddhism”), the white ownership of Buddhism is claimed through delegitimizing the validity and long history of our traditions, then appropriating the practices on the pretext of performing them more correctly.The assertion of white authority goes hand in hand with the mainstream erasure of the contributions of Asian and Asian American Buddhists in the development of Buddhism in the U.S. Perhaps the most public example of such erasure was demonstrated in the in the early 1990s when Tricycle editor Helen Tworkov stated, “The spokespeople for Buddhism in America have been, almost exclusively, educated members of the white middle class.… Asian American Buddhists … so far … have not figured prominently in the development of something called American Buddhism.” Rev. Ryo Imamura, an 18th-generation Buddhist priest in the Jodo Shinshu tradition, responded with a letter to the editor:I would like to point out that it was my grandparents and other immigrants from Asia who brought and implanted Buddhism in American soil over 100 years ago despite white American intolerance and bigotry. It was my American-born parents and their generation who courageously and diligently fostered the growth of American Buddhism despite having to practice discretely in hidden ethnic temples and in concentration camps because of the same white intolerance and bigotry. It was us Asian Buddhists who welcomed countless white Americans into our temples, introduced them to the Dharma, and often assisted them to initiate their own Sanghas when they felt uncomfortable practicing with us…Rev. Imamura was speaking from a particular place, that intersecting space of being Asian American and Buddhist in a country maintained by white domination. He was born during World War II in the Gila River incarceration camp in Arizona. Like the Kimuras and more than 120,000 other Japanese Americans on the West Coast, the Imamuras were forced into barren camps because of the “suspicious” nature of their culture and spirituality. Behind barbed wires, in the face of constant threat by armed sentry, the Imamuras persisted in their Buddhist practice. They continued to aid other members of their community on their path of liberation from suffering, especially the daily suffering of incarceration and white domination.This was their American Buddhism.Rev. Imamura was also speaking quite literally. After their incarceration, his father and mother, Rev. Kanmo and Jane Imamura, established the Buddhist Study Center of Berkeley, where they hosted eminent teachers and welcomed Asian, Asian American, and white practitioners alike. Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, and Alan Watts were among the “countless white Americans” who learned about Buddhism from their study groups. The lectures and events were all free of charge, including the hot tea and pastries set out by Jane Imamura to welcome the attendees. It is important to note that Jane’s father, Rev. Issei Matsuura, was one of the first Buddhist priests to be arrested by the FBI and imprisoned at the start of World War II. As a priest, he was viewed as an especially dangerous threat to national security. That the Imamura family would go on to openly and freely share the buddhadharma in America after being imprisoned by the U.S. government for their cultural/spiritual beliefs is a notable example of the ways in which Asian American Buddhists have labored to maintain their practice and make it available to others, despite white supremacy. Yet the Imamuras’ historical contribution in cultivating a new generation of American Buddhists—including white Buddhists—were left out of the mainstream conversation on Buddhism. Rev. Ryo Imamura’s letter was rejected from Tricycle and never published.[May, 2017 update: Noting Rev. Imamura’s request upon sending his letter — “Please do not reprint this letter in Tricycle if you do not print it in its entirety” — Funie Hsu and Buddhist Peace Fellowship have now reproduced it online, writing, “25 years later, the Buddhist Peace Fellowship is honored to be able to publish the letter in its complete, uncensored form. […] By making the full letter available online, we hope to spark conversation and enable Asian American Buddhists to find community and know, in the epistemological sense, that we have always existed. And that we have resisted.” Read it here.]This is but one example of the ongoing reality of Asian and Asian American Buddhist erasure. It is evident that the cultural appropriation of Buddhism operates on a framework that holds that our spirituality can only be made safe through white ownership.To be clear, Buddhism belongs to all sentient beings. Even so, Asians and Asian American Buddhists have a rightful, distinct historical claim to Buddhism. It has been rooted in our cultures for thousands of years. When it is said that Buddhism has been practiced for over 2,500 years, it is important to consider who has been persistently maintaining the practice for millennia: Asians, and more recently, Asian Americans. It is because of our physical, emotional, and spiritual labor, our diligent cultivation of the practice through time and through histories of oppression, that Buddhism has persisted to the current time period and can be shared with non-Asian practitioners. This is historical fact.To not acknowledge the labor and contributions of Asian American Buddhists in the development of American Buddhism is simply cultural appropriation.Everyone can benefit from reflecting on cultural appropriation as a way to deepen our Buddhist practice. We can do this by using the five precepts as a guide. One teacher I study with stresses that the precepts are not merely about refraining from certain actions (no killing, no stealing, and so on); equally as important, they are about proactive efforts we can take to foster our spiritual development. The precept directing no stealing, for example, should be understood as both not taking what is not yours or what is not freely given and as actively practicing dana, or generosity. We can apply this approach to the issue of cultural appropriation.In order to alleviate the suffering caused by cultural appropriation, we can refrain from asserting ownership of a free teaching that belongs to all. We can refrain from asserting false authority and superiority over those who have diligently maintained the practice to share freely with others. And we can actively work to give dana by expressing gratitude for the Asian and Asian American Buddhists who have shared their indigenous ways of being as integral expressions of their practice.We can reflect on our tone in speaking about our knowledge of Buddhism and our relationship to it. We can ask two simple questions: First, am I asserting a sense of superiority over others, especially Asian and Asian American Buddhists, with my Buddhist practice? And am I using my Buddhist practice as a source of special distinction?For white practitioners in particular, you can also mindfully investigate the emotions that arise when issues of cultural appropriation are brought to your attention. Robin DiAngelo writes about the concept of “white fragility,” a set of emotions—including anger, defensiveness, guilt, and more—that often accompany the thoughts of white people when they are forced to confront the reality of white supremacy. This concept can be helpful for white Buddhists in thinking about the false self and possible attachments to protecting the ego. Deep contemplation on this can help shatter the fragility of the false self and the delusion of racial colorblindness.Dana as gratitude might include intentional efforts to center the histories of Asian and Asian American Buddhists in your sanghas; that work might be informed by facilitating reading groups or inviting Asian American Buddhist scholars and practitioners to speak. A white practitioner could choose to attend an Asian-dominant sangha and learn from a teacher who is not white. And we can all actively assert the need for consistent incorporation of Asian and Asian American Buddhist perspectives and leadership roles in popular Buddhist magazines, organizations, and conferences.Advocating for the centrality of Asian and Asian American Buddhists is definitely not to say that we practice the most authentic, perfect form of Buddhism; in fact, a different form of racism can also exist in Asian sanghas, one that’s directed at non-Asian People of Color. Dana, then, might also look like a mutual fostering of conversations about how we can combat interpersonal racism toward each other in our communities and sanghas. Recently, a few members of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship have begun to initiate such conversations as part of what the organization calls Radical Rebirth—a set of guiding principles that have restructured BPF’s work to mobilize against systemic oppression, grow compassionate direct action, and actively seek racial justice, among other engaged projects.Finally, for those of us who are Asian or Asian American, we, too, must examine our role in other forms of cultural appropriation. It is not enough to argue for our centrality in American Buddhism. We have an obligation to examine our own participation in white supremacy in all areas of our lives. We must have conversations in our sanghas about actively supporting our dharma family of color, especially when the violent suffering of Black Americans continues to be so blatant.Though the Kimura family’s treasure has now been lost to the soil of the earth, the historical context of its burial illuminates the brilliance of the triple gem (Buddha, dharma, and sangha) as a path for liberation. In the U.S., that path includes the liberation of suffering from white supremacy. This is American Buddhism.This piece originally appeared on Lion’s Roar. "

Scholar and Soto Zen priest Duncan Ryuken Williams tells the story of 10-year-old Masumi Kimura and her family. Like many other Japanese American families living in California before World War II, the Kimuras were farmers, tilling soil and developing irrigation systems for land that had long been dismissed as inarable by white Americans. They were also Buddhist, part of the earliest organized Buddhist community in America. Because of their ethnic and religious background, especially Mr. Kimura’s leadership role at the local temple, the family was deemed suspect by the FBI following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.Williams details the day that Masumi came home “to find her father pinned on the ground and an agent holding a gun to her mother’s head.” After further questioning by the FBI, the agents left. Mr. Kimura, anxious to protect his family from further violence, instructed Masumi to prepare a fire in the bath furnace. He gathered all of the family belongings that had Japanese writing or any trace of Japaneseness and threw them into the fire. “However,” Williams writes, “her father hesitated with a few items.”Masumi remembers that her father set aside minutes from board meetings and other temple documents from the Madeira Buddhist Temple, the family’s bound edition of the Buddhist scriptures…Wrapping the Buddhist scriptures and the temple records in the kimono cloth and placing them in the tin boxes, Masumi’s father carefully lowered them into the hole and covered them with dirt. It was safer to bury these items than to keep them. -“Lessons from the Internment of Japanese-Americans,” Dharma World MagazineGiven the hostile anti-Japanese sentiment sanctioned by the federal government, the Kimuras were left with little option but to burn or bury any signs of their spiritual and cultural difference.The Kimura family’s experience demonstrates merely one historic example of the ways in which Asian and Asian American Buddhists have long been viewed with violent suspicion for our cultural and spiritual differences. Though our communities are diverse and complex ― including Central Asians, South Asians, Southeast Asians, East Asians, and Pacific Islanders ― our experience of exclusion in regard to the representation of our spirituality is shared. For Buddhists of Asian ancestry living in the United States, being Buddhist has historically been tied to racial assumptions that have marked us as “perpetually foreign.” These differences have been used to systematically violate our civil rights and exclude us from society in significant ways.White supremacy, the system of power behind the suspicion and exclusion of Asian and Asian American Buddhists, is the same system that justified the founding and building of the U.S. through the genocide of indigenous peoples and the labor of enslaved Africans. Undeniably, America has been created by excluding people whose differences were deemed inferior ― a process known as racial othering ― so as to establish a seemingly natural superiority of white people.White supremacy has systematically alienated Asian and Asian American Buddhist communities and diminished the validity of our relationship to Buddhism in the U.S. The erasure and exclusion of our communities is not merely about a lack of inclusion; to put it so simply would be dismissive of the facts of history. The exclusion of Asian and Asian American Buddhists from conversations on American Buddhism is cultural appropriation. It renders invisible our foundational role in establishing and maintaining Buddhism in America despite white supremacy. Thus, such erasure denies our right to claim our deep and specific connection ― indeed, our centrality ― to American Buddhism. It appropriates our historical authority in order to promote the white ownership of an indigenous Asian practice for liberation.The same process of white supremacy has created an American culture in which other practitioners, namely white practitioners, have been granted the freedom to be Buddhist in safer and more public ways. Moreover, instead of facing systemic injustice for embracing a spirituality that departs from the Judeo-Christian norm, white Buddhists are often lauded for this difference. They may attain a certain cultural capital for their practice, for donning Buddhist symbols and using dharma names in Asian languages, all of which mark them with distinction as “interesting,” perhaps even “worldly”—anything but “suspect” or “foreign.”This is white supremacy and privilege in Buddhism.Most conversations about cultural appropriation in Buddhism revolve around the outward symbols and signs of the practice: beads, tattoos, statues, and so on. But an important element of the appropriation occurs through the assumed occupation of white authority status, often legitimized through the intellectual study of Buddhism. In a Fall 2000 special issue of Turning Wheel: The Journal of Socially Engaged Buddhism dedicated to addressing the underrepresentation of “Buddhists of Asian Descent in the U.S.,” guest editors Maia Duerr and Mushim Ikeda shared the following reflection:Not long ago, a prominent European-American Buddhist related that during a trip to Japan, she discovered that she knew more about Zen than most Japanese. This innocent remark reflects some all-too-common perceptions often held by non-Asian Buddhists: that they are “more knowledgeable” about Buddhism, that they practice “real” Buddhism, as opposed to “folk” Buddhism.Indeed, Asian and Asian American Buddhist practices have often been dismissed as superstitious, inauthentic (yet authentically exotic!) forms of Buddhism. In mainstream white American Buddhist conversations, white Buddhists are often heralded as the erudite saviors and purifiers of Buddhism. This perspective exemplifies the subtle enactments and overwhelming hubris of white supremacy. In positioning a certain type of Buddhism (white) as better than other kinds of Buddhism (Asian, “folk,” “baggage Buddhism”), the white ownership of Buddhism is claimed through delegitimizing the validity and long history of our traditions, then appropriating the practices on the pretext of performing them more correctly.The assertion of white authority goes hand in hand with the mainstream erasure of the contributions of Asian and Asian American Buddhists in the development of Buddhism in the U.S. Perhaps the most public example of such erasure was demonstrated in the in the early 1990s when Tricycle editor Helen Tworkov stated, “The spokespeople for Buddhism in America have been, almost exclusively, educated members of the white middle class.… Asian American Buddhists … so far … have not figured prominently in the development of something called American Buddhism.” Rev. Ryo Imamura, an 18th-generation Buddhist priest in the Jodo Shinshu tradition, responded with a letter to the editor:I would like to point out that it was my grandparents and other immigrants from Asia who brought and implanted Buddhism in American soil over 100 years ago despite white American intolerance and bigotry. It was my American-born parents and their generation who courageously and diligently fostered the growth of American Buddhism despite having to practice discretely in hidden ethnic temples and in concentration camps because of the same white intolerance and bigotry. It was us Asian Buddhists who welcomed countless white Americans into our temples, introduced them to the Dharma, and often assisted them to initiate their own Sanghas when they felt uncomfortable practicing with us…Rev. Imamura was speaking from a particular place, that intersecting space of being Asian American and Buddhist in a country maintained by white domination. He was born during World War II in the Gila River incarceration camp in Arizona. Like the Kimuras and more than 120,000 other Japanese Americans on the West Coast, the Imamuras were forced into barren camps because of the “suspicious” nature of their culture and spirituality. Behind barbed wires, in the face of constant threat by armed sentry, the Imamuras persisted in their Buddhist practice. They continued to aid other members of their community on their path of liberation from suffering, especially the daily suffering of incarceration and white domination.This was their American Buddhism.Rev. Imamura was also speaking quite literally. After their incarceration, his father and mother, Rev. Kanmo and Jane Imamura, established the Buddhist Study Center of Berkeley, where they hosted eminent teachers and welcomed Asian, Asian American, and white practitioners alike. Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, and Alan Watts were among the “countless white Americans” who learned about Buddhism from their study groups. The lectures and events were all free of charge, including the hot tea and pastries set out by Jane Imamura to welcome the attendees. It is important to note that Jane’s father, Rev. Issei Matsuura, was one of the first Buddhist priests to be arrested by the FBI and imprisoned at the start of World War II. As a priest, he was viewed as an especially dangerous threat to national security. That the Imamura family would go on to openly and freely share the buddhadharma in America after being imprisoned by the U.S. government for their cultural/spiritual beliefs is a notable example of the ways in which Asian American Buddhists have labored to maintain their practice and make it available to others, despite white supremacy. Yet the Imamuras’ historical contribution in cultivating a new generation of American Buddhists—including white Buddhists—were left out of the mainstream conversation on Buddhism. Rev. Ryo Imamura’s letter was rejected from Tricycle and never published.[May, 2017 update: Noting Rev. Imamura’s request upon sending his letter — “Please do not reprint this letter in Tricycle if you do not print it in its entirety” — Funie Hsu and Buddhist Peace Fellowship have now reproduced it online, writing, “25 years later, the Buddhist Peace Fellowship is honored to be able to publish the letter in its complete, uncensored form. […] By making the full letter available online, we hope to spark conversation and enable Asian American Buddhists to find community and know, in the epistemological sense, that we have always existed. And that we have resisted.” Read it here.]This is but one example of the ongoing reality of Asian and Asian American Buddhist erasure. It is evident that the cultural appropriation of Buddhism operates on a framework that holds that our spirituality can only be made safe through white ownership.To be clear, Buddhism belongs to all sentient beings. Even so, Asians and Asian American Buddhists have a rightful, distinct historical claim to Buddhism. It has been rooted in our cultures for thousands of years. When it is said that Buddhism has been practiced for over 2,500 years, it is important to consider who has been persistently maintaining the practice for millennia: Asians, and more recently, Asian Americans. It is because of our physical, emotional, and spiritual labor, our diligent cultivation of the practice through time and through histories of oppression, that Buddhism has persisted to the current time period and can be shared with non-Asian practitioners. This is historical fact.To not acknowledge the labor and contributions of Asian American Buddhists in the development of American Buddhism is simply cultural appropriation.Everyone can benefit from reflecting on cultural appropriation as a way to deepen our Buddhist practice. We can do this by using the five precepts as a guide. One teacher I study with stresses that the precepts are not merely about refraining from certain actions (no killing, no stealing, and so on); equally as important, they are about proactive efforts we can take to foster our spiritual development. The precept directing no stealing, for example, should be understood as both not taking what is not yours or what is not freely given and as actively practicing dana, or generosity. We can apply this approach to the issue of cultural appropriation.In order to alleviate the suffering caused by cultural appropriation, we can refrain from asserting ownership of a free teaching that belongs to all. We can refrain from asserting false authority and superiority over those who have diligently maintained the practice to share freely with others. And we can actively work to give dana by expressing gratitude for the Asian and Asian American Buddhists who have shared their indigenous ways of being as integral expressions of their practice.We can reflect on our tone in speaking about our knowledge of Buddhism and our relationship to it. We can ask two simple questions: First, am I asserting a sense of superiority over others, especially Asian and Asian American Buddhists, with my Buddhist practice? And am I using my Buddhist practice as a source of special distinction?For white practitioners in particular, you can also mindfully investigate the emotions that arise when issues of cultural appropriation are brought to your attention. Robin DiAngelo writes about the concept of “white fragility,” a set of emotions—including anger, defensiveness, guilt, and more—that often accompany the thoughts of white people when they are forced to confront the reality of white supremacy. This concept can be helpful for white Buddhists in thinking about the false self and possible attachments to protecting the ego. Deep contemplation on this can help shatter the fragility of the false self and the delusion of racial colorblindness.Dana as gratitude might include intentional efforts to center the histories of Asian and Asian American Buddhists in your sanghas; that work might be informed by facilitating reading groups or inviting Asian American Buddhist scholars and practitioners to speak. A white practitioner could choose to attend an Asian-dominant sangha and learn from a teacher who is not white. And we can all actively assert the need for consistent incorporation of Asian and Asian American Buddhist perspectives and leadership roles in popular Buddhist magazines, organizations, and conferences.Advocating for the centrality of Asian and Asian American Buddhists is definitely not to say that we practice the most authentic, perfect form of Buddhism; in fact, a different form of racism can also exist in Asian sanghas, one that’s directed at non-Asian People of Color. Dana, then, might also look like a mutual fostering of conversations about how we can combat interpersonal racism toward each other in our communities and sanghas. Recently, a few members of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship have begun to initiate such conversations as part of what the organization calls Radical Rebirth—a set of guiding principles that have restructured BPF’s work to mobilize against systemic oppression, grow compassionate direct action, and actively seek racial justice, among other engaged projects.Finally, for those of us who are Asian or Asian American, we, too, must examine our role in other forms of cultural appropriation. It is not enough to argue for our centrality in American Buddhism. We have an obligation to examine our own participation in white supremacy in all areas of our lives. We must have conversations in our sanghas about actively supporting our dharma family of color, especially when the violent suffering of Black Americans continues to be so blatant.Though the Kimura family’s treasure has now been lost to the soil of the earth, the historical context of its burial illuminates the brilliance of the triple gem (Buddha, dharma, and sangha) as a path for liberation. In the U.S., that path includes the liberation of suffering from white supremacy. This is American Buddhism.This piece originally appeared on Lion’s Roar. "

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inauguration-trial-james-okeefe-project-veritas_us_5a1ee55be4b017a311ebc0fe,A video shot by Project Veritas takes center stage in the ongoing felony prosecution of six individuals caught up in a mass arrest on Inauguration Day.,2017-11-29,"James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, dodges questions about a woman who falsely claimed in interviews with The Washington Post that U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a teen. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1ee59e140000f03ab6a69e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The background of conservative activist James O’Keefe came under scrutiny in D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday morning, as prosecutors continued to seek felony convictions for six individuals swept up in a mass arrest on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration.Defense attorneys for those facing felony conspiracy counts pressed Bryan Adelmeyer of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department about the background of Project Veritas. The conservative organization, which O’Keefe founded, has launched sting operations against liberals and news organizations, and has been accused of deceptive editing practices.Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, which is part of the Justice Department, are highlighting a video shot by a Project Veritas operative wearing a button camera. The video shows a planning meeting for a protest on Inauguration Day. Prosecutors have not alleged that any of the six people currently on trial actually caused any damage ahead of Trump’s inauguration, when smashed business windows in downtown D.C. caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage. Instead, they allege that they ― and the 181 others whose felony trials are scheduled ― were part of a conspiracy and should be held accountable for the conduct of others in the group. More than 200 people, including several journalists, were caught up in a mass arrest that day, when demonstrators seeking to disrupt Trump’s inauguration gathered, many of them wearing black. Adelmeyer testified on Wednesday that he provided a false name when he infiltrated a protest-planning meeting held in a church basement in early January. Adelmeyer, who has been on the force for nearly a decade, said his main priority was to find out about “criminal actions masked by First Amendment activities.” He said he told his supervisors that he believed protest organizers intended to be “non-violent, but confrontational” on the day of the inauguration. He testified that he took brief notes about the meeting he attended.Adelmeyer testified that he showed up to the protest in an undercover capacity on Jan. 20 wearing black pants and a zip-up black hoodie, but that he never joined up with protesters because he wasn’t allowed to be involved in criminal activity. Adelmeyer said he later found out that a Project Veritas operative had been at the same meeting. The operative had filmed a video that was played for jurors on Tuesday, despite objections from defense attorneys. Adelmeyer testified Wednesday that he didn’t “really follow” Project Veritas before he learned about the video.“I never really heard of them before, honestly,” he said. Adelmeyer initially didn’t recall James O’Keefe’s name. But he admitted that he believed the group “side[s] very far to one side, specifically the right.”Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff objected when defense attorney Jamie Heine asked Adelmeyer if he knew that O’Keefe “broke into the office of a Democratic senator.” But following a conference at the bench, Judge Lynn Leibovitz allowed a version of the question to proceed: Heine asked Adelmeyer whether he knew that O’Keefe had pleaded guilty to entry by false pretenses, a reference to O’Keefe pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count in connection with an incident at the office of Sen. Mary Landrieu. Adelmeyer said he wasn’t familiar with that incident, but referenced a separate incident he said he believed he’d read about.Adelmeyer also testified that he had read about Project Veritas’ attempted sting operation aimed at The Washington Post, in which an operative associated with the organization unsuccessfully tried to trick the paper into printing a false allegation against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. He said he had read that Project Veritas had been criticized for splicing together videos, but maintained that the video shown Tuesday was an accurate representation of what he’d seen at the protest-planning meeting.Sara Kropf, an attorney representing one of the defendants, introduced to the jury the idea that Project Veritas had planted other individuals at the planning meeting and had them speak during it. Adelmeyer said it was possible that another Project Veritas operative had been in the room.The jury, which has been sitting on the case for nearly two weeks, has heard from employees at businesses where windows were smashed on the morning of Jan. 20. Additional officers are expected to testify in the coming days. The trial is anticipated to stretch into the next two weeks.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs. Have a tip?

Widodo saw Metallica in concert in Jakarta in 2013.No doubt Widodo will now give the gift, which was also signed by the band’s Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich, a welcome home.“Prime Minister Rasmussen understands my favorite [music],” said Widodo, per The Jakarta Post. Rasmussen tweeted that Widodo “seemed eager to dig into” the collection, which was released earlier this month.It’s sad but true that some diplomatic souvenirs can be deemed boring, such as U.S. President Barack Obama’s gift of 25 classic American movies to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2009.But beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and Rasmussen appeared to be equally thrilled with Widodo’s present of a traditional dagger.Ulrich said the presentation of his group’s music to Widodo was “way cool.”“Music really does connect people!!!” he added on Instagram."

With the debut of his first middle-grade novel last week, he can add fiction writer to that list. The Magic Misfits follows a young street magician named Carter who teams up with a group of other “misfits” to stand up against villains and go on adventures. The book, published by Little, Brown and Company, is set to be the first in a four-part series.In honor of The Magic Misfits’ release, Harris spoke to HuffPost about his writing process, parenthood and more. The actor released his memoir, Neil Patrick Harris: Choose Your Own Autobiography, in 2014, but The Magic Misfits is his first foray into fiction and the young reader genre.“In my upbringing, I was a voracious reader,” Harris said. “When I was 9 or 10 years old, I lived in a bookshop in the small town I grew up in.”Reading has remained an important part of his life, especially since he became a father. Harris and his husband, David Burtka, have 7-year-old twins, Gideon and Harper.“We’ve read to them since they came home from the hospital,” Harris said. “We read to them every night.”“I think the world in which you exist expands greatly through reading about new places and new experiences,” he added. “We’re all creatures of habit ― we go to the same restaurants and travel in the same vehicles to the same places. But when you get to read a book, you’re suddenly entirely in a new world, whether it’s real or created. And from that, you can learn so many things.”The Magic Misfits is intended for readers ages 8 to 12, but Harris said his original idea was to create a picture book.“David and I read books to our children, and mostly they’re picture books ― large format, maybe 40 pages and lots of pictures,” he said. “I thought it would be great to create something that [my kids] could read, and kids their age could read, that would be an exciting adventure, that would be in their vocabulary and that would teach them new words and perhaps a bit of sense of humor. And I hoped it could also teach them magic tricks, teach them good lessons about friendship and perseverance and inclusion.”But after doing some research, Harris decided it would be more exciting to write for his kids’ future selves.Still, the lessons in the book are meaningful for people of all ages. One message is tied to the name of the series, which Harris said was inspired by Ed Alonzo, a magician friend of his who goes by the name The Misfit of Magic. “In the book, you have these ‘misfits’ who are joined by their love of magic, not the otherworldly warlock magic but magician magic ― magic with cards and coins,” he said. “And through their appreciation of learning that and through their individuality, they actually become stronger when they’re together. So it includes messages of strength in honesty. Honesty is important, being proud of what makes you different is important, taking responsibility is important.”Harris is thoughtful when it comes to teaching his own children lessons of honesty, friendship and inclusion. “They’re at the age that they’re starting to question most everything, and I think our job as parents, as fathers, is being honest, constantly honest,” he said. “We use our vocabulary very specifically so that when they ask a question, we won’t lie. They’ll know that they can come to us for actual truths.”Still, he added, there are some challenges with that approach.“It’s a tricky thing to do because sometimes you can’t be too blunt with the truth. You have to word yourself in particular ways,” he said. “If they ask about certain mythical holiday figurative people, for example, you just can’t be blunt.”Ultimately, Harris said he tries not to be too formal in his parenting approach.“I find that I’m in a constant state of educating them in a conversational way ― not sitting them down and telling them life lessons, but folding things that I’ve learned into the conversation so that they may have their own ah-ha moment without realizing that I might be trying to nudge them toward that,” he said. The Magic Misfits includes twin characters named Izzy and Olly, but Harris said they are not based on his kids. “The twins are clever, but they have no relation to our actual kids,” he said. “They’re more an appreciation for Marx brothers, verbal comedy, George Burns and Gracie Allen. That’s the kind of old-school repartee I thought would be funny in a modern-day book.” Harris said Harper and Gideon aren’t quite old enough to perform their own magic tricks. “To perform magic, you really have to have the ability to keep a secret, patience and the skills from practicing,” he explained. “Because with most magic tricks ― at least for kids ― once you show the kids the secret, that excites them, but then all they want to do is show everyone else the secret.” “I’ve performed for them a little bit. They think I have some sort of magical powers and abilities beyond what I actually have. I like to be able to lord that power over them,” he joked.Harris also told HuffPost about some of his own favorite children’s books.“I was a huge Roald Dahl fan growing up. I just really enjoyed his acerbic sense of humor combined with his fantastical story ideas,” he said, adding that he also enjoyed Bridge to Terabithia, Choose Your Own Adventure books, and the Encyclopedia Brown and Hardy Boys series.“Reading is, as someone once said, fundamental,” Harris said.

In addition to having “credible martial arts skills, the ability to speak English,” and “star quality,” the directors were specifically looking for someone who was “ethnically Chinese” to play the title character, Hua Mulan.Liu is one of China’s most popular actresses.

Whitewashing Asian roles in Hollywood has long been an issue, with recent cases including western adaptations of Japanese works “Ghost in the Shell” and “Death Note.” After speculation that the new Mulan would be yet another whitewashing victim or otherwise miscast, seeing Liu Yifei get the role is a relief.For those unfamiliar with the plot of “Mulan,” Disney’s 1998 animated film is loosely based on the tale of legendary woman warrior Hua Mulan, featured in the sixth-century poem “The Ballad of Mulan.” The animated version follows a young woman who disguises herself as a man to take her ailing father’s place in the army in fifth-century China.You can currently find the movie on Netflix.We’ll be watching it repeatedly until the live-action film comes out in 2019."

The usual loud Christmas music and bright lights are turned down. Only eight kids with sensory challenges are allowed per time slot. They can participate in arts and crafts, and take home a photo with Santa.

It took his parents 18 months to obtain a formal diagnosis.Thanks to “a lot of therapy,” Magro said, he grew up to be someone who now advocates for others with autism and, through his nonprofit, gives scholarships to students with autism to pursue higher education.

They can participate in arts and crafts, and take home a photo with Santa. An occupational therapist, a speech therapist and a physical therapist ― possibly dressed as Santa’s elves ― are also on site.As for “Santa,” he lets the kids take their time and pays attention to their different levels of development.“We don’t want them to feel rushed. We don’t want them to feel overloaded,” Magro told HuffPost. “We just want to make it a labor of love.”Magro describes his own childhood as “a time when a lot of people just really had no idea what autism was.” He was nonverbal until he was 2-and-a-half years old and struggled with sensory challenges. It took his parents 18 months to obtain a formal diagnosis.Thanks to “a lot of therapy,” Magro said, he grew up to be someone who now advocates for others with autism and, through his nonprofit, gives scholarships to students with autism to pursue higher education. Magro described the Santa event as a “big, big deal” for his community in New Jersey and credited local residents for helping make it a success.He said that dressed as Santa, he has witnessed “some really cute moments” over the last few years. One child even shared that his Christmas wish was for Magro to come hang out with him ― dressed as Santa, of course.“We’re still in contact with the family today,” Magro said.For more information about this Santa event, head to KFM Making a Difference’s Facebook event. There is no cost to attend, although donations are welcome."
29,WOMEN,"It’s Not Too Late, Ivanka","Judy Gearhart, ContributorExecutive Director, International Labor Rights Forum",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-not-too-late-ivanka_us_5a1de9dfe4b0f5a162720cd9,It is long past due for the government official to wield her influence in defense of women.,2017-11-28,"<p>An <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/ivanka-trump"">Ivanka Trump</a> billboard in India that reads “When Women Succeed, We All Succeed.”</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1debc1150000290085a552.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Ivanka Trump attends the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India this week, she will speak as a representative of the U.S. government with experience as an entrepreneur, but not as a representative of the apparel company she founded, with wholesale revenues of $47 million and production orders in India and around the globe. It’s not clear which role, however, is better for helping Ms. Trump advance her stated mission of “empowering women.” Whichever role she chooses, she has much more power than she has so far exercised to advance women’s rights and welfare. We can only hope she finds enlightenment while in India.Ivanka Trump’s brand has not taken much of a stand for the rights of the mostly women workers in its supply chain. Despite promises made in July, by the company CEO Abigail Klem, the company did not respond to a Washington Post request for a progress update. Meanwhile, Ivanka Trump herself has said that because of her White House role, she “has been advised that she cannot ask the government to act in an issue involving the brand in any way, constraining her ability to intervene personally.” These excuses, and the radio silence that’s followed, are not encouraging signs.Yet surely, Ms. Trump can do more for women workers in her role as government advisor. Perhaps, it was too much for her to try to block the Trump administration’s war on Obama-era policies ― even those that were designed to advance women’s equity ― initiatives he decimated such as paid family sick leave, funding under the Violence Against Women Act and protections for survivors of sexual violence in college. The policies that Ivanka herself has championed, such as maternity leave policies that exclude fathers and adoptive parents, are widely predicted to hurt efforts to achieve pay equity for women.For women workers globally, Ivanka Trump has remained silent and appears unaware of the Trump administration’s apparent lack of support for a new ILO Convention on Violence against Women and Men in the World of Work. The proposed convention would establish a global human rights standard that would address gender-based violence at work. This is a critical initiative to ensure sexual harassment and sexual violence at work is taken up in global human rights norms in a way that drives legal reforms in countries around the world.As Representative Jan Schakowsky, who introduced the Violence against Women Act, wrote in July: “Gender-based violence is an impediment to women’s economic empowerment, and its prevention is critical to establishing safe, productive and healthy workplaces for all.” The World Health Organization reports that one in three women will experience sexual violence in her lifetime. According to the United Nations, 40-50 percent of EU women experience unwanted sexual advances, harassment or physical contact at work. In some countries where the problem has been studied less, the statistic may be even worse.Ivanka may be constrained from speaking for her brand, but there is no reason she could not be advancing legal policies and reform initiatives designed to ensure women workers are protected and able to access remedy when their rights are violated. For a woman committed to “promoting greater opportunit[ies] for women around the world”, she needs to seize this opportunity before it is too late.Unfortunately, Ivanka’s keynote speech in India, “Women First, Prosperity For All,” indicates the kind of approach that views women as the means to development as opposed to one that is focused first and foremost on women’s rights as human rights. Her speech highlights that resources for women entrepreneurs are necessary so that “our families, our economies, and our societies reach their fullest potential.” What’s missing here is a focus on advancing the rights of all women, not just expanding financing for women entrepreneurs who aspire to be like her.It’s not too late. Ivanka may be focused on connecting with other women entrepreneurs and business leaders, yet there is every reason for her to meet with the women who work in India’s burgeoning apparel sector so she can hear firsthand about the struggles they face in securing their rights and welfare ― and by extension that of their families. Ivanka Trump, whether acting as a global entrepreneur or as a U.S. government advisor, has tremendous potential to help turn the tide and create permanent preventive solutions to the pervasive sexual violence endured by women everywhere. But she needs to act now."
30,POLITICS,Senate Republicans Looking To Play 'Let's Make A Deal' On Tax Cuts,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-tax-reform_us_5a1cb40be4b0e2ddcbb22c61,Will the holdouts actually hold out?,2017-11-28,The vote of Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) on the tax cut bill could be one of the toughest gets for the Republican leadership.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1cb506150000a74d85a19b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans are moving quickly toward a vote on their tax proposal this week, with GOP leaders still tweaking the bill to win over reluctant Republicans.On Monday, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) became the second GOP senator to say he would oppose the measure over provisions governing pass-through businesses. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has also said he believes the requirements for who would get a lower pass-through tax rate is too restrictive.There are a number of other senators who seem to have serious reservations about the bill, and, if every Democrat votes no, as expected, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can lose no more than two Republicans to pass the bill (with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie on legislation subject to a special budget process that requires only a simple majority). But the opposition is soft, and GOP leaders have shown a willingness to make whatever change is necessary to get the bill out of their chamber.“I assume this is one of those things that you keep adjusting until it’s at the right place and you have the votes to pass it,” Senate GOP conference vice chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told HuffPost on Monday.Blunt said the issues that Johnson and Daines have raised were worth talking about, and he assumed there was some work-around that would get them on board. Johnson and Daines are typically reliable Republican votes who likely will support the tax proposal in its final form.The bigger questions for GOP leaders are senators including Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). Corker ― and some other Republicans, such as James Lankford (R-Okla.) ― have expressed concern over the amount of debt the bill would produce. McCain’s issue has been the process, and even though he’s said he’s been happy generally with the process for this bill, he has noted that the measure keeps changing. And Collins and Murkowski have shown some reservations about voting to kill the individual mandate for Obamacare, which the Senate bill would do in order to pay for more tax cuts.Collins and Murkowski were tight-lipped Monday, but Murkowski has shown some willingness to vote for the tax proposal ― even if it includes the individual mandate repeal ― as long as the bill also opens up parts of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and natural gas drilling.Republicans ultimately haven’t decided whether the final version of the bill will include the Obamacare mandate repeal, but there are issues either way. If they don’t include the repeal, they would have $338 billion less for the deductions and tax cuts that they want in their bill. If it is included, that could endanger the support of Collins and Murkowski. When Blunt was asked whether he thought the individual mandate repeal would be in the final bill, he said yes, shakily.“I think it still will be, but, you know, it depends on where the votes are. It all depends on where the votes are,” he told HuffPost.In many ways, Corker’s vote could be tougher than anyone else’s ― if he sticks to the principles he laid down at the outset of the tax reform debate.The retiring Republican said he would vote no if the bill added money to the debt. But he has already shown a willingness to accept some budget gimmicks to justify the cost of the bill. For one, Corker is open to taking a baseline of the bill that wouldn’t account for expiring measures being reauthorized. The cost of extending the measures that are technically temporary could be more than $500 billion over 10 years. There is also the matter of which analysis Corker uses for the bill. A Tax Foundation score said the $1.5 trillion cost of the bill would be offset by about $1.26 trillion in economic growth. That analysis is far more optimistic than others.Corker reported Monday that he was working with other Republican senators and the Trump administration to “trigger” tax increases if the revenue that Republicans project is not there. Until the issue is resolved, however, Corker said he said he “very possibly” could vote against the tax proposal in the Budget Committee if there is not a fix.“I’m not threatening anything,” Corker said. “I’m just saying that it’s very important for me to know that we got this resolved.”The Budget Committee is expected to report the bill out either Tuesday or Wednesday, and Republicans hold only a one-vote majority on the panel, so Corker could delay the bill if he votes no. (Johnson is also on the Budget Committee, so he could also slow down the measure.)Republicans could just bring the bill to the floor without a committee markup, like they did with their health care legislation, but that might raise some red procedural flags with McCain.Republicans could very well find a way to convince lawmakers to support the legislation in committee with promises that it will change later on the floor. The problem for leaders is that the changes some of these senators want could either explode the cost of the bill or threaten support with other lawmakers.Opening up who gets the lower pass-through rate could be very expensive and potentially allow individuals at the current top tax rate of 39.6 percent to restructure how they’re paid so that they become a small business or limited liability corporation. And the trigger clawback could present problems for other Republicans who believe strongly in tax cuts and want them to be permanent no matter the effect on the deficit.On either side, leaders are balancing the concerns of other Republicans against each other, with their bias going toward whatever can pass. That gives individual Republicans a great deal of leverage over the current negotiations, and while leaders would almost certainly like to get the bill out of the Senate as soon as possible, some Republicans might figure out that this is their opportunity to actually change the bill and slow the whole process down.

31,ARTS & CULTURE,How A 90-Year-Old Bookstore Got Into The Business Of Totes,Jillian Capewell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/strand-bookstore-totes-new-york_us_59f8eec1e4b00c6145e261e2,"New York's Strand Book Store has been making its iconic tote bags since the 1980s. Today, it boasts more than 100 designs.",2017-11-28,Strand designer Topher MacDonald with several of the tote bags he designed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59fb79631700002c01795a74.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Those who are familiar with New York’s Strand Book Store can likely recall its slogan: “18 miles of books.” It’s right there on the store’s ubiquitous red oval logo, seen citywide on tote bags carried by well-read locals and tourists alike.But today, the 90-year-old Manhattan institution selling new and used books boasts closer to 23 miles of the printed word. (It’s measured, by the way, by book spines, exactly how they sit on the shelf.) “I think 18 miles has such a nice ring to it,” senior designer Topher MacDonald said, recalling an old store awning that originally read “8 miles of books.” Eventually, “somebody tacked a 1 on top of it because [the store] had gotten too big,” he added.However long the Strand’s stock is, the phrase is beautifully evocative. For a book lover catching sight of the slogan on a tote ambling around Central Park, it conjures images of never-ending stacks, more stories and curious plots than can be devoured in a lifetime. Indeed, it’s the humble canvas tote, first sold at the Strand in the 1980s, that allows a bibliophile on-the-go to subtly transmit that image — and an image of themselves, too. Current store co-owner Nancy Bass Wyden — the granddaughter of store founder Ben Bass — told HuffPost that the first iteration of the Strand tote was designed by a former longtime floor manager named Richard Devereaux. It had simple block letters, spelling out the store’s name, address and phone number on canvas.That design persisted until the ’90s, when the bookstore’s now-famous red oval logo replaced it. The newer design, attributed to another floor manager’s girlfriend at the time, features the bookstore’s name in Strand Gothic (the store’s own font).The initial tote was relatively small; it held only two or three books at a time. But it grew, and the designs became more varied, as the Strand began ramping up its merchandise section around 2012.“My dad [Fred Bass] kind of resisted for many years. You know, ‘What are you doing to this place?! We should just have serious books!’” Bass Wyden said. He came around to the idea, she said, because it pleased customers.“That was, and is, the most important thing to him,” she said.The Strand has now offered over 100 original tote designs, ranging from political to whimsical. Walking around the store, you can spot canvas homages to Frida Kahlo and Michelle Obama laid out on tables, or get lost in an intricate hand-drawn city scene printed on a bag. There are totes with useful additions like zippers or small phone-sized pockets.Books and tote bags go together naturally — one is an object to be carried, the other carries it. So it makes sense that Strand customers would gravitate toward the bookstore’s bags. The appeal of a tote, however, goes beyond mere utility. On the surface, any Strand tote signals that its owner enjoys books. Perhaps the owner would also like to be seen supporting independent bookstores — an ever-more-political stance as Amazon and its ilk cast a long shadow over small businesses. Perhaps they have a connection to New York City; whether they live there, visit there, or know someone who visits there, they proudly flaunt the affiliation.Once you start looking, it’s easy to spot a Strand tote or three on an average crowded subway. Their sheer ubiquity means the bags inevitably lose a factor or two of cool. In 2011, Vol. 1 Brooklyn riffed on the associations begotten by various literary totes, suggesting the typical Strand tote owner “probably [doesn’t] actually live in New York. Either that, or you’re a freshman at NYU.”Still, for lit lovers who are unconcerned with urban cachet, there are plenty of options. Customers can buy a bag to communicate even more specific facts about themselves: I love cats. I am a feminist. Shakespeare is my personal superhero. I will not f**k someone who doesn’t own any books.“We know that people that love books, love cats,” Bass Wyden said, reiterating a likely facet of many habitual readers’ personalities: They enjoy the indoors. “We always try to keep that in mind, you know: cozy, fireplace, coffee, tea.”Hand-drawn designs — a trend seen popping up on book covers themselves ― have also proved popular, which Bass Wyden suggested was a result of the “backlash from technology” and living in an increasingly digital world. Each tote mentions the Strand’s name in some way, usually showcasing that same red oval logo. (The Strand merchandizing team briefly tried a few other designs, replacing the “miles of books” slogan with the phrase “Where books are loved,” but ultimately went back to the original.)Nearly 50 of the designs are credited to MacDonald, who began working out on the art department floor around five years ago. His handiwork ranges from delicate, multicolor illustrations of New Yorkers going about their day to an image of an extensively detailed library with ceiling-high bookshelves and cats around each turn.MacDonald says the idea of a “weird, introvert fantasy world” inspired one of his latest designs: a dusty shelf stocked with a compass, a bell jar, a skull, books and other oddities, all presided over by a black cat. “Stay Curious,” it reads.Ultimately, the designs come out of a collaborative process, with Bass Wyden and other staff members contributing ideas to a department called Studio Strand, which also consists of designers Greg Locke and Alison George and manager Meagan Henry. MacDonald, who hand-draws designs on a tablet, said that the collaboration can lead to little visual “Easter eggs” on the totes. MacDonald included his dog in a tableau of the city’s canine population. On another bag, the Japanese character for “book” takes the place of the “A” in “Strand” — another fun wink for those in the know. At first glance, the store’s “Victorian Reader” seems to depict a straightforward scene of old-timey New York, with older building facades, horse-drawn carriages and people in the street with their noses in books.Upon closer inspection, the attention to detail — creepy detail ― emerges. There’s a Headless Horseman statue and a violent barber inspired by Sweeney Todd. A carriage is being driven by a skeleton. Two identical twins ride eerily by on a tandem bicycle.“I think [Bass Wyden was] just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be creepy if there were some abandoned shoes in the street?’” MacDonald recalled.“It’s fun to create these opportunities for everyone. Like, what happens if you put a cobweb over here, or what happens if you put, like, a skull at the top of a building?” he continued. “Just making it as immersive as possible.”Elsewhere in the design, a frustrated writer tosses his papers out the window. In another window, Bass Wyden’s grandfather peers out at the scene below. The design has been in the merchandise rotation for several years.“It really is all of that detail that really makes it, you know, resonate for so long,” MacDonald added.With an in-house design team, the bookstore can also adapt quickly to emerging trends and new catchphrases. When “Hamilton” was selling out nightly, a “Young, Scrappy and Hungry” bag popped up on shelves. When the coloring book craze seized bookstores around 2014, Strand answered with a tote featuring outlines of New York staples: a pigeon, the MetroCard.The bookstore also offered “F**k 2016” pins and “Make America Read Again” totes: bold statements in a bold election year that allowed people to wear not just their love of reading, but their frustration, on their sleeves.“I kept saying, ‘Don’t order too much! He’s not gonna be around!’” Bass Wyden said with a laugh, referring, of course, to now-President Donald Trump. The resistance is alive, well and for sale at the bookstore, where Ruth Bader Ginsburg totes lie on a table near others that read, “Nevertheless, She Persisted.”A tote with the saying “A well-read woman is a dangerous creature” features what looks like a straightforward floral motif against black canvas, but upon further inspection, there are bees sprinkled throughout ― subtly underscoring the “dangerous creature” note. Other totes are collaborations with beloved artists like Art Spiegelman and Adrian Tomine.Other designs have come from happenstance. Bass Wyden said a manager who collected autographs and drawings asked painter David Hockney to draw him a picture when he visited the store in the ’70s. Hockney drew a bag of books, which eventually became a tote. “I thought that was funny, to put a tote on a tote,” Bass Wyden said.For bookstore purists, the growth of the Strand’s in-store merchandise ― increasingly catering to an in-and-out kind of customer rather than one content to spend hours among the stacks ― might seem at odds with the store’s history as a haven for literature and those who love it. It’s understandable that seeing space occupied by bags advertising the store’s lengthy selection of books, instead of the books themselves, could chafe a certain kind of reader.But if a bookstore must diversify its offerings to offset changing publishing trends or to reflect customer tastes, the creations tailored for bibliophiles at the Strand seem like a practical, and charming, way to meet in the middle. In a way, the many canvas bags on offer echo the varied customers drawn to the store in order to peruse its curated tables and outdoor carts — creative, singular, true New York originals."

Current store co-owner Nancy Bass Wyden — the granddaughter of store founder Ben Bass — told HuffPost that the first iteration of the Strand tote was designed by a former longtime floor manager named Richard Devereaux. It had simple block letters, spelling out the store’s name, address and phone number on canvas.That design persisted until the ’90s, when the bookstore’s now-famous red oval logo replaced it. The newer design, attributed to another floor manager’s girlfriend at the time, features the bookstore’s name in Strand Gothic (the store’s own font).The initial tote was relatively small; it held only two or three books at a time. But it grew, and the designs became more varied, as the Strand began ramping up its merchandise section around 2012.“My dad [Fred Bass] kind of resisted for many years. You know, ‘What are you doing to this place?! We should just have serious books!’” Bass Wyden said. He came around to the idea, she said, because it pleased customers.“That was, and is, the most important thing to him,” she said.The Strand has now offered over 100 original tote designs, ranging from political to whimsical. Walking around the store, you can spot canvas homages to Frida Kahlo and Michelle Obama laid out on tables, or get lost in an intricate hand-drawn city scene printed on a bag. There are totes with useful additions like zippers or small phone-sized pockets.Books and tote bags go together naturally — one is an object to be carried, the other carries it. So it makes sense that Strand customers would gravitate toward the bookstore’s bags. The appeal of a tote, however, goes beyond mere utility. On the surface, any Strand tote signals that its owner enjoys books. Perhaps the owner would also like to be seen supporting independent bookstores — an ever-more-political stance as Amazon and its ilk cast a long shadow over small businesses. Perhaps they have a connection to New York City; whether they live there, visit there, or know someone who visits there, they proudly flaunt the affiliation.Once you start looking, it’s easy to spot a Strand tote or three on an average crowded subway. Their sheer ubiquity means the bags inevitably lose a factor or two of cool. In 2011, Vol. 1 Brooklyn riffed on the associations begotten by various literary totes, suggesting the typical Strand tote owner “probably [doesn’t] actually live in New York. Either that, or you’re a freshman at NYU.”Still, for lit lovers who are unconcerned with urban cachet, there are plenty of options. Customers can buy a bag to communicate even more specific facts about themselves: I love cats. I am a feminist. Shakespeare is my personal superhero. I will not f**k someone who doesn’t own any books.“We know that people that love books, love cats,” Bass Wyden said, reiterating a likely facet of many habitual readers’ personalities: They enjoy the indoors. “We always try to keep that in mind, you know: cozy, fireplace, coffee, tea.”Hand-drawn designs — a trend seen popping up on book covers themselves ― have also proved popular, which Bass Wyden suggested was a result of the “backlash from technology” and living in an increasingly digital world. Each tote mentions the Strand’s name in some way, usually showcasing that same red oval logo. (The Strand merchandizing team briefly tried a few other designs, replacing the “miles of books” slogan with the phrase “Where books are loved,” but ultimately went back to the original.)Nearly 50 of the designs are credited to MacDonald, who began working out on the art department floor around five years ago. His handiwork ranges from delicate, multicolor illustrations of New Yorkers going about their day to an image of an extensively detailed library with ceiling-high bookshelves and cats around each turn.MacDonald says the idea of a “weird, introvert fantasy world” inspired one of his latest designs: a dusty shelf stocked with a compass, a bell jar, a skull, books and other oddities, all presided over by a black cat. “Stay Curious,” it reads.Ultimately, the designs come out of a collaborative process, with Bass Wyden and other staff members contributing ideas to a department called Studio Strand, which also consists of designers Greg Locke and Alison George and manager Meagan Henry. MacDonald, who hand-draws designs on a tablet, said that the collaboration can lead to little visual “Easter eggs” on the totes. MacDonald included his dog in a tableau of the city’s canine population. On another bag, the Japanese character for “book” takes the place of the “A” in “Strand” — another fun wink for those in the know. At first glance, the store’s “Victorian Reader” seems to depict a straightforward scene of old-timey New York, with older building facades, horse-drawn carriages and people in the street with their noses in books.Upon closer inspection, the attention to detail — creepy detail ― emerges. There’s a Headless Horseman statue and a violent barber inspired by Sweeney Todd. A carriage is being driven by a skeleton. Two identical twins ride eerily by on a tandem bicycle.“I think [Bass Wyden was] just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be creepy if there were some abandoned shoes in the street?’” MacDonald recalled.“It’s fun to create these opportunities for everyone. Like, what happens if you put a cobweb over here, or what happens if you put, like, a skull at the top of a building?” he continued. “Just making it as immersive as possible.”Elsewhere in the design, a frustrated writer tosses his papers out the window. In another window, Bass Wyden’s grandfather peers out at the scene below. The design has been in the merchandise rotation for several years.“It really is all of that detail that really makes it, you know, resonate for so long,” MacDonald added.With an in-house design team, the bookstore can also adapt quickly to emerging trends and new catchphrases. When “Hamilton” was selling out nightly, a “Young, Scrappy and Hungry” bag popped up on shelves. When the coloring book craze seized bookstores around 2014, Strand answered with a tote featuring outlines of New York staples: a pigeon, the MetroCard.The bookstore also offered “F**k 2016” pins and “Make America Read Again” totes: bold statements in a bold election year that allowed people to wear not just their love of reading, but their frustration, on their sleeves.“I kept saying, ‘Don’t order too much! He’s not gonna be around!’” Bass Wyden said with a laugh, referring, of course, to now-President Donald Trump. The resistance is alive, well and for sale at the bookstore, where Ruth Bader Ginsburg totes lie on a table near others that read, “Nevertheless, She Persisted.”A tote with the saying “A well-read woman is a dangerous creature” features what looks like a straightforward floral motif against black canvas, but upon further inspection, there are bees sprinkled throughout ― subtly underscoring the “dangerous creature” note. Other totes are collaborations with beloved artists like Art Spiegelman and Adrian Tomine.Other designs have come from happenstance. Bass Wyden said a manager who collected autographs and drawings asked painter David Hockney to draw him a picture when he visited the store in the ’70s. Hockney drew a bag of books, which eventually became a tote. “I thought that was funny, to put a tote on a tote,” Bass Wyden said.For bookstore purists, the growth of the Strand’s in-store merchandise ― increasingly catering to an in-and-out kind of customer rather than one content to spend hours among the stacks ― might seem at odds with the store’s history as a haven for literature and those who love it. It’s understandable that seeing space occupied by bags advertising the store’s lengthy selection of books, instead of the books themselves, could chafe a certain kind of reader.But if a bookstore must diversify its offerings to offset changing publishing trends or to reflect customer tastes, the creations tailored for bibliophiles at the Strand seem like a practical, and charming, way to meet in the middle. In a way, the many canvas bags on offer echo the varied customers drawn to the store in order to peruse its curated tables and outdoor carts — creative, singular, true New York originals."

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) cautioned regulators in his neighboring state against giving swift approval to another proposed oil pipeline.In a Tuesday letter shared with HuffPost, the progressive congressman urged the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MNPUC) to consider climate change, downstream pollution and Native Americans’ fierce opposition before voting on the final certificates needed to begin construction of Enbridge Energy’s Line 3 pipeline. The state regulators are scheduled to hold a Dec. 7 hearing on the project’s potential environmental impact. A final vote is slated for April. Enbridge’s $2 billion pipeline would carry 760,000 barrels of tar sands oil some 1,031 miles from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Minnesota every day. That amount of crude is equivalent to the annual carbon emissions of about 16 to 18 million cars on the road, Ellison noted.“Many of my constituents noted that the Line 3 replacement pipeline would be transporting tar sands crude, which is among the dirtiest fossil fuels,” Ellison wrote. “When reviewing this project, the MNPUC should ensure that the pipeline would not further exacerbate the warming of our planet or undermine Minnesota’s ability to achieve statutory greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.”Tar sands, a noxious mix of clay, sand and oil, are considered one of the most pollutive fossil fuels and could face stricter regulations in Canada in the future. To reduce costs ahead of any crackdown, the industry is looking to scale up the pipelines between the United States and Canada. Enbridge’s Line 3 and TransCanada’s Keystone XL are part of that push.The Nebraska Public Service Commission voted 3-2 this month to approve the Keystone XL addition, despite the fact that the existing Keystone pipeline had leaked 210,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota just days earlier. It was the biggest spill in the pipeline’s seven-year history, but not the first. The pipeline has had three major accidents since the earlier construction was completed in 2010, far more than TransCanada predicted to regulators, according to Reuters. That has stoked fears that Keystone XL, if completed, could contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest aquifer in North America.Ellison cited similar concerns in his letter, noting that Enbridge pipelines had more than 800 spills between 1999 and 2010, according to a Polaris Institute report. That includes a major 2010 spill in the Kalamazoo River in Michigan.Last month, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission voted to require Enbridge to publicly disclose its projections for potential spills from the Line 3 pipeline. The company had redacted the data from the public version of its report submitted to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, claiming the information could be used by “bad actors” to damage the pipeline. “Many constituents also expressed concern about the risk posed to downstream communities,” Ellison wrote. “The proposed Line 3 reroute would cross the Red River, the Mississippi, and the Lake Superior watersheds, 192 surface waters, and hundreds of wetland acres. Millions of people and thousands of cities line the shores of the Mississippi, and a spill or leak could have severe consequences on access to drinking water.”Public opposition to these oil projects has also been driven by the troubles over the Dakota Access Pipeline, a conduit for Bakken crude that cuts through the Standing Rock Sioux’s sacred water. That project prompted huge protests at the reservation, which drew activists, veterans and environmentalists from across the country. Ellison said Enbridge’s proposed route crosses land set aside for the Ojibwe tribe in an 1855 treaty.“Tribal communities have also shared with me their deep opposition to the pipeline,” Ellison said. “Minnesota must respect our treaties and address the legitimate issues that the pipeline presents to the rights we have guaranteed to our indigenous neighbors.”"

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks to reporters after a rally in support of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's independence.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1daaab140000196c50fa6f.jpeg?cache=r7zPZxBUuN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Tuesday rallied progressive activists against President Donald Trump’s appointment for interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Warren, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and leaders of major liberal groups, including the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, MoveON and Demos, rallied outside the consumer agency’s headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., as CFPB employees congregated at their office windows to watch.“For six years, this agency has fought to give consumers a chance. For six years, this agency has fought for working people,” Warren declared as demonstrators cheered behind her. “And now it’s time for us to fight for the agency.” Trump on Friday appointed White House budget director Mick Mulvaney to serve as interim CFPB director, and Mulvaney showed up at the agency on Monday. But last week, outgoing CFPB director Richard Cordray named deputy director Leandra English as the interim agency head. English has sued to lead the watchdog.Warren is credited with conceiving the CFPB. She and other boosters of the agency argue that the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the CFPB insulates it from a presidential appointment of an interim head like Mulvaney. They maintain that English can hold the post until Trump nominates a permanent leader who is confirmed by the Senate. “This is about Wall Street banks versus families, and right now Donald Trump has put himself firmly on the side of Wall Street banks,” Warren told reporters after delivering her prepared remarks. “It’s like a double kiss to Wall Street this week ― trying to push forward tax reform that gives a trillion and a half dollars in tax cuts to giant corporations and at the same time, trying to hollow out the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.”“I say we start by following the law,” she added. “If Donald Trump wants to name a nominee, name him and bring him over to the Senate for the hearing.” Conflict over the CFPB’s leadership created scenes of chaos on Monday: English tried to assume her role at the helm, and Mulvaney, who brought employees doughnuts on his first day, instructed employees to disregard her.It is unclear how English will fare in federal court. She sued the White House on her own with representation from Deepak Gupta, a progressive D.C.-based attorney.The CFPB’s general counsel, however, drafted a legal memo in support of Mulvaney. (The attorney who wrote the internal White House memo justifying Mulvaney’s appointment represented a payday lender in front of the CFPB last year.)Experts on the CFPB say that the legal dispute over the agency’s leadership is a matter of legitimate disagreement. Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), whose name is on the law creating the watchdog group, conceded Monday that there was some legal complexity to the issue.“I think my side is right,” Frank said during an appearance on CNBC. “But it is also clear that people’s view of the law here on the whole is influenced by what they want to see.”As speakers were keen to note on Tuesday, Congress indeed created the CFPB with a leadership and funding structure specifically designed to safeguard its independence. Unlike many federal agencies run by panels of officials from both major political parties, the CFPB is run by one individual who serves a five-year term and can only be dismissed for very narrow reasons. Its funding also comes from the Federal Reserve, a feature that insulates it from yearly appropriations battles.Financial institutions and conservative jurists have long argued that the structure of the agency is unconstitutional, because it is not subject to real oversight from either the president or Congress. In October 2016, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the agency’s structure is unconstitutional; the full bench of the federal appeals court has yet to issue its ruling.For Warren, one of Wall Street’s most loathed foes, and many of her progressive supporters, the fight over Mulvaney’s appointment is just as much about the matter at hand as it is about a long-simmering battle over the future of financial regulation. Prior to winning a Senate seat in 2012, Warren was a Harvard law professor and Congress’ chief overseer of the Wall Street bailout programs. She envisioned the CFPB as a regulator of potentially dangerous financial products such as predatory loans, similar to how the Consumer Product Safety Commission regulates more conventional consumer products.“Consumer financial protection had not been the primary focus of any Federal agency, and no agency had effective tools to set the rules for and oversee the whole market,” Warren testified before Congress in May 2011, when she was helping the Treasury Department set up the agency.“The result was a system without effective rules or consistent enforcement,” she said. “We have seen the results, both in the 2008 financial crisis and in its aftermath.”Conservative Republicans and banks didn’t hide their opposition to the CFPB’s creation at the time. Their resistance to Warren’s nomination to lead it in 2012 forced then-President Barack Obama to name Cordray instead.Mulvaney himself called the CFPB a “sick, sad joke” as recently as 2014.The agency has earned a reputation as an effective check on the abusive practices of financial institutions such as banks, payday lenders, credit card companies and student loan agencies. The CFPB has distributed nearly $12 billion in compensation and other forms of financial relief to 29 million consumers since 2011, according to agency figures. One of its most notable achievements occurred in September 2016, when the agency discovered that Wells Fargo had been opening fee-generating accounts for consumers without their knowledge. The enforcement action resulted in the payment of $190 million in penalties and reimbursements. Following Warren’s tough questioning at a Senate hearing, the incident even prompted the resignation of Wells Fargo CEO John Stump and the clawback of his bonus.Many Democrats and consumer advocacy groups now fear that, one way or another, Trump will defang the agency and make it more amenable to the financial industry.David and Allyne Pittle, septuagenarian retirees from Alexandria, Virginia, said they showed up at Tuesday’s rally after reading about in The Washington Post.“I’m here to bear witness to the importance of this agency. This agency protects consumers from the unfair practices of banks and the abuse of Wall Street,” said David Pittle, 79. “It’s taken us 200 years to get an agency like that and this administration is trying to do damage to it already.”Several speakers at the rally said Trump’s attempts to reshape the CFPB run counter to his promise to fix a political and economic system stacked against ordinary people.“Donald Trump’s elevation, in part, came from people who thought the system is rigged,” Ben Wikler, Washington director of MoveOn, told the crowd. “So this is a betrayal of Donald Trump’s core supporters.”When a reporter asked Warren whether Trump’s alleged attempts to diminish the CFPB would be a winning issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, she responded, “Boy, it sure ought to be.”“This isn’t about politics,” she said. “This is about, ‘Whose side are you on?’”This article has been updated with additional details about the creation and operation of the CFPB.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) were also set to attend the meeting with Trump.But after Trump tweeted that he didn’t “see a deal” coming together as a result of the meeting with Democrats, Schumer and Pelosi said they would negotiate with McConnell and Ryan instead, without the president. They said they have requested a meeting with McConnell and Ryan for Tuesday afternoon.“Given that the President doesn’t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead. ... We don’t have any time to waste in addressing the issues that confront us, so we’re going to continue to negotiate with Republican leaders who may be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement,” the Democratic leaders said in a joint statement.They suggested the president couldn’t be trusted to operate in good faith to find an agreement and avert a shutdown.“If the President, who already said earlier this year that ‘our country needs a good shutdown,’ isn’t interested in addressing the difficult year end agenda, we’ll work with those Republicans who are, as we did in April,” Schumer and Pelosi said. “We look forward to continuing to work in good faith, as we have been for the last month, with our Republican colleagues in Congress to do just that.”Their statement came after Trump tweeted about the scheduled meeting with Schumer and Pelosi, whom he called “Chuck and Nancy.” “Meeting with ‘Chuck and Nancy’ today about keeping government open and working,” he tweeted. “Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don’t see a deal!”McConnell and Ryan accused Schumer and Pelosi early Tuesday afternoon of making excuses to avoid meeting with Trump.“We have important work to do, and Democratic leaders have continually found new excuses not to meet with the administration to discuss these issues,” they said in a statement. “Democrats are putting government operations, particularly resources for our men and women on the battlefield, at great risk by pulling these antics. There is a meeting at the White House this afternoon, and if Democrats want to reach an agreement, they will be there.”“I never refused to go to a meeting that President Obama called, a bipartisan meeting,” McConnell said. “It never occurred to me that I could just say to President Obama, ‘I’m not showing up.’ That strikes me as a lack of seriousness about the matter before us.”But as HuffPost reported in 2010, McConnell skipped a bipartisan meeting and intimate dinner with Obama. He instead went to an event ― including a dinner ― held by the conservative Federalist Society.McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said the difference was that McConnell didn’t “turn down the meeting.”“The WH announced a half-day meeting before checking with the participants to see if they were avail,” he said. Later in the month, congressional leaders met in the White House for a bipartisan gathering. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday’s meeting would go ahead as planned and that Democrats should attend.“The president’s invitation to the Democrat leaders still stands and he encourages them to put aside their pettiness, stop the political grandstanding, show up and get to work,” she said in a statement.Democrats have said they want protections for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to be part of a package, and some have said they wouldn’t vote for a deal that left out those so-called Dreamers. Republicans control the House, Senate and White House, but cannot avert a shutdown on their own — in the past, they’ve relied on some Democratic votes to pass funding bills.At the White House Tuesday afternoon, Trump, as well as McConnell and Ryan, spoke to the press. The White House left two empty chairs where the Democratic leaders would have been.Trump again said he considered the Democrats “weak on crime” and “weak on illegal immigration,” adding that he was “not that surprised” they skipped the meeting.In September, Pelosi and Schumer held a similar sit-down with Trump and Senate Republicans at the White House ― and they walked away with the upper hand. The president agreed to their demands on funding the government and raising the debt ceiling, over the objections of the GOP leaders and his own Treasury secretary.A week later, after a dinner meeting with the president, the Democratic leaders said they had struck a deal with Trump on extending protections for young undocumented immigrants who were losing those same protections because of an action by the president. Trump later contradicted them, saying there was no deal.Earlier this month in an interview with HuffPost, Schumer said that despite the president’s fickleness, he was still willing to work with him ― when there was a benefit to it.“I am not going to obstruct Donald,” Schumer said. “Here’s been my motto since I started: Go by your values. I’m not going to obstruct him for its own sake, nor am I going to compromise for its own sake. If we can keep our values and get something done by working with him, fine. So far, he’s been so hard right it’s been impossible. If it changes, it’s welcome.”This story has been updated with a statement from Republican congressional leaders and the White House, as well as more background information."
39,IMPACT,The Ultimate Fashion Fail: One Garbage Truck Of Textiles Is Thrown Away Every Second,Tess Riley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fashion-industry-waste-circular-economy_us_5a1c66cde4b0e9bc3368d08e,"Is a world beyond ""fast fashion"" possible?",2017-11-28,"A worker balances a basket of waste products to be processed at a tannery at Hazaribagh in Dhaka, Bangladesh.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1c85da150000884585a0fa.jpeg?cache=d16KIDcJZG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We need a new approach to how we consume clothes if we want to prevent obscene volumes of waste, widespread exhaustion of critical resources and the toxic pollution of the environment, according to a new report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.“The textiles industry is a huge industry employing more than 300 million people globally,” says Rob Opsomer, co-author of the report. “It’s also very polluting. We found that the equivalent of one garbage truck full of textiles gets landfilled or burned every single second of every day of the year.” Then there’s the issue of what we’re making those textiles from. As much as 60 percent of our clothing is made from plastic, according to the report. The problem is, every time we wash our clothes, tiny plastic microfibers get released into the washing machine before escaping into the oceans, where they are eaten by fish. It turns out we’re eating and drinking these microplastics too.At the end of a long weekend of Black Friday and Cyber Monday mega-discounts from the likes of H&M and Gap, it’s hard to imagine a world where we’re not just lapping up cheap, disposable fast fashion.But that’s exactly what the Ellen MacArthur Foundation is doing. Launched in collaboration with sustainable fashion icon Stella McCartney, the report sets out four main ways to create “the new textiles economy”: phase out hazardous materials (including those that contribute to the microplastics problem); make better quality clothes and keep them in the system longer through rental models; improve recycling processes; and use renewable resources in manufacturing.Key to this is realizing that it’s not just about reducing the textiles industry’s negative impact but creating a positive alternative, says Lewis Perkins, president of the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute.“If you’re driving a car 100 miles an hour in the wrong direction and you slow down to 40, you’re still going in the wrong direction,” he says. Put another way, we’re only going to get so far by convincing shoppers to consume less. From Rent the Runway to The RealReal, we’re seeing great examples of the new textiles economy emerging in countries such as the U.S., says Opsomer, adding: “People don’t want just three shirts or pairs of pants, so we need to find ways to provide them with access to well-made stuff without necessarily owning it.”And this isn’t just an evolution in the U.S., as demonstrated by projects such as China’s subscription-based clothes sharing platform YCloset. In a recent funding round, YCloset raised $50 million. For all the talk of Netflix-inspired models, however, a big question remains: Is this vision accessible for those in lower income brackets for whom monthly subscriptions and luxury rentals might not be feasible? For Opsomer, the point is to mainstream the circular fashion model so it becomes not just widely accessible but also widely desirable. “There’s a stigma attached to second-hand fashion,” he says. “But, as projects like Rent the Runway show, even those renting at the luxury end of things are open to the idea of second-hand. Ultimately this model provides a vision for access to ethical and affordable clothing.”More broadly, this model ― where sustainable resources are not just used but re-used ― is taking hold, says Antonia Gawel, head of the World Economic Forum’s Circular Economy initiative. The challenge, she believes, is to ramp up the public and private sectors’ progress.With companies such as Nike and H&M Group publicly endorsing the new Ellen MacArthur Foundation report, there are at least signs that some of the giants of the fashion industry are listening.

He was 30-something at the time, singing about a 16-year-old. You want to take away Ringo Starr’s achievement?”An incredulous Cuomo cut in. “You can’t be serious,” the CNN anchor repeated twice. “You think that Ringo Starr’s song is supposed to be a nod towards allowing 30-year-old men to prey on teenagers? You don’t believe that, Joel. You’re a parent. You don’t believe that.”Instead of responding directly, Pollak went on to say that as a parent he worries about the “risks our sons face today,” namely being “exposed to accusations that may or may not be true.”Moore, a former judge, has been accused of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple women, including minors.In an earlier interview, Pollak had claimed that “only one” of Moore’s alleged relationships ― with a 14-year-old ― was “problematic.” Others involving girls who were 16 and 18 were “perfectly legitimate,” he said during an appearance on “MSNBC Live With Ali Velshi.” Moore had been in his 30s during those alleged encounters.“The 16-year-old and the 18-year-old have no business in that story because those are women of legal age of consent,” Pollak told Velshi."

Tillerson’s deputy chief of staff, Christine Ciccone, will “step in to lead the Redesign effort.”“We appreciate Maliz sharing her expertise with us over the past few months,” the spokesman said. “We wish her the best of luck in her next venture.”Tillerson has launched a dramatic campaign to reorganize the State Department since taking office earlier this year, including the hiring of two consulting firms to help spearhead the changes. He has called the effort “the most important thing” he can do as secretary and has pledged to slash the department’s budget and push out thousands of career diplomats. “If I accomplish that, that will go on forever, and you will create the State Department of the future,” Tillerson said of the reorganization during a September speech at the U.S. Embassy in London.Such plans have been met with alarm within the agency and abroad. The New York Times reported last week that more than a dozen of the State Department’s top-tier officials ― the equivalent of three- and four-star generals ― have left or been removed under Tillerson. Applications to join the Foreign Service are on track to fall 50 percent this year, and morale is low by the department’s own admission.Earlier this month, Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote to Tillerson to say they were “deeply concerned by the exodus of more than 100” senior officials since January.“The amount of talent leaving the State Department endangers the institution and undermines American leadership, security and interests around the world,” they wrote. “We remain profoundly concerned over what appears to be the intentional hollowing-out of our senior diplomatic ranks.”Republican lawmakers ― including Sens. Bob Corker (Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and John McCain (Ariz.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee ― have said those concerns are “bipartisan in nature.”Tillerson, for his part, has denied that spirits at the department are low.“I walk the halls, people smile,” he told Bloomberg in October. “If it’s as bad as it seems to be described, I’m not seeing it, I’m not getting it.”"
42,WOMEN,Over 200 Women In U.S. National Security Sign Open Letter About Sexual Misconduct,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/over-200-women-in-us-national-security-write-open-letter-about-sexual-assault-and-harassment_us_5a1dbbb7e4b04abdc61462cc,"""We, too, are survivors of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse or know others who are,"" the letter reads.",2017-11-28,"Alanna Vagianos - Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c1138352200002007de7e1e.jpg?ops=100_100,"Women who have worked in U.S. national security wrote an open letter to their community calling on those in power to help combat sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. Published on Tuesday by Time, the open letter was signed by 223 women who serve or have served in the military, diplomatic positions and development organizations.“We, too, are survivors of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse or know others who are,” the letter reads. The letter calls on people and institutions in the national security community to “reduce the incidences of sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace.” To combat sexual harassment, the letter asks people in power in the field to create better channels to report abuse, create better data collection on sexual violence and make employee sexual harassment training and exit interviews mandatory. The 223 women also demanded that the national security community address the “serious gender imbalance” in senior leadership positions.“This is not just a problem in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, newsrooms or Congress. It is everywhere,” the letter reads. “These abuses are born of imbalances of power and environments that permit such practices while silencing and shaming their survivors.”In 2016, there were 6,172 sexual assault cases reported in the military alone; it was a record number for sexual assaults reported in one year, which many believe reflects a stronger trust in the system since discussing sexual assault in the military has become part of the mainstream conversation. “Many women are held back or driven from this field by men who use their power to assault at one end of the spectrum and perpetuate ― sometimes unconsciously ― environments that silence, demean, belittle or neglect women at the other. Assault is the progression of the same behaviors that permit us to be denigrated, interrupted, shut out, and shut up,” the letter reads. “These behaviors incubate a permissive environment where sexual harassment and assault take hold. And it’s time to make it stop.”An anonymous survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense last year found that 14,900 service members had experienced some kind of sexual assault ― ranging from groping to rape ― in 2016. The same survey revealed that 1 in 3 service members who experienced assault in 2016 chose to report it; 10 years ago, only 1 in 14 chose to report. The letter ends with a powerful question: “How will you protect, empower, and defend the women who serve our nation?” Head over to Time to read the full letter."

Hoa, found guilty of “conducting propaganda against the state,” was arrested this year for reporting on a 2016 toxic waste spill that poisoned millions of fish off the central Vietnamese coast, potentially sickening hundreds of people. The spill, from a steel mill owned by Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics Group, has been described as one of Vietnam’s worst environmental disasters.Hoa’s trial, “unexpectedly” rescheduled at the last minute, was brief and closed to the public, according to reports. The activist, who had been a regular contributor to Radio Free Asia, did not have an attorney.Reporters Without Borders, which has launched a #StopTheCrackdownVN campaign to draw attention to Vietnam’s violations of press freedom, condemned Hoa’s sentence as “totally disproportionate.”“Not even his family was warned that this trial was going to take place,” Daniel Bastard, head of the organization’s Asia-Pacific desk, said in a statement. “Such drastic action confirms the intransigence of Vietnam’s refusal to tolerate any reporting freedom.”Human Rights Watch also lambasted the verdict, with Phil Robertson, deputy director of the organization’s Asia division, calling Hoa’s sentence an example of “how profoundly the government’s paranoid desire to maintain political control trumps notions of justice and human rights.”“How else can one explain that executives of an international firm that poisoned the ocean, ruining the coastal economy in four provinces, are free to go about their business while this idealistic young journalist is heading to prison for helping expose their misdeeds?” Robertson told The New York Times.Hoa’s punishment comes just months after another environmental activist and prominent Vietnamese blogger, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (better known by her pen name Mother Mushroom), was sentenced to 10 years in prison — also for publishing “propaganda against the state.”Like Hoa, Quynh had written critically about the steel mill spill, which occurred when the plant flushed cyanide and other chemicals through its new wastewater discharge system. The spill affected 120 miles of Vietnam’s coastline and the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen. It killed an estimated 115 tons of fish, reported Radio Free Asia, and has been blamed for sickening local communities.A 32-year-old woman told the Times last year that she suffered from vomiting, diarrhea and dizziness after eating fish poisoned by the spill.“Some of the fish were dead; some were dying,” her father, who dries fish for a living, told the paper. “We ate the fish that were still alive. We ate the fish for two weeks.”The disaster prompted widespread protests — a rarity in tightly controlled Vietnam. Hoa had covered some of these protests, often taking drone footage of demonstrations and sharing it on social media, according to Reporters Without Borders.As Reuters notes, Vietnamese authorities have recently ramped up efforts to “silence critics,” many of whom use social media platforms like Facebook to express dissent. Bloggers and activists have been arrested and threatened, and authorities have reportedly been leaning on Facebook and YouTube to censor content.On Monday, a well-known rights lawyer who had represented Quynh said the Bar Federation in his province had revoked his law licence just days before the activist’s appeal hearing on Nov. 30.“The government does not want me to work as a lawyer anymore because I have been defending poor people, people who were unjustly charged ... cases that are sensitive in Vietnam,” Vo An Don told Reuters.Vietnam has at least 84 prisoners of conscience in custody — the highest number in any Southeast Asian country, according to Amnesty International.

A much greater number of migrants tried to cross in 2016, but the fatality rate for the year was 1.4 percent.Even the 3,033 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean represent only a portion of the overall tragedy: IOM figures show there have been at least 5,124 migrant fatalities worldwide in 2017. Earlier this month, a German newspaper published a list of 33,000 migrants who have died en route to Europe since 1993.The leading causes of Mediterranean deaths this year were drowning and presumed drowning, followed by unknown causes, dehydration and starvation. For migrants elsewhere in the world, shootings, physical abuse and harsh weather conditions caused scores of fatalities.More than half of all migrant and refugee deaths over the past four years have occurred during attempts to cross the Mediterranean. In late 2014, Pope Francis suggested the sea was becoming a “vast cemetery.” Its three main routes are particularly treacherous for people attempting to flee war and persecution in overcrowded smuggler boats, which often fail to carry enough water and fuel for long journeys.On Friday, the IOM called the Mediterranean “by far the world’s deadliest border” for migrants.“People are still dying at sea in enormous numbers, even after years of seeing this happen repeatedly,” said Eugenio Ambrosi, the organization’s regional director for the European Union, Norway and Switzerland. “We have to ask ourselves: Why is this still happening?”"

Nowadays, the first condition is out of the equation; you simply don’t go ahead and form a family unless you can afford it. And the second element, nurturing useful members of society, has somehow lost momentum. We get so caught up in our own and society’s responsibilities towards our children that we often neglect our offspring’s basic responsibilities towards the rest.As modern mothers become more educated and cultured, some might think that we would not fall into the same traps parents fell into in the past; some might think that we’d know better. Yet, we are constantly making mistakes that might compromise our children’s future success.Here are just some of them:We project our regrets onto our children’s goals.Our regrets and disappointments from our childhood sometimes haunt us as adults. We recognise that we could have been a famous cello player if only we’d had discipline, but now it’s too late for us. But it’s not too late for our kids. “What do you mean you don’t want to learn how to play cello?” a mother will ask her daughter exasperated. “You just can’t miss the opportunity. You could become a famous cello player!”In the process, we tend to forget that becoming a famous athlete, or a cello player might be our own dream, but is not our child’s. And that nobody will do something she does not like in the long run. In our effort to provide our children with the necessary skills to achieve their goals and succeed in life, we make our second mistake.We overload their schedules with activities.Are chess lessons offered at school? Our child can’t miss the chance, since chess is such a “smart” activity. Did her classmates enroll in that new robotics class that introduces children to programming? We’ll enroll our daughter too, and squeeze the class in between archery practice and cello lessons, because we wouldn’t feel good with ourselves if we did otherwise. We wouldn’t like our child to be left behind.In order to cram everything in, though, the whole family needs to follow a carefully devised schedule, and not allow for the slightest deviation. Our day turns into a constant struggle with time, where no one wins. But the day has only twenty-four hours, and our children begin complaining that they don’t have time to play, or rest, or just think for themselves. To sooth our guilt and to make them happy, we make our third mistake.We buy them things. Lots of them.Does their tablet look old? We replace it instantly. Did their friend buy a new cell phone? We’ll follow along, because God forbid they feel deprived in any way. And did they forget their jacket at school because they were in a hurry? That’s no reason to fuss. We’ll buy them a new one.Children thus learn that everything is handed to them on a silver platter, and they don’t really have to try for anything. They just need to play along. As a result, we proceed to the forth mistake.We deprive them of motivation. Yes, every now and then we may throw in a comment like, “Every hour you spend playing on your tablet, another child spends studying,” or “Clash of Clans won’t put food on the table.” But our children probably don’t even glance up. They’re holding a shiny expensive tablet in their hands, with the apple logo on the back, and to be honest, they can’t think of any reason why they shouldn’t be.They won’t ask how much it cost, because money doesn’t seem to be an issue. It was their parents who bought them the tablet, because, well, because they are children. And everyone has one. Their mother appears motherly enough by giving them the right advice and even using an interesting quote, but that alone is highly unlikely to motivate an 11-year-old to study maths. Motivation isn’t something that shows up one day, nor something you can enforce. Besides, parents have already taught their children that they are not responsible for their actions. And that’s our fifth mistake.We assume responsibility for their actions.Material accumulation aside, we cultivate the attitude that our children don’t have to worry about anything, because, “We are here. Our job is to help.” Do they face a problem at school, like getting a lower grade than we think they deserve? We will rush off to the headmaster to explain, justify, and put things right. Is there something they don’t understand? No, they don’t have to try. We will explain it to them, and if we can’t, we’ll hire a tutor. Are they not considered the smartest, most gifted student ever? We storm in to question the teacher’s judgment and motives, because we won’t tolerate our child being treated unfairly. Not our child.As parents we tend to forget, though, that our children’s stay in the parental embrace is temporary, and they will soon have to face what lies outside the parental walls. Without realizing it, we have created socially awkward personalities—people totally unprepared to interact in an increasingly demanding society. People who haven’t learned that life is an arena, that no one is spared and that they’ll have to fight hard for their rights. And people who haven’t realized that society is not a mirror of the family life, where everyone takes great precautions not to hurt their feelings.Society simply works under different rules. And unless we change our parenting habits, our children will learn them the hard way.Previously published as “How We Undermine Our Children’s Future” in Irena’s GAZE column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.com.For some more great Wild Word essays:Why This Is Our “Women’s Lives Matter” Moment by Maria BehanHow To Transform Your Relationship With Money To Plan For The Future by Hadassah DamienWhy Good Parenting Starts With Mothering Ourselves by Jami Ingledue"

He launched Mission Innovation, an initiative that led more than 20 countries to pledge to double their investments in energy research and development.R&D: Penny Wise, Pound FoolishDuring his tenure, Dr. Moniz also proposed a doubling of the Energy Department’s energy R&D budget over a five-year period. Congress responded in its fiscal year 2017 budget by raising the energy R&D budget by five percent.By contrast, the Trump Administration’s Office of Management and Budget has proposed halving the R&D budget in fiscal year 2018. Moniz calls that proposal “very unsatisfactory,” but says wryly that he finds himself in the unusual position of betting that Congress will do the right thing. In this case, that means providing “some stability” for the department’s R&D efforts.In the Secretary’s wide-ranging fireside chat with journalist Amy Harder of Axios, Moniz touched on many energy policy, climate, trade, and nuclear weapons issues. Perhaps best known for his critical role in negotiating the Iran nuclear agreement, the former Secretary today is continuing his efforts to reduce global threats and find solutions to global challenges. Looming large on his current agenda are climate change and nuclear and biological weapons.Since leaving office, the scientist who conceived President Obama’s “all of the above” energy policy has recently launched the nonprofit Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) to provide solutions to a range of energy policy issues. An important part of EFI’s agenda is to advance innovation in energy technology, policy, and business.The Realities of Global Trade—And Carbon FeesDr. Moniz pointed out in his Las Vegas appearance that China has deployed twice the renewable energy capacity of the U.S. They are advancing rapidly, he said, both to address domestic pollution and to seize clean energy manufacturing opportunities. “We better try to keep our innovation edge and capture a lot of that market even as we address our climate needs,” he urged.Regarding the Trump Administration’s climate policy, the former Secretary said he regrets the Administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords. However, he opined, there’s “no going back” on that decision.Moniz also takes exception to the way in which the Administration has defined America’s global trade challenges. The Administration’s statements do not reflect the reality of international supply chain integration, according to Moniz. That’s the process by which cars, trains, planes, and other equipment today are built with parts from all over the world.“If you take NAFTA as an example,” he said, “there is tremendous supply chain integration among North American companies.” Thus the key question is, “How do you capture the high value parts of the supply chain?” Furthering this strategic goal, he said, “has to be worked out on a case-by-case basis.”Dr. Moniz sees carbon fees as an inevitable part of our future and believes large businesses recognize this. “If you’re making long-term capital allocations, you’d be crazy to base it on a high carbon future,” he said.Asked whether he was optimistic about solving the climate crisis, Moniz jokingly replied, “I am a physicist, so I am by definition optimistic.” He then went on to distinguish between short, medium, and long-range climate solutions and the relative difficulties of decarbonizing different sectors of the economy.Decarbonization Pathways and CostsGiven the ready availability of plentiful clean and economical renewable power sources today, Moniz believes that the electricity generating sector is the easiest sector to decarbonize. The optimism created by the relative ease with which that sector is now being transformed, however, needs to be tempered, he said, when it comes to the industrial, transportation, and building heating sectors. They present more complex challenges.Step one, Moniz said, is electrifying what can be electrified. The electrification of light duty vehicles (cars and light trucks) is relatively easy and is already underway. Aviation would be the hardest sector to electrify, Moniz asserted. Shipping will also present big challenges. To get to deep decarbonization by 2050 to meet the long-term goals of the Paris climate accords (holding global temperature increases to less than 2℃ and 1.5 ℃, if possible), Moniz is convinced that “we need other breakthroughs,” and that innovation will be key.“I have a hard time seeing how we’ll get [there] without continuing deep innovation.” That effort, he said, will have to be part of a large-scale carbon management effort. In the long-term, the main elements of carbon management will be carbon capture and sequestration; carbon dioxide utilization to create new fuels (carbon dioxide plus sunlight plus water equal hydrocarbon fuel); and some new method of “vacuum cleaning” the atmosphere to remove excess carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas.Conquering Complexities and Scaling Up“There are many significant sources of carbon dioxide in industrial plants that are amenable to rather cheap carbon capture,” Moniz said. “Then we’ve got to figure out very large-scale sequestration. But that’s not going to handle industry broadly.” He also mentioned the possibility that “reviving, if you like, the whole idea of a major hydrogen economy” may be part of the climate solution for the industrial and transportation sectors.“Everything I’ve mentioned is possible,” Moniz asserted, “but nowhere close to being possible at a cost point and scale that looks reasonable.” Finding economical solutions is precisely the hoped for payoff of the energy innovation that Moniz staunchly advocates.Despite his guarded assessment of the costs of deep decarbonization, Moniz acknowledged that in addition to costly and potentially dangerous geoengineering approaches for lowering global temperatures, like spraying droplets of sulfur into the sky (“We know that it’ll lead to further acidification of the oceans, which I consider to be a very, very big danger”), there are biological solutions for removing atmospheric carbon. However, Moniz noted, “We’ve only scratched the surface of biological solutions’ potential.”“All of these [processes] raise big issues, like that the biological solutions may involve engineered plants ... Big question to manage these,” he added.In the long term, these solutions must be done at large scale, Moniz pointed out. In the relatively near-term, however, “we can do a lot through stimulating deployment and frankly, I think that the DOE loan program did a lot of good stuff, including in this [southwestern] region.”Underinvesting in InnovationFor the intermediate term, “I think we’re going to need the fruits of programs like ARPAe,” he said, referring to the DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy. To achieve the big revolutionary breakthroughs needed in 25-30 years, however, Moniz advised that a well-funded innovation agenda is required today.“We are underinvesting in innovation today,” he emphasized. “That was the whole point in Mission Innovation [and] the American Energy Innovation Council. The CEOs were saying this 10 years ago: that’s where we have to go.”To learn more about his views on what the nation ought to be doing to advance energy research and development in a world increasingly fraught by accelerating climate change, I spoke directly with Secretary Moniz recently at the October National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas, NV.

The documents demonstrate, Amnesty alleged, that Shell aided a Nigerian military campaign to silence protesters who sought to bring attention to the the effects of pollution in the oil-rich Ogoniland region.Among the allegations in the report are claims that Shell operated a team of undercover police officers who were trained by Nigeria’s state security service. The unit was allegedly tasked with conducting surveillance on Ogoni activists resisting the exploitation of their land by corporate interests.The report also asserts that Shell provided “logistical support” to the country’s military, which was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Ogoni people in the early 1990s. The internal company documents, which HuffPost also reviewed, appear to show that Shell paid an “honorarium” as a “show of gratitude” to a military commander whose troops had engaged in a “bloody clash” with villagers several months prior. “The evidence we have reviewed shows that Shell repeatedly encouraged the Nigerian military to deal with community protests, even when it knew the horrors this would lead to – unlawful killings, rape, torture, the burning of villages,” Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty’s director of global issues, said in a statement.“In the midst of this brutal crackdown Shell even provided the military with material support, including transport,” she continued, adding “and in at least one instance paid a military commander notorious for human rights violations.”Shell has categorically denied the allegations.Activists from the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), a group spearheaded by Nigerian author and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, had been lobbying the government for several years to grant Ogoniland political and economic autonomy. Their campaign lead Shell to announce in 1993 that it was ending operations in Ogoniland, citing security concerns, but the company ultimately moved forward with plans to build a new pipeline through the region.Ensuing protests gave rise to a brutal crackdown by Nigeria’s military police, which, according to Amnesty’s report, included raids on Ogoni villages, torture and rape of Ogoni men and women, as well as the killings of roughly 1,000 people. In 1995, Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists were hanged following an internationally discredited trial, which led to Nigeria’s suspension from the Commonwealth. In 2009, Shell agreed to pay a $15.5 million settlement after being accused of collaborating in the executions.Amnesty alleged that Shell was aware of the military’s human rights violations in the 1990s and that a former regional head of security for the company had even provided information to the country’s internal security agency that aided in the crackdown.Gaughran said Amnesty was “preparing a criminal file to submit to the relevant authorities, with a view to prosecution.”In a statement to HuffPost, a spokesperson for The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) said the company strongly denied the allegations.“The executions of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his fellow Ogonis in 1995 were tragic events that were carried out by the military government in power at the time,” the spokesperson said. “We were shocked and saddened when we heard the news. Shell appealed to the Nigerian government to grant clemency. To our deep regret, that appeal, and the appeals made by many others … went unheard.”The representative pointed to Shell’s company values of “honesty, integrity and respect for people” and called Amnesty’s claims “false and without merit.”“SPDC did not collude with the authorities to suppress community unrest and in no way encouraged or advocated any act of violence in Nigeria,” the representative added. “We believe that the evidence will show clearly that Shell was not responsible for these tragic events.”MOSOP, the Ogoni activist group, continues to have a presence in Ogoniland, which has experienced numerous oil spills over the years resulting in negative impacts on residents’ health and livelihoods. According to the local Nigerian news site, the Daily Post, the organization gave the federal government an ultimatum earlier this month, saying if it didn’t initiate a clean up of the region it would “face the anger of the people.”"

In 2009, Shell agreed to pay a $15.5 million settlement after being accused of collaborating in the executions.Amnesty alleged that Shell was aware of the military’s human rights violations in the 1990s and that a former regional head of security for the company had even provided information to the country’s internal security agency that aided in the crackdown.Gaughran said Amnesty was “preparing a criminal file to submit to the relevant authorities, with a view to prosecution.”In a statement to HuffPost, a spokesperson for The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) said the company strongly denied the allegations.“The executions of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his fellow Ogonis in 1995 were tragic events that were carried out by the military government in power at the time,” the spokesperson said. “We were shocked and saddened when we heard the news. Shell appealed to the Nigerian government to grant clemency. To our deep regret, that appeal, and the appeals made by many others … went unheard.”The representative pointed to Shell’s company values of “honesty, integrity and respect for people” and called Amnesty’s claims “false and without merit.”“SPDC did not collude with the authorities to suppress community unrest and in no way encouraged or advocated any act of violence in Nigeria,” the representative added. “We believe that the evidence will show clearly that Shell was not responsible for these tragic events.”MOSOP, the Ogoni activist group, continues to have a presence in Ogoniland, which has experienced numerous oil spills over the years resulting in negative impacts on residents’ health and livelihoods. According to the local Nigerian news site, the Daily Post, the organization gave the federal government an ultimatum earlier this month, saying if it didn’t initiate a clean up of the region it would “face the anger of the people.”"

The rail line has brought some $9 billion in new public and private investment to the city while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, winning accolades from business and environmentalists alike.A champion of urban sustainability, deeply concerned about climate change, the mayor is guiding the city toward the elimination of all net carbon emissions and landfill waste. His administration has ambitious emissions reduction plans for Phoenix and is currently overachieving them. He holds climate change responsible for worsening the city’s drought, increasing forest fires in the region, and intensified local heat waves.Stanton was one of more than 60 mayors who announced in June 2017 that they would abide by the 196-nation Paris climate agreement despite President Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the accord—the only nation in the world to do so. Stanton has denounced the President’s action.While expressing passion and enthusiasm about his job as mayor and the opportunities for public service it affords, Stanton nonetheless aspires to higher office. In early October he announced his intention to resign from his position to run for Congress in the Spring of 2018.I spoke with the mayor recently at the October 13th National Clean Energy Summit to learn what has inspired him to set Phoenix on the path to urban sustainability. We also discussed his major achievements, obstacles encountered, and his plans for the city. An edited version of the conversation follows.Q&A with Mayor StantonJohn J. Berger: What have you achieved in the development of renewable energy and in advancing energy efficiency in Phoenix?Greg Stanton:  Probably the biggest thing we have done— which is going to be a game changer— is our transportation infrastructure investment plan that the voters overwhelmingly supported.Leadership MattersWe’re a city of 550 square miles, but we were becoming more urban. We have already built a light rail, and now we are tripling our light rail. Already we have had nine billion dollars of public and private investment along the light rail, mostly in the form of residential development.We set a very specific goal that when I became mayor, we are going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 15 percent by 2015. We blew that away! Leadership matters, and we have learned that if you set a goal, and you organize to achieve that goal, you go way beyond the goal. The city, the city staff, and the people— they want leadership! They want to see what the mayor wants. So, now we are at 40 percent reduction by 2025, ultimately leading to a zero-waste, carbon- neutral city by 2050.Zero WasteJB: Have these goals been documented in some way by city council resolutions?GS: Yes, we have passed it as a city council ordinance. Once we passed that ordinance, we set that goal. It included a very ambitious goal for the City of Phoenix of 40 percent waste diversion by 2020 and we are ahead of schedule on that. When I first was mayor six years ago, when I began, we were at 13 percent. We just passed the 30 percent mark in the last month. We are heading in the right direction. Mostly though public education. Just telling the people how easy it is to recycle. Participatory recycling. That’s been very successful.A Circular EconomyGS:. The City of Phoenix has lots of palm trees. People were dumping palm fronds into our landfill. Now we’ve got a company called Palm Silage that has a $10 million-a-year business by taking palm fronds out, grinding them up as animal feed, and selling it.We partnered with Goodwill. We put 60,000 mattresses into the landfill. All of that stuff is recyclable. And so, we are working with them, and we were able to make a ton of money based upon pulling mattresses apart and recycling the various component parts. You get the point.[A] circular economy is so important. Phoenix is the first north American city in the Ellen McArthur Circular Economy 100 organization. She has got us rethinking everything. It’s all about the circular economy. You want zero impact— not just a 40 percent diversion. You do well [by adopting a] circular economy, and you can achieve a 100 percent diversion.JB: What was the catalyst that started you on this path to come up with so many progressive renewable energy and presumably energy efficiency policies for Phoenix?GS: Why does anybody enter public life? You want to use that office for the betterment of humanity. . . I love serving in public service. I love it. I want to have the most impact that I can. If you want to do that, you go to the highest impact areas. There is no other area where you can have the biggest impact long-term than sustainability. If there is, I don’t know what it is..Secondarily, I’m an elected official and this is really popular! People want leadership on this issue. They understand that the impact they are having today is going to impact future generations. They get excited when we announce that we have successfully achieved our renewable energy goals or that we successfully reduced our greenhouse gas emissions. I go big with that! Press conferences and that sort of thing.Anticipating OppositionJB: Does it matter that Phoenix is blue?GS: On the partisan side of it?JB: Yes.GS: Phoenix is a pretty moderate city if you look at the political makeup. But as mayor, I want to show leadership. We are in a red state, and one of the big challenges we have is that we want to be progressive and aggressive when it comes to climate change-related issues. . . . What we don’t need is our legislature coming in because some special interest group doesn’t like what we’re doing and trying to preempt us. We had that happen on occasion.Sustainable Cities Attract TalentCities work best because people vote with their feet: They want to move to a community that reflects their values. Jobs want to go to cities that reflect their values. The number one economic development benefit is actually this: When it comes to economic development, more than anything, we are not chasing corporations, we are chasing talent. Talented young people want to move to a city that reflects their values. So you better have strong policies when it comes to sustainability if you are in the talent attraction business,.JB: Can I infer that this type of political platform would work well even within a Republican city?GS: That’s an interesting question. I am the mayor of Phoenix, and that is the best job I have ever had in government. I can’t really talk about other cities, but all I know is that whether you are a blue city or a red city or anywhere in between, you want to be a leader on economic development. You want to attract talent. It is the same reason why the City of Phoenix has very strong policies as it relates to non-discrimination against the LGBT community, or as we support the Latino community. High-wage companies, particularly technology companies, care about that.Micro-managing CitiesJB: As a mayor of a leading American city, how could state governments and the federal government be more supportive of cities that want to go in the direction that you’re going in?GS: I’ll start with the state. We’re not really asking much from the state—just don’t pass laws that stop us from doing what we’re trying to do. Economically, the City of Phoenix is doing great. We are one of the fastest growing economies in America. Our unemployment rate is well below the state average. Jobs and economic activity are happening in cities in part because we passed job sustainability policies.At the federal level, look, it is disappointing right now. I am the mayor, but I am an American, and I am really concerned about American leadership in the world on a variety of issues. But the first one, unfortunately, was when the President did decide to take us out of [the Paris climate agreement).Our Global Standing SuffersGS: Can the rest of the world trust America that when we make a commitment we’re going to live up to that commitment? And are they willing and motivated then to make another commitment, because Paris won’t be the last agreement that has to be [up]held? Can they trust the U.S.? Once you lose that trust it is so hard to get it back. So, I am very disappointed the President made the decision he did to pull us out. Not because of the immediate impact on our ability to meet our climate goals, but also because of the drop in our standing in the world. Yes, mayors are going to do everything we can to pick up the new mantle and make sure we meet those agreements through smart policies in our cities. We are going to do what we can. But make no mistake, there’s no substitute for having a supportive president, a supportive Congress, and right now I feel like we don’t have that.What the Feds Could DoJB: Yes. Now let’s look at the other side of the coin. It’s really hypothetical at the moment, but if the federal government were more aligned with clean energy, energy efficiency, and progressive politics, what could a federal government do that really wanted to supercharge or set a national mobilization in place? As Al Gore says, and many people recognize, time is of the essence here.GS: It’s true that you could pass incredibly smart and impactful public policies through use of tax credits, but also direct infrastructure investment. The U.S. cannot get out of the business of supporting cities throughout the country in these investments. The transportation industry that we talked about is only fully successful by leveraging federal resources.As a country, to let our roads be in the condition they are, our airports are falling behind, bridges etc. You know, basic transportation. But then, what about advancing infrastructure? What about investments in clean energy and solar in particular? Other governments are getting this. Germany gets it. They’ve got an industrial policy that supports green renewable energy. . . . There is a lot that the federal government can do. And they’re retreating. It is very disappointing.____________________John J. Berger, PhD.

Durham then attempts to pick him up.In a statement to HuffPost relayed by the university, Durham apologized to Austin and for taking the dispute “to a physical level.”“Lance and I have always had a brother-like relationship and brothers sometimes fight but, as I said before, the situation should have been handled in a more mature manner,” Durham said. “I’m glad that even after the incident, our friendship remains strong.”Austin said the video “is not beneficial to anyone.”“Step Durham apologized and we long ago put that incident behind us,” he said in a statement. “As far as I’m concerned, there’s no further need for an apology. I forgave him already and we have since played well together as teammates this season.”The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported that Austin and Durham did not appear to miss playing time this past season. Georgia Tech finished with a record of 5-6 after getting crushed by rival Georgia, 38-7, on Nov. 25.Both players were among the team’s top 10 tacklers.This story has been updated with comments from Durham and Austin."

Conyers must resign.”Last week, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), a second-term congresswoman, became the first Democrat in Congress to urge Conyers to resign.Earlier Tuesday, the civil rights icon’s former deputy chief of staff, who had worked for him in the 1990s, accused him of sexual misconduct, including an incident in which she said she refused his offer to have sex at a Washington hotel. Multiple former staffers had come forward last week with similar allegations, including one who received a previously undisclosed monetary settlement from him in 2015.Conyers has repeatedly denied the allegations. On Sunday, however, he announced he would step aside as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee pending the results of an ethics investigation.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) upped the pressure on Conyers late Tuesday by asking the House Ethics Committee if they needed additional resources to “expeditiously” conduct a sexual harassment investigation of the congressman.“As one who served seven years on the Ethics Committee, I know that the demands on staff and resources can at times be overstretched,” Pelosi wrote in a letter. “Should you need any additional resources to fairly and swiftly pursue these investigations, please make that need known.” "

The attacker, Devin Kelley, was able to legally purchase the firearm he used in his massacre because the Air Force did not report his domestic violence conviction appropriately.The military branch’s review is still ongoing, but should be completed within the next few months.Personnel at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, where Kelley was court-martialed for abusing his wife and stepson, “did not report required information to civilian law enforcement in the Kelley case,” the Air Force said in a statement Tuesday.The error was “not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations,” the statement said. A spokesperson for the Air Force could not confirm how many bases had similar problems.The Air Force is reviewing an estimated 60,000 incidents involving its service members since 2002, the spokesperson said. It’s also working to improve reporting, including training and implementing new procedures to double check cases are sent to the national database.Kelley was convicted by a general court-martial on two charges of domestic assault against his wife and stepson before being released with a bad conduct discharge in 2014.Under federal law, his conviction prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms. But because his offense was not entered into the federal database that gun sellers use to check the criminal history of potential buyers, he passed multiple background checks and was able to purchase guns, including the one he used to slaughter congregants at First Baptist Church.Local authorities have not released much information about the lead-up to the shooting, but said Kelley was in a domestic dispute with his wife and her family. He may have targeted the church because his mother-in-law worshipped there. She was not in attendance during the shooting, but his grandmother-in-law was. Kelley killed her.Members of Congress have introduced at least two bills in the wake of the massacre to ensure that the military submits domestic violence convictions to the background check system."
59,POLITICS,DOJ Lawyer Can't Guarantee Trump Won't Fire Bumped Leader Of Consumer Agency,Ryan J. Reilly and Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/consumer-financial-protection-agency-acting-director-trump_us_5a1c835ce4b04e8b2a83cd27,Leandra English and Mick Mulvaney both claim to be the rightful acting head of the bureau.,2017-11-28,"White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, right, is President Donald Trump's pick for acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, even though the outgoing director named a replacement.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1c9a05140000000eb6a087.jpeg?cache=wPaeM2jK9d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The federal government cannot guarantee that President Donald Trump will not fire a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official who is suing the president over his purported appointment of a former Republican congressman to a position she says is rightfully hers, a Justice Department official told a federal judge Monday evening. Attorneys representing two people who both believe they have the rightful claim to be acting head of the CFBP squared off at a hastily arranged hearing in federal court here. The hearing capped off what had been a frantic day at the CFPB, which has come under attack from Republicans who believe the agency has too much power.The 2010 Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB established a clear, if unusual, succession process. When a CFPB director resigns, according to the law, the agency’s deputy director immediately becomes its acting chief, serving out the remainder of the director’s term, unless the president appoints a new director who is confirmed by the senate. When CFPB Director Richard Cordray stepped down last week, he tapped recently appointed Deputy Director Leandra English to take over his job until July. But the Trump administration decided not to wait that long and instead appointed Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to the job and told him to show up at the CFPB on Monday.English, represented by attorney Deepak Gupta, filed suit Sunday night. Gupta told Judge Timothy J. Kelly, a recent Trump appointee, at the hearing Monday that he should maintain the status quo that was in place before Mulvaney showed up at the CFPB with doughnuts a few hours earlier. Letting Mulvaney take charge, Gupta argued, would “reward” bad behavior because the change took place after the lawsuit was filed. Gupta also squeezed in a reference to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, telling Kelly that the text of the statute should be clear. “There needs to be an answer to this question. There needs to be one soon,” Gupta said, predicting whatever decision the judge made would quickly be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. “Everyone needs to know who is the director of this bureau.” Kelly seemed cautious about the idea of issuing a preliminary injunction that would order the president to refrain from appointing someone, calling the idea of enjoining the president an “extraordinary remedy.” He made no immediate ruling Monday and said he planned to read an additional brief the government planned to file Monday night. Brett Shumate, a political appointee at the Justice Department, told Kelly that he was unaware of any plans to fire English. “I have no knowledge of that, your honor,” he said. But he later clarified that he could not guarantee that English would not be fired and added that the government did not believe that loss of position would be an “irreparable harm” that would necessitate an injunction. Shumate said English is still showing up at the office and getting a paycheck. But the “status quo” now, he said, is that Mulvaney is the acting director of the CFPB.“They’re treating him as the director,” Shumate said of CFPB employees. Putting English in charge would cause the president to suffer damage and would create widespread confusion within the agency, he said.Congress established the CFPB to combat consumer lending abuses after the subprime mortgage debacle led to millions of foreclosures and fueled the 2008 financial crisis. The agency has returned more than $12 billion in ill-gotten gains from banks to consumers since taking up its task. It most recently was involved in imposing a $100 million fine against Wells Fargo for illegally creating fake bank accounts. The CFPB has authority to rein in abusive practices across a broad spectrum of consumer credit, including student loans, payday loans, mortgages, credit cards and checking accounts.Mulvaney is ideologically opposed to the agency’s existence, having called the CFPB “the worst kind of government entity” and a “sad, sick joke” in congressional testimony. The president appeared to share Mulvaney’s sentiments in a tweet over the weekend.“The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!”Banking, despite the president’s claims, remains wildly profitable. In just the third quarter of this year alone, Wells Fargo posted a $4.6 billion profit, while Bank of America made $5.6 billion and JPMorgan Chase took home $6.7 billion.Top Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who came up with the idea for the CFPB after the financial crisis, have supported English as the acting director. Few doubt that Trump will eventually be able to appoint someone who does not support the agency’s mission as its top official. If English remains in office, her term will expire in July.But installing Mulvaney as acting director could lengthen the duration of Trump’s influence over the agency. Opponents of the CFPB don’t need the agency to actually function to win a political victory ― the whole point is to stymie its work and prevent it from interfering with bank business. If Mulvaney is able to effectively block the agency’s work, Trump would have no urgent need to appoint a permanent director. And the longer he waits to appoint one, the later the expiration date for the next director’s five-year term.This article has been updated to clarify language surrounding the succession process."

It was shown to the jury during Tuesday’s testimony of Officer Bryan Adelmeyer of the Metropolitan Police Department, who went undercover to suss out protesters’ plans for Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.The Project Veritas video may play a key role in a trial that could determine the fate of an additional 181 defendants still facing trials on several felony counts over the course of the next year. More than 200 people, including numerous journalists, were arrested en masse after windows were smashed in downtown Washington before the inauguration. One defendant pleaded guilty to felony rioting charges, and 19 others have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts. Seven additional defendants who initially faced felonies are now scheduled to face trial on misdemeanor charges next month.A total of 187 defendants, including the six currently on trial, have pending felony charges, with prosecutors alleging they were part of a conspiracy that resulted in extensive property damage and should therefore be held responsible for the actions of the other individuals they were arrested with. So far, prosecutors have not alleged that any of the six defendants on trial individually caused any destruction but instead argued that they enabled those who did. One of the defendants is a photographer who had taken an interest in covering demonstrations throughout the United States. Critics have long accused Project Veritas of deceptive practices. Hours before the video was played in D.C. Superior Court, The Washington Post reported that a woman working with Project Veritas tried to convince the newspaper to print false allegations against Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore, who has been credibly accused by multiple women of pursuing relationships with them when he was a prosecutor in his 30s and they were teens. But videos filmed by Project Veritas, which sought to infiltrate groups planning to disrupt Trump’s inauguration, have been used to secure at least one other conviction in a separate inauguration-related case.The government maintained on Tuesday that the video provided by Project Veritas wasn’t deceptively edited. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff initially tried to keep Project Veritas’ name out of the court record, referring to it only as a “third party provider” and objecting when one of the defense attorneys was about to name the organization.“Who provided it is irrelevant,” Kerkhoff told the judge out of the presence of the jury. “I have not disclosed the identify of the tapers.” After a defense attorney told Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz that the organization was “ultraconservative” and had a reason to potentially doctor the video, Kerkhoff relented, admitting to the judge it was provided by Project Veritas.Kerkhoff even said that the government had redacted the video themselves, concealing the identity of the Project Veritas affiliate who used a button camera to record the video as well as Adelmeyer’s image. Leibovitz, over the objections of defense attorneys who believed the video had not been properly authenticated, allowed the Project Veritas video to be shown to jurors. She ruled that because Officer Adelmeyer was present for much of the discussion captured in the video, he would know if it accurately reflected what he saw.Sam Menefee-Libey, who is handling press for a group of defendants and supporters of what has been dubbed J20 (for the Jan. 20 protests), called the government’s use of the video an overreach. He believes the government doesn’t want the name of the organization to come out because it undermines its credibility.“The judge has allowed the U.S. Attorney’s Office to get away with something that is incredibly questionable,” Menefee-Libey said. “Veritas has been roundly denounced by every reputable journalistic organization on the planet as being deceptive.”O’Keefe did not respond to several questions posed by HuffPost in an email on Tuesday but did send a tweet directed at a HuffPost reporter referencing his organization’s work during the inauguration. A Project Veritas representative provided links to prior coverage of its infiltration of protest organizations.Adelmeyer testified Tuesday that he did not film video or record audio when he attended the Jan. 8 meeting in an undercover capacity. It was only afterward that the government learned the meeting had been recorded by Project Veritas. Much of the discussion captured on the tape touched on the relatively progressive approach that the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department has taken toward protesters in recent years. Organizers did not believe that police would arrest them en masse or corral them, and one person found it “comforting” that the Metropolitan Police Department would be in charge of the areas they were protesting. The leader of a group, named Dylan, said its goal was to “make inauguration a giant clusterfuck.”In the tape, there was some talk of “unarresting” people ― meaning breaking individuals out of police custody ― and “resisting” attacks from the police and Trump supporters. There was also a brief mention of breaking windows: a caution not to do so during another event.Adelmeyer will face more aggressive questioning from defense attorneys on Tuesday morning. They’re expected to ask him about a civil lawsuit brought against him as well as any internal disciplinary actions he’s faced.Prosecutors, defense attorneys and Judge Leibovitz also engaged in a lengthy discussion outside of the presence of the jury about the use of the term “antifa,” which defense attorneys worried would give negative connotations to the jury. Judge Leibovitz was worried that simply saying antifa was short for anti-fascist would take away from the meaning of the term. “I assume if you polled the 15 people in the jury box, they’re not too crazy about fascism either,” she said. She ended up telling the jury that antifa was short for anti-fascist and that such a term should not be thought of as an indicator of violence. She also restricted the use of the term “black bloc” in the trial, saying the phrase for black-clad protesters should be used only when alleged conspirators used it.

It was shown to the jury during Tuesday’s testimony of Officer Bryan Adelmeyer of the Metropolitan Police Department, who went undercover to suss out protesters’ plans for Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.The Project Veritas video may play a key role in a trial that could determine the fate of an additional 181 defendants still facing trials on several felony counts over the course of the next year. More than 200 people, including numerous journalists, were arrested en masse after windows were smashed in downtown Washington before the inauguration. One defendant pleaded guilty to felony rioting charges, and 19 others have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts.

Scrolling through my Facebook news feed was enough to understand how other minorities felt by the controversial piece: many of my friends and the people I follow are in complete disagreement with the article and question where The New York Times stands in regard to white nationalism and supremacy.As a first-generation Dominican-American living in Miami, I attest to the story needing to be published. Although Miami is one of the southernmost cities in the United States, it’s actually more open-minded than not, and many people share similar ideologies. To this day, I’ve yet to see a Confederate flag waving on a lawn or a swastika tattooed on a person’s face. Conversely, it’s not necessarily what I see in Miami that startles me, but the conversations I hear.The reason I choose to live in Miami is simple: the Latin American culture. Miami takes me back to waking up to salsa music on Sunday mornings while my mother cleaned the house and my father cooked breakfast. To visiting the Hispanic islands and being able to throw practically any seed in the ground and watch fruits flourish day by day.Unfortunately, Miami also reminds me of the racist conversations members of the Latin American community frequently discuss. Things Hispanics in America (especially in Miami) say that contribute to our nation’s racism, like “I prefer to live in white neighborhoods because black people…” or “Don’t mess up ‘la raza’ (the ‘race’) by marrying a black person” are a major contribution to our nation’s racial discrimination ― especially said by those Latin Americans in the United States who consider themselves “liberal.”What shocked me most was when I snuck in to hear Trump’s speech when he came to Miami this past June. I originally went to attend a protest being held outside of the establishment where he was scheduled to speak, but somehow made my way inside. I sat on the mezzanine of the Manuel Artime Theater, where a middle-aged Cuban lady and her father sat to my right. She assumed that I was a supporter of Trump’s agenda and proceeded to spark conversation. Her major concern was Muslims “infiltrating” American society and how it would affect national security. Her words, however, degraded Muslims and people of color in general. The entire crowd (minus the media) showed their support of the administration’s agenda by cheering louder than any other group of people I’ve seen in Miami.Until then, I was in complete disbelief to the amount of Miamians in support of Trump. Regardless of why white Latin Americans were attending, it shows that white supremacy is also ingrained into Latin American culture in the United States ― specifically white Latin Americans in Miami. In fact, Miami schools are becoming more and more racially segregated, according to a Florida State University analysis ― which proves that segregated neighborhoods in Miami are alive and well. While Latin Americans in Miami claim to be patriotic Americans, they must have forgotten their indigenous and African roots, and crossed over to white nationalism and supremacy.The Times article discussed earlier is a perfect example of how normal white nationalism and supremacy in America truly is. Although the story of Tony and Maria Hovater’s life may seem morally worse to minorities simply because they are white Americans, if you remove the swastikas and Confederate flags, many Latin Americans aren’t any better ― we just have a more subtle way of showing it.Articles like the one published in The New York Times shouldn’t be something to be angry about. If anything, shedding light on how normal white supremacy in America has always been will better our understanding of why people share those ideologies, and what we can do to teach our children better."

Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy.In October Egyptian security forces arrested 57 people in a wave of arrests triggered by the raising of a rainbow flag at a music concert.The overwhelming majority of those arrested were not involved in the flag incident, however, and were arrested over their perceived sexual orientation in the following days."

To put everyone else’s needs before our own. Because that’s what mothers do. But when we allow ourselves to be completely sucked dry, we are in reality not only much less happy, but much less effective. And we’re setting up our kids to follow the same pattern in their lives.But, of course, we don’t want this for our kids. We want them to have rich, full lives as their authentic selves. So why do we allow less for ourselves?Here are some ways I’ve learned to nurture myself after being in the trenches of parenting. I still fail at some of them every day, but that’s ok. We should give ourselves the grace we give to others.Learn to listen to and honor your own needs. First we have to accept that we are worthy at all of having our needs met. Remind yourself that you also deserve to be cared for, and you are setting a better example for your kids when you are getting that care. Be unapologetic and relentless with following through on this and do not apologize for meeting your own needs.Listen to the different ways your body and soul are telling you that you have unmet needs: maybe it’s simple exhaustion, but it could also be anger and resentment; feeling emotionally shut down, unable to interact with anyone; feeling like you’re losing control, going off your own rails; hopelessness; feeling completely drained and sucked dry; or others pointing out that you seem off.Practice emotional boundaries, and don’t do everyone’s emotional labor. Women are conditioned our whole lives to do others’ (especially men’s) emotional labor; to manage their moods, to be a receptacle for their feelings, to word things carefully so as not to upset. And this is fine for our kids, since we are trying to teach them how to do these things themselves. But it is work, and it can be tiring. Realize how much you are doing this for others, and let go of what you can. This requires putting up healthy emotional boundaries, which women (especially moms) are not always accustomed to doing. But it’s ok to reserve your energy for yourself and your kids. Boundaries are good and healthy and keep us whole and sane.Build your support network. This has made the biggest difference in my life. First of all, having somewhere to go to just dump your feelings in the moment is crucial. Texting a friend, venting to your husband, posting in a private online group. Somewhere absolutely safe where you know you will be heard and supported, never judged. This can help you feel held up on days when you fear you are going under. But having friends in real life is important too, and evenings out with friends where you get real and connect and support each other are absolutely essential, and leave me feeling refreshed and filled up.It’s okay to ask for help. It can be hard to admit that we are struggling and to make ourselves vulnerable; but I am always more than happy to help support a friend when they need it. I value it when people let me in enough to ask for support. Don’t you? Then don’t be afraid to ask for it. If you are willing to have an open heart and let those close to you see the messiness inside you will find the help, support and friendship that you need.Get involved in your community. I know, you’re saying, I don’t have time for that! But feeling connected with your community, even in the smallest way, can have huge benefits in my experience. We are sorely missing the village and this can help fill part of that hole. You don’t have to do it all; just pick one thing, and contribute. It seems counter-intuitive, but there is nothing that fills us up like giving back.When all else fails, just connect. No matter what is going on, take some time each day to just connect with your kids, to set aside the parenting role and just listen to them and really see them as fellow humans. Whether it’s playing a game and laughing, cuddling on the couch, or just asking about something in their lives and listening–just connect. A little connection will make you feel closer to your kids and make you feel like a better parent.Conversely, set aside a contained time everyday to have the tough parenting conversations (NOT when you are angry!). Calmly state the problem, the expections and consequences. And then let that shit go. You’ve done your work for the day, lay that burden down. Don’t go on about it all day, don’t carry it around.Remember that love is infinite; patience and energy are not. It is completely unrealistic to expect ourselves to be patient all the time. And really, we don’t want to be Stepford moms. We don’t want to teach our kids that anger is a terrible thing that we should never feel. We should show them how to process it with love. But even though it’s best to do that, to say we’re feeling angry and why and take deep breaths and maybe give ourselves a time-out–well, we all still lose it sometimes. Because kids are crazy-making. And we are human. Forgive yourself and move on.Let go of control wherever possible. The idea that we have control over our kids is an illusion. They are people, with their own minds and hearts and motivations. We can influence and guide them, we can set boundaries and consequences. We can do our level best. We cannot “fix” them and it is not our responsibility to do so. They must experience the natural consequences of their actions in the world, and they will always learn better from their own failures than they will from us telling them the same damn thing a million times.Finally, don’t forget: Nurture yourself. Mother yourself. Speak to yourself like you would your kids, like you would a dear friend. Don’t say to yourself, “what the hell is wrong with you?” Instead say, as you would to your kids, with love and tenderness: “what do you need, honey?”Previously published as ‘Mothering Ourselves’ in Jami’s monthly BEHIND DOMESTIC LINES in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comCome join our “Behind Domestic Lines” Facebook group, a safe community for parents to share their experiences and support each other.SUPPORT JAMI’S WRITING!For some more great Wild Word essays:Why This Is Our ‘Women’s Lives Matter’ Moment by Maria BehanOn Speaking Our #MeToo Truths by Annie Mark-WestfallWhy Young Irish Women Are Marching for Choice by Lorna O’Hara"

Officers are still searching for the vandals, who apparently also damaged the frame of a large tent erected on the center’s property. No one was hurt in the attack.Ahmad Alattal, a coordinator at the center, told AFP that the incident isn’t the first time his mosque has been targeted. A little over a month ago, a glass bottle was reportedly broken against a window on the front door.“We are constantly receiving threats by email, on social media and also by phone,” Alattal said in an AFP video.Imam Youssef Chadid, a leader within Poland’s Muslim community, blamed the attack on a “not very friendly” atmosphere in the country toward Muslims and Islam.“I am 100 percent sure this was a racist, anti-Muslim attack,” Chadid said, according to The Associated Press.Warsaw police are reviewing security footage that showed at least two individuals participating in the attack. Authorities have asked the public to come forward with information.There are about 22,000 Muslims living in Warsaw, according to the AP. About 500 people attend prayers at Warsaw’s Muslim Cultural Centre. The mosque is one of two Islamic religious centers in Poland’s capital city. European Union leaders and human rights groups have expressed concerns about the growth of far-right and nationalist movements in Poland. Earlier this month, a march organized by far-right groups attracted 60,000 people. Some banners at the march contained racist and xenophobic slogans, calling for “pure blood, clear mind” and claiming that “Europe will be white or uninhabited.”In October, hundreds of Catholics in Poland gathered at the country’s borders to pray for their country. Participants told news outlets the prayer was a demonstration against Islam’s presence in Europe.Research shows that Poles tend to believe that their country is much more Muslim than it actually is. An Ipsos survey from 2016 found that Polish respondents estimated that 7 percent of the country’s population is Muslim. In fact, less than 0.1 percent of Poland’s population is Muslim, according to the Pew Research Center. In contrast, about 94.3 percent are Christian."

The 24-year-old man, who has only been identified by his surname of Oh, sustained organ damage from five gunshot wounds, and has since been treated for tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and intestinal worms, his doctors have said.During a broadcast on Sunday, the South made note of the solider’s pre-existing health conditions while criticizing the North, which struggles to feed its people and provide adequate health care services.The loudspeaker broadcasts serve as a kind of psychological warfare as the North tries to keep outside information from trickling in. Yonhap News, citing military officials, reported that North Koreans within 12 miles of the border are able to hear the speakers.North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, has not addressed the soldier’s defection.

In conversations with disheartened journalists, activists, lobbyists and other political operators, the closest answer that could be found was somewhat less than heartening.Murder … maybe? “Well, there was the politician who said you could do anything as long as you weren’t found in bed with a live boy or a dead girl,” recalled veteran political reporter and commentator Eleanor Clift, paraphrasing former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards (D). Clift cited Bob Packwood, the veteran Oregon Republican senator who was forced to resign in 1995 after 19 women ― some who had worked for him ― accused him of sexual misconduct. Despite being forced out of his seat under threat of expulsion, Packwood soon founded a successful lobbying firm, representing major corporate clients and appearing from time to time at hearings and other notable events in Washington. Mark Leibovich, New York Times Magazine chief national correspondent and author of This Town, this decade’s buzziest anthropological study of Washington, sees a shift in attitudes, but notes that D.C.’s culture of second chances runs deep ― at least for its public figures ― so long as the redeemed person is politically useful. “There has always been the barrel, and there have always been people spending time in it,” said Leibovich of periods of political exile and infamy. “What do you have to do to never emerge from the barrel? It’s a pretty forgiving barrel. The cushion is time.” “I do think it’s an interesting time for barrel sciences,” he added. Indeed, Washington has a dubious history of second acts: Oliver North is now a Fox News contributor; Anthony Weiner ran a viable campaign for mayor; Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) won re-election as a “pro-life” crusader after pressuring his mistress to get an abortion; Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) hiked the Appalachian Trail all the way back to Congress; former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) had a very public episode involving diapers and prostitutes, yet won re-election. While the dynamics of political scandals are certainly changing, whether there’s been a net improvement in how Washington metabolizes bad actors is another question altogether.On the one hand, as nearly everyone interviewed by HuffPost noted, the allegations of sexual misconduct against a number of public officials have prompted a long-overdue reckoning with sexual harassment and assault in politics. On the other hand, the increasing tribalism of today’s politics can distract from any number of sins, providing lifelines to perpetrators who might otherwise have not had a second chance in a pre-Fox News era. There is always a large audience of people ready to believe that the charges against you are politically motivated, so long as you’re willing to toe the line on their politics. It is in this context that cynicism creeps in — that despite the changing times, you still can’t help but wonder if a Russia Today show is entirely out of the question for Anthony Weiner when he gets out of prison.“I think all of politics now is becoming this weird reality TV show where Americans have given up on politics being something noble or something to look up to ― and that’s a rational decision, because it hasn’t been for a long, long time,” observed Sam Geduldig, a prominent Republican lobbyist and erstwhile senior aide to former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Figures like Moore can “cocoon themselves into a social media sphere that will accept them,” Leibovich noted, citing pro-Trump outlets like Breitbart News. To wit, in the last 12 months, Sebastian Gorka, a man with ties to Hungarian fascists and whose White House tenure could charitably be described as an utter disaster, landed a Fox News contributing gig; Sean Spicer enjoyed a soft landing with a teaching gig at Harvard and a cameo on the Emmys after an institution-damaging tenure as White House press secretary; and Greg Gianforte won a seat in Congress after being arrested for assaulting a reporter.And, of course, Donald Trump, a man who admitted on tape to sexually assaulting women, was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.Many people interviewed by HuffPost see the ethical waters being muddied by Trump’s electoral success. While they note that many victims now feel emboldened to speak out about the mistreatment they’ve endured, others might feel deflated by Trump’s success. Equally alarming, they add, is how Trump’s triumphs encourage bad actors.Jess McIntosh, editor-in-chief of the progressive website Shareblue and a former communications aide for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, believes Trump’s election encouraged conservatives of all stripes to defend bad behavior like Trump’s lest they be deprived of access and influence in Republican politics. “There’s a place for a mindful conservative voice, but you’re not getting a talk radio show,” said McIntosh. “You’re going on MSNBC, you’re writing an occasional New York Times op-ed.” “Either you become a king in that cesspool or you go away,” McIntosh concluded. What’s more, the current success of figures like Trump and Gianforte can denude lesser, though still serious, political transgressions of their shock value. Mair, looking back on Mark Sanford’s 2009 disappearance and subsequent botched cover-up of his mistress, noted with dark humor how that scandal now seems quaint by comparison. “Yes, he obviously lied about stuff; yes, he had an affair,” recalled Mair. “This wasn’t a guy who was diddling interns, this was a guy who had an affair because he truly loved somebody. It was the purest form of ethical malfeasance.” Jim Manley, who served as communications director for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), echoed that dispiriting sentiment. “In this day and age, the fallback appears to be, ‘Thank God the member appears to not be sleeping with an intern,’” he said.Or, as one senior Republican lobbyist speaking on condition of anonymity put it: “Consensual infidelity is the new chivalry.”  Former Congressman Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is perhaps the best current example of how the “anything goes” attitude of the Trump era and the increasingly tribal nature of our politics can serve as lifelines to fallen politicians.Grimm, who in 2014 pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud and once threatened to throw a reporter over a Capitol Hill balcony on live TV, announced in October that he will seek his old seat representing Staten Island. His announcement was followed by a photo of him posing with former Trump adviser and Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon.“Michael Grimm could make it back,” asserted Geduldig. “In light of all else that is out there, the bar has been lowered. Truly inappropriate behavior that had previously gone unreported is the new bar. What Mark Halperin did is worse than any shit that Michael Grimm did.” So what about Moore? Assuming, for the sake of argument, that he either loses his election or is expelled from the Senate ― though assuming such things is often a recipe for disappointment in Washington and politics ― what’s next for a man accused by no less than six women of sexual impropriety? Perhaps a book deal with a conservative imprint? Or a talk radio program on a far-right radio network? Or a Sean Hannity-style show on the conservative OAN TV network? Perhaps ― dare we indulge our most cynical impulses ― another run for Senate?No one HuffPost spoke to was willing to say that Moore would disappear from politics completely, absent jail time.“It wouldn’t shock me, if Roy Moore loses, to see him in Des Moines at some point in the next few years,” predicted Leibovich.Hear Eliot Nelson talk about this story on the HuffPost Politics podcast: "

There is always a large audience of people ready to believe that the charges against you are politically motivated, so long as you’re willing to toe the line on their politics. It is in this context that cynicism creeps in — that despite the changing times, you still can’t help but wonder if a Russia Today show is entirely out of the question for Anthony Weiner when he gets out of prison.“I think all of politics now is becoming this weird reality TV show where Americans have given up on politics being something noble or something to look up to ― and that’s a rational decision, because it hasn’t been for a long, long time,” observed Sam Geduldig, a prominent Republican lobbyist and erstwhile senior aide to former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Figures like Moore can “cocoon themselves into a social media sphere that will accept them,” Leibovich noted, citing pro-Trump outlets like Breitbart News. To wit, in the last 12 months, Sebastian Gorka, a man with ties to Hungarian fascists and whose White House tenure could charitably be described as an utter disaster, landed a Fox News contributing gig; Sean Spicer enjoyed a soft landing with a teaching gig at Harvard and a cameo on the Emmys after an institution-damaging tenure as White House press secretary; and Greg Gianforte won a seat in Congress after being arrested for assaulting a reporter.And, of course, Donald Trump, a man who admitted on tape to sexually assaulting women, was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.Many people interviewed by HuffPost see the ethical waters being muddied by Trump’s electoral success. While they note that many victims now feel emboldened to speak out about the mistreatment they’ve endured, others might feel deflated by Trump’s success. Equally alarming, they add, is how Trump’s triumphs encourage bad actors.Jess McIntosh, editor-in-chief of the progressive website Shareblue and a former communications aide for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, believes Trump’s election encouraged conservatives of all stripes to defend bad behavior like Trump’s lest they be deprived of access and influence in Republican politics. “There’s a place for a mindful conservative voice, but you’re not getting a talk radio show,” said McIntosh. “You’re going on MSNBC, you’re writing an occasional New York Times op-ed.” “Either you become a king in that cesspool or you go away,” McIntosh concluded. What’s more, the current success of figures like Trump and Gianforte can denude lesser, though still serious, political transgressions of their shock value. Mair, looking back on Mark Sanford’s 2009 disappearance and subsequent botched cover-up of his mistress, noted with dark humor how that scandal now seems quaint by comparison. “Yes, he obviously lied about stuff; yes, he had an affair,” recalled Mair. “This wasn’t a guy who was diddling interns, this was a guy who had an affair because he truly loved somebody. It was the purest form of ethical malfeasance.” Jim Manley, who served as communications director for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), echoed that dispiriting sentiment. “In this day and age, the fallback appears to be, ‘Thank God the member appears to not be sleeping with an intern,’” he said.Or, as one senior Republican lobbyist speaking on condition of anonymity put it: “Consensual infidelity is the new chivalry.”  Former Congressman Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is perhaps the best current example of how the “anything goes” attitude of the Trump era and the increasingly tribal nature of our politics can serve as lifelines to fallen politicians.Grimm, who in 2014 pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud and once threatened to throw a reporter over a Capitol Hill balcony on live TV, announced in October that he will seek his old seat representing Staten Island. His announcement was followed by a photo of him posing with former Trump adviser and Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon.“Michael Grimm could make it back,” asserted Geduldig. “In light of all else that is out there, the bar has been lowered. Truly inappropriate behavior that had previously gone unreported is the new bar. What Mark Halperin did is worse than any shit that Michael Grimm did.” So what about Moore? Assuming, for the sake of argument, that he either loses his election or is expelled from the Senate ― though assuming such things is often a recipe for disappointment in Washington and politics ― what’s next for a man accused by no less than six women of sexual impropriety? Perhaps a book deal with a conservative imprint? Or a talk radio program on a far-right radio network? Or a Sean Hannity-style show on the conservative OAN TV network? Perhaps ― dare we indulge our most cynical impulses ― another run for Senate?No one HuffPost spoke to was willing to say that Moore would disappear from politics completely, absent jail time.“It wouldn’t shock me, if Roy Moore loses, to see him in Des Moines at some point in the next few years,” predicted Leibovich.Hear Eliot Nelson talk about this story on the HuffPost Politics podcast: "

But Mulvaney, who tried to dismantle the agency when he served in the U.S. House of Representatives, faces a challenge from Leandra English, who was named temporary head of the agency by outgoing director Richard Cordray hours beforehand.Both issued statements on Monday morning indicating they were in charge.English sent an email in which she welcomed staff back from the Thanksgiving holiday and signed off as “acting director,” according to a source.But Mulvaney stood his ground, writing in a staff email an hour later:“Please disregard any instructions you receive from Ms. English in her presumed capacity as Acting Director,” he said in a memo seen by Reuters. “If you receive additional communications from her today ... please inform the General Counsel.”Mulvaney also signed off as “acting director” and invited staff to pop by his office on the fourth floor to “grab a donut.”The same source said that as Mulvaney was getting settled in, CFPB general counsel Mary McLeod sent a memo she had prepared on Sunday to the CFPB’s legal division agreeing with an opinion of the U.S. Justice Department that Trump had the power to appoint Mulvaney as temporary leader of the watchdog.(Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Additional reporting by Pete Schroeder; Writing by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by Eric Meijer and Bill Trott)"

A new study suggests the systemic changes scientists say are necessary to avoid the worst effects of warming temperatures will not be done by corporations alone.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1c7365140000ea16b69fe7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Billionaires, bankers and corporate executives have trumpeted a new era of sustainable capitalism for years, promising that advances in renewable energy and a rising generation of socially conscious tycoons would radically change an economic system addicted to fossil fuels.But a study published this month in the peer-reviewed Academy of Management Journal found that several big companies that had announced ambitious sustainability goals retreated when profits decreased or top executives changed. The research tracked five major Australian firms in different sectors over 10 years, examining company reports, media releases and policy statements and conducting more than 70 interviews with senior managers. Between 2005 and 2015, the unnamed companies ― in energy, manufacturing, finance, insurance and media, with workforces ranging from 1,500 to 36,000 employees ― adopted progressive climate policies with much fanfare, only to quietly scale back the efforts in the years that followed. The findings highlight the limitations of relying on market forces to combat climate change and dangers of allowing corporations beholden to the financial interests of shareholders to shape policy. It suggests the systemic changes scientists say are necessary to avoid the worst effects of warming temperatures will require massive government spending and regulation.“There’s so much hype about corporate good deeds, corporations will save us,” Christopher Wright, a co-author of the study and professor at the University of Sydney Business School, told HuffPost by phone on Sunday. “It’s so at odds with the reality that it’s pretty frightening.”He and his co-author, the University of Newcastle’s Daniel Nyberg, identified three distinct phases in the companies they studied. In the first phase, the companies laid out the “framing,” or business case for climate action. In doing so, they made bold announcements using words like “innovation,” “opportunity,” “leadership,” and “win-win outcomes,” while avoiding more negative terms such as “regulation” and “sacrifice.” The new policies included internal carbon pricing schemes, renewable energy investments or the launch of initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The second phase involved “localizing” the issue with steps to reduce energy consumption, begin using “green” products and services, and promote the need for climate action. Internally, this included retrofitting facilities with energy-saving lighting and creating new positions such as a chief sustainability officer to oversee progress. Externally, programs like this spurred most major corporations, including oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell that spent years funding climate change denial, to support the Paris climate agreement in 2015.But in the final stage, this progress began to deteriorate. The third phase marked the return to “normalization,” where climate change initiatives wound down and market concerns took priority.During this period, shareholders, financial analysts or managers pressured the firm to reduce costly climate initiatives and pursue new fossil-fuel-related business opportunities, such as hydraulic fracturing or tar sands oil, as the researchers observed at the manufacturing firm. Political pressure also played a role, as conservatives shifted the Australian government away from climate change-related policies in favor of increased fossil fuel extraction. The reversal at companies also took the form of a new chief executive coming in to promote a “back to basics” strategy. In an interview for the study, one senior manager at the insurance company summed it up like this: “Look, that was all a nice thing to have in good times but now we’re in hard times. We get back to core stuff.”Recent research seems to confirm the findings. Fossil fuel emissions hit an all-time high in 2017 as carbon dioxide emissions surged for the first time in three years, climate scientists announced earlier this month. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions ― greenhouse gases that each trap 30 and 300 times more heat than carbon dioxide ― are also on the rise, European Union scientists said last month. Meanwhile, companies are barely making a dent, making it only 31 percent of the way to reducing emissions to levels needed to keep the world from warming beyond the point scientists say climate change will become unmanageable, a study released last month by the green investor nonprofit CDP found.“You’re looking at systemic economic change,” Wright said. “Given that scale, it’s not surprising then, perhaps, that there has been so little action.”Addressing climate change requires a full rethinking of the economic theories that have dominated politics in developed countries for decades, he said. In the 1980s, conservative governments under President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pushed for aggressive deregulation under the auspice that, freed of high taxes and bureaucratic red tape, companies and wealthy people would spread their fortunes around in the form of job-creating investments. A decade later, in the 1990s, President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, adopted a similar skepticism of the role of the state. The concept, favoring limited state intervention and widespread privatization, is called neoliberalism.“We need to be rethinking the whole way in which we’re handing over the future of our societies to markets and corporations,” Wright said. “That was the consensus in the late ’80s and ’90s, that that was the way to do it. Unfortunately it’s the exact opposite.”Yet corporate interests dominate international negotiations on climate change. At the United Nations’ annual climate change summit this month, Ukraine introduced a proposal to give some of the world’s largest polluters a bigger say over how the Paris climate deal gets implemented. The United States, which pushed for increased coal and fossil fuel use despite President Donald Trump’s promise to withdraw from the Paris agreement, backed the proposal.In March, developing countries, including some of the nations most vulnerable to sea level rise, called for new regulations to limit the influence of corporate lobbyists on rich countries’ climate delegations. “These corporations are so powerful,” Chebet Maikut, a representative for Uganda, told The New York Times. “We need a stronger rule book.”Stark contradictions abound with even the most vocally eco-conscious corporate giants. Walmart touts itself as an environmental leader and said in February it’s “staying on track to fight climate change.” Yet the retail behemoth refuses to add an environmentalist to its board of directors, insisting the founding Walton family’s billionaire patriarch’s philanthropy qualifies him as an expert. Apple ― which hired Lisa Jackson as its sustainability chief after she served as Environmental Protection Agency administrator during President Barack Obama’s first term ― issued a $1 billion green bond in June, vowing to become one of the greenest corporations. But the iPhone maker contributes to an ever-growing electronic waste problem by fighting to ban its customers from repairing their devices. Financial titans JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock participated in talks calling for more aggressive climate change action this month, but continue to fund oil drilling in the Amazon rainforest. “The corporate message seems to be to rebang the drum on markets and technology and certainly make no mention of coercive regulations or laws limiting what they do,” he said. “If anything, it’s about giving them space to self-regulate, which again fits with that neoliberal creed.” He sighed. “I’m pessimistic about the future.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1c32bd140000015450f607.jpeg?cache=jnLWlMCzaB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been eight years since Adam Lambert stepped out of the “American Idol” spotlight with his debut album, “For Your Entertainment.” Released on Nov. 23, 2009, the album established the singer-songwriter as a pop provocateur, thanks to his sexed-up performance of the title track at that year’s American Music Awards. When it came to his artistic direction, Lambert now says RCA Record executives didn’t always have his back. Lambert, 35, marked the anniversary of his album’s release last week with an Instagram post that revealed just how far the music industry has come in the past eight years. He posted the cover of “For Your Entertainment” along with an alternate black-and-white cover used for retailers he says felt “uncomfortable” with the original. “I was feelin my gender fluid (and fully photoshopped) glam rock fantasy,” Lambert recalled in the post. “The powers that be released a second cover for retailers who felt ‘uncomfortable’ [with] the original.”Seeing the images side by side, he added, “seems so funny now,” noting that “it was a much different climate” eight years ago. Indeed, a number of queer-identifying artists willing to explore gender and sexuality in their music and performances have been riding high on the charts in the years since the release of “For Your Entertainment.”Grammy winner Sam Smith, who happens to be a pal of Lambert’s, recently made headlines for rocking stiletto heels and shunning gender labels, noting, “I don’t know what the title would be, but I feel just as much woman as I am man.”Similarly, Troye Sivan has made colorful nail polish part of his signature look. Lambert, who is currently touring Europe with legendary rock band Queen, said he’s happy to have helped paved the way for artists like Smith, 25, and Sivan, 22. “Look at all the gender fluidity stuff that’s become the conservation right now. The kids coming up right now are less hung up on stereotypical gender roles,” he told the Express and Star on Friday. “It’s funny, because I look at kids rocking some nail polish or a little glitter and I’m like, ‘Do you guys think this is new? I’ve been doing this for years.’”Catch the latest in LGBTQ news by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter. "
