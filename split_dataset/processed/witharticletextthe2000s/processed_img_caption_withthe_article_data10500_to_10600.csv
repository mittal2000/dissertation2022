That’s how it all goes down.” While Minhaj spent most of his routine mocking Trump — including several jabs at the president’s alleged ties to Russia and his late-night tweets — the comedian also took aim at Bill O’Reilly, Jeff Sessions, Hillary Clinton, CNN and many other media organizations.He ended his routine with a more somber nod to the importance of a free press, noting how “amazing” it is for the press corps to host an annual dinner in which the president is openly mocked. “Even the president is not beyond the reach of the First Amendment,” he said. “But the president didn’t show up, because Donald Trump doesn’t care about free speech.”“I’m proud that all of us are here tonight to defend that right,” he continued, “even if the man in the White House never would.”Watch his full roast below:Read more on the 2017 White House Correspondents’ Dinner here."

4,POLITICS,Rob Quist Turned Down A Visit From DNC Chair Tom Perez,Daniel Marans and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-quist-turned-down-dnc-bernie-sanders_us_5904e8c6e4b05c39767ff02d,But Bernie Sanders is welcome.,2017-04-29,"Rob Quist, the Democratic House candidate in Montana, turned down a visit from Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5904e9c42600003596c4871e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rob Quist, the folk music star-turned-Democratic House candidate in Montana’s special election, declined an offer for the Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez to campaign for him in the state, an inside source says.The Quist campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The DNC declined to do so. The national Democratic Party has endured criticism from progressive activists for failing to provide support to Quist and other long-shot special election candidates. But some Democratic operatives argue that their involvement can nationalize a race in a way that is sometimes unhelpful to candidates running in Republican-leaning districts.On its face, Quist’s decision to reject the DNC’s offer of in-person assistance affirms this theory. Montana has lately trended Republican in national elections, and a visible presence from the chair of Democratic Party could prove a liability among independents and Republican swing voters.However, Quist has welcomed the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who the Montana Democrat backed in the 2016 presidential primary. Sanders announced this month that he would campaign for Quist some time before the May 25 special election.It can’t hurt that Quist is running a populist campaign in the Sanders mold. He emphasizes his support for protecting Montana’s federally owned public lands and a single-payer health care system. In a not-so-subtle dig at GOP opponent Greg Gianforte, a tech millionaire who moved to Montana from New Jersey, Quist ran an ad criticizing the disproportionate number of millionaires in Congress.With less than a month to go, Quist needs all the help he can get. He announced a $1.3-million fundraising haul earlier this month, but a new poll shows him trailing Gianforte by 15 points.Still, the contrast in Quist’s apparent attitudes toward the DNC and Sanders, respectively, reflects the delicate balance the Democratic Party is striking as it seeks to revive its electoral prospects. Sanders, who has caucused with Democrats for decades and is a member of Senate Democratic leadership, officially remains an independent. Despite that distinction ― or perhaps because of it ― the senator is the most popular elected official in the country, according to a recent Harvard-Harris poll.That has effectively made Sanders’ stamp of approval one of the most coveted endorsements in the Democratic Party. Like Quist, Democrat James Thompson, who held the Republican to an unexpectedly tight margin in the special election for Kansas’ deep-red 4th district this month, also sought and received Sanders’ blessing.The party clearly recognized this reality when Perez teamed up with Sanders for the cross-country “Stand Up, Fight Back” tour last week. Not all candidates view Sanders as an asset, of course. Jon Ossoff, the Democrat running to fill an open House seat in the affluent and heavily Republican Georgia’s 6th district, has not asked for Sanders’ blessing, the senator told HuffPost. (Sanders nonetheless expressed his hope that Ossoff would win the June 20 runoff.)"
5,POLITICS,The Resistance Gave Birth To A Girl And Her Name Is Hannah Risheq,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-democrats-hannah-risheq_us_59021e02e4b081a5c0fbbe0d,The 25-year-old Muslim-Jewish Democrat is running for office to protect her Virginia district from Donald Trump.,2017-04-29,Risheq talks to a supporter at her campaign launch party. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5901038e1400001f00a9c063.jpeg?ops=crop_90_107_828_613%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"CHANTILLY, Va. ― Do Hannah Risheq a favor. Don’t tell her she should be focusing on her wedding plans.Risheq, 25, is getting married later this year, and of course she’s thrilled. But as she knocks on doors and hits events in this Fairfax County suburb, introducing herself as a Democratic candidate for the state House of Delegates, people keep telling her she’s too young to run for office ― she should be out having fun, maybe planning that wedding.“This is something that drives me up the wall,” said Risheq. “A wedding is a party. A wedding isn’t going to decide my fate as a citizen. This is more important.”“I wonder if they would say that to a man,” she muttered.Risheq, who is a social worker, is about as atypical a political candidate as it gets. Besides being a young woman, she is both Muslim and Jewish ― her dad is a Muslim immigrant from Palestine, and her mom is Jewish American. She’s running an entirely grassroots campaign that doesn’t take corporate money, and is trying to unseat a Republican incumbent, James LeMunyon, who has held the seat since 2009.Risheq’s bid for Virginia’s 67th District is a long shot. She just announced her candidacy last month, which didn’t leave her much time to build name recognition or fundraise ahead of the mid-June Democratic primary. And she has two Democratic opponents; one of them, 38-year-old local leader Karrie Delaney, has been campaigning since September and raised more than $68,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Risheq has raised $7,000.But the way Risheq sees it, she knows the policy issues key to this race, and she has the energy and desire to fight for a community that she loves. That’s what it really takes, she figures. Even if she doesn’t have the most money, she’s more interested in having the best, most organized volunteers rallying support for her.Risheq has two master’s degrees: one in public health from nearby George Mason University, and one in social work from Columbia University in New York. She moved back to Virginia in January after finishing her most recent degree, and says she doesn’t see the point of waiting 10 years to run for office if she’s ready now.“The thing is, they say they want young people to get involved. And then when you show up after getting an education and getting life experience, and you come back to your hometown and you are ready to make the difference, they’re like, ‘Well, you’ve been gone too long,’” she said, throwing her arms up. “Well? I’m 25. When did you want me to get involved? So, I’m here.”Risheq is a novice, sure, but she’s got a distinct advantage: her timing. She embodies the spirit of what is driving the Democratic Party forward right now. The past few months have seen tens of thousands of people, outraged by Donald Trump’s presidency, signing up to help elect Democrats to office or to run for office themselves. EMILY’s List, an organization that backs female candidates, said last week that it’s heard from more than 11,000 women in all 50 states interested in running for office since Trump’s win.This resurgence of progressive activism has already led to some stunning developments. Earlier this month, a Democratic congressional candidate in Kansas nearly pulled off a shocking win in a heavily Republican district. In Georgia, 30-year-old Democratic newcomer Jon Ossoff is heading into a runoff race for a congressional seat he almost won outright in a longtime GOP district. Democrats in Illinois, many of whom had never run for office before, just won a spate of local elections in Republican regions.There’s something going on in Virginia, too. Last week, Democrat Jacqueline Smith won a special election for Prince William County Circuit Court Clerk, a low-profile job but one that she has after defeating Republican state Del. Jackson Miller. He had far greater name recognition and was widely favored to win, having outraised Smith 6-to-1. That race was the first time Virginia voters have gone to the polls since Trump’s win in November.Amanda Litman, a co-founder of Run For Something, a grassroots organization that recruits and trains progressive millennials to run for office, sees Risheq as part of the next generation of leaders. The group, which has heard from 9,000 people under the age of 35 interested in running for office, has been connecting volunteers with Risheq’s campaign.“Hannah is an amazing candidate ― exactly the kind of person Run for Something exists to help,” Litman said. “She’s passionate, smart, willing to do the work, and her personal experience as a young woman and Arab-American will make the Virginia legislature a better, more representative governing body.”Policy-wise, Risheq is a pretty typical Democrat. She’s pro-choice. She supports LGBTQ rights. She supports protecting the Affordable Care Act and expanding Medicaid. She’s particularly focused on the need for more resources for mental health and substance abuse services. But her background has given her some experiences others don’t share.She remembers how it felt when she was a child and someone burned down her parents’ restaurant outside of Asheboro, North Carolina.That wasn’t long after her parents found a business card from the grand wizard of the North Carolina Ku Klux Klan taped to the front door of their restaurant, with a warning written on the back: “Either you leave now or we burn the place down.”They relocated to Greensboro and opened a new restaurant, and business boomed until the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Customers, aware her father was Muslim, stopped coming. Her parents lost most of their friends. They had to close the restaurant and struggled to regain financial footing. It took its toll on Risheq, whose grades plummeted in school. She started attending a Christian church so people wouldn’t see her as Muslim or Jewish.“We were isolated. We received hate mail. We were discriminated against,” said Risheq. “I was not invited to birthday parties ― things as a child that are really important to you.”That changed when her family moved to northern Virginia in 2010, where they felt welcomed as a multicultural, multi-religious household. Her parents started a successful business. Risheq thrived, living in a community where, at last, she felt diversity was celebrated.So when Trump became president, Risheq worried that his divisive rhetoric would drown out voices like hers and erode the goodwill in her community. She looked around at what she could do and learned about the upcoming elections for the state House. She also learned how white and male the state legislature is: Just 17 percent of Virginia legislators are minorities, and 19 percent are women. She decided the best way to protect her community was to represent it.“I want to make sure that everyone, especially children of nontraditional backgrounds or identities, feels comfortable and accepted being who they are,” she said. “My parents taught me a lot about compromise and about bringing splintered groups together. A lot of my friends are part of different marginalized groups, LGBTQ groups, other young women. I’m running because I want to give a voice to everyone.”Risheq hosted a couple dozen people at her house for a campaign launch party last Sunday afternoon. Her parents were there, quietly refilling trays of dolmas and macaron cookies for people to pick over as they mingled and met Risheq. Her father, Khaled, admitted he was a little surprised she wanted to run for office so soon, but said he understood why she’s doing it.“Between her mom’s background and my background, she felt urgent about needing to do something,” said Khaled. “I came from the Middle East. Every time I go back, I feel it’s the same. Why? It’s because it’s the same people, nobody else from outside the system … For this country, it’s really, really important for young people to take over. We don’t want to have the same old, same old.”Some of the party’s attendees, like Kelly Carnes and Jen Renken, drove 45 minutes from Washington, D.C., to meet Risheq and see how they could help her campaign. They left thinking they may do some phone banking for her.“We admire that Hannah is taking the initiative to get involved and do something,” said Carnes, 32. “We feel overwhelmed in D.C., where there are so few representative positions that we can hold there. To make a difference, we can come out here and give encouragement and rally for the cause out here.”Risheq won over at least one voter that day. Kevin Hicks, a 47-year-old engineer who lives down the street from her, said he walked over to see who this young female candidate was that he kept hearing about. After she spoke to the room, Hicks said he really liked her advocacy for stronger mental health services in the district and her emphasis on inclusion.“I work in the technology industry, so I work with people that are [in the U.S. with] H-1B [work visas], and I really have come to value our immigrant population,” said Hicks. “It elevates the competitive nature of everything.”Hicks brought his daughter Louise, 17, who is too young to vote but has been following Risheq’s race. She said she’s on an advisory council to her high school’s board, and has noticed that while her community is diverse, its leadership is not.“When I went on [Risheq’s] website and read, ‘I’m a millennial, I think millennials should get involved,’ I was excited,” said the teen.Louise’s father is excited, too. Though Risheq might take heat for being too young and lacking the experience to represent a district of nearly 80,000 people, he said, given how politically divided the country is, Risheq may be just the kind of leadership needed right now.“I might vote for her just because she doesn’t know anything,” Hicks said with a laugh. “I think she’s got a good case to say, ‘I’m going to listen to people.’ At least, she’ll get my support.”"

But his protest chant, soundtracked by a big speaker blasting Public Enemy’s anthem “Fight The Power,” rings loud.“This is what democracy looks like,” he shouted as protesters, marching in New York City’s only official climate march on Saturday afternoon, streamed past the power plant.The People’s Climate March began in 2014 as a massive protest in Manhattan. But this year, with environmental regulations under assault from a new president who dismissed climate change as a hoax, organizers encouraged as many people as possible to join thousands for a mass march in Washington, D.C.Knowing not everyone could make the trip, Nathaniel, a community organizer in Queens for nonprofit food pantry City Harvest, assembled a sister march through New York City’s biggest and most diverse borough. The march began outside a public housing development in Queens’ Woodside neighborhood and snaked through the borough’s otherwise quiet residential streets, stopping off at four different public housing projects.“This is bigger than one block, two blocks, one NYCHA development or four NYCHA developments,” Nathaniel told HuffPost, using the acronym for the New York City Housing Authority. The last stop, the Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement, served as a microcosmic example of the larger environmental problem about which Nathaniel hoped to raise awareness: that low-income people and communities of color often suffer the worst effects of the greenhouse gas pollution warming the planet and rapidly changing the climate. The housing project sits sandwiched between the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, where a steady stream of vehicles spew exhaust all day, and the one of the dirtiest power plants in New York State.Ravenswood produces about 2.3 million metric tons of emissions each year, according to figures the Queens Tribune cited. That’s equivalent to about 500,000 cars. Unlike many plants that run on cleaner-burning natural gas alone, the power station burns 3,264,000 gallons of fuel oil per year. Under a law passed in 2015, the plant has until 2020 to switch over to a cleaner fuel. But lawmakers have recently stepped up efforts to probe emissions from the plant, citing health problems for people who live nearby. “For decades, power plants in our communities here in western Queens have strongly contributed to increased asthma rates and increases in hospitalizations and ER visits that exceed the average in Queens,” said Costa Constantinides, a Democrat who represents the area on the city council, in December. “Our city has made great progress on ending the use of dirty fuel oil in buildings. Now more than ever, these plants must become better neighbors and stop the practice.”The march wasn’t locals only. Protesters came from around the city and surrounding suburbs. Tina Nannaroni, who lives in the Forest Hills area of Queens, said she got up at 5 a.m. to take a bus to Washington, D.C., only to learn her ride had been mysteriously canceled. “In 1965, they sabotaged the anti-Vietnam marches by canceling the buses,” she said. “I don’t know if that’s what happened, or if it’s just incompetence.” Evelyn Fenick and Stephen Judd took the train in from Connecticut to march with matching signs that read “Just Cuz The Climate Killed The T. Rex Doesn’t Mean Rex T. Gets To Kill The Climate,” a reference to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who previously served as chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp. “It blew up,” Nathaniel said. “This is urgent, it’s important for a lot of people, you can no longer work in silos. It’s all community, it’s all climate justice.” "

But lawmakers have recently stepped up efforts to probe emissions from the plant, citing health problems for people who live nearby. “For decades, power plants in our communities here in western Queens have strongly contributed to increased asthma rates and increases in hospitalizations and ER visits that exceed the average in Queens,” said Costa Constantinides, a Democrat who represents the area on the city council, in December. “Our city has made great progress on ending the use of dirty fuel oil in buildings. Now more than ever, these plants must become better neighbors and stop the practice.”The march wasn’t locals only. Protesters came from around the city and surrounding suburbs. Tina Nannaroni, who lives in the Forest Hills area of Queens, said she got up at 5 a.m. to take a bus to Washington, D.C., only to learn her ride had been mysteriously canceled. “In 1965, they sabotaged the anti-Vietnam marches by canceling the buses,” she said. “I don’t know if that’s what happened, or if it’s just incompetence.” Evelyn Fenick and Stephen Judd took the train in from Connecticut to march with matching signs that read “Just Cuz The Climate Killed The T. Rex Doesn’t Mean Rex T. Gets To Kill The Climate,” a reference to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who previously served as chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp. “It blew up,” Nathaniel said. “This is urgent, it’s important for a lot of people, you can no longer work in silos. It’s all community, it’s all climate justice.” "
8,POLITICS,EPA Purges Pages That Highlight Climate Change From Its Website,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-website-climate-change_us_5904bd23e4b0bb2d086ee483,The agency says it's making the changes to reflect the new leadership.,2017-04-29, Users now have to scroll to the bottom of the EPA's website to see an archived version of the site that contains information containing climate change.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5904bfd51c00003a00e82650.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Environmental Protection Agency removed portions of its website related to climate change on Friday evening ― hours before thousands were set to protest President Donald Trump’s environmental policy.Sections dealing with climate change were only part of what is being reviewed, the agency said in a Friday press release. The EPA was making the changes “reflect the approach of new leadership,” it said.“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land, and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said J.P. Freire, the EPA’s associate administrator for public affairs, in a statement. “We want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”The Hill noted that pages dealing with climate change and its impacts, climate science, and what readers can do to combat climate change now say they are being updated. The agency has also updated a page on the Clean Power Plan, which the Obama administration had implemented, to reflect the Trump administration’s effort to undo it. The EPA did leave in place a snapshot of the website under the Obama administration, which visitors can see only if they scroll to the bottom of epa.gov.The EPA made the changes to reflect the agency’s “new direction” under Trump and Administrator Scott Pruitt. Trump has suggested that climate change is a hoax and Pruitt has repeatedly questioned how much human beings are contributing to it.But the science on climate change is overwhelmingly clear. Ninety-seven percent of actively publishing climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends are extremely likely due to human activity.Astrid Caldas, a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the changes were deliberately made to coincide with Saturday’s climate march.“At a time when Americans are increasingly experiencing climate impacts in their daily lives, the administration has seemingly buried its head in the sand,” Caldas said in a statement. “The administration appears to have timed these changes to make information about climate science more challenging to access to coincide with the Peoples Climate March and related news stories, which will likely drive thousands of Americans to visit the EPA website.”“The facts about climate change have not changed, however, and politics are not a valid reason to archive basic explanations of science,” the statement continued. “While it is unclear what the administration has planned for updating the web page, climate scientists will be watching closely to ensure the scientific accuracy of whatever replaces it, and that the underlying scientific data remain accessible to Americans.”Officials purged the climate change section a week after Trump released a statement on Earth Day touting his commitment to the environment and scientific inquiry. His administration has taken a number of actions over its first 100 days that threaten the environment.In an interview with The Washington Post, Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, questioned why the website needed revision at all.“It’s hard to understand why facts require revision,” she said.John O’Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, Council 238, which represents 9,000 EPA employees, called the website change a “sneak attack” in a Saturday statement.“How many extreme weather events, including droughts, floods, forest fires, or other unnatural disasters do we need to experience before this Administration realizes that global climate change is real and needs to be addressed?” O’Grady said. “Something appears to be very wrong with this Administration’s position on global climate change, and this impacts all Americans, especially the poor and marginalized.”"

Trump reversed a planned decrease in the cost of mortgage insurance for working- and middle-class homebuyers. Within hours of being sworn in, Trump put a hold on a reduction in the cost of Federal Housing Authority mortgage insurance. The move means 750,000 to 850,000 Americans will face higher costs in the next year alone, according to the National Association of Realtors.2. He nominated to run the Treasury Department a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager who activists say ran a “foreclosure machine.” Steven Mnuchin misled senators by saying the bank he invested in and ran didn’t use illegal robo-signings (documents showed they did) and omitted $100 million in assets from his personal financial disclosure forms. Oh, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating claims his bank engaged in the racist practice of redlining.3. Mnuchin is painfully under-informed about automation’s potential to decimate labor. In an interview with Axios’ Mike Allen, Mnuchin said he was “not at all” concerned about the potential shocks to the labor market that advances in automation might have, insisting that the timeline for such concerns was “50 or 100 years.”As The Verge’s Adi Robinson noted, “[a] December report from the White House cited studies that estimate automation will affect between 9 percent and 47 percent of jobs over the next 10 to 20 years.”4. Trump tried to put a fast-food executive in charge of the Labor Department. After running a campaign focused on the economy’s forgotten workers, Trump plucked the chief executive of the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. burger chains to lead the nation’s top workplace watchdog. While Andrew Puzder ran parent company CKE Restaurants, Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. franchises around the country violated the very labor laws that Puzder would have been expected to enforce. Puzder’s nomination eventually went down in flames ― not due to his company’s labor record, but because of old domestic abuse allegations and because he’d personally employed an undocumented immigrant.5. Goldman Sachs’ influence in the Trump White House doesn’t end with Mnuchin. Former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn’s influence in the West Wing has grown considerably in Trump’s first 100 days. Cohn’s developed such a strong hand internally that he is currently thought to be a leading contender for Reince Priebus’ job, should any staff shakeup create the need for a new White House chief of staff. As HuffPost has noted, “Cohn’s appointment as White House chief of staff wouldn’t just be a boon for bank lobbyists seeking lucrative new loopholes. It would be a restoration of finance to the center of American politics.”6. Goldman Sachs’ influence in the Trump White House doesn’t end with Gary Cohn, either. Trump nominated former Sullivan & Cromwell partner Jay Clayton to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is tasked with making sure the financial sector behaves itself. In the wake of Clayton’s nomination, his old firm carefully trimmed his 800-word biography ― which detailed his adventures helping Wall Street firms navigate the legal terrain in pursuit of mergers, acquisitions and capital market offerings ― down to a more concise 30.Here’s an even more concise biography: Clayton is probably best known as Goldman Sachs’ bailout lawyer.7. Trump named a billionaire investor as an anti-regulation czar. Trump named Carl Icahn as a special adviser on regulation, which is awkward, given the dozens and dozens of regulations that materially affect Ichan’s investments. He is particularly incensed by an EPA renewable fuel rule that applies to an oil refinery in which he owns a stake.8. Trump named a huge fan of monopolies to lead the search for anti-trust regulators. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump gave billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel the go-ahead to lead the search for his administration’s “top antitrust enforcement jobs.” Thiel, who sits on the board of world-devouring platform Facebook, came out as a committed monopolist in his book Zero To One: “Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.”9. Overall, Trump’s advisers live in an elitist bubble. As the Washington Post’s Philip Bump reported in April, Trump has staffed his White House with a collection of plutocrats who possess a staggering collective wealth: “Financial reports released by the Trump administration indicate that 27 staffers who work for him are worth a combined $2.3 billion thanks to real estate, investments and hefty salaries.” That’s more money than 86 counties’ worth of Trump voters make in a year.10. Trump moved to kill a rule that forces Wall Street to act in the best interest of Americans saving for retirement. Trump signed a memo that put the fiduciary rule — which requires brokers act in the best interests of folks saving for retirement — on the path to the glue factory. His adviser Cohn likened the move to “freedom,” saying, “This is like putting only healthy food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldn’t eat it because you might die younger.”Not exactly: The rule literally forbade brokers from guiding retirees “into expensive or poor-performing products that carry economic benefits and perks for the advisers and their firms, without disclosing such conflicts of interest.” It’s estimated that consumers lose $17 billion annually to such scams.11. Trump took aim at post-crisis bank regulation. Trump signed an executive order in February that by itself doesn’t undo Dodd-Frank, but starts a process that could defang Wall Street oversight. Technically, the administration is still in the “just asking questions” phase of financial de-regulation, but Trump has been clear about his intentions, saying that “we expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” Trump signed the order after a meeting earlier that day with big-time Wall Street executives, at one point telling JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it.”Trump signed two more executive orders in April asking the Treasury Department to review governmental authority to take over failing financial companies, and to review rules that allow for the regulation of financial companies other than banks as systemically important.12. Trump outlined a budget that’s broadly punitive to Trump’s own voters. The Washington Post’s Jenna Johnson reports Trump’s proposed budget includes cuts that “would disproportionately harm the rural areas and small towns that were key to his unexpected win.”13. Trump has instigated a trade war that will hit Americans first. The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas cattle ranchers have emerged as the “first casualty” of Trump’s “blundering, blustering trade policy.” Per contributor Richard Parker: “By threatening a trade war with Mexico within days of inauguration, the president helped trigger a slide in cattle futures. Mexico is a major export market. By sinking the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the new administration cut off long-sought access to the Japanese market. Now banks have raised the conditions for collateral for loans for ranchers.”14. Trump has backed health care proposals with a common theme: subsidize the wealthy while jacking up prices on the poor with shock cost increases. Both Trump-backed Obamacare replacements are broadly redistributive, but not in any discernibly populist direction. Rather, they shift wealth from poorer Americans to wealthier ones and corporations. People earning over a $1 million, in fact, would have “saved an estimated $165 billion in taxes over 10 years.” The tax benefits would be financed through draconian cuts to Medicaid and other health programs for the poor.15. The plan also features substantial cuts in drug treatment protocols to address the nation’s opioid crisis. As CNN’s Dan Merica reported: “The current version of the Trump-backed Republican health care plan would end the Obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program. The GOP plan would instead leave up to states ― and their budgets ― to decide whether to cover drug treatment and mental health services under Medicaid. That’s a decision advocates say could put the most vulnerable opiate abusers in greater risk, thanks to near-constant pressure on state budgets.”16. Good news for employers who like stealing from their workers! Trump signed a bill, sent to him by Congress, that repeals the sensible-sounding Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, put in place by Obama. The rule would have required companies to disclose labor law violations when they bid on federal contracts, so that the government doesn’t steer taxpayer dollars toward companies that cheat or endanger workers. By repealing the rule, Trump did a favor for companies that have a history of wage theft and workplace hazards. 17. Trump delayed a life-saving protection for construction workers. Earlier this month, Trump put a halt to the most consequential workplace safety reform of the last decade. The so-called silica rule would reduce the amount of cancer-causing dust that companies can legally expose construction workers to. The tighter regulations rolled out last year were 45 years in the making and are projected to save 600 lives per year. But the Trump administration announced a three-month delay to enforcing the rule, drawing applause from the construction industry. Workplace watchdogs now worry the regulations will be watered down or scrapped altogether.18. Trump made it harder for low-wage workers to save for retirement. The Obama administration took steps to popularize what are known as automatic IRA accounts. These are government-sponsored retirement plans set up for people who don’t have IRA’s through their jobs, i.e., much of the working class and working poor. Even though these plans once enjoyed conservative support, Trump repealed Obama’s executive order that would have made it easier for cities and counties to set up these auto-IRA’s. That surely pleased Wall Street, which doesn’t like how these IRA’s compete with its own offerings.19. Trump made it easier for employers to hide worker injuries. Earlier this month, Trump loosened the record-keeping requirements for employers in dangerous industries. Instead of having to keep accurate injury records for six years, employers can only be held accountable for the last six months. Occupational health experts say the change will make it easier for companies to sweep injuries under the rug. “This will give license to employers to keep fraudulent records and to willfully violate the law with impunity,” a former OSHA policy adviser told HuffPost.20. Trump weakened rules on lobbyists working in his administration. Trump signed an executive order that allows lobbyists to join his administration, provided they don’t work for two years on any issue on which they lobbied. (The Obama administration barred anyone who had been registered as a lobbyist in the prior year from joining.)As a result, someone like Geoffrey Burr, who lobbied the Labor Department in opposition to wages rules and worker safety measures, can work in the Trump administration’s Labor Department.21. Trump allowed coal companies to dump waste in streams. Trump signed a bill killing the Obama administration’s Stream Protection Rule, which aimed to keep toxic metals out of water supplies in coal country.22. Trump froze Environmental Protection Agency contracts grants. The Trump team put a temporary halt to funding for routinely contracted work like drinking water testing, ProPublica reported.23. Trump’s FCC kept the prices sky-high for families who call loved ones in prison. Prison phone calls are absurdly expensive, averaging around $3 for a 15-minute in-state call. Activists have been trying to bring the cost down for years.In 2015, federal regulators approved a rule that capped charges at 11 cents per minute. The industry sued, and Trump’s new head of the FCC, Ajit Pai, recently announced the agency would not defend the rule in court.24. The FCC also blocked nine internet service providers from a federal subsidy program for low-income Americans. Pai undid a move that allowed internet service providers to participate in the Lifeline program, which gives a $9.25-per-month credit to households to buy internet service.25. Trump’s EPA killed a rule to protect people from mercury exposure. The EPA withdrew a rule requiring dentists’ offices to install equipment to dispose of fillings that contain mercury as an alternative to washing them down the drain. Mercury can hurt pregnant women and kids even at low levels.26. Troubling signs for civil asset forfeiture reform. During a White House meeting with county sheriffs from across the country, Trump offered to help “destroy the career” of Texas state Sen. Juan Hinojosa after one of the sheriffs in attendance complained about Hinojosa’s efforts to curtail the oft-abused practice of civil asset forfeiture.27. Big military budget build-up has little for the soldiers on the front lines. Trump has planned to funnel taxpayer dollars into the military in a bid to beef up its budget. But as of now, the principal beneficiary of this largesse will continue to be wealthy military contractors and Pentagon elites. As HuffPost’s David Wood reported, very little will trickle down to working-class service members, who typically deploy with “budget leftovers” such as “antiquated rifles, helicopters built for their grandfathers during the Vietnam War and communications gear that is overweight and unreliable.” The men and women who are training to fight in the next war have “weapons that don’t work, trucks that are broken down, [and] combat exercises canceled for lack of money.”28. Plans are afoot to make it easier for corporations to get out of paying their taxes. Trump signed an executive order this month asking the Treasury Department to look at all Obama-era tax rules. Anything that’s too much of a burden or too complex in the eyes of Secretary Mnuchin could get axed. The main target appears to be rules put in place to cut down on tax inversions, in which an American company acquires a foreign company and relocates abroad to cut down on its U.S. taxes.29. And now, Trump has proposed a massive tax cut for America’s elites: Just ahead of the (largely arbitrary) “100 Days” deadline, the White House issued a single-page statement of principles that outlines a massive tax cut for America’s richest citizens. In HuffPost’s analysis, the wealthy would benefit from “reducing the tax rate on stocks, bonds and real estate investments; eliminating inheritance taxes for millionaire heirs and heiresses; and bringing down the tax rate on the largest corporations to less than half of what it is now.” According to the Center for Economic Policy and Research, Trump would himself receive a tax break windfall under this plan, to the tune of $65 million.Appropriately, the punchline of Trump’s faux-populist joke is, “The Aristocrats!”"

As HuffPost’s David Wood reported, very little will trickle down to working-class service members, who typically deploy with “budget leftovers” such as “antiquated rifles, helicopters built for their grandfathers during the Vietnam War and communications gear that is overweight and unreliable.” The men and women who are training to fight in the next war have “weapons that don’t work, trucks that are broken down, [and] combat exercises canceled for lack of money.”28. Plans are afoot to make it easier for corporations to get out of paying their taxes. Trump signed an executive order this month asking the Treasury Department to look at all Obama-era tax rules. Anything that’s too much of a burden or too complex in the eyes of Secretary Mnuchin could get axed. The main target appears to be rules put in place to cut down on tax inversions, in which an American company acquires a foreign company and relocates abroad to cut down on its U.S. taxes.29. And now, Trump has proposed a massive tax cut for America’s elites: Just ahead of the (largely arbitrary) “100 Days” deadline, the White House issued a single-page statement of principles that outlines a massive tax cut for America’s richest citizens. In HuffPost’s analysis, the wealthy would benefit from “reducing the tax rate on stocks, bonds and real estate investments; eliminating inheritance taxes for millionaire heirs and heiresses; and bringing down the tax rate on the largest corporations to less than half of what it is now.” According to the Center for Economic Policy and Research, Trump would himself receive a tax break windfall under this plan, to the tune of $65 million.Appropriately, the punchline of Trump’s faux-populist joke is, “The Aristocrats!”"
11,POLITICS,"In 100 Days, Trump Has Found 29 Ways To Screw Regular Americans","Ben Walsh, Dave Jamieson, and Jason Linkins",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-is-not-a-populist_us_58ab5ad9e4b07028b7030328,This is populism?,2017-04-29,"A CH-46E Sea Knight troop carrier, first used during the Vietnam war, before it takes off from the USS Essex in 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59021c82260000bd9ac480c7.jpeg?cache=T1dV0ADBYH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump campaigned as a champion of forgotten and downtrodden Americans ― a risible but tried-and-true platform ― but the first 100 days of his presidency have been decidedly un-populist.Amid Trump’s deluge of unsubstantiated claims and the chaos of his administration, it can be challenging to keep track of what campaign promises he has or hasn’t fulfilled.So here’s a list of 29 things Trump has done so far that cater to big business at the expense of ordinary Americans:1. Trump reversed a planned decrease in the cost of mortgage insurance for working- and middle-class homebuyers. Within hours of being sworn in, Trump put a hold on a reduction in the cost of Federal Housing Authority mortgage insurance. The move means 750,000 to 850,000 Americans will face higher costs in the next year alone, according to the National Association of Realtors.2. He nominated to run the Treasury Department a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager who activists say ran a “foreclosure machine.” Steven Mnuchin misled senators by saying the bank he invested in and ran didn’t use illegal robo-signings (documents showed they did) and omitted $100 million in assets from his personal financial disclosure forms. Oh, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating claims his bank engaged in the racist practice of redlining.3. Mnuchin is painfully under-informed about automation’s potential to decimate labor. In an interview with Axios’ Mike Allen, Mnuchin said he was “not at all” concerned about the potential shocks to the labor market that advances in automation might have, insisting that the timeline for such concerns was “50 or 100 years.”As The Verge’s Adi Robinson noted, “[a] December report from the White House cited studies that estimate automation will affect between 9 percent and 47 percent of jobs over the next 10 to 20 years.”4. Trump tried to put a fast-food executive in charge of the Labor Department. After running a campaign focused on the economy’s forgotten workers, Trump plucked the chief executive of the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. burger chains to lead the nation’s top workplace watchdog. While Andrew Puzder ran parent company CKE Restaurants, Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. franchises around the country violated the very labor laws that Puzder would have been expected to enforce. Puzder’s nomination eventually went down in flames ― not due to his company’s labor record, but because of old domestic abuse allegations and because he’d personally employed an undocumented immigrant.5. Goldman Sachs’ influence in the Trump White House doesn’t end with Mnuchin. Former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn’s influence in the West Wing has grown considerably in Trump’s first 100 days. Cohn’s developed such a strong hand internally that he is currently thought to be a leading contender for Reince Priebus’ job, should any staff shakeup create the need for a new White House chief of staff. As HuffPost has noted, “Cohn’s appointment as White House chief of staff wouldn’t just be a boon for bank lobbyists seeking lucrative new loopholes. It would be a restoration of finance to the center of American politics.”6. Goldman Sachs’ influence in the Trump White House doesn’t end with Gary Cohn, either. Trump nominated former Sullivan & Cromwell partner Jay Clayton to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is tasked with making sure the financial sector behaves itself. In the wake of Clayton’s nomination, his old firm carefully trimmed his 800-word biography ― which detailed his adventures helping Wall Street firms navigate the legal terrain in pursuit of mergers, acquisitions and capital market offerings ― down to a more concise 30.Here’s an even more concise biography: Clayton is probably best known as Goldman Sachs’ bailout lawyer.7. Trump named a billionaire investor as an anti-regulation czar. Trump named Carl Icahn as a special adviser on regulation, which is awkward, given the dozens and dozens of regulations that materially affect Ichan’s investments. He is particularly incensed by an EPA renewable fuel rule that applies to an oil refinery in which he owns a stake.8. Trump named a huge fan of monopolies to lead the search for anti-trust regulators. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump gave billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel the go-ahead to lead the search for his administration’s “top antitrust enforcement jobs.” Thiel, who sits on the board of world-devouring platform Facebook, came out as a committed monopolist in his book Zero To One: “Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.”9. Overall, Trump’s advisers live in an elitist bubble. As the Washington Post’s Philip Bump reported in April, Trump has staffed his White House with a collection of plutocrats who possess a staggering collective wealth: “Financial reports released by the Trump administration indicate that 27 staffers who work for him are worth a combined $2.3 billion thanks to real estate, investments and hefty salaries.” That’s more money than 86 counties’ worth of Trump voters make in a year.10. Trump moved to kill a rule that forces Wall Street to act in the best interest of Americans saving for retirement. Trump signed a memo that put the fiduciary rule — which requires brokers act in the best interests of folks saving for retirement — on the path to the glue factory. His adviser Cohn likened the move to “freedom,” saying, “This is like putting only healthy food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldn’t eat it because you might die younger.”Not exactly: The rule literally forbade brokers from guiding retirees “into expensive or poor-performing products that carry economic benefits and perks for the advisers and their firms, without disclosing such conflicts of interest.” It’s estimated that consumers lose $17 billion annually to such scams.11. Trump took aim at post-crisis bank regulation. Trump signed an executive order in February that by itself doesn’t undo Dodd-Frank, but starts a process that could defang Wall Street oversight. Technically, the administration is still in the “just asking questions” phase of financial de-regulation, but Trump has been clear about his intentions, saying that “we expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” Trump signed the order after a meeting earlier that day with big-time Wall Street executives, at one point telling JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it.”Trump signed two more executive orders in April asking the Treasury Department to review governmental authority to take over failing financial companies, and to review rules that allow for the regulation of financial companies other than banks as systemically important.12. Trump outlined a budget that’s broadly punitive to Trump’s own voters. The Washington Post’s Jenna Johnson reports Trump’s proposed budget includes cuts that “would disproportionately harm the rural areas and small towns that were key to his unexpected win.”13. Trump has instigated a trade war that will hit Americans first. The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas cattle ranchers have emerged as the “first casualty” of Trump’s “blundering, blustering trade policy.” Per contributor Richard Parker: “By threatening a trade war with Mexico within days of inauguration, the president helped trigger a slide in cattle futures. Mexico is a major export market. By sinking the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the new administration cut off long-sought access to the Japanese market. Now banks have raised the conditions for collateral for loans for ranchers.”14. Trump has backed health care proposals with a common theme: subsidize the wealthy while jacking up prices on the poor with shock cost increases. Both Trump-backed Obamacare replacements are broadly redistributive, but not in any discernibly populist direction. Rather, they shift wealth from poorer Americans to wealthier ones and corporations. People earning over a $1 million, in fact, would have “saved an estimated $165 billion in taxes over 10 years.” The tax benefits would be financed through draconian cuts to Medicaid and other health programs for the poor.15. The plan also features substantial cuts in drug treatment protocols to address the nation’s opioid crisis. As CNN’s Dan Merica reported: “The current version of the Trump-backed Republican health care plan would end the Obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program. The GOP plan would instead leave up to states ― and their budgets ― to decide whether to cover drug treatment and mental health services under Medicaid. That’s a decision advocates say could put the most vulnerable opiate abusers in greater risk, thanks to near-constant pressure on state budgets.”16. Good news for employers who like stealing from their workers! Trump signed a bill, sent to him by Congress, that repeals the sensible-sounding Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, put in place by Obama. The rule would have required companies to disclose labor law violations when they bid on federal contracts, so that the government doesn’t steer taxpayer dollars toward companies that cheat or endanger workers. By repealing the rule, Trump did a favor for companies that have a history of wage theft and workplace hazards. 17. Trump delayed a life-saving protection for construction workers. Earlier this month, Trump put a halt to the most consequential workplace safety reform of the last decade. The so-called silica rule would reduce the amount of cancer-causing dust that companies can legally expose construction workers to. The tighter regulations rolled out last year were 45 years in the making and are projected to save 600 lives per year. But the Trump administration announced a three-month delay to enforcing the rule, drawing applause from the construction industry. Workplace watchdogs now worry the regulations will be watered down or scrapped altogether.18. Trump made it harder for low-wage workers to save for retirement. The Obama administration took steps to popularize what are known as automatic IRA accounts. These are government-sponsored retirement plans set up for people who don’t have IRA’s through their jobs, i.e., much of the working class and working poor. Even though these plans once enjoyed conservative support, Trump repealed Obama’s executive order that would have made it easier for cities and counties to set up these auto-IRA’s. That surely pleased Wall Street, which doesn’t like how these IRA’s compete with its own offerings.19. Trump made it easier for employers to hide worker injuries. Earlier this month, Trump loosened the record-keeping requirements for employers in dangerous industries. Instead of having to keep accurate injury records for six years, employers can only be held accountable for the last six months. Occupational health experts say the change will make it easier for companies to sweep injuries under the rug. “This will give license to employers to keep fraudulent records and to willfully violate the law with impunity,” a former OSHA policy adviser told HuffPost.20. Trump weakened rules on lobbyists working in his administration. Trump signed an executive order that allows lobbyists to join his administration, provided they don’t work for two years on any issue on which they lobbied. (The Obama administration barred anyone who had been registered as a lobbyist in the prior year from joining.)As a result, someone like Geoffrey Burr, who lobbied the Labor Department in opposition to wages rules and worker safety measures, can work in the Trump administration’s Labor Department.21. Trump allowed coal companies to dump waste in streams. Trump signed a bill killing the Obama administration’s Stream Protection Rule, which aimed to keep toxic metals out of water supplies in coal country.22. Trump froze Environmental Protection Agency contracts grants. The Trump team put a temporary halt to funding for routinely contracted work like drinking water testing, ProPublica reported.23. Trump’s FCC kept the prices sky-high for families who call loved ones in prison. Prison phone calls are absurdly expensive, averaging around $3 for a 15-minute in-state call. Activists have been trying to bring the cost down for years.In 2015, federal regulators approved a rule that capped charges at 11 cents per minute. The industry sued, and Trump’s new head of the FCC, Ajit Pai, recently announced the agency would not defend the rule in court.24. The FCC also blocked nine internet service providers from a federal subsidy program for low-income Americans. Pai undid a move that allowed internet service providers to participate in the Lifeline program, which gives a $9.25-per-month credit to households to buy internet service.25. Trump’s EPA killed a rule to protect people from mercury exposure. The EPA withdrew a rule requiring dentists’ offices to install equipment to dispose of fillings that contain mercury as an alternative to washing them down the drain. Mercury can hurt pregnant women and kids even at low levels.26. Troubling signs for civil asset forfeiture reform. During a White House meeting with county sheriffs from across the country, Trump offered to help “destroy the career” of Texas state Sen. Juan Hinojosa after one of the sheriffs in attendance complained about Hinojosa’s efforts to curtail the oft-abused practice of civil asset forfeiture.27. Big military budget build-up has little for the soldiers on the front lines. Trump has planned to funnel taxpayer dollars into the military in a bid to beef up its budget. But as of now, the principal beneficiary of this largesse will continue to be wealthy military contractors and Pentagon elites. As HuffPost’s David Wood reported, very little will trickle down to working-class service members, who typically deploy with “budget leftovers” such as “antiquated rifles, helicopters built for their grandfathers during the Vietnam War and communications gear that is overweight and unreliable.” The men and women who are training to fight in the next war have “weapons that don’t work, trucks that are broken down, [and] combat exercises canceled for lack of money.”28.

Anything that’s too much of a burden or too complex in the eyes of Secretary Mnuchin could get axed. The main target appears to be rules put in place to cut down on tax inversions, in which an American company acquires a foreign company and relocates abroad to cut down on its U.S. taxes.29.

12,ENTERTAINMENT,The 'Happiest Moment' Of Quentin Tarantino's Life Came During 'Reservoir Dogs',Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/quentin-tarantino-reservoir-dogs-anniversary_us_59040f8be4b05c39767fc25e,The director recounted a cast dinner that cemented his career.,2017-04-29,"Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth arrive at the ""Reservoir Dogs"" screening.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590498281400002000a9c91a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As one of America’s star directors, Quentin Tarantino has become a larger-than-life personality. He seems relentlessly cocksure today, but there was once a time when Tarantino had to prove to himself that he was capable of this whole filmmaking thing.Given how trying it can be to forge a movie career, Tarantino had a relatively auspicious start. His first project, “Reservoir Dogs,” made him an instant up-and-comer amid the 1990s’ independent-film boom. Celebrating the crime thriller’s 25th anniversary, Tarantino reunited with Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth on Friday night for a screening and panel discussion at the Tribeca Film Festival. There, he spoke of his signature memory from the film, which doubles as the “happiest moment” of his life.It came at the end of a two-week rehearsal period, during which the actors bonded in Los Angeles. Keitel hosted a cast dinner at the house he was renting in Malibu. Tarantino was staying with his mother in Glendale, about 40 miles away. That night, perched around Keitel’s table, he realized the dream he’d maintained since his Tennessee days as a teenage video-store clerk had real potential. Thanks to the “Reservoir Dogs” cast’s harmony, Tarantino’s career was born.“We’re sitting there and we’re having a great time, and I really realized that, gosh, a lot of the pressure was off my shoulders cinematically,” Tarantino said. “These guys were so perfect in their parts, they were so vibing with each other, they so understood the material. By rehearsing two weeks, they knew the material. I was like, ‘Fuck, if I just keep this movie in focus, I’ve got a movie.’ Anything else I bring to it will just be frosting, but the cake is here — it’s these guys. I watched it at dinner that night. It was a really nice thing for Harvey to do. But I remember that night getting in my car and just taking that drive all the way from Malibu to Glendale, just on [Sunset Boulevard], never getting off Sunset, all the little, windy roads. And that was the happiest time of my life. That was the happiest moment of my life. This thing that I had thought about for so long — not just ‘Reservoir Dogs,’ just making movies in general -- this might just work out.”Of course, things did work out, despite projector problems and a power outage during the first “Reservoir Dogs” screening at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival. Tarantino saw it as a mark of achievement that people walked out during the scene were Mr. Blonde tortures the kidnapped police officer. The number of exits during a single screening peaked at 33, according to his count. Even Wes Craven walked out at Spain's horror-focused Sitges Film Festival. “The guy who did ‘Last House on the Left’ walked out of my movie,” Tarantino roared. “I guess it was too tough for him.”"

Someone else has doubtless created a list of all that’s occurred, but no matter how many details you recall, the entire conglomerate of fiascos carries weight as a single disaster. In some cases, it’s less about what even happened and more about the unfurling plans—there are another 44 months to go. Time and power are on Trump’s side.Like many people, I have been to marches, attended seminars, responded to emails, joined conference calls, and written to congress people, as well as anyone else who might care to listen. I’ve joined that nebulous thing: the Resistance.What do we know about the Resistance?The work of the Resistance feels like we’re playing whack-a-mole. What’s it going to be today: A fresh attack on health care, the start of a new war, the deportation of more DACA immigrants, massive trickle-down tax cuts for the rich and corporations—or a hundred other things?There’s too much to do. Friends talk about unsubscribing from selected emails they are getting in order to focus on issues they really care about. We can’t each do it all, so we chose our closest concern, hoping others will pick up the rest. And we are all prepared to be much more active about our caring than we used to be. We acknowledge that a lack of participation in the past may have contributed to the demise of the values we share and hold dear, but back then we had a president with whom we shared a basic worldview. Now he’s gone, and we’re all in the line of fire.But we’re getting organized. We’ve stopped being liberals because that’s too wishy-washy and nice. We’re progressives focused on improving the human condition. My friend who has taken up the Sierra Club as her cause is not just worried about water quality in Florida (although that’s an urgent problem), she’s working towards addressing climate change as a whole. I’ve held most of my focus on women’s issues. Some see health care or education as the main concern, others are centered on regional government and putting thoughtful candidates in place. Admittedly, every time you try limiting yourself you come across something that draws you into a wider or overlapping conflict. Fighting pollution might sound like you could throw it in the Sierra Club basket and hope those folks will take care of things, only to find yourself reflecting on how pollution affects women and families—particularly in underserved areas—and further, bleeds into Black Lives Matter. In Flint, Michigan, for example, high lead concentrations in municipal tap water most affected poor and low-income African American families. So we can choose our battles but we can’t lose sight of the war.There’s a lot of cynicism about marching. Does anyone in power care? Actually, it seems they do, although how that really plays out remains to be seen. The Women’s March on Washington on January 21st made me feel hopeful for the first time since the election and being out there with energetic people who think and act as I do always cheers me up. We talk to each other on a march, share rides, offer directions, knowing how unlikely it is that we will ever meet again. It’s comradeship and we need it desperately because many of us are new at this or have not done it in a long while.The problem with whack-a-mole is that we’re playing defense. There’s no room for a Progressive agenda until we hold a greater share of power. The Arena Summit in Raleigh late last month spoke to this, but that’s part of the long game. Meanwhile, we are losing ground every day. Many of Trump’s targets focus on social and economic issues we thought to be long ago solved by law or consensus. The right to choose is surely one of those—didn’t I fight for that forty years ago?So we need to be active in setting things up for the round of local, state, and national elections in 2018 and 2020. To that end, I’ve been on conference calls with both the ACLU and Ready to Resist, one of the thousands of people on each call. Attendance is impressive and impassioned. Speakers discuss problems and solutions that are in play right as we talk. The calls do not have the immediacy of a march, but they provide a better sense of what can be accomplished now and how to go about that.We have our victories, and Trump often stumbles, one example being when White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon was removed from his seat on the National Security Council. It was terrifying and historically unprecedented to have Bannon—someone with no government, foreign policy, or intelligence experience, a white supremacist, warmonger, and Islamophobic conspiracy theorist― in charge of our country’s national security apparatus. Now there’s Michael Flynn’s failure to disclose his payments from foreign governments—Flynn may be out of his job as National Security Advisor, but his Russian connections continue to resonate with a warning for this administration. Even more satisfying temporary victories were the complete legislative failure of Trump’s first attack on the ACA, and the administration’s retrenchment on budgetary allocation for its Humpty-Dumpty border wall. We need it all. New issues and rash blustering arise every day: Attempting to threaten the Ninth Circuit Court, indirectly threatening North Korea—by the time you read this the list will be out of date.The first 100 days feel like we’re marching through a long, dark tunnel. We’re holding onto our optimism, but there are no jokes about the oncoming train—we already sense its rumble, and we’re working hard to get our country to switch tracks.This blog was previously posted on the Sanity Papers, April 28, 2017.

IgnoranceThis is an umbrella term meant to characterize individuals whose allegiance and pro-Trump behavior is based on a position in which all of the facts are not considered. This can happen by active and passive mechanisms that can include narrow-minded media intake (active) or lack of access to mainstream, public sources of socio-cultural information.A controversial explanation emerged last year that described the Dunning-Kruger effect, or the inability for one to realize his or her own incompetence. According to the neuroscientist who promoted this idea, part of Trump’s appeal is rooted in psychobiological elements that are present in his supporters such as increased sensitivity to threatening stimuli (and perhaps a larger amygdala, the brain’s fear center), higher attentional engagement and arousal, and adherence to Terror Management Theory.In short, this theory is based on the notion that some people manage their fear of death and the recognition of their own mortality by adopting belief systems, ideologies, and identities that focus on life and its meaning. Allegiance to these belief systems (and to a particular figure) can be strengthened when one is reminded of their mortality as is often the case when leaders such as Donald Trump use fear as a primary theme of their platform.2. Unwavering support of partyIndividuals in this category are the die-hards whose political affiliation runs deep and they will “ride the tide of success” when their party of choice is in power and “go down with the ship” when their political affiliation is out of power or favor.While this type of support is less obvious in the general public, it is well exemplified by Republican members of Congress who share the same party affiliation as the president. Several votes and maneuvers within Congress have been split along party lines including the confirmation of questionably capable Cabinet members, the proposal of an investigation into the president’s tax records, and potentially probing the apparent hacking of the general election by Russian operatives.3. Endorsement of the messagePeople who fit this description are those that actively support, believe, and promote the platform put forth by this administration during the campaign. While this represents a significant number of people they can be identified in a few general categories. One group is the upper 1% of the population otherwise known as the “super-rich” who stand to benefit from proposed tax cuts and can effectively ignore the arguably malicious means by which they are obtained (at the peril of the middle and lower classes). A second group consists of those individuals who believe in the “philosophies” extolled by the president and his inner circle that can politely be described as racist, nationalist, jingoistic, isolationist, and/or bigoted.In 2017 America, no one is going to deny that these people exist and hold beliefs that denigrate others based on color, ethnicity, religion, and/or country of origin/residency. A third group is those who misinterpret or misrepresent the message of the political figure that they support. For example, thousands clamored for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare without realizing that this was the same as the Affordable Care Act through which they obtained their existing health coverage. It should be clear at this point that membership in these categories is not mutually exclusive.Any discussion of who does or does not support a particular candidate or political figure has to include mention of a phenomenon known as ingroup/outgroup psychology. This refers to the observation that we identify with those with whom we share certain qualities (our ingroup) and negatively view those who do not share these qualities as an outgroup. The identification of one’s ingroup can be determined by biologically-derived factors such as sex or geographically-based factors such as support of a local sports team. Politics is no different. In fact, many have argued that ingroup/outgroup psychology, or an “us versus them” mentality, has become more divisive in recent years. A great example of how simple group dividing lines can be established and how quickly animosity toward your outgroup comes from an exercise conducted by Iowa schoolteacher Jane Elliott in 1968. In the aftermath of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Elliott divided her class by eye-color (brown versus blue) and assigned a higher “social status” to one eye color group. Alarmingly, it did not take long for the higher status children to ridicule and ostracize the lower status group.For an example of this type of behavior today, one need not go much further than Facebook, Twitter or the comments section of online media articles.What the current president was able to do, and what he continues to do, is to move between ingroups by “playing to” the characteristics of the specific group. This is not unique to him, or con men in general, but what makes the current situation unique are the high stakes involved and the potentially damaging consequences of his “ingroup surfing.” A timely example of this behavior, is the president’s appearance at an NRA convention in Atlanta on Friday in which he returned to campaign form and called Elizabeth Warren, a Senator who reports having a Native American background, “Pocohontas”...despite being the sitting President of the United States; a move that was repeatedly most likely because it “played to his base.”To summarize, the approval rating and support for the current president will never be zero due to neurobiological and psychological forces that often operate below the level of consciousness as well as conscious decisions to back policies that are beneficial to the desires of a few but not necessarily for the well-being of the many."

Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Senior fellow",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-pope-in-egypt-tiptoeing-through-a-minefield_us_59044fd6e4b05279d4edbc49,The pope’s problem in Egypt is maneuvering between problematic partners.,2017-04-29,<p>Pope Francis and Egyptian leader Abdul Fattah Al-Sisi</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59044fe82600001f7ac486b4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Billed as a bid to stimulate inter-faith dialogue, Pope Francis, on a visit to Egypt, is tiptoeing through a religious and geopolitical minefield.Designed to improve the fragile position of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East, North Africa and the larger Muslim world, the pope is walking a tightrope amid Saudi-inspired Sunni Muslim ultra-conservatism that fuels intolerance and sectarianism across the region, and a power struggle between Egyptian general-turned-president Abdul Fattah Al-Sisi and Al-Azhar, one of the world’s oldest and foremost seats of Islamic learning.In a boost of Orthodox Christian morale, Pope Francis paid homage to the scores of victims of the bombing earlier this month of two Coptic churches shortly after becoming the first head of the Vatican to set foot in Egypt in 17 years. The bombings were the latest jihadist attacks on religious minorities in the Middle East and North Africa that has persuaded Christians and others to flee their home countries, if not the region.The jihadist campaign is rooted in an intolerant, supremacist interpretation of Islam that traces its roots to the Arabian Peninsula long before Saudi Arabia was established as a state, offshoots of which have turned their violence as much on the kingdom as on others. It is further fuelled by increased Islamophobia abetted by the rise of anti-Muslim and anti-migration nationalism and populism across the globe.It also feeds on autocratic leaders like Mr. Al-Sisi whose rule is based on brutal repression designed to mask their failure to deliver public services and goods or manage complex, politically risky transitions towards a post-oil era. These leaders have often abetted massive, decades-long Saudi funding of an ultra-conservative Sunni Muslim worldview that has embedded itself in Muslim communities across the globe, including Al Azhar.Addressing a peace conference at Al Azhar, the pope urged his audience to “say once more a firm and clear ‘No!’ to every form of violence, vengeance, and hatred carried out in the name of religion or in the name of God.” Pope Francis issued his call as Al Azhar was resisting efforts by Mr. Al-Sisi to persuade the institution to cut its ties to ultra-conservatism and reform its teachings.In doing so, the pope was shining a spotlight on multiple complex battles for the soul of Islam as well as the survival of autocracy in the Middle East and North Africa. These battles include Saudi efforts to distance ultra-conservatism from its more militant, jihadist offshoots; resistance to reform by ultra-conservatives who no longer are wholly dependent on support of the kingdom; and strains in relations between Saudi Arabia and some of its closest Arab allies, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, that are fought in part over ultra-conservativism and political Islam.Resistance to Mr. Al-Sisi’s calls for reform of Al Azhar is rooted not only in Saudi-inspired ultra-conservatism but also an ingrained animosity towards government interference and the president’s high-handed approach. Mr. Al-Sisi, often prone to hyperbole and self-aggrandizement, threatened the university’s scholars in 2015 that he would complain to God if they failed to act on his demand for reform. “Allah Almighty be witness to your truth on Judgment Day concerning that which I’m talking about now.,” Mr. Al-Sisi said.Speaking months later to a German-Egyptian community, Mr. Al-Sisi asserted that “God made me a doctor to diagnose the problem, he made me like this so I could see and understand the true state of affairs. It’s a blessing from God.”Mr. Al-Sisi’s campaign against Al Azhar highlights the pitfalls of Saudi Arabia’s long-standing use of religious ultra-conservatism backed by its financial muscle as a soft power tool and the kingdom’s more recent efforts to shave off the rough edges of its ideology rooted in both religion and an austere Bedouin culture, and project it as open-minded, tolerant and peace-loving.Mr. Al-Sisi rose to power in a Saudi-backed military coup in 2013 that toppled Mohammed Morsi, a Muslim Brother and Egypt’s first and only democratically elected president. Mr. Al-Sisi recently traveled to the kingdom to patch up differences over Syria, Yemen, Saudi unhappiness with his inability to whip Egypt’s troubled economy into shape, and his attempted crackdown on ultra-conservatism that led the kingdom to temporarily curtail economic support for his regime.Among the pope’s interlocutors in Egypt was former Egyptian grand mufti Al Goma, an advocate of a Saudi-propagated depoliticized form of Islam that pledges absolute obedience to the ruler, an opponent of popular sovereignty, and a symbol of the tension involved in adhering to both Saudi-inspired ultra-conservatism that serves the interests of the Saudi state, and being loyal to the government of his own country.A prominent backer of Mr. Al-Sisi’s grab for power, Mr. Goma frequently espouses views that reflect Saudi-inspired ultra-conservatism. In an interview with MBC, a Saudi-owned media conglomerate, Mr. Goma recently asserted that women did not have the strength to become heart surgeons, serve in the military, or engage in sports likes soccer, body building, wrestling, and weightlifting.Mr. Goma’s remarks came as Saudi Arabia’s ultra-conservative religious establishment was fighting a backbench battle against efforts by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to slightly loosen the kingdom’s austere social and moral codes as part of an effort to upgrade Saudi autocracy and take it into the 21st century as well as diversify and rationalize the economy.Prince Mohammed’s plans laid out in his Vision 2030 plan involves a degree of greater inclusion of women in the workforce as well as greater sporting opportunities for women in a country that does not include physical education for girls in the curriculum of public schools, has no public sports facilities for women, and bans women from driving.Pope Francis’ interlocutors in Cairo also included the imam of the Al-Azhar Grand Mosque, Ahmed El- Tayeb. A prominent Islamic legal scholar, who opposes ultra-conservatism and rejected a nomination for Saudi Arabia’s prestigious King Faisal International Prize, recalls Mr. El-Tayeb effusively thanking the kingdom during panels in recent years for its numerous donations to Al Azhar. Al Azhar scholars, the legal scholar said, compete “frantically” for sabbaticals in the kingdom that could last anywhere from one to 20 years, paid substantially better, and raised a scholar’s status.“Many of my friends and family praise Abdul Wahab in their writing,” the scholar said referring to Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahhab, the 18th century religious leader whose puritan interpretation of Islam became the basis for the power-sharing agreement between the kingdom’s ruling Al Saud family and its religious establishment. “They shrug their shoulders when I ask them privately if they are serious… When I asked El-Tayeb why Al Azhar was not seeing changes and avoidance of dogma, he said: ‘my hands are tied.’To illustrate Saudi inroads, the scholar recalled being present when several years ago Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, a former grand mufti and predecessor of Mr. El-Tayeb as imam of the Al Azhar mosque, was interviewed about Saudi funding. “What’s wrong with that?” the scholar recalls Mr. Tantawy as saying. Irritated by the question, he pulled a check for US$100,000 from a drawer and slapped it against his forehead. “Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), they are our brothers,” the scholar quoted Mr. Tantawy, who was widely seen as a liberal reformer despite misogynist and anti-Semitic remarks attributed to him, as saying.In an illustration of the sometimes contradictory pressures emanating from ties to ultra-conservatism at a time that the Saudi-inspired worldview is on the defensive, Mr. El-Tayeb together with Mr. Goma last year attended a UAE and Russian-backed conference in the Chechen capital of Grozny that had Mr. Al-Sisi’s tacit support. The conference put Saudi Arabia on the spot with its condemnation of ultra-conservatism as deviant and exclusion from its definition of Sunni Muslim Islam.The conference and Mr. Al-Sisi’s self-serving kickback at ultra-conservatism illustrates the tightrope the pope walks as he seeks to further inter-faith dialogue in a bid to counter the threat to Christians and other minorities in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Muslim world and position the church as a bastion in the fight against Islamophobia.The pope’s problem in Egypt is maneuvering between problematic partners: Mr. Al-Sisi with his brutal repression that threatens to enhance rather than limit ultra-conservatism and militancy or Islamic scholars torn between the influence of Saudi Arabia’s ultra-conservative religious establishment and their adherence to Saudi-backed notions of obedience to the ruler that dictates as well as complicates their relationship with an Egyptian leader who positions himself somewhere between them and God.Dr. James M.

16,POLITICS,"Five Ways Donald Trump Has Broken His Promise To Protect Social Security, Medicare And Medicaid In His First 100 Days","Nancy Altman and Linda Benesch, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/five-ways-donald-trump-has-jeopardized-his-promise_us_59049fe7e4b084f59b49f96a,Trump has been completely silent in the face of attacks on Social Security and Medicare from GOP leaders. Not one comment.,2017-04-29,"Trump’s campaign speeches included frequent promises to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5904a15f1400002500a9c92d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump ran for president as a different kind of Republican. During the primary, he stood out from the crowd by promising to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He went on to make that promise a centerpiece of his general election campaign.Even before the election, there was good reason to be extremely skeptical of Trump’s promise. After all, prior to running, he had called Social Security a Ponzi scheme, said that “privatization would be good for all of us,” and, in true elitist fashion, called for raising the retirement age to age 70, because “how many times will you really want to take that trailer to the Grand Canyon?” Moreover, he selected Mike Pence as his vice president. Pence has a long record of attacking Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Indeed, Pence criticized Bush’s Social Security privatization proposal for not going far enough, fast enough!It is clear that Trump understands how popular these programs are. Social Security has famously been called the third rail of politics – go after it and your political career is dead. In a 2011 interview with Sean Hannity, Trump said he was on board with plans to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — but that Republicans should be very careful “not to fall into the Democratic trap” by doing it in the open, without bipartisan cover, or they would pay the price politically.So, did Trump mean what he said during the campaign? Or, did he say what he needed to in order to get elected, knowing all along he would break his campaign promise? Unfortunately, It looks like the latter. After only 100 days in office, he has already jeopardized his promise to the American people in at least five ways:1. Championing a “health care” bill that would raid Medicare and gut MedicaidThe American Health Care Act, AKA Trumpcare, would be very destructive to both Medicare and Medicaid. Trumpcare raids $117 billion dollars from Medicare, depriving the program of essential funding and giving Congressional Republicans the perfect excuse to call for cuts a few years down the road. It cuts nearly a trillion dollars from Medicaid, which would be a disaster for, among others, millions of seniors, who rely on Medicaid to pay for long term care costs, both at home and in nursing homes.Trumpcare would also be a disaster for Social Security beneficiaries in their early 60s who aren’t yet eligible for Medicare. The bill would allow insurance companies to charge older customers far more, which the CBO estimates could lead to a massive 750% increase in their premiums. Not only has he not opposed these campaign-breaking promises, he is “disappointed,” he says, that House Republicans haven’t yet rammed this harmful legislation through.2. Appointing Anti-Social Security Mick Mulvaney as Budget DirectorIf Trump truly intended to keep his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare, he would be surrounding himself with people who support that goal. He has done exactly the opposite. For the key position of Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Trump appointed Mick Mulvaney, a member of the House Freedom Caucus well known for his fervent support of Social Security and Medicare cuts.Mulvaney has enormous influence over the budgets of the agencies responsible for administering Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. If that weren’t bad enough, he promised both GOP lawmakers and right-wing media personalities that he will push Trump to cut Social Security. On recent television appearances, including Face the Nation, Mulvaney has outrageously asserted that Social Security Disability Insurance isn’t “real” Social Security.Obviously, Social Security’s insurance against the loss of wages in the event of disability, as well as old age and death, are all essential parts of working families’ earned Social Security benefits. But, it is not hard to see the method in Mulvaney’s madness. By Mulvaney’s Orwellian illogic, Trump could cut Social Security, but claim he did not!3. Appointing Anti-Medicare Tom Price as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Trump’s choice to head the cabinet department that runs Medicare and Medicaid, is just as dangerous as Mulvaney. Moreover, by virtue of his position, Price is a trustee of Social Security and Medicare. Talk about a fox in the henhouse: Price has said “nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government’s intrusion into medicine through Medicare.” and “We will not rest until we make certain that government-run health care [e.g., Medicare] is ended.” Trump has now put him in the perfect position to carry out that threat.On top of his abhorrent policy views, Price also faces very serious accusations of insider trading, working with pharmaceutical corporations to block regulations they opposed and lining his own pockets in the process, but that’s an aside. Even if he were above reproach, his long history of wanting to dismantle Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is a breach of faith with those who believed Trump on the campaign trail when he said he would protect these vital programs.4. Instituting a Months-Long Hiring Freeze That Hurt Social Security Beneficiaries Social Security doesn’t add a penny to the deficit. Indeed, it has dedicated revenue and an accumulated surplus of $2.8 trillion, out of which is paid not only benefits but the associated administrative costs. Nevertheless, only days after taking office, President Trump instituted a federal hiring freeze that included the Social Security Administration, which is already in a weakened state due to years of budget cuts imposed by Congressional Republicans. The hiring freeze forced SSA to turn away beneficiaries who came to their field offices for assistance.Trump claims he wants to run government like a business. Any business that had a product as successful and profitable as Social Security would be increasing customer service, not restricting it. Making it harder for Americans to access their earned Social Security benefits – access they have already paid for – is terrible policy and a violation of Trump’s promise.5. Staying Silent in the Face of Attacks on Social Security and Medicare From His Own Administration and Party LeadershipDuring the election, Trump had no problem attacking leaders in his own party for supporting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid cuts. He went so far as to say “they want to really cut [Social Security], and they want to cut it very substantially, the Republicans, and I’m not going to do that” and even called out Paul Ryan by name. He, also, has not lost his flair for tweeting.But since the election, Trump has been completely silent in the face of attacks on Social Security and Medicare from GOP leaders. Not one comment. Not one tweet.Just days after the election, Ryan made it clear that he plans to make 2017 the year that he finally accomplishes his decades long goal of destroying Medicare via privatization. Trump said nothing. In December, the Republican Chair of the House Social Security Subcommittee introduced a bill to gut Social Security. Trump said nothing. This silence even extends to his own administration. Mulvaney is all over television attacking Social Security and saying that Trump’s promise isn’t binding, and the president has declined to reprimand him.A few weeks ago, reports emerged that the White House was considering, as part of its tax plan, the idea of weakening Social Security, perhaps fatally, by raiding a substantial part of its dedicated revenue. Though that proposal has not yet emerged, the tax proposals that have been released have encouraged right-wing ideologues to argue, in the Wall Street Journal’s opinion page and elsewhere, that the proposed tax cuts for corporations and billionaires are great but would be even better if they were paid for by cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Still, Trump has said nothing.As Trump acknowledged during the primaries, Republican politicians are hostile to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Even though Trump’s first 100 days have shown no fidelity to his campaign promise, it is not too late for him to prove he really is different from the Republican establishment.He can repudiate that part of Trumpcare that undermines his promise. He can make clear that Mulvaney and Price are not running the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid show. He can propose and push for the adequate funding of SSA and the part of HHS responsible for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid. And most important, he can attack those in his party who propose dismantling these essential programs and tweet his continued commitment to them.If he was not just conning the public when he promised to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, he should do all of those things. The first 100 days should not make any of us hold our breath in anticipation, though."

Every country’s human right record gets scrutinized under the process every five years.At Bahrain’s last UPR session in 2012 it was urged by other countries to do all sorts of things it still hasn’t done, including to independently investigate allegations of torture and bring the perpetrators to justice, to allow peaceful expression and demonstrations, and to let into Bahrain the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association.Since then Bahrain’s human rights record become even uglier. In the last few months the king has approved an amendment to the constitution to allow civilians to be tried in military courts, executions have resumed (for the first time since 2010), and prison conditions have become much, much worse, with leading human rights defender Nabeel Rajab and other prisoners routinely denied adequate medical treatment.Back in 2012 international journalists and human rights organizations were allowed into the country, now they are not. At the 2012 session some human rights activists from Bahrain were allowed to be at the UPR to give officials an alternative view to the rosy government line. But now activists are prevented from going to Geneva.Local NGO the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights reports that since 20 April dozens of people have received summonses and many charged with taking part in the same “illegal gathering” in January.One of them is Fatima Al Halwachi, whose father Khalil is a prominent academic and peaceful dissident recently sentenced to 10 years in prison after an unfair trial. She told me she was called for questioning at the public prosecutor’s office and charged with being part of an illegal gathering.“I knew I would be banned from traveling when I heard that my colleague was asked during an investigation on her return from a UN hearing in Geneva earlier this year ‘if Fatima will attend the next session?’” she told me. “Six police cars and a civilian car surrounded my house on Friday 21 April to issue me with a summons for investigation, where I charged with joining a gathering in Duraz, and like other human rights defenders I have been banned from travel by the public prosecution so we can’t attend the UPR.”Fatima Al Halwachi is a Swedish citizen, an articulate and impressive human rights activist, exactly the sort of person Bahrain regime fears being in Geneva when its record is under scrutiny. She’s one of more than 30 people summoned for questioning over the last week as part of the government’s attempt to muzzle criticism.The UN takes seriously threats against those who want to engage with it. Hans Thoolen, Secretary of the Martin Ennals Foundation, reminds human rights defenders they “have until the end of May to submit cases of reprisals for the period June 2016 to May 2017 to the UN Secretary-General’s report,” and should send reports of reprisals to reprisals@ohchr.org. The “reprisals report” will be made public soon.Monday’s UPR session is a chance for countries to tell Bahrain they’re not fooled by its fake reforms. At its last session in 2012, Denmark, Ireland and the U.S. raised the case of human rights defender and Danish citizen Abdulhadi Al Khawaja. The government of Australia also urged a “speedy conclusion to these cases (of human rights violations against peaceful protestors), such as the ongoing case of Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja.” He was sentenced to life in jail after being subjected to severe torture and an unfair trial. He is still in prison, and says he will suspend his hunger strike in protest at abysmal prison conditions if there are strong statements on the issue at the UPR.Bahrain’s main western backers in London and Washington seem increasingly reluctant to criticize their military ally, but the UPR offers rare chance to list the problems other counties have with the regime, and to shake its sense of impunity. The U.S. and U.K. governments should take the chance on Monday to tell Bahrain that this time flouting the UPR recommendations will bring consequences."

A court on Tuesday ordered her deportation after sentencing her to three-and-a-half years in prison for espionage.She left China on Friday from the southern city of Guangzhou and arrived in Los Angeles on the same day, her husband said in a statement.The Chinese government has not released details of the charges against Phan-Gillis. Her lawyer told Reuters on Tuesday he could not reveal details of the case because it involved “state secrets.”Her husband, Jeff Gillis, said China had accused Phan-Gillis of visiting the country twice on spy missions in 1996 and working with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to capture two Chinese spies in the United States and turn them into double agents.The deportation comes at a time of warming China-U.S. relations after U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida in early April.In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trump called Xi a “good man” and praised him for his efforts to press North Korea to give up its development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.An official of the U.S. State Department said it was aware of the deportation.“The United States welcomes her home,” said the official, who did not want to be identified by name.Negotiations to secure the release of Phan-Gillis intensified when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Beijing in March, according to the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation.“Sandy is overjoyed to be reunited with friends and family, and sends out her thanks to the many people who worked tirelessly for her release,” Gillis said.U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, said Phan-Gillis had been detained on “baseless” charges.“Today, she is released and free again. This is a day of great celebration for her family and all Texans,” Cruz said in a statement, which applauded the State Department and Trump for securing Phan-Gillis’ release.(Reporting by John Ruwitch in Shanghai; additional reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Sandra Maler)"

It wasn’t the stress of being a solo mom of three kids under ten, or dealing with chronic health issues and economic challenges. It wasn’t the video of the passenger being dragged off the United flight, or the military posturing in the waters near North Korea, or the families being broken by deportation, or the mother of all bombs dropped in Afghanistan. I could have cried about any of those things, gripped by a deep anguish and fear for where we are headed as a country and culture. What I was crying about that grey morning as the windshield wipers streaked raindrops across my line of sight was Chechnya. More specifically, reports by the respected newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, of the establishment of the first gay concentration camp, and the round-ups, torture, and interrogation of gay men in what appears to be the beginning of an attempt to exterminate queer existence there.Since the election last November, I have tread a line each day between staying aware and engaged, and trying to keep my sanity by withdrawing and indulging in enough denial to keep me functioning without falling apart. But I cannot ever ignore the fact that in the southernmost tip of Eastern Europe, 60 miles from the Caspian Sea, the Chechen Republic, or Chechnya, is replicating the process of elimination that was used on Jews in Germany. The strategies and rhetoric are similar. Round up innocent people, torture them for information on others like them, tell them to leave the country while at the same time building camps to imprison and kill them. Local journalists report that additional camps have been discovered, bringing the total known number of Chechnyan gay concentration camps to six.One divergent strain is that while Hitler clearly stated his goals for deporting and exterminating Jews in Germany, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and his press secretary, Alvi Karimov, claim the reports of gay concentration camps are libelous and untrue because they assert that there are no gay people in Chechnya. And further, that if there were gay people in Chechnya, that their families would have eliminated them through honor killings.Hitler asserted his intention to separate Jews from Aryan society and to abolish their civil, legal, and political rights as early as 1920, and by 1935 Jews were stripped of German citizenship and the first concentration camps were established. The persecuted in Nazi Germany also included queer people who were forced to wear pink triangles to identify themselves, the counterpart to the yellow Star of David Jews were forced to wear. In the past I’ve often wondered, How could people have let it happen? How could six million people be exterminated during the Holocaust while others looked on? At that time even esteemed media outlets such as The New York Times refused to report on the Holocaust, believing little could or should be done. Between the enforced censorship in Nazi Germany, and the negligence on the part of the press to report on the widespread genocide taking place, and perhaps an overwhelming sense of denial and helplessness, the Holocaust was allowed to take deadly hold.A similar question could be asked about the AIDS epidemic. In the U.S. there are approximately 1.2 million people living with HIV, and 700,000 have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and 35 million have died globally. Then President Ronald Reagan remained silent from the first reported case of HIV in 1981 until he finally spoke about the disease toward the end of his second term in office in 1987 after over 20,000 people had died. Bolstered by the support of the religious right and a new political action group the Moral Majority founded by Rev. Jerry Falwell, who claimed that “AIDS is the wrath of God upon homosexuals,” Reagan was emboldened to remain silent and let people die.In the 1970s, the pink triangle was reclaimed from the Holocaust and inverted as a symbol of queer resistance and solidarity. And in 1987, six gay activists in New York formed the Silence = Death Project, plastering posters around the city featuring the pink triangle on a black background and the words “Silence = Death” in a push for visibility and action against the silence. At the bottom of the poster were words that are still relevant and powerful today, “Why is Reagan silent about AIDS? What is really going on at the Center for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Vatican? Gays and lesbians are not expendable...Use your power...Vote...Boycott...Defend yourselves...Turn anger, fear, grief into action.”The Russian LGBT Network, headed by Igor Kochetkov, is doing all of these things. They have formed an underground railroad for gay men in Chechnya. The network has arranged travel to evacuate gay men out of the region, found safe houses, and provided medical care for those who are badly injured. But don’t let that put you at ease. As of April 21, they only had funding to evacuate 25 men. They have 30 more waiting to leave, and they receive five new requests for help each day. That number will only escalate. You can donate here to help.Here is another article that lists ways that we can take action.Crying in my car on the way to work won’t change anything, but it does take me out of my denial and puts me in touch with the emotions necessary to fuel a fight. We have to look at our history and learn from it so that it never repeats. We have to be fierce, loving, and defiant, and never, ever silent. Remember those words from 1987 and make them ours for today.Why is our government silent about these gay concentration camps? What is really going on in our governmental and religious institutions? The LGBTQ+ community is not expendable. Use your power…Vote…Boycott…Defend yourselves…Turn anger, fear, grief into action.What the bigots and homophobes and transphobes and sexists and racists don’t seem to realize is that we will never be eliminated, even if they try to pick us off one by one. We will continue to rise up in resistance. Because we have learned all too well that Silence = Death and Action = Life. Rise up!"

His hotel has seen a boom in business from visiting dignitaries.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59039fc31400001f00a9c7be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has left a trail of broken promises and unaccomplished goals in his first 100 days in office. Yet Trump has changed the White House in one major way: He has used the pomp and prestige of the presidency to serve his own bottom line.When Trump announced on Jan. 11 that he would not divest from his multibillion-dollar international business, he broke with decades of ethical norms. Dollars flowing into his business during his time in the White House will accrue to his personal benefit. More than that, the Trump brand has gotten a permanent makeover thanks to the intangible assets the Office of the President of the United States bestows.In his first 100 days, Trump has routinely advertised the link between the presidency and his brand. He has stated that ethics and conflict-of-interest laws and constitutional provisions do not apply to him. He has embraced the nepotistic practices more typically seen in pseudo-democracies and dictatorships by installing Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump as senior White House advisers.This casual attitude about ethics has trickled down in his administration. His aides promoted his family’s business on television, U.S. embassies promoted his properties on government websites and his unpaid advisers have advocated for their self-interest. This is not even to mention his disgraced former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, lying about payments from foreign governments and meetings with foreign diplomats.Trump’s subversion of the presidency to serve his interests came after he campaigned on a decidedly anti-corruption message to “drain the swamp” and called his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton “the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.”Fred Wertheimer, an expert in ethics and campaign funding, helped pass and institute the regime of ethics and campaign finance laws and norms that Trump now barely acknowledges as applying to him. From his work at the nonprofit Common Cause in the 1970s to his current role as head of Democracy 21, Wertheimer has seen and fought against many forms of Washington corruption, including Watergate, the campaign finance abuses of the 1990s, Jack Abramoff’s corrupt lobbying and the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision.“President Trump is the worst president we have had in modern times in terms of issues involving ethics, conflicts of interest, protecting the integrity of the presidency and the government,” Wertheimer told HuffPost.Wertheimer explains the situation like this: “The president maintains a worldwide business that licenses his name for fees. At the same time, he’s serving as president. His family members, his daughter, his son-in-law maintain their business operations. This is what happens in countries all over the world where leaders use their office to enrich themselves and open the door to corruption and influence buying.”Trump’s family business specializes in one thing: brand management. Trump says he’s a dealmaker, but his true skills lie in advertising and marketing. He has licensed his name to more than 50 real estate properties around the world, earning him tens of millions of dollars in revenue. And he has already turned the presidency into a marketing tool for his for-profit interests.“Everything he owns has increased value not as a result of him but as a result of the presidency, and they have said so,” Wertheimer said. “His brand is no longer Donald Trump. His brand is President Donald Trump.”Eric Trump, who now runs the Trump Organization with his brother Donald Trump, Jr., told the New York Times in March, “I think our brand is the hottest it has ever been.”As he did on the NBC reality TV show “The Apprentice,” Trump makes sure his properties are advertised to his supporters and cable news viewers on a regular basis, permanently imbuing his business with the presidential brand.Trump has visited a Trump-owned property on 31 of his first 100 days in office ― and on some days he’s visited more than one. The press reports on each visit, essentially advertising the property to the public as the federal government pays money directly to the property to rent space, rooms and even golf carts. The State Department and at least three U.S. embassies even advertised one of his properties online in April when a blog post about Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort was shared on government websites and on their social media accounts.He has spent seven of his first 14 weekends as president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, using the resort to conduct official presidential business. He hosted an open-air situation room when he consulted with Japanese President Shinzo Abe on how to respond to a North Korean missile test launch on the resort’s wide-open outdoor patio.On another Mar-a-Lago weekend, this time when Chinese President Xi Jinping was visiting, Trump made the decision to fire 59 Tomahawk missiles at an air base in Syria.Trump’s visits make his for-profit resort a permanent part of presidential history, which wouldn’t matter except that he’s the one who benefits financially.The presidential visits to Mar-a-Lago also afford members unprecedented access to the president ― for a fee. (The resort doubled its initial membership fees from $100,000 to $200,000 days after Trump assumed the presidency.) Members can also bring guests hoping to get the president’s ear.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) ― who was a bitter rival of Trump’s during the GOP primaries ― helped facilitate a meeting between Trump and Álvaro Uribe and Andrés Pastrana, two former conservative presidents of Colombia, at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month, where they lobbied Trump to oppose the peace deal between the current Colombian government and the country’s left-wing FARC rebels. The two former presidents were able to secure a private meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago when a member reportedly brought them in as guests.Trump has also visited the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., twice since his inauguration to dine on his favorite well-done steak with ketchup at the hotel’s BLT Steak restaurantThe hotel is the perfect symbol of how Trump has intertwined his personal business interests with the operations of the U.S. government. The federal government actually owns the historic building the hotel occupies, which means Trump is both the landlord and the tenant at a property that is actively generating profits for his family. Trump’s lease with the General Services Administration technically prohibits elected officials from taking part in it ― but now that Trump heads the executive branch, the agency has decided that provision doesn’t apply to him.Hotel management has already taken advantage of Trump’s presidential glow to pitch foreign governments on staying there. Less than 10 days after Trump won the election, his D.C. hotel hosted a gathering for about 100 foreign diplomats and tried to convince them to book rooms there when they stayed in Washington.“Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’” one diplomat explained to The Washington Post. “Isn’t it rude to come to his city and say, ‘I am staying at your competitor?’”Since then, the governments of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have booked rooms or hosted events at Trump’s hotel. A business group affiliated with the government of Turkey will host both Turkish and American government officials at its annual conference at the Trump hotel in May. (While Trump promised to hand over foreign profits from his hotel to the U.S. Treasury, his company has not answered questions on how it will do so.)Sarah Chayes, an expert in government corruption at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told HuffPost that it is no surprise that foreign governments with high rates of corruption are happy to put money in the president’s pocket. That’s because they recognize the arrangement.“What all his bombast and straight-talking hid is the fact that this is very similar to the structure of governments I’ve been looking at in places like Azerbaijan, Honduras, Serbia, Nigeria, you name it,” Chayes said.Chayes isn’t alone in her comparison. Former U.S. diplomats to countries with high rates of corruption and nepotism agree.“I think that by the example they’re setting you can bet that is going to filter down throughout American governance and throughout the global commercial world,” said Joseph C. Wilson IV, ambassador to Gabon and Sao Tome Principe from 1992 to 1995.The commercial enterprise Trump is most involved in ― high-end real estate ― is already known around the world for infamous cases of corruption and money laundering through shell companies. In 2015, the Department of Justice launched a pilot program requiring real estate buyers to disclose their real identities in a handful of major U.S. cities.But that program did not apply to real estate purchases in Las Vegas, where Milan Investments, a limited liability company with anonymous owners, paid $3.1 million to buy 11 condos at the Trump International Las Vegas, which Trump co-owns. Because of the hidden ownership, it’s impossible to know if the sale was purely commercial.Comparisons of the Trump administration to corrupt foreign regimes go beyond the many opportunities for influence that his continued ownership of his business creates. They also extend to the employment of his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner as top White House aides.Both Ivanka Trump and Kushner maintain loose connections to their own corporate enterprises. In fact, the day Ivanka Trump sat next to China’s Xi and his wife at a Mar-a-Lago dinner, the Chinese government approved five new trademarks for her company. Her company continues to apply for trademark protection around the world as sales of her brand soar thanks to her increased publicity.“This is just like companies that hire the Chinese princelings as a way of getting their permits agreed on,” said Chayes, who blew the whistle on corruption in Afghanistan and studies kleptocratic networks around the world.The presidential brand even extends to Trump’s adult sons, who have been assigned to run the family business in his stead. Even though the Trump Organization promised to halt any new foreign deals after Trump assumed office, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump still travel overseas to check on the family’s deals that were already underway. When they travel, as they have to Canada and Dubai, they show up with Secret Service in tow. Not only is it costly for the taxpayers to send agents on international business trips, but the visual of the president’s sons arriving with armed government protection also serves the interests of the Trump business. “When a person shows up with a gigantic Secret Service contingent, that is a negotiating benefit,” Chayes said. “That improves his negotiating position when he’s negotiating with weaker and smaller countries, which is every other country in the world except China.”In the U.S., the Trump sons are trying to expand their hotel business. They have so far had difficulty opening new hotels in cities where the president is unpopular. The family’s past cooperation with shady businessmen with unknown foreign sources of investment also posed problems for the Trump sons’ plans to brand a hotel in Dallas. Now they’re hoping to expand in regions of the country where their father is still popular.“No one has ever tried to pull off what President Trump is attempting here, which is to turn the way in which our democracy functions into the way corrupt countries function to enrich their leaders,” Wertheimer said. “It’s just never been done, and the scale here is enormous.”“But then again, we’re only 100 days in.”"

25,POLITICS,People Of Color Bear The Brunt Of Fast-Food Explosion,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fast-food-minority-communities_us_59035fb5e4b02655f83c9999,"Black America has a fast-food problem, and the U.S. government helped create it.",2017-04-29,People line up to buy food at a fast food restaurant in Harlem in New York. Minority communities have been inundated with fast food in recent decades.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5903615d1400001f00a9c6c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is no secret that America’s profusion of more than 200,000 fast-food restaurants has probably gone too far, forcing us to pay a heavy toll for easy access to all that cheap, convenient and tasty food with still-growing rates of obesity and diet-related, life-threatening conditions like diabetes.But it’s often overlooked that urban, African American neighborhoods have been disproportionately targeted by the continued expansion of fast-food chains.According to Chin Jou, an American history lecturer at the University of Sydney, this didn’t happen by accident.Jou’s new book, Supersizing Urban America: How Inner Cities Got Fast Food with Government Help, details how the U.S. government has helped subsidize the growth of fast-food outlets in minority communities through Small Business Administration grants, as well as urban revitalization and minority entrepreneurship initiatives that prioritize fast-food establishments over other industries.These efforts — along with a heavy advertising push from the industry itself — have pushed many African American families a long way from the healthier diets of previous generations. As a result, Jou points out, minority communities are disproportionately affected by obesity and related health issues.African Americans are 1.5 times more likely to be obese than white Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These disparities in obesity rates start in childhood. Not coincidentally, fast-food companies are more likely to promote their foods to minority children than to whites, potentially shaping diet preferences from a young age.It won’t be easy to reverse this trend, especially as the industry increasingly looks to Latino neighborhoods and other minority communities to boost sales. But Jou said there’s hope.HuffPost recently spoke with the author about how our American diet took such a turn and how to get nutrition back on track — even with a fast food-loving president.Your book begins with an excerpt from Eric Schlosser’s Fast Food Nation discussing the role the SBA has played in the fast-food industry’s expansion. Why did this capture your curiosity? Why did you feel this was a story worth telling?I reread the Fast Food Nation excerpt in 2010. At the time, I was studying the history of obesity as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health, so obesity was on my mind a lot. The Fast Food Nation excerpt, which was about the federal government’s loan guarantees to fast-food franchises, struck me because it occurred to me that such policies may have inadvertently and indirectly contributed to the obesity epidemic ― an epidemic that the government was in the process of trying to reduce with initiatives like Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move.”The notion that the government may have indirectly contributed to the obesity epidemic was not a new idea ― Michael Pollan is perhaps most famously associated with promulgating the idea that agricultural subsidies for crops like corn and soy contribute to the relatively low costs of processed foods made from these items. But before reading that excerpt, I hadn’t realized that the federal government also supported fast-food franchises through Small Business Administration loan guarantees.What do you think is the most troubling aspect of the SBA’s fast-food support? Why might readers be alarmed by this?A troubling aspect of the SBA’s fast-food support (and of the government’s various urban renewal initiatives since the 1960s) is that this contributed to the historical development of what has been called “food swamps,” or places that have a preponderance of fast food and junk food relative to affordable healthy foods. The development of these “food swamps” wasn’t inevitable.I was struck by how some of the factors contributing to the fast-food explosion in minority communities were often well intended — like the Clinton administration’s Enterprise Zone-Enterprise Community urban renewal initiative. There aren’t really any pure “bad guys” here, are there? Absolutely, the urban renewal initiatives have been well intentioned, and there are no clear villains in this story. Rather, this is a story of unintended consequences. I don’t know if it would have been easier to write this narrative if there were obvious bad guys, but this is a complicated story that, in my view, did not warrant the drawing out of unequivocally evil characters throughout the narrative.As you touch in the conclusion, anti-obesity messaging is sometimes critiqued as elitist. How do we combat that tendency, addressing the problem without looking down on people?You bring up a really important point. First, anti-obesity public health campaigns should not engage in any form of fat-shaming. There have been studies published in prestigious peer-reviewed journals which have found that public health campaigns employing fat-shaming (or “weight stigma”) are actually counterproductive to people losing weight, and can lead to a cascade of pernicious effects, including bullying, stress, depression, and even suicide. Needless to say, fat-shaming is also just plain cruel and sets a bad example for children.As for how to combat obesity without fat-shaming, I think we need to get away from stigmatizing large bodies and particular food habits, and focus instead on developing policies that make heathy foods more affordable, accessible, and appealing. These sorts of policies, which you also outlined at the end of the book, would all come with a price tag. Given the political climate, are you at all optimistic these solutions could realistically be on the table?Facilitating access to healthier foods for all Americans would probably cost relatively little compared to the current administration’s plans for defense spending, business tax reductions, and even the proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Even so, I’m not optimistic that healthier diets for all Americans will be a priority for the current administration. We have a president that has not been shy about publicizing his affinity for McDonald’s, KFC, and, of course, the taco bowls at his own Trump Grill, not to mention the fact that his first nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, was head of the restaurant group that owns Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s.The book touches on so many important and timely issues, were you surprised that no one had beat you to this topic?I was very surprised, which is why I dropped the book project I had been working on and decided to pursue this. While in the last stages of completing my book, I learned that a historian at Georgetown named Marcia Chatelain is working on a book on a similar topic, but focusing on McDonald’s franchise owners and the issue of civil rights. Needless to say, I’m very much looking forward to the publication of her book. Another forthcoming book I’m looking forward to reading is by a professor of Africana studies and human ecology at Rutgers named Naa Oyo Kwate.By pointing to these two scholars’ work, I am suggesting, of course, that while the development of fast food in African-American communities is one that may have been overlooked by historians and other scholars in the past, that’s no longer the case. A broader societal shift is taking on poverty in addition to other factors that contribute to obesity. Do you see any other reasons for hope that we might yet make progress on this?Nationwide and among adults, obesity rates have plateaued or risen slightly for roughly the last decade, depending on which age cohort we’re looking at. But there have also been declines among children in particular age categories, and in particular states, which give some reason for hope, since those children will become adults, of course. The CDC issued a report in 2013 showing that obesity rates fell between 2008 and 2011 among preschool-aged children in 19 states and U.S. territories. The children referenced in this report participated in federal nutrition programs, which points, perhaps, to how investments in improved nutrition by the government can be effective.The most encouraging development was from a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014 showing a 43 percent decline in obesity rates between 2004 and 2012 among children ages 2 to 5. When asked about their response to such studies, obesity experts tended to say that such findings were grounds for optimism, but that there should be continued vigilance and support for childhood obesity interventions. I would share that sentiment.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

The crowd, made up of mostly middle-aged men and women, sipped on some cold beers and took photos of the empty stage, capturing the seats in which Tom and Bruce would soon to be sitting. A few minutes before showtime, former first daughter Malia Obama, alongside a friend, found her seat in the orchestra section. Then, Hanks’ wife, Rita Wilson, and Springsteen’s wife and bandmate, Patti Scialfa, walked in together with people screaming, “Patti! Woo, Patti!” She waved to the crowd as she found her seat while Wilson and Gayle King stopped to say hello and check in on Malia.Showtime was fast approaching. And, soon enough, Hanks and Springsteen were introduced to stage and the crowd went wild. “BRUUUUUCCCEEE,” fans chanted, as they do at every one of his shows. Of course, Hanks made a joke about how he doesn’t understand why we “boo” The Boss, before leaping into a discussion on director Jonathan Demme and his recent death to cancer. “The strongest union of our two names is from the motion picture ‘Philadelphia,’ Hanks, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his role in the Demme-directed 1993 film about a man with AIDS, said. “God bless Jonathan Demme. We just lost him.”Springsteen also won an Academy Award for the movie for his work on the song “Streets of Philadelphia.”“I had some lyrics and, eventually, I just came up with that tiny little beat and the track. I figured it wasn’t what [Demme] wanted, [but] I sent it to him anyway. He sent me that opening piece of film where the camera moves slowly through Philly and I said, ‘What do you think?’ And he says, ‘Great.’ And that was it,” Springsteen explained. “Took about two days.” Hanks chimed in, “If you ever want to have a great moment in a motion picture, walk out the door and make sure they put on a Bruce Springsteen song.” The audience cheered yet again. Throughout the conversation, Hanks would weave in Springsteen lyrics ― like “My machine, she’s a dud / out stuck in the mud” ― and then request the crowd play a game of “call and response” to finish the phrase ― like “Somewhere in the swamps of Jersey.” Let’s just say true, hardcore Springsteeners were in the building.Hanks spent the next 50 minutes or so chatting with Springsteen about a lot of what was mentioned in his recent memoir ― everything from his humble beginnings to meeting with Clive Davis and the success of the “cinematic” “Born to Run.” But what really struck a chord was Springsteen’s take on living your life and not letting it pass you by. “All artists at some point believe they can live within their art. What you learn, either quickly or painfully and slowly — what you learn is it’s just your job,” he said. “You get outside of those things in music. We make our own little worlds. They can change the way you approach your own life, but they can’t give you a life. That took me a long time to learn that lesson. Thanks Patti,” he added of his wife, “It was a tremendous struggle to me.”Springsteen spoke about making his “own little worlds” within his music, explaining that writing lyrics is all about storytelling. “Basically, you tell a story to save your life,” he said. “When I was very young, I felt like I was drowning. You are not living. A writer tells a story to save his life. Three minutes of bliss and compressed living, that’s why you can get so excited in such a short period of time. It was that life or death hunger. That is what I wanted my characters to be about. Life awaits you, but taking it is a rough and tumble business.”As for Hanks' interpretation of all this, the actor put it simply when describing what Bruce, and his concerts, mean to his fans. “We will follow you into hell, sir.”"
29,POLITICS,High Schoolers Who Investigated Their Principal Visit D.C.; President To Hide,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-school-journalists-trump_us_59039a17e4b0bb2d086e693a,An investigation by these student journalists led to their principal's resignation.,2017-04-29,The Pittsburg High School students visit the HuffPost's Washington bureau.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590411d3260000bd9ac48657.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― At first, student journalists who exposed their new principal’s bogus credentials were worried their story wouldn’t have an impact, as the school administration stood by its new hire. But then the principal resigned and the story received global attention. “We worked hard on this story and we’re glad that our work was recognized, because it would have felt a little strange to do all that work and just have nothing happen,” Connor Balthazor, 17, said in an interview.Balthazor is one of the six high school students from Pittsburg, Kansas, who found that incoming principal Amy Robertson had fake degrees, one from a fake school. The team reported its findings in the school paper, The Booster Redux, at the end of March.“During the interview process with Robertson, the Booster staff found inconsistencies with Robertson’s credentials,” their article stated. “Robertson presented incomplete answers, conflicting dates and inconsistencies in her responses” during a follow-up interview, the students wrote.A few days after the story came out, Robertson resigned, leading journalists across the country to praise the students for their investigation.HuffPost invited the six teens ― Balthazor, Gina Mathew, Kali Poenitske, Maddie Baden, Trina Paul, and Patrick Sullivan ― to be our guests at the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner this weekend. Sadly, President Donald Trump won’t be attending the event because of his contentious relationship with the press. Journalists have gone to great lengths to expose his sham university, fake charity work and mistreatment of women, among other things. Unlike the would-be principal at Pittsburg High School, however, the president of the United States hasn’t been deterred from office by shame. "

Dr. Travis Bradberry provides 10 great ways to break bad habits and start your day off right.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590109af1c00001600e81e62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I don’t know anyone who couldn’t use a little boost in their energy and self-control.Researchers at the University of Nottingham recently published findings from their exploration of 83 separate studies on energy and self-control. What they found will change the way you start your day.The researchers found that self-control and energy are not only intricately linked but also finite, daily resources that tire much like a muscle. Even though we don’t always realize it, as the day goes on, we have increased difficulty exerting self-control and focusing on our work. As self-control wears out, we feel tired and find tasks to be more difficult and our mood sours.This exhaustion of self-control kills your productivity, and it makes the morning hours, when self-control is highest, the most important hours of the day.But the trick isn’t just to spend your morning hours working; it’s to do the right things in the morning that will make your energy and self-control last as long as possible.“For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.” – Steve Jobs The Nottingham research has led me to uncover ways we can break bad habits in the morning and maximize our energy and self-control throughout the day.Whether you naturally wake up feeling alert and productive or wake up with the brainpower of a zombie, these tips will help you transform your morning routine and set a positive tone that lasts the entire day.1. Start with exercise. Researchers at the University of Bristol found that people who exercise during the workday have more energy and a more positive outlook, which are both critical to getting things done. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. Exercising first thing in the morning ensures that you’ll have the time for it, and it improves your self-control and energy levels all day long.2. But drink some lemon water first. Drinking lemon water as soon as you wake up spikes your energy levels physically and mentally. Lemon water gives you steady, natural energy that lasts the length of the day by improving nutrient absorption in your stomach. You need to drink it first thing in the morning (on an empty stomach) to ensure full absorption. You should also wait 15–30 minutes after drinking it before eating (perfect time to squeeze in some exercise). Lemons are packed with nutrients; they’re chock full of potassium, vitamin C, and antioxidants. If you’re under 150 pounds, drink the juice of half a lemon (a full lemon if you’re over 150 pounds). Don’t drink the juice without water because it’s hard on your teeth.3. No screen time until breakfast. When you dive straight into e-mails, texts, and Facebook, you lose focus and your morning succumbs to the wants and needs of other people. It’s much healthier to take those precious first moments of the day to do something relaxing that sets a calm, positive tone for your day. Jumping right into electronics has the opposite effect—it’s a frantic way to start your day. Exercising, meditating, or even watching the birds out the window are all great ways to start the day.4. Eat a real breakfast. Eating anything at all for breakfast puts you ahead of a lot of people. People who eat breakfast are less likely to be obese, they have more stable blood-sugar levels, and they tend to be less hungry over the course of the day. And these are just the statistics for people who eat any breakfast. When you eat a healthy breakfast, the doors to a productive day swing wide open. A healthy breakfast gives you energy, improves your short-term memory, and helps you to concentrate more intensely and for longer periods.5. Set goals for the day. Research shows that having concrete goals is correlated with huge increases in confidence and feelings of control. Setting goals specific to the day puts everything into motion. Narrow your goals down to a few achievable ones that can easily be broken down into steps. Vague goals such as “I want to finish writing my article” are counter-productive because they fail to include the “how” of things. The same goal re-phrased in a more functional way would read something like this: “I am going to finish my article by writing each of the three sections, spending no more than an hour on each section.” Now, you have more than simply something you want to achieve—you have a way to achieve it.Getting your morning started off right at home is important, but it’s only half the battle. If you fail to maintain that tone once you set foot in the office, your morning can lose momentum quickly. Here’s how you can maintain a productive tone once you hit the office:1. First, clean your workspace. Even though it’s a pain to clean right when you get into work, it makes a big difference to your ability to concentrate. A Princeton University study found that people who worked in a clean workspace out-performed those who worked in a cluttered one because clutter pulls your attention away from your work. In fact, the effects of clutter on concentration are not all that different from the effects of multi-tasking.2. No e-mail until you’ve eaten three frogs. “Eating a frog” is the greatest antidote to procrastination, and the most productive people know the importance of biting into this delicacy first thing in the morning. In other words, spend your morning on something that requires a high level of concentration that you don’t want to do, and you’ll get it done in short order. Make a habit of eating three frogs before you check your e-mail because e-mail is a major distraction that enables procrastination and wastes precious mental energy.“Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” – Mark Twain 3. Keep morning meetings on schedule. Meetings are the biggest time waster there is, and they can ruin an otherwise productive morning. People who use their mornings effectively know that a meeting will drag on forever if they let it, so they inform everyone at the onset that they’ll stick to the intended schedule. This sets a limit that motivates everyone to be more focused and efficient. Keep your morning meetings on time, and your entire day will stay on track.4. Don’t multitask. Multi-tasking in the morning—when you have lots to do, tons of energy, and it feels like you can do two or three things at once—is tempting, but it sets your whole day back. Research conducted at Stanford University confirmed that multitasking is less productive than doing a single thing at a time. The researchers found that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information, or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.But what if some people have a special gift for multitasking? The Stanford researchers compared groups of people based on their tendency to multitask and their belief that it helps their performance. They found that heavy multitaskers (those who multitask a lot and feel that it boosts their performance) were actually worse at multitasking than those who like to do a single thing at a time. The frequent multitaskers performed worse because they had more trouble organizing their thoughts and filtering out irrelevant information, and they were slower at switching from one task to another. Ouch!Multitasking reduces your efficiency and performance because your brain can only focus adequately on one thing at a time. When you try to do two things at once, your brain lacks the capacity to perform both tasks successfully.5. Finally, say no. No is a powerful word that will protect your precious mornings. When it’s time to say no, avoid phrases such as “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them while your mind is fresh. Research conducted at the University of California Berkeley showed that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Learn to use no, and it will lift your mood as well as your productivity.Bringing It All TogetherThe right morning routine can make your day, every day. The trick is to be intentional about your mornings, understanding that a.m. hours are precious and should be handled with care.What do you do in the morning to start your day off right?

31,POLITICS,Chicago Was On The Verge Of Police Reform. Then Trump Picked Jeff Sessions To Run The DOJ.,Ryan J. Reilly and Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-police-reform-jeff-sessions-chicago_us_58f50a77e4b0da2ff86254cf,The city will serve as a bellwether for how -- or if -- the Justice Department will fight police abuse under the new attorney general.,2017-04-29,"A protester takes part in a weekly nighttime peace march through the streets of a South Side Chicago neighborhood on September 16, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ff96301c00003a00e81a45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"CHICAGO ― In the final months of the Obama administration, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division scrambled to complete its biggest-ever investigation of a city police department: a 13-month probe of Chicago’s 12,000-strong police force that wrapped up just a week before President Donald Trump’s inauguration.For more than a year, the division’s lawyers reviewed thousands of Chicago Police Department documents, visited all 22 police districts, went on 60 ride-alongs, reviewed 170 police shooting files, examined over 425 incidents of less-lethal force, interviewed 340 department members and talked to about 1,000 Chicago residents. Their final report, issued Jan. 13, recognized the tough job officers had in Chicago as they dealt with spiking gun violence, and praised the “diligent efforts and brave actions of countless” officers. But a “breach in trust” eroded Chicago’s ability to prevent crime, because officers were able to escape accountability when they broke the law, the report found. Because “trust and effectiveness in combating violent crime are inextricably intertwined,” the report found “broad, fundamental reform” was needed in Chicago. Without a formal legal agreement to reform — known as a consent decree — and independent monitoring, the report concluded, reform efforts in Chicago were “not likely to be successful.”Jeff Sessions, Trump’s attorney general, disagrees. In recent weeks, Sessions has expressed deep skepticism about the role of the federal government in fixing broken police departments, leaving serious doubts about the ultimate outcome of the Justice Department’s work in Chicago.Sessions wants the Justice Department to serve as the “leading advocate for law enforcement in America.” While admitting he hadn’t read the full Chicago report, he called it “anecdotal” and “not so scientifically based.” Earlier this month in Baltimore, a Justice Department lawyer said Sessions had “grave concerns” about an agreement previously reached between that city and the Obama administration. A federal judge signed off on the deal over Sessions’ objections.In an interview with a conservative radio host this month, Sessions seemed to suggest that Justice Department investigations and consent decrees were resulting in “big crime increases.” In an op-ed for USA Today last week, Sessions wrote that consent decrees could amount to “harmful federal intrusion” that could “cost more lives by handcuffing the police instead of the criminals.” There’s too much focus on “a small number of police who are bad actors,” Sessions wrote, and “too many people believe the solution is to impose consent decrees that discourage the proactive policing that keeps our cities safe.”Chicago has a serious violent crime problem. Last year was the deadliest in the city in two decades, with 762 homicides. But supporters of police reform like Jonathan Smith, a former official in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said that Sessions was “simply wrong” to suggest that crime goes up as a result of reform (or, in Chicago’s case, an investigation). DOJ investigations can increase community confidence in police departments and make people safer, Smith argued.“In communities like Baltimore and Chicago where certain neighborhoods are experiencing gun violence, the problems long predate Justice Department involvement,” said Smith. “The issues in those communities are linked to weakened gun laws that create easy access to firearms, lack of opportunity for jobs and housing and a history of police misconduct that creates mistrust between police and the communities they serve. Lack of police accountability is often a significant contributing factor in a spike in crime because of community mistrust.”Lorie Fridell, a criminologist and police bias expert from whom the Chicago’s Police Accountability Task Force solicited information for its report released last year, said DOJ investigations not only help to usher in badly need reforms to the specific departments probed, but other departments also rely on the reports to determine if their own departments are meeting constitutional standards. “I think it’s very unfortunate the DOJ is no longer going to prioritize police reform,” Fridell said. ”The future of police reform is therefore going to have to come from the ground up. It’s going to be important for concerned individuals to demand high-quality policing.”Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman, said it should be “eminently clear” that the Justice Department “will never negotiate or sign a consent decree that could reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city.” Sarah Isgur Flores, the top spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to point to any specific sections of consent decrees Sessions or the department took issue with, though she said there were “several areas of concern” with the Baltimore agreement, which she alleged was “thrown together in such a hurried fashion.” She said Trump’s administration “agrees with the need to rebuild public confidence in law enforcement” but had serious worries “where consent decrees may reduce the lawful powers of the police department.”Sessions appears to believe civil rights and constitutional policing were somehow adversarial to effective crime fighting, said Vanita Gupta, who headed the Civil Rights Division in the final years of the Obama administration. But “there’s no evidence that backs up what he’s saying,” she argued. Gupta rejected the new administration’s suggestion that the Baltimore agreement was tossed together at the last minute, calling it “an insult to the city and to the Baltimore Police Department,” and suggested they need take a closer look at what DOJ investigators found in Chicago.“If the attorney general and his staff actually read the report, they would see reflected in that report the perspective of hundreds of Chicago police officers themselves, who talked to us about the realities of policing in the Chicago Police Department,” said Gupta. “That report reflects in many ways a very significant set of voices from law enforcement itself.”Sessions dismissing the Justice Department’s reports without reading them also frustrates Christy Lopez, a former top Civil Rights Division official. It’s “ignorant” to describe the reports as anecdotal, Lopez said. The Chicago investigation, for example, revealed that just 1.4 percent of all misconduct complaints were sustained, or upheld as valid, over a period of more than five years, and that white Chicagoans were much more likely to have their complaints sustained than black or Latino residents.“That’s not anecdotal,” says Lopez. Lopez also said that dismissing the individual stories highlighted in the DOJ reports as anecdotal is “deliberately blind” to what investigators were trying to do. “It devalues people when you minimize the importance of their stories,” Lopez said. “You can call them anecdotes, but, for example in the Ferguson case ― when we have an officer writing down in his own report that after he went out and arrested a woman who’d called in on a domestic violence call, and he arrested her for an occupancy permit violation, and she says ‘I’ll never call the police again, even if I’m being killed’ ― that many be an anecdote, but that’s an important story to tell.”Chicago residents for years have demanded changes like a citizen-led review board for police misconduct cases or improved mental health and crisis training. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson have both expressed willingness to enact reform, with or without oversight from the courts or the DOJ. Failure to get traction for reforms — even as they face an obstinate police union — could spell political trouble for both of them. In the absence of federal action, advocates “are looking at every option ― including litigation, political pressure and legislation” to bring about reform, said Karen Sheley, director of the ACLU Illinois’ police practices project. The city has “hit a crisis point,” she added. “Everyone in Chicago should be asking their elected officials to support reform, including of the police union contracts, which are being negotiated now.”A lack of police reform has already come at a high cost to Chicago taxpayers. Since 2004, the city has forked over about $662 million for police misconduct in the form of multimillion-dollar settlements, as well as legal fees and other penalties. Settlements totaling more than $100,000 require city council approval ― and they always get it. Police who break the rules and later cost the city money are rarely punished, allowing a core of officers especially prone to violating rules to propel the staggering payout costs.In his op-ed last week criticizing police reform, Sessions pointed to violent crime spikes in Chicago and Baltimore as reasons not to implement reform, even though neither city has implemented consent decrees. In an email to HuffPost, a Justice Department representative provided links to stories about crime spikes in New Orleans, Cleveland and Albuquerque, New Mexico, all cities that came under federal scrutiny. One story highlighted comments from Louisiana’s attorney general, who argued that the Justice Department consent decree has resulted in a spike in crime in New Orleans.“It’s not fair to say that the city of New Orleans is less safe because of consent decrees,” New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat, told HuffPost after a meeting with Sessions this week.Federal consent decrees on policing do have a mixed record, but there are plenty of success stories. The consent decree monitor in Seattle, for example, recently said the police department had made a dramatic turnaround, and the overall crime rate in Newark, New Jersey, is lower than it’s been in 50 years.Peter Harvey, the consent decree monitor in Newark, said it’s simply not true that federal police reform efforts lead to violent crime spikes, and that the community is excited by the prospect of modern policing being implemented in Newark.“Remember, it’s the community that helps you police. Very few cities have enough cops to patrol a city 24-7 effectively, 12 months a year. You need the community to help you,” said Harvey. “The community will help you if you ask the community to engage with you, but what the community will not do is watch you place community residents in chokeholds where they die, and then turn around and say, ‘Well, we want to be your friend.’ Those are inconsistent messages.” Harvey said the overwhelming majority of cities he knew of found a consent decree to be a positive development, because it allowed them to bring about changes they may have wanted for years but could not implement. “In virtually every city that has had a consent decree, shootings have gone down, killings have gone down, judgments against the city have been reduced, and morale in the police department has been raised and morale in the community has been raised,” Harvey said. “It’s not going to negatively impact the crime rate, because you’re not inviting the police not to patrol, you’re not inviting the police not to enforce the law, you’re inviting the police to follow constitutional mandates.”The DOJ’s change of agenda is worrying, said Father Michael Pfleger, the outspoken pastor of Chicago’s St. Sabina Church on the South Side of Chicago.“The Justice Department, sort of being the big brother watching, the enforcer, has been a good thing across the country,” said Pfleger, who has organized his congregation to regularly protest violence and police brutality. “Now Sessions has certainly sent a message that police have no one standing over them ensuring they’re acting justify and fairly. ... That’s not what we need right now. Yes, we need strong police, but not an imposing force.”“There’s a fear, a tremendous fear I’ve heard from residents, who wonder, ‘Where do we turn? If the police are wrong, then where do we turn?’” he said.Leaving the systemic problems found in Chicago unfixed “would be a serious abdication of the Justice Department’s responsibility,” Gupta said, noting that investigating patterns and practices of unconstitutional policing was a mandate given to the Justice Department by Congress. “Nobody was surprised by the findings,” Gupta added. “The issues in Chicago are longstanding and deep-rooted. To think that there could be a crime-fighting strategy that doesn’t address police legitimacy and the severe breakdown in police-resident trust in certain neighborhoods in Chicago to me actually seems quite dangerous.” She finds it telling that Sessions and the DOJ have not identified any specific provisions of consent decrees that raise concerns. “What is it specifically that is causing alarm?” she asked. “Is it really the program at large that this Justice Department is seeking to diminish?” Ryan J.

Without any formal training, Rama turned to art as a form of therapy. She continued to make work, with limited recognition, until her death in 2015 at 97 years old. The words “art therapy” call certain images to mind: smiling flowers and gentle trees, pointy-roofed houses and birds like lowercase m’s. You know, Bob Ross–type stuff. Rama, however, was interested in more unorthodox subject matter: tongues and teeth, prosthetic limbs and animal pelts, masturbation and puddles of shit. The first New York museum survey of Rama’s work, titled “Carol Rama: Antibodies,” is now on view at the New Museum in Manhattan. Featuring 150 of Rama’s works, it is a stunning overview of an artist who followed no one and learned nothing, making work in her 80s the same way she did at 18, by following her gut. Despite the fact that Rama was born in 1918 and raised under Benito Mussolini’s fascist rule, her work feels current, frighteningly so. In a variety of media and styles, Rama visualizes the ecstatic horror of existing in a female body ― sexual, deranged and unbound.Today, women are creating the most visceral and compelling material in the horror genre, whose borders are bleeding out at an ever increasing pace. There is Julia Ducournau’s “Raw,” described in Rolling Stone as a “cannibal coming-of-age” movie ― a film so grotesque some theaters stocked up on barf bags for queasy viewers. There is also “XX,” an anthology of short horror films directed by and starring women, which made waves at the film festival circuit earlier this year. Horror has crept outside the confines of film as well. Musicians including Jenny Hval, Bat for Lashes and even Beyoncé have incorporated the genre’s tropes and aesthetic into their mangled and monstrous music videos. And on TV, there’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a thriller that verges on horrific, based off Margaret Atwood’s haunting 1985 dystopian novel, visualized with a “radical feminist aesthetic.” There are two interrelated ideas lurking at the core of most works of feminine horror. Firstly, the experience of being a woman can be a horrific one, plagued by restrictive standards, a persistent fear of violence, a sense of enforced silence and ― if you think about it all too much ― subsequent madness. The other key of feminist horror is, however, to subvert these terms, to take ownership of femininity and all the monstrosity it possesses. “I desire, I bleed, I make, I bite,” says the monstrous female, feeding off her own suffering and even taking pleasure from it. Rama herself made a conscious decision to confront the unfathomable suffering she endured at such a young age, turning pain into power. “Private circumstances put me in a state of psychological amputation and loss,” she said in 1986. “I understood that I was obeying a mechanism of repetition of pain. And that when I turned it on its head, it became a sort of devotion to pain, to joy, to death.” Rama was inspired after visiting her mother in a psychiatric clinic and observing the other patients housed there. People, she described, “with their tongues sticking out, their legs apart or crouching down in some other position.” This blatant disregard for societal norms enthralled young Rama, who found in women with mental illness something stimulating and even hopeful. “The sticking-out tongue is the object of desire,” she said in 1995. “The desire that we have too, except that etiquette enables us to swallow our tongues.”In the 1930s, Rama began creating delicate watercolors of undressed women, desirous and deranged. She often returned to the image of “Dorina,” a nude woman reclining blissfully as a snake writhes from between her legs. Her labia is blood red, as is her tongue, which dangles from her lips like a slab of raw meat. “Sin is my master,” Rama once said, when asked about artists who influenced her. The snake, a symbol of sin in Christianity, often manifests in her work, though its presence often seems more pleasurable than agonizing.During the time Rama was creating her early work, Fascism labelled deviant bodies of any kind as wicked ― whether they be physically disabled or sexually unorthodox in any way. Rama made such persons her subjects, rendering women in wheelchairs and strapped into hospital beds, men touching themselves while admiring dead horses and a lady mid-squat, producing a watery pile of poop. Through her work she bestowed the de-humanized deviants persecuted by a Fascist regime with subjectivity, and this, humanity. “I believe there is no freedom without derangement,” Rama said in 1997. “But then, we are all pretty deranged.”When Rama first exhibited her work in 1945 at Turin’s Faber Gallery, the show was abruptly shut down by the police for public indecency. Over 25 works were lost or destroyed as a result. This incident prompted Rama to explore more abstract avenues for exploring similar subject matter. Moving from figuration to expressionist collage, she continued to create works that growled and licked and scratched, never aligning herself with any particular movement, tradition or man. Rama’s abstract works, it turned out, were even more ghastly than her figurative depictions, the kind of nonsensical scary most of us only encounter in a dream state. Her canvasses are first covered with oozing globs of black, red and brown, then sprinkled with objects like doll eyeballs, fingernails or dirty syringes. The paintings resemble botched autopsies, glimpses inside bodies that refuse to remain silent any longer, their bloody insides at long last coming out to play.With her 1950s and ‘60s work, which she called bricolages, Rama took the unbound body one step further, exorcising all unnecessary parts like hair and skin. This is body horror at its finest, inspiring a mix of terror and fascination in the viewer. Rama threw the unknowability of our own bodies back at us, illuminating that few real-life monstrosities can compare to the excrescence of our own blood and guts. Rama went on to fold themes into her work that inspire feminist horror of all genres to this day. For example, one series titled “Omens of Birnam” is based on the Three Witches in “Macbeth,” who use their powers to control the fates of men. Rama was enthralled with mythical, occult women, a subject which was recently explored in 2016’s “The Witch.” For another series, Rama worked with textiles to transfigure the traditional bridal gown, eschewing traditional white for black frocks accentuated with red gashes and welts. Blood-splattered wedding dresses, symbolizing the perversion of purity, have become a horror flick mainstay, most memorably appearing in prom dress form in “Carrie.” In the 1990s, Rama became fixated, along with much of the world, on bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a deadly illness also known as mad cow disease. Research revealed that an epizootic in the U.K. was a result of cattle being fed a cattle meat-based product, therefore unwittingly committing cannibalism time and time again. Infected beasts would convulse wildly as their brains deteriorated, a visceral physical manifestation of their mental anguish. In this bizarre tale of cannibalism and madness, Rama glimpsed her own story, and the story of womankind. She connected human’s hunger for cow meat with men’s hunger for women’s flesh, thereby aligning pornography with cannibalism. “The feminine body is meat and animal meat is a body that has been sexualized by the normative heterosexual gaze,” Beatriz Preciado writes in The Passion According to Carol Rama. The madness that results from this cannibalistic chain of bodies consuming bodies, Rama believes, has been cast over time as “female hysteria.” The artist summed up her conclusions by stating, “The mad cow is me and that has given me joy, an extraordinary joy.” Her mad-cow-centric works take the shape of large-scale collages featuring pieces of rubber cut in the shapes of breasts, testicles and meaty sacs. It’s hard to decipher which parts are food and which are not. In the film “Raw,” eating meat serves as a metaphor for self-discovery and self-empowerment, feasting off others to strengthen oneself. The taboo act of eating meat generates a chain of rule-breaking discoveries ― some sexual, others psychological, some straight-up cannibalistic. The film offers an empowering alternative to Rama’s mad cow premonition ― finally a woman gets to do the consuming, for once. Today, it still qualifies as news when a “unlikable woman” appears on television. Yet decades ago, in the 1940s, Rama was pushing boundaries by depicting, in dainty watercolor, a woman sticking out her tongue while spreading her cheeks and taking a shit. Throughout her life, Rama followed no “masters,” accepted no instruction and adhered to no tradition. Her oeuvre is as loose and leaky as the innards of a dead animal. She preferred to work untrained and untethered, thus making art which which she believed “belonged to everybody,” because “madness is close to everybody” ― male or female, man or beast. Sadly, she did not receive widespread acknowledgment for her work until she was in her 80s. Even now, she remains largely unknown and underappreciated, especially given the unorthodox and insurgent nature of her work. In subject matter and style, Rama’s work most closely resembles work made decades after her ― by artists working in film, music and television. A true pioneer of the monstrous feminine, Rama realized the brutality inflicted on women’s bodies and minds and the seed of pleasure buried within that brutality. Embrace the depravity, she teaches, embrace the lunacy, embrace everything. When there is desire, even amidst unbearable suffering, there is joy. “Carol Rama: Antibodies” runs until September 10, 2017 at New Museum. "

But it comes as another major blow for presidential candidate Marine Le Pen.,2017-04-28,"Ousted interim leader of France’s National Front, Jean-François Jalkh (left), stepped down just days after replacing presidential candidate Marine Le Pen.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59035fce1400002000a9c6b9.jpeg?cache=8CmJ25Uvls&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen temporarily stepped down as leader of the far-right National Front this week, in what has been widely viewed as a strategic political move ahead of the election to distance herself from the party’s controversial past.But controversy was close behind: Jean-François Jalkh, her party’s newly appointed interim leader, lasted less than a week on the job. He stepped down suddenly on Friday as reports emerged that he once called the use of Nazi gas chambers during World War II “impossible” ― delivering yet another devastating setback to Le Pen’s election bid and her sweeping efforts to “de-demonize” the Front. The criminal issue of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial is one that has plagued Le Pen’s party for years: her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, National Front founder and leader for nearly four decades, was convicted and fined multiple times for repeatedly dismissing the Holocaust as just “a detail” of history. Le Pen kicked him out of the party in 2015, after she had taken over.But Jalkh’s newly surfaced comments have countered Le Pen’s painstaking work to recast the party’s image, and stirred memories of her father’s infamous remarks. In an interview in 2000, Jalkh was recorded questioning the events that led to the Nazi massacre of millions of Jews using the deadly gas, Zyklon B.“Me, I consider that from a technical point of view it’s impossible, I say impossible to use it in … mass exterminations,” he said, according to a transcript. Jalkh initially denied making such comments. Now, Front party member Steeve Briois will replace him as leader, but Jalkh’s ousting comes at a particularly disastrous time for Le Pen and her populist platform: On May 7, she will face off in France’s final round of elections against centrist En Marche! party leader Emmanuel Macron, who is leading in the polls.The Front’s most recent downfall is just the latest in a series of events that have seen the race for the presidency become increasingly fraught with scandal.Macron, a political novice who married his high school teacher, has been accused of favoritism and of having an extramarital affair with a man.Eliminated candidate François Fillon, who was knocked out in the first round of elections earlier this month, has also been embroiled in controversy. The conservative Republican party leader was investigated over allegations of embezzlement and paying his wife and children for fake jobs he created.And on Thursday, the European Parliament accused Le Pen of defrauding it of around 5 million euros (US$ 5.4 million). Le Pen has denied the allegations, but an investigation is underway.Le Pen has also raised questions surrounding the events of the Holocaust, declaring this month that France was not responsible for the Vel d’Hiv Roundup in 1942, when French police arrested thousands of Jewish people in Paris and deported them to death camps."

The order, signed by Trump on Friday, instructs the Department of the Interior to consider changing the existing oil and gas leasing program (which former President Barack Obama’s administration approved last year), and to review regulations for offshore energy development. It also instructs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to review marine sanctuaries that have been designated or expanded within the last decade. Hours after Trump signed the order, California state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D) announced plans to introduce legislation to protect state waters from expanded drilling. Jackson told reporters said she plans to amend Senate Bill 188 next week to prohibit the State Lands Commission from allowing any new leases in state waters for construction of pipelines or other infrastructure related to petroleum development. If approved, the legislation would protect waters three miles off the California coast. Beyond that, the water is federal jurisdiction.“For the sake of our environment, our economy and our quality of life, the door that Trump wants to open to more offshore oil and gas drilling must be closed shut,” Jackson said. “President Trump and his oil industry cronies may want to drill, but we’re going to prevent that from being feasible.” Jackson represents Santa Barbara, where a 1969 oil spill spewed an estimated 3 million gallons into the ocean and killed thousands of birds, dolphins and sea lions. Allowing Trump’s order to go unchallenged, Jackson argued, would risk future devastation. She described the issue as “deeply personal” to coastal residents. “We know that this is not a step forward, but indeed a major step backwards,” Jackson said of Trump’s order. “A step backwards into an outdated, retro ‘Mad Men’ era of energy policies that would make us vulnerable to oil spills, would be disastrous to our coasts, and cause lasting harm to our state’s multi-trillion dollar coastal economy, an economy that is dependent on fishing, tourism and our magnificent natural resources.” The bill has the support of state Senate Majority Leader Kevin de León, who called Trump’s order “stunning.” “We will oppose these efforts,” de León vowed, calling Jackson’s bill “an important step to protect our state from oil drilling.”The legislation, likely to advance in the Democratic-controlled state Senate, sets up another battle between California and the president. The state legislature has taken aim at Trump’s policies on immigration and the environment, and has taken preemptive steps to protect Muslim residents. The state is also considering a single-payer health care system as Trump continues to press for repeal of the Affordable Care Act.California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has vowed to preserve the state’s environmental protections and uphold its progressive values.“California is not turning back,” Brown said during his January state of the state address. “Not now, not ever.”Brown, in a joint statement with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), also condemned Trump’s executive order.“Today’s unilateral action is short-sighted,” read the statement. “For good reason there has been no federal expansion of oil and gas drilling along our shared coastline for more than 30 years. We still remember what happened in Santa Barbara in 1969, Port Angeles in 1985, Grays Harbor in 1988 and Coos Bay in 1999. We remember the oil soaked beaches and wildlife and the devastating economic impacts to local communities and the fishing industry. Now is not the time to turn back the clock. We cannot return to the days where the federal government put the interests of big oil above our communities and treasured coastline.” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) also vowed to oppose the order.“We will vigorously oppose new drilling off the shores of our coast,” he said in a statement. “California is leading the way in clean energy production and policies that preserve our state’s pristine natural resources. Instead of taking us backwards, the federal government should work with us to advance the clean energy economy that’s creating jobs, providing energy and preserving California’s natural beauty.”Read more on Trump’s drilling executive order here."

She said she didn’t know what prompted the suspension.In an article for The Hill, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) writes that live tissue training previously involved sedated goats or pigs, which were shot or stabbed in order to mimic injuries humans could face in combat. Those animals would ultimately be “euthanized,” she wrote. Roybal-Allard, who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, wrote that she had been working with the Coast Guard towards ending the practice.The suspension will last for at least six months while the Coast Guard examines alternatives, like realistic human dummies, Coast Guard spokeswoman Alana Miller told the Washington Post.The Post notes that the U.S. military has used animals for medical training since the Vietnam War, and faced public backlash in 1983 over plans to shoot dozens of dogs suspended by mesh slings. Protests led to then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger issuing a ban on shooting dogs for training.In 2012, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals published a video showing a Coast Guard drill that appeared to show live goats being shot, stabbed and dismembered, the Post reports. The video showed the animals vocalizing and kicking while being injured, indicating they were “not adequately anesthetized and were likely feeling pain,” PETA said at the time. The U.S. Department of Agriculture subsequently cited the military contractor involved for “inadequately anesthetizing and monitoring the goats,” The Virginian-Pilot reported. PETA has applauded the recent suspension.The Humane Society of the United States also praised the suspension, and encouraged the Coast Guard to make it a permanent change in a statement sent to HuffPost.“The Humane Society of the United States welcomes the Coast Guard’s decision to suspend live animal trauma training and urges the agency to permanently replace the use of live animals with human-based simulators, which provide more realistic training opportunities without harming animals,” the group said.Correction: A previous version of this article included a misspelling of Roybal-Allard’s last name."

His vows to make Mexico pay for it have fallen silent.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5902a3c41400002000a9c532.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just three months into his presidency, Donald Trump’s bestselling The Art of the Deal might be due for a sequel: The Humility of the Failed Bluff.The boastful businessman who claimed that his negotiating skills were unsurpassed appears to have met his match a number of times already.Trump went from accusing the Chinese of manipulating their currency to agreeing that they didn’t. He has not made any visible progress in forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall. He was talked out of abandoning the North American Free Trade Agreement by the leaders of Mexico and Canada. And he was unable to bully Democrats into working with him to repeal the Affordable Care Act.“He has folded like a lawn chair at the slightest hint of pressure, and he’s getting played like a violin by enemies like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un,” said Adam Jentleson, former deputy chief of staff to retired Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.In Mexico, the country Trump has vilified since the start of his campaign nearly two years ago, a senator told The New York Times that political leaders there have started to see Trump primarily as a “bluffer.”“In front of a bluffer, you always have to maintain a firm and dignified position,” Armando Ríos Piter told the Times.Some Trump supporters challenge that view. Michael Caputo, a western New York political consultant who worked for Trump’s primary campaign last year, said Ríos and others who underestimate Trump will be sorry.“Bluffers win. And they win big,” Caputo said. “At the end of the poker game that the senator is speaking about, we’ll end up with more chips. The senator is going to be awful surprised and out of the game early.”But other Trump allies, including radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, are starting to fret about Trump’s strategy. “I’m not happy to have to pass this on,” Limbaugh told his listeners earlier this week. “But it looks like, from here, right here, right now, it looks like President Trump is caving on his demand for a measly $1 billion in the budget for his wall on the border with Mexico.”On the campaign trail, Trump marketed himself as the ultimate closer, a tough-talking businessman who could renegotiate trade deals and international agreements to better benefit the American worker. He regularly disparaged “weak” and “stupid” leaders in Washington for failing to accomplish what someone who had actually sat at a boardroom table could easily do once in the Oval Office.“I’ve watched the politicians. I’ve dealt with them all my life,” Trump said in 2015. “If you can’t make a good deal with a politician, then there’s something wrong with you. You’re certainly not very good.”Nearly 100 days into his presidency, however, Trump appears to be finding the job is much tougher than he imagined. He has issued bold ultimatums in negotiations on health care, immigration and trade only to have to back down. While his predecessor once said he never bluffed on the world stage, Trump has embraced the risky tactic on both foreign and domestic fronts ― with little to show for it.“People put in for the TV character of Donald Trump, a hyper-confident negotiator, a wheeler-dealer mogul,” said GOP strategist Rick Wilson. “The real Donald Trump is a 70-year-old man who inherited a bunch of money who’s been bankrupt four times and who basically turned into a branding company.… He’s intellectually sloppy and temperamentally unsuited for the job.”In the health care debate, Trump has been all over the map. He first warned Republican lawmakers that he would leave the Affordable Care Act in place and move on to other priorities unless they approved a bill to repeal and replace it. The ultimatum failed to sway skeptical conservatives in the House, and lawmakers bolted town for a two-week recess without voting on the measure. He and his aides then threatened to reach out to Democrats to resuscitate his stalled agenda, but that too went out the window. This week, the administration is once again pushing for a party-line vote on an Obamacare repeal bill.Trump’s bluster toward Democrats also fell flat. Earlier this month, he threatened to sabotage Obamacare if they didn’t agree to proposed changes regarding the law. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney announced Wednesday that the administration was considering cutting off crucial payments to health insurance companies ― a move that would be devastating for people who buy coverage on their own, rather than through employers. Later that day, less than 48 hours before a crucial government funding deadline, Trump backed down and said he would honor the payments after all. Trump didn’t fare any better on funding his proposed border wall, either. Facing likely odds of a government shutdown, the president on Tuesday backed off demands that Democrats agree to fund the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border ― the same wall he said Mexico would pay for on the campaign trail. Trump maintained that the wall remained a priority and that it would eventually get built. But it’s hard to see what more he could do to persuade Democrats to vote to fund the wall between now and the next round of budget talks in September.That issue, because it was a promise repeated throughout his campaign, could do Trump serious damage if he doesn’t deliver, said Ari Fleischer, a press secretary to former President George W. Bush.“I think Trump must demonstrate this year, not necessarily now, progress toward building the wall or his base will be disappointed,” Fleischer said. “He went too far in saying Mexico will pay for it, but I believe his base cares far more about it being built and a lot less about who pays.”Trump’s efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement may yet bear fruit. His threat to pull the U.S. out of the agreement brought Canada and Mexico to the negotiating table this week. But it’s less clear what kind of concessions he’ll be able to wring out of them. Even Trump admitted that withdrawing from the trade pact would amount to a “shock to the system.”“If I’m unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we’re going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot,” he said at the White House on Thursday."

Now, it’s President Donald Trump’s turn to face this landmark moment.Let’s be honest, these “100 days” judgments can seem awfully premature. Big legislative projects can take significant amounts of time ― the implementation of those policies even longer. And the truly defining moments of a presidency could occur at any moment. There’s a sense that the “First 100 Days” rubric has become more of a media trope ― and you can tell by the way occupants of the Trump White House have responded with waves of contradictory P.R. that on some level, they agree.Something about this 100-day marker has got Trump shook, desperate to get something major in just under the wire. Perhaps any honest accounting of how things have gone for the young administration is enough to cause consternation.But there’s a lesson for Trump’s critics and opponents in the first 100 days of his presidency as well. That lesson: There are likely to be several hundred more days of the Trump presidency.The reason I bring this up is that there is a popular sentiment out there among Trump’s most ardent critics that I encounter on a semi-regular basis, in travels through social media and in real life, that holds that some quick solution to the Trump problem is imminent. A shoe drops, and it’s lights out for Donald ― or at least it’s the prelude to yet another shoe making its descent. When will the Trump presidency end? How will it happen? These are questions that have been put to me. In all likelihood, it ends with another election. If it happens prematurely, though, it will be the result of something bad, and that trauma will likely beget further trauma.Presidencies that end abruptly, by definition, don’t end cleanly. We don’t press reset, get a new slate, and walk away clean. After the ignominious end of Richard Nixon’s administration, his successor, President Gerald Ford, tried to make a swift pivot, kicking off his tenure with a ritual incantation: “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.” But if you trace our history since the end of the Vietnam War and the Nixon presidency, it looks as if that period of unease never really did end. In the decades since, we’ve been more defined by our crises of faith than we have been by our accomplishments, and trust in important institutions has eroded. Perhaps the toughest thing to grapple with right now is the realization that the presidency of Donald Trump is not actually some freak, black-swan event that rose from the ether to shock our system unexpectedly. Rather, it is the natural consequence of decades of choices that we made together.Of course, this doesn’t mean that Trump is a man more sinned against than sinning. Given his unruly nature, manic ego, and history of corruption, this should be a period of high anxiety in its own right. By my reckoning, there is a better-than-average likelihood that Trump will become involved in some serious wrongdoing ― in fact, he might be ensnared in such iniquity at this very moment. This is not, by any means, a call to give up on pursuing truth and justice, inquiry and investigation, wherever evidence may lead. It’s merely a reminder that the solution to this particular moment probably does not lie over the next horizon. It’s also an admonition to remember that should Trump be removed from office, it will likely be due to some sort of traumatizing event. So, if you’re sitting at home, fingers crossed in the hope that this is all to end some time in the near future, think about what you’re wishing for, when you wish for a quick fix.One-hundred days into his presidency, Trump’s impeachment is already branded merchandise. And The Case For Impeachment is already the title of a book, by American University history professor Allan J. Lichtman. You may remember Lichtman ― he was one of the few people during the 2016 election cycle to predict that Trump was destined to prevail, using what he describes as “the same proven method that had led [him] to forecast accurately the outcomes of eight previous elections.” This time out, even Lichtman was surprised that he’d nailed the outcome yet again.Trump took notice. After the election, he sent along a brief note of congratulations: “Professor ― Congrats ― good call.” “What Trump overlooked,” writes Lichtman, “was my next ‘big prediction’: that, after winning the presidency, he would be impeached.” It’s worth pointing out that Lichtman hasn’t based this prediction on some proven statistical model ― he admits he’s making gut predictions based on Trump’s behavior and history, along with the historical record of past capsized presidencies. Sometimes, we go too far when historians try to be pundit stars.But if you’re looking to Lichtman’s text to provide the thing the title of his book immediately implies ― a straightforward, prêt-à-porter legal case against Trump’s continued presidency that can be filed and argued ― you’re going to go home wanting. Lichtman ably explains the impeachment mechanism, describes past presidencies that have fomented crises, and even outlines ways in which “impeachment traps” can be laid. But much of the body of his book simply rehashes things that we already know about Trump: his shady business deals, his various scams, his conflicts of interests, his deceptions, and his shabby treatment of women. Lichtman is correct to note that the misdeeds of yesteryear can become relevant to impeachment proceedings. In a technical sense, they can even serve to animate an impeachment. But it’s hard to believe that any of Trump’s past transgressions, having been digested fully by the public in the years that have just passed, are going to inspire Congress to act on his removal at some point in the future.Nevertheless, there are some areas, capably identified by Lichtman, where Trump could potentially lose his grip on his office. One has to do with his varied business holdings, a ripe ground for all sorts of corruption. His stateside assets raise considerable concerns about conflicts of interest, and the possibility that he’ll be guided more by what’s best for his bottom line than he is about the concerns of the American people. Abroad, his international holdings raise the concern that he’ll be susceptible to foreign favor-trading, and give special treatment to foreign actors who agree to plump his bank account. Just this week, it was reported that the State Department was promoting Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort ― a move that brought the immediate scorn of ethics watchdogs for the potential violation of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause. (The State Department subsequently deleted these promotions.)These are the sorts of entanglements that the nation’s founders specifically sought to avoid, and which could be grounds for impeachment. But while there is an emoluments-related lawsuit currently snaking its way through the legal system, you have to remember that the most effective defender of the public interest, where conflicts of interest are concerned, is Congress, and the Republicans who control both houses have elected to turn a blind eye to the problem. Should Democrats, at some point, retake the majority in one or both houses of Congress, oversight could accelerate considerably. But either way, we are not looking at something that’s going to get Trump tossed from office any time soon. And while the Trump administration has brought a lot of attention ― and even some public affection ― to the Office of Government Ethics, this agency is not out there setting impeachment traps. If the OGE gets its way, Trump’s critics won’t even be able to make a case based on his business holdings, because he will be in compliance with OGE advice. The other area on which Trump is vulnerable is the ongoing investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the extent to which Trump and his coterie were knit up in that alleged plot. This particular case has all the high-tension trimmings, complete with the frisson of treason. But again, nothing has reached the point where anyone is moments away from being clapped in irons. This matter will also take time to resolve. And while new speculation into the matter seems to be generated on an hourly basis, depending on who you follow on Twitter, these sorts of cases can be hard to make when they seem makeable.In the end, this whole tawdry affair could end with no one being able to prove a case against Trump and his associates. It could even potentially end with their exoneration. These are outcomes for which you should intellectually and emotionally be prepared to accept. Hopefully, the outcome is the result of a thorough and professional inquiry in which we can have faith, whatever it is.Besides, do you really want the White House to have been compromised by the Russian state? Would you prefer that massive graft takes root at the executive level? Don’t forget that while any of these things might shorten Trump’s tenure, they’re still not good outcomes for the rest of us.And what about the other kinds of things that might suddenly end a presidency? Most of them involve an event that causes widespread damage, misery, or injury. We should be clear-eyed about this. If you’re rooting for a quick end to Trump’s presidential tenure, remember: You’re also rooting for something that will likely bring widespread anguish to your fellow Americans.There has to be a morning after. If Trump is taken down by intelligence community findings, corruption, or some destructive event, we’ll still have to deal with the aftermath. In that sense, impeachment is not necessarily a “peaceful remedy” at all. It would be yet another crisis of faith in fractious times, sowing tension and division, difficult to unwind. We ought to pursue the truth, serve just ends, and punish wrongdoers, but we shouldn’t be up at night, hoping for wrong to be done, just because it will facilitate the electoral outcomes we prefer.So it’s telling that in the penultimate chapter of The Case For Impeachment, Lichtman opts out of shaking the pom-poms for impeachment. Instead, he addresses Trump directly, urging him to simply change his ways, by following “a blueprint for surviving as president.” Lichtman advises Trump to divest his assets, become more forward-thinking on policy, achieve a greater level of grace and generosity in his temperament, suspend his autocratic approach, and stop lying his way out of problems.Here’s Lichtman’s final admonition to Trump: I have one word for you in conclusion, Mr. President, and that word is legacy. It’s easy to get swept up in the adulation and enthusiasm of the crowd. But you can’t build a legacy on rallies and tweets. You need solid accomplishments that make America great and safe and that will secure your re-election in 2020.Too much to ask for? Maybe. Probably. But it’s a pretty optimistic moment to come at the end of a book titled “The Case For Impeachment.” And it shows that Lichtman isn’t actually rooting for a presidency-ending trauma, despite the litany of Trump past misdeeds he catalogues in the preceding chapters. This isn’t really a case for impeachment ― it’s the case for Trump to do enough of the necessary self-reflection to have an effective, respectable, and responsible presidency. That’s something that still might be achieved if Trump took stock of his errors and made the most of this moment.And there is a lesson here for Trump’s critics and opponents as well. This is time for some fearless inventory-taking, for the generation of bold ideas, and for keeping all of your fellow citizens foremost in your thoughts. To say nothing of some relentless campaigning and organizing. This is also a legacy moment for this cohort, a time to do some work. I’ve read a lot of party “autopsies,” in which a party that loses an election attempts to assess what went wrong. In all honestly, they never really boil down to real change. Instead, they become a call to do the same old things, just with better marketing. Democrats in particular have repeatedly gone to the “but our opponents are crazy” well, only to face the law of diminishing returns head-on. Everybody is looking for shortcuts instead of doing honest evaluation, and the shortcuts don’t lead anywhere.Should Trump’s term be shortened by wrongdoing, let it be the result of justice being served as clearly and as honestly as possible. In the meantime, everyone would be well-advised to spend a lot less time and labor crossing their fingers in the hopes of a quick fix. Quick fixes don’t exist.In fact, it can be argued that it was the search for this quick fix that led us to this point in the first place. The real “100 days” lesson for those who hope to one day supplant Trump, is that the first political party or movement that courageously takes stock in itself, generates new ideas, and eschews the temptation of the easy answer is likely to be the next one that builds something that endures. And should Trump’s time in office end in infamy, they’ll be in a better position to help the country heal. That’s what it takes to end a nightmare, if not a presidency.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

Big legislative projects can take significant amounts of time ― the implementation of those policies even longer. And the truly defining moments of a presidency could occur at any moment. There’s a sense that the “First 100 Days” rubric has become more of a media trope ― and you can tell by the way occupants of the Trump White House have responded with waves of contradictory P.R. that on some level, they agree.Something about this 100-day marker has got Trump shook, desperate to get something major in just under the wire. Perhaps any honest accounting of how things have gone for the young administration is enough to cause consternation.But there’s a lesson for Trump’s critics and opponents in the first 100 days of his presidency as well. That lesson: There are likely to be several hundred more days of the Trump presidency.The reason I bring this up is that there is a popular sentiment out there among Trump’s most ardent critics that I encounter on a semi-regular basis, in travels through social media and in real life, that holds that some quick solution to the Trump problem is imminent. A shoe drops, and it’s lights out for Donald ― or at least it’s the prelude to yet another shoe making its descent. When will the Trump presidency end? How will it happen? These are questions that have been put to me. In all likelihood, it ends with another election. If it happens prematurely, though, it will be the result of something bad, and that trauma will likely beget further trauma.Presidencies that end abruptly, by definition, don’t end cleanly. We don’t press reset, get a new slate, and walk away clean. After the ignominious end of Richard Nixon’s administration, his successor, President Gerald Ford, tried to make a swift pivot, kicking off his tenure with a ritual incantation: “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.” But if you trace our history since the end of the Vietnam War and the Nixon presidency, it looks as if that period of unease never really did end. In the decades since, we’ve been more defined by our crises of faith than we have been by our accomplishments, and trust in important institutions has eroded. Perhaps the toughest thing to grapple with right now is the realization that the presidency of Donald Trump is not actually some freak, black-swan event that rose from the ether to shock our system unexpectedly. Rather, it is the natural consequence of decades of choices that we made together.Of course, this doesn’t mean that Trump is a man more sinned against than sinning. Given his unruly nature, manic ego, and history of corruption, this should be a period of high anxiety in its own right. By my reckoning, there is a better-than-average likelihood that Trump will become involved in some serious wrongdoing ― in fact, he might be ensnared in such iniquity at this very moment. This is not, by any means, a call to give up on pursuing truth and justice, inquiry and investigation, wherever evidence may lead. It’s merely a reminder that the solution to this particular moment probably does not lie over the next horizon. It’s also an admonition to remember that should Trump be removed from office, it will likely be due to some sort of traumatizing event. So, if you’re sitting at home, fingers crossed in the hope that this is all to end some time in the near future, think about what you’re wishing for, when you wish for a quick fix.One-hundred days into his presidency, Trump’s impeachment is already branded merchandise. And The Case For Impeachment is already the title of a book, by American University history professor Allan J. Lichtman. You may remember Lichtman ― he was one of the few people during the 2016 election cycle to predict that Trump was destined to prevail, using what he describes as “the same proven method that had led [him] to forecast accurately the outcomes of eight previous elections.” This time out, even Lichtman was surprised that he’d nailed the outcome yet again.Trump took notice. After the election, he sent along a brief note of congratulations: “Professor ― Congrats ― good call.” “What Trump overlooked,” writes Lichtman, “was my next ‘big prediction’: that, after winning the presidency, he would be impeached.” It’s worth pointing out that Lichtman hasn’t based this prediction on some proven statistical model ― he admits he’s making gut predictions based on Trump’s behavior and history, along with the historical record of past capsized presidencies. Sometimes, we go too far when historians try to be pundit stars.But if you’re looking to Lichtman’s text to provide the thing the title of his book immediately implies ― a straightforward, prêt-à-porter legal case against Trump’s continued presidency that can be filed and argued ― you’re going to go home wanting. Lichtman ably explains the impeachment mechanism, describes past presidencies that have fomented crises, and even outlines ways in which “impeachment traps” can be laid. But much of the body of his book simply rehashes things that we already know about Trump: his shady business deals, his various scams, his conflicts of interests, his deceptions, and his shabby treatment of women. Lichtman is correct to note that the misdeeds of yesteryear can become relevant to impeachment proceedings. In a technical sense, they can even serve to animate an impeachment. But it’s hard to believe that any of Trump’s past transgressions, having been digested fully by the public in the years that have just passed, are going to inspire Congress to act on his removal at some point in the future.Nevertheless, there are some areas, capably identified by Lichtman, where Trump could potentially lose his grip on his office. One has to do with his varied business holdings, a ripe ground for all sorts of corruption. His stateside assets raise considerable concerns about conflicts of interest, and the possibility that he’ll be guided more by what’s best for his bottom line than he is about the concerns of the American people. Abroad, his international holdings raise the concern that he’ll be susceptible to foreign favor-trading, and give special treatment to foreign actors who agree to plump his bank account. Just this week, it was reported that the State Department was promoting Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort ― a move that brought the immediate scorn of ethics watchdogs for the potential violation of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause. (The State Department subsequently deleted these promotions.)These are the sorts of entanglements that the nation’s founders specifically sought to avoid, and which could be grounds for impeachment. But while there is an emoluments-related lawsuit currently snaking its way through the legal system, you have to remember that the most effective defender of the public interest, where conflicts of interest are concerned, is Congress, and the Republicans who control both houses have elected to turn a blind eye to the problem. Should Democrats, at some point, retake the majority in one or both houses of Congress, oversight could accelerate considerably. But either way, we are not looking at something that’s going to get Trump tossed from office any time soon. And while the Trump administration has brought a lot of attention ― and even some public affection ― to the Office of Government Ethics, this agency is not out there setting impeachment traps. If the OGE gets its way, Trump’s critics won’t even be able to make a case based on his business holdings, because he will be in compliance with OGE advice. The other area on which Trump is vulnerable is the ongoing investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the extent to which Trump and his coterie were knit up in that alleged plot. This particular case has all the high-tension trimmings, complete with the frisson of treason. But again, nothing has reached the point where anyone is moments away from being clapped in irons. This matter will also take time to resolve. And while new speculation into the matter seems to be generated on an hourly basis, depending on who you follow on Twitter, these sorts of cases can be hard to make when they seem makeable.In the end, this whole tawdry affair could end with no one being able to prove a case against Trump and his associates. It could even potentially end with their exoneration. These are outcomes for which you should intellectually and emotionally be prepared to accept. Hopefully, the outcome is the result of a thorough and professional inquiry in which we can have faith, whatever it is.Besides, do you really want the White House to have been compromised by the Russian state? Would you prefer that massive graft takes root at the executive level? Don’t forget that while any of these things might shorten Trump’s tenure, they’re still not good outcomes for the rest of us.And what about the other kinds of things that might suddenly end a presidency? Most of them involve an event that causes widespread damage, misery, or injury. We should be clear-eyed about this. If you’re rooting for a quick end to Trump’s presidential tenure, remember: You’re also rooting for something that will likely bring widespread anguish to your fellow Americans.There has to be a morning after. If Trump is taken down by intelligence community findings, corruption, or some destructive event, we’ll still have to deal with the aftermath. In that sense, impeachment is not necessarily a “peaceful remedy” at all. It would be yet another crisis of faith in fractious times, sowing tension and division, difficult to unwind. We ought to pursue the truth, serve just ends, and punish wrongdoers, but we shouldn’t be up at night, hoping for wrong to be done, just because it will facilitate the electoral outcomes we prefer.So it’s telling that in the penultimate chapter of The Case For Impeachment, Lichtman opts out of shaking the pom-poms for impeachment. Instead, he addresses Trump directly, urging him to simply change his ways, by following “a blueprint for surviving as president.” Lichtman advises Trump to divest his assets, become more forward-thinking on policy, achieve a greater level of grace and generosity in his temperament, suspend his autocratic approach, and stop lying his way out of problems.Here’s Lichtman’s final admonition to Trump: I have one word for you in conclusion, Mr. President, and that word is legacy. It’s easy to get swept up in the adulation and enthusiasm of the crowd. But you can’t build a legacy on rallies and tweets. You need solid accomplishments that make America great and safe and that will secure your re-election in 2020.Too much to ask for? Maybe. Probably. But it’s a pretty optimistic moment to come at the end of a book titled “The Case For Impeachment.” And it shows that Lichtman isn’t actually rooting for a presidency-ending trauma, despite the litany of Trump past misdeeds he catalogues in the preceding chapters. This isn’t really a case for impeachment ― it’s the case for Trump to do enough of the necessary self-reflection to have an effective, respectable, and responsible presidency. That’s something that still might be achieved if Trump took stock of his errors and made the most of this moment.And there is a lesson here for Trump’s critics and opponents as well. This is time for some fearless inventory-taking, for the generation of bold ideas, and for keeping all of your fellow citizens foremost in your thoughts. To say nothing of some relentless campaigning and organizing. This is also a legacy moment for this cohort, a time to do some work. I’ve read a lot of party “autopsies,” in which a party that loses an election attempts to assess what went wrong. In all honestly, they never really boil down to real change. Instead, they become a call to do the same old things, just with better marketing. Democrats in particular have repeatedly gone to the “but our opponents are crazy” well, only to face the law of diminishing returns head-on. Everybody is looking for shortcuts instead of doing honest evaluation, and the shortcuts don’t lead anywhere.Should Trump’s term be shortened by wrongdoing, let it be the result of justice being served as clearly and as honestly as possible. In the meantime, everyone would be well-advised to spend a lot less time and labor crossing their fingers in the hopes of a quick fix. Quick fixes don’t exist.In fact, it can be argued that it was the search for this quick fix that led us to this point in the first place. The real “100 days” lesson for those who hope to one day supplant Trump, is that the first political party or movement that courageously takes stock in itself, generates new ideas, and eschews the temptation of the easy answer is likely to be the next one that builds something that endures. And should Trump’s time in office end in infamy, they’ll be in a better position to help the country heal. That’s what it takes to end a nightmare, if not a presidency.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

And we take a look ahead to the 2018 midterms ― and to the UK’s election in June. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 28, 2017.QUANTIFYING PRESIDENT TRUMP’S FIRST MONTHS IN OFFICE - Donald Trump is closing in on his first 100 days as president ― and whether or not you consider that a significant milestone, it’s as good a time as any to take stock of his numbers, via HuffPost Pollster’s aggregates of publicly available surveys. All data is as of Friday morning. [Pollster charts]TRUMP’S APPROVAL RATING-Among the public: 43% approve of Donald Trump’s job as president, while 52% disapprove-Among Democrats: 13% approve, 85% disapprove-Among Republicans: 84% approve, 13% disapprove-Among independents: 40% approve, 51% disapprove-On the economy: 45% approve, 45% disapprove-On health care: 36% approve, 54% disapprove-On foreign policy: 41% approve, 49% disapprove WHAT THE POLLS ARE SAYING - There’s no shortage of polling delving into opinions on Trump’s first 100 days in office, although there is a notable scarcity of good headlines for Trump in the mix. We’ve rounded up some of the key takeaways from the latest surveys. Opinions on Trump are deeply polarized - Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto: “Ratings of Donald Trump are far more partisan than ratings of his immediate predecessors were at this point in their presidencies: both Presidents Obama and Bush enjoyed higher ratings from the opposing political party at the 100-day mark. Mr. Trump also gets lower ratings [than] they did among independents.” [CBS]Voters don’t think he’s bringing real change, but do see a brightening economic picture  - Dana Blanton: “Trump’s victory came from voters’ desire for change ― a big part of which was ‘draining the swamp.’ Yet only 43 percent think the president is succeeding in bringing real change to Washington. More, 50 percent, say he’s failing….The number saying the economy is in ‘poor’ shape is lower than it’s been in more than a decade. By an 18-point margin, 52-34 percent, voters see the nation’s job situation improving ― the first time since 2004 that more than half say so.” [Fox]Fewer now believe he’s keeping his promises - Ryan Teague Beckwith: “According to a TIME-SurveyMonkey poll conducted last week, just 25% of Americans believe that Trump ‘keeps his promises,’ down from 31% in a similar poll in early February….Just 26% of Americans said that Trump accomplished most or almost all of the things he said he would do in his first 100 days, down from the 40% who expected that he would do so in a similar survey just after his inauguration.” [Time]Trump isn’t expanding his base - Jennifer Agiesta: “Overall, 44% say they approve of Trump’s handling of the presidency, 54% disapprove. That’s about the same as in each of the two previous CNN/ORC polls taken after his inauguration….The poll finds declining ratings for Trump’s handling of two issues that have been top priorities since he took office ― health care and immigration.” [CNN]And his image remains largely what it was in January - Kathy Frankovic: “What Americans saw in President Trump as he was inaugurated nearly 100 days ago is more or less the same things they see today: opinions of his qualities and his Presidency have changed little. The public is more negative than positive about his performance, and most continue to find weaknesses in his honesty, empathy and temperament.” [YouGov]Millennials are not impressed - Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, with GfK: “As the first 100 days of the administration nears, 32% of 18 to 29 year old Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s job performance overall…[Y]oung Americans’ approval of President Trump’s handling of the economy is at 37%. Furthermore on other issues, the poll finds his approval of dealing with ISIS at 33%, health care at 30%, climate change at 28% and performance on race relations at 27%.” [Harvard IOP]But Trump voters have few regrets - UVA, in conjunction with Public Opinion Strategies (R): “A new University of Virginia Center for Politics poll of Trump voters shows his approval rating at 93% with these voters, though just 42% ‘strongly approve’ while 51% ‘somewhat approve.’...To the extent that Trump voters expressed concern about the president, they worried about his tweeting….Looking ahead to the 2018 midterm election, 78% of respondents said they planned to vote for the Republican candidate in their House district, 2% for the Democratic candidate, and 19% undecided.” [Sabato’s Crystal Ball] WHAT DO TRUMP’S RATINGS MEAN FOR THE MIDTERMS? - Harry Enten: “[P]residential approval is not a great measure of the more immediate electoral issue: How will the president’s party do in the midterm elections? By all means, keep one eye on Trump’s approval rating, but keep the other on the generic congressional ballot — a longstanding poll question that pits a nameless Republican against a nameless Democrat in a race for the House. Approval ratings have historically jumped all over the place, and even on the eve of the midterms, they do a relatively poor job of forecasting the election results. The generic ballot, in contrast, has tended to be far more telling. And the generic ballot polls conducted since Trump became president suggest that House Republicans are on track to suffer a potentially major defeat in the 2018 midterm elections. The relationship between how the House majority party fares on the generic ballot at this point and how it does in the next midterm election is messy. Republicans weren’t polling well in the first half of 2013, for example, but went on to dominate the 2014 midterms….[But] when we look at the generic ballot numbers this early in the cycle while also accounting for who holds the White House, the generic ballot has forecasted midterm House results fairly well.” [538]HUFFPOST POLLSTER IS NOW TRACKING THE UK ELECTION - United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May has called for a snap general election to be held June 8. Currently, the Conservative Party is in the lead with 46 percent, per HuffPost’s aggregate, followed by the Labour Party with 29 percent. The Liberal Democrats stand at 11 percent and UKIP and the Scottish National Party each receive about 5 percent.

47,POLITICS,Senate Democrats Introduce Bill To Completely Ditch Fossil Fuels By 2050,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-100-by-50_us_590377e3e4b0bb2d086e23fb,"The ""100 by '50 Act,"" co-sponsored by Bernie Sanders, is a long-shot rallying cry.",2017-04-28,Sen. Merkley during a news conference on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on legislation he is sponsoring that is aimed at eliminating U.S. dependence on overseas oil by 2030. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59037968260000bd9ac484ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) knows the bill he introduced on Thursday to transition the United States to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 probably won’t become law anytime soon.But, as one of the Senate’s most hawkish environmentalists, this is his moonshot. “It’s the equivalent of Kennedy saying ‘we’re going to put an American on the moon, and we’re going to do it by the end of the decade,’” Merkley told HuffPost by phone on Friday, referring to former President John F. Kennedy’s historic May 1961 speech. “When Kennedy said that, we didn’t have the technology, we didn’t have it figured out but we knew what we wanted.” Eight years later, astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped off Apollo 11 and onto the surface of the moon. Thirty-three years from now, Merkley hopes every car, power plant and factory is powered by zero-emissions energy. “We may not be able to get a hearing on it at this point. We may not be able to get it in the Oval Office, but we can engage people in discussions that will become not whether to do it, but how,” Merkley said. “What this bill does is say we have to take on every sector of the energy economy.” Called “the 100 by ‘50 Act,” the bill ― co-sponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) ― is more of a rallying cry than a viable policy proposal, as HuffPost first reported earlier this month. The Republican-dominated Congress is unlikely to even give the bill a hearing, let alone advance it to the desk of President Donald Trump, a staunch fossil fuel advocate whose administration appears to spend more time antagonizing environmentalists than listening to them.“It’s a values statement that says we stand by the principle, the vision, of eliminating the fossil fuel energy economy,” said Merkley, who rated 100 percent last year on the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters’ scorecard, which ranks lawmakers based on how they vote on environmental legislation. “We can emblazon the phrase ‘100 by ‘50’ into people’s minds so that vision statement becomes clear.”The bill outlines a timeline for converting the U.S. vehicle fleet to electric, shuttering coal- and gas-burning power plants and making energy efficiency policies more widespread. It lays out plans to retrain workers in dirty energy sectors, such as oil drillers, for new jobs, and support low-income communities of color who have suffered disproportionately from the effects of pollution. The political climate may not be conducive to turning the bill into law, but the economics are increasingly in its favor. Over the last year, the average cost of generated solar energy dropped by 17 percent, onshore wind fell by 18 percent and offshore wind turbine power plummeted by 28 percent, according to a new report from the United Nations and Bloomberg New Energy Finance. And with battery storage ― considered by many the missing piece of the renewable energy equation ― set to expand rapidly this year, it’s easy to see why renewable energy investors remain optimistic even in the Trump era. “Instead of making changes around the margins, this bill would finally commit America to the wholesale energy transformation that technology has made possible and affordable, and that an eroding climate makes utterly essential,” Bill McKibben, 350.org co-founder, said in a statement. “This bill won’t pass Congress immediately―the fossil fuel industry will see to that―but it will change the debate in fundamental ways.”The bill also establishes a clear policy position around which Democrats can court a grassroots base alienated by Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential run. Those voters later criticized party elites for electing former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as chairman of the Democratic National Committee over Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who had won support from both Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer. In March, Sanders announced plans to introduce a single-payer health care bill after the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act crumbled. Though similarly doomed to gather dust, “the 100 by ‘50 Act” articulates a vision around which Democratic lawmakers can organize their base. “You’re not fighting if you don’t put forward a bill,” Merkley said. “We’re preparing for the moment when we have an opportunity to enact that road.” "
48,POLITICS,Congress Buys Some Time To Finish A Massive Spending Deal,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-spending-deal-one-week_us_59036ae5e4b0bb2d086debcb,"Mind you, this was supposed to be done by last October.",2017-04-28,House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer vented his frustration over the spending talks on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59036cae260000bd9ac484ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Still lacking an agreement on an omnibus spending deal to keep the government open, Congress passed a one-week funding measure on Friday so that Republicans and Democrats could continue negotiations.Lawmakers generally saw the so-called continuing resolution as yet another letdown. Congress has already passed two previous continuing resolutions to give members more time to complete the 2017 appropriations process, which was supposed to be finished by the end of last September. Republicans were also hoping that passing an omnibus deal this week would allow President Donald Trump to tout the agreement as an accomplishment in his first 100 days, even if there are hardly any wins in the deal for Republicans.The House easily passed the bill by a vote of 382-30, and then the Senate passed it by voice vote later Friday afternoon. Now the stopgap bill moves to Trump’s desk for his signature before midnight to avoid a government shutdown. With the extra time gained and barring any unexpected hiccups, lawmakers sound confident they can come to an agreement next week on legislation that will fund the government until October.Democratic and Republican leaders, however, have yet to settle all their issues on the larger bill. Lawmakers are still hammering out some lingering provisions dealing with environmental, financial and drug regulations.“Our people on the Appropriations Committee stayed up till 1:30 last night,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Friday. “They made a good deal of progress, but we still have some progress to go.”Schumer said that Republicans had removed a number of policy riders that Democrats thought were inappropriate for a spending bill, but there were still some more provisions that Democrats want out. “And so we’re willing to extend things for a little bit more time, in hopes that the same kind of progress can continue to be made,” Schumer said. “But we still have a little bit of a ways to go, and they still have some poison pill riders that they haven’t dropped yet.”Republicans and Democrats have agreed to the overall framework of the omnibus deal. Lawmakers and aides said the bill would appropriate money at levels consistent with the sequestration caps set in 2011 ― save for “emergency” border security funding and some money for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. In a blow to Trump and other Republicans, the spending deal would not put money toward the construction of a border wall. In a blow to Democrats, it would not appropriate money for the Obamacare subsidies.Even though many Republicans favor the government continuing to pay those subsidies, Republican appropriators said it would be unfair to force members of their party to vote for that money. “Because then you’d have to have members voting to sustain a system that they were against, and that’s not fair to ask them that,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said Friday.The House is technically suing over the executive branch’s authority to make those payments. But Republicans seem to believe the situation is sustainable as long as the Department of Health and Human Services keeps making the payments and a court ruling in favor of the House remains stayed pending an appeal.Lawmakers are also looking to close deals that would offer a permanent fix on health care benefits for retired miners and provide money to address a Medicaid shortfall in Puerto Rico, although both items are somewhat in flux. Members are still figuring out how much money will go to Puerto Rico and how miners’ health care costs will be offset in the budget.“As long as they work out the details between how it’s going to be paid for,” said Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.), who’s been pushing for the miners, “we think it’s going to be fine.”While the various agreements all seem to be coming together, there’s still the possibility that congressional talks could derail. It appears that Trump and his administration have periodically jumped into the talks and nearly wrecked already settled deals. A Trump tweet this week seemed to oppose money going to Puerto Rico even after Republicans had already conceded that point. Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney almost caused a health care crisis himself when he appeared to threaten a stoppage in the Obamacare subsidies, pressing Democrats to reconsider whether they could accept an omnibus deal without those “cost-sharing reduction” payments.And then there is the larger push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act hanging over the whole process. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday that he would urge Democrats to vote against the continuing resolution if Republicans tried to pass their health care bill this week. He sounded like a man at wits’ end over the entire situation.“I am going to vote for this continuing resolution,” Hoyer said on the House floor Friday, “but I want to put my colleagues on notice, and the American people on notice, Mr. Speaker, that I will not vote for another one.”Michael McAuliff contributed to this report."
49,MEDIA,Fox News Breaks With AP And Top TV Networks For Election Day Polling,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-exit-polls-election_us_590265f7e4b05c39767d4190,The network quits an exit poll consortium amid concerns about the process that led to expectations Hillary Clinton would win.,2017-04-28,Fox News broke with the rest of the networks over how exit polls are conducted on election night. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590266cd2600003596c48251.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fox News has broken with the National Election Pool, a consortium of five major television networks and The Associated Press that share the costs and results of exit polls for national elections.“We’ve had concerns with Election Day exit polling for many years, and this year once again proved that they are problematic,” Jay Wallace, Fox’s executive vice president of news, said in a statement after HuffPost learned the network was dropping out. “Our plan is to explore and find a more modern measurement of voter sentiment on Election Day.”The exit polls, which attempt to measure which candidates voters selected and why before polls close, have played a key role on election night broadcasts. The data, quarantined until 5 p.m., gives network executives and anchors an early sense of how the rest of the night is likely to play out.And for those manning control rooms and anchor desks in November, it appeared likely they’d be announcing in a few hours that Hillary Clinton had become the 45th president of the United States. “We were all around this long table, Rupert [Murdoch] at the head of the table, and all of the producers and anchors on both sides of it,” Fox News anchor Chris Wallace recalled in January. “They gave us the first wave of exit polls. While it didn’t flat-out say Clinton was going to win, if you read it, you had to think Clinton was going to win.”According to the 2016 exit polls, Clinton was expected to win the battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida — and in effect, the presidency. She went on to lose all four states, tipping the election to Donald Trump.Fox News’ concern about the reliability of exit polls is shared by some other participants of the consortium, according to sources, especially as a shrinking percentage of voters head to the polls on Election Day. In 2016, early voting surged to nearly 40 percent of the total vote.  With Fox out, The AP and four TV networks — CBS, ABC, NBC, and CNN — will presumably each have to pay more for the exit polling, which is conducted by Edison Research and costs millions of dollars. An alternative, less likely, would be to reduce the area covered by exit polls. Typically, exit polls focus on roughly two dozen states with the most competitive races. Networks have tried reforming the exit poll process before, especially after all five infamously called Florida for Vice President Al Gore in the disputed 2000 election. Though the networks share exit poll data, each has their own decision desk to crunch numbers on election night, which is why one may project a winner in a state that another says is still “too close to call.”Following more problems around the 2002 election, the networks switched from Voter News Service to Edison Research. The networks have agreed since the Florida debacle not to call winners in states based on exit polls prior to the close of voting. However, anchors may discuss other findings in the exit polls, such as why voters said they went to the polls.Even if anchors aren’t projecting winners before the polls close, the post-5 p.m. exit poll expectations can set the tone for early coverage, as was the case in 2016.

Bills in two states would eliminate liability for drivers who run into protesters — as long as it’s “accidental.” State lawmakers in Tennessee introduced such a measure shortly after a Nashville driver struck a safety worker protecting people protesting against President Donald Trump. Arizona’s Republican state senators voted for legislation that could hit some protesters with racketeering charges. In the Wisconsin bill legislators are pushing this week, University of Wisconsin students who disrupt speeches and demonstrations could be expelled, and campuses would have to remain neutral on political issues, The Associated Press reports.Tensions are mounting at colleges across the U.S., particularly those with a history of progressive activism such as the UW-Madison campus and the University of California at Berkeley. Conservative commentator Ann Coulter cancelled a speech Thursday at Berkeley amid security concerns in a city that has been rattled by violent political confrontations in recent weeks. In February, Berkeley protesters stopped former Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking. And in November, UW-Madison students shouted down former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro who spoke on campus.States including Michigan, North Carolina and Virginia are now considering campus bills. The measures are based on guidelines that the Goldwater Institute created. The Goldwater plan would prevent college administrators from disinviting speakers “no matter how controversial,” and impose sanctions on students who “interfere with the free-speech rights of others.” Such “interference” apparently includes speaking out at a speech.Colorado passed a law this month that ensures the right to demonstrate, organize or speak concerning a political issue anywhere on campus. Though Republicans viewed as protecting conservative speakers launched the measure, it was ultimately also backed by some Democrats, who saw it as protecting the rights of progressive activists on campus. The university system had previously limited demonstrations to specific “free speech zones.”Wisconsin Republicans say their anti-heckling bill “protects the freedom of expression on college campuses.”The head of the progressive One Wisconsin Now called the bill’s sponsors “fragile snowflakes” — an insult conservatives typically use against liberals.“Now, these Republicans want to make our campuses safe spaces for Republicans to be free of criticism and subject students to legal sanctions if they speak out,” executive director Scot Ross said in a statement Thursday."

Under a new measure being floated in the House, companies like Consol Energy would be able to shift their obligations to cover the health care costs of retired coal miners on to the federal government, which already pays for other retirees’ coverage. The measure, pushed by Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), could jeopardize efforts to finalize a separate provision that would permanently fund health benefits for retired United Mine Workers. Those benefits, which pertain only to mine workers who worked for now-bankrupt companies, are set to expire in a matter of days. There remains a dispute over how to pay for a permanent fix. But the Murphy text, lawmakers warn, could complicate those already difficult negotiations as Congress tries to keep the government funded this week. “Consol is probably one of the premier coal companies we’ve ever had in West Virginia and I’m very appreciative of all they’ve done, all the good jobs they’ve provided,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told HuffPost on Thursday. “But this bill, the way it’s been configured, the way it’s been worked, is not a place for that right now because they still have a viable company, an ongoing company.”Manchin said the current measure to permanently fix health benefits for United Mine Workers and their widows is “truly a bill that protects orphans.”“These are people who were left behind, their companies went bankrupt, they left the system,” he said. “There’s no way to get any type of payment.”But if Murphy’s language is attached to the current miner fix, Manchin warned, it would make Democrats and possibly a number of Republicans abandon ship.“To do that at this time would not be advised at all,” Manchin said. “I think the Senate is pretty much resolved in where we are and I think that’s been transmitted to the House pretty clearly.”At the heart of the dispute is a promise the government made 70 years ago to protect the health care of United Mine Workers. Under the 1992 Coal Act, the government agreed to cover the cost of health care for United Mine Worker retirees and their widows. But the language only covers miners who retired before the fall of 1994, and stipulates that still-profitable coal companies have to pay the health care costs for their miners who retired after that date.Murphy’s push would change that. Currently, coal companies that remain afloat and by all appearances financially healthy are paying for roughly 20,000 retirees protected under the Coal Act. His measure would move those costs ― likely in the billions of dollars ― to the taxpayers.The congressman confirmed to HuffPost that he is drafting language that would make it so Consol and other companies don’t have to pay for the health coverage of their retirees even though they remain solvent. His text is expected to be included in the omnibus spending bill to fund the government that Congress will consider after first passing a short-term resolution to keep the government open this week. Asked if it was just to help out Consol Energy, Murphy said his measure would be for “a number of coal companies” to ensure that “all of the things aren’t placed on the shoulders of existing companies.” The congressman said he’s in talks with his colleagues and a lot of people in the mining industry about the language he’s drafting.Murphy spokeswoman Carly Atchison said in an email that he supports following through on the promise the government made to the United Mine Workers in 1946. “However, he is also concerned that our active coal companies, who were burdened with legacy retiree healthcare obligations mandated by Congress, will not be able to sustain competitiveness over the long term,” Atchison wrote. “That is why he is working on language to protect all of our coal miners by addressing the retiree healthcare needs of today while avoiding [a] crisis tomorrow by placing our active coal producers at a competitive disadvantage and push more coal companies into bankruptcy.”Consol Energy did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Murphy received $32,450 in contributions from the mining industry during his 2016 re-election campaign, and has received $353,039 from the industry over the course of his career in Congress, according to Open Secrets. Consol Energy and a number of its high-ranking employees appear to have contributed more than $70,000 to Murphy’s campaigns during his time in the House.The effort launched by Murphy and coal companies in the past 24 hours didn’t sit well with the United Mine Workers of America, which has been working with Manchin and others in both chambers to get a permanent health benefits fix through Congress for years. The current language pulls from the bipartisan Miners Protection Act, authored by Manchin, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and a handful of other coal-state senators.“Some elements of the coal industry have come in at the last minute to try to steal health care and pension funding from retirees,” said Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America. “They have not gone through regular order like the Miners Protection Act has at the request of the Senate Majority Leader. Congress must decide if they want to save lives or pad bottom lines.”"

I’m not in any pain right now. I’m feeling so terrific and so glad to be above ground,” Rae told PEOPLE. “Now I have to figure out whether I want to go have treatment again to opt for life. I love life. I’ve had a wonderful one already. I have this decision to make.”This isn’t the first experience with cancer for Rae, best known for her beloved character Edna Garrett first on “Diff’rent Strokes” and then on “The Facts of Life.” She lost her mother, uncle and sister to pancreatic cancer and worried about her disposition to the disease. In 2008, 10 years after her sister died, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and spent 6 months in treatment at UCLA Medical Center.Rae has not decided whether or not to undergo treatment for her bone cancer, which was supposed to begin on Thursday.“I wanted to think about it first,” she says. “I think I’m gong to go for it. The side effects were not too bad when I did it originally. I’ve had a great life, but I have so many wonderful things happening. I’d like to chose life. I’m grateful for the life I’ve already had.”On “The Facts of Life,” Rae was one of the only adults in a cast of teenage girls, and they thanked her during an awards speech in 2011.“To be led by our most gracious, and amazing fearless leader, the amazing star of our show, Charlotte Rae, was just extraordinary and we love you Charlotte,” said co-star Nancy McKeon, who played the role of Jo, when the cast won the TV Land Pop Culture Award. “And we’re here for you, you’re amazing.”"

Trump on May 8 and Hawaii v. Trump on May 15.C-SPAN had petitioned both courts to let them broadcast.The San Francisco-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which has a long and proud tradition of cameras in the courtroom, acceded first. But the bigger surprise came Wednesday, when the 4th Circuit, which doesn’t allow cameras at all, nonetheless allowed the network to carry live audio of the proceedings from Richmond.Terry Murphy, C-SPAN’s vice president of programming, said in an interview that scoring that kind of access in a high-profile case “is great for the media and great for transparency.”“I really applaud them for really allowing the American public to hear a case that’s going to be argued before them,” he said.Typically you must be a cable subscriber to watch C-SPAN content online, but both circuits’ feeds will be “free and in the clear ... as a public service,” Howard Mortman, C-SPAN’s director of communications, said in an email. Live audio may not sound as exciting as watching judges grill lawyers, but that’s precisely what the public got in February when three judges on the 9th Circuit heard an emergency appeal over Trump’s first travel ban on refugees and people from predominantly Muslim countries. The audio was streamed on YouTube from a telephone conference.By hearing’s end, the YouTube feed had registered more than 135,000 listeners, and that’s not even counting whoever tuned in on CNN’s website, which also carried a live audio feed. Even Trump seems to have caught the CNN stream of that hearing.“I watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn’t believe,” Trump said of the oral arguments in the appeal, which he ended up losing. The judges ruled 3-0 that his first travel ban likely violated the due process rights of Muslim travelers, permanent residents and non-citizens with ties to the U.S. For Michelle Olsen, an attorney who has long advocated for appellate courts to make audio available on their websites, what the 4th Circuit did in allowing C-SPAN to be the go-to outlet for the public and other media organizations is a step in the right direction. “It’s exciting to see other circuits dipping their toes in the water,” she said.Live audio is also way more than what the American public gets with the Supreme Court, which has never allowed such a thing — despite C-SPAN and other organizations’ numerous pleas over the years to offer live audio of landmark cases.It’s rare, but the high court may release an audio recording after the fact on the same day — as it did during the first challenge to President Barack Obama’s health care law in 2012 and arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide.Nothing else since. But maybe the interest in the travel ban litigation and the initiative of lower courts may convince the Supreme Court to reconsider.“I think the next step at the Supreme Court is likely to be with audio — either same day or live streaming, at some point,” said Olsen. “I don’t see anything close to a consensus for video at the court right now.”The 4th Circuit may have subtly telegraphed to its higher-ups in Washington that it’s time to step it up. In its Wednesday order allowing C-SPAN to serve as the live-audio servicer for other media outlets, the court noted the request was made in response to “heightened public scrutiny” — the same phrase the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist used when he signed off on a C-SPAN request to allow it to broadcast oral arguments in the 2000 Bush v. Gore case.Rehnquist shot down the live-television idea, but he later agreed the audio could be released shortly after the marathon hearing concluded.(The Supreme Court does post time-delayed audio of every one of its oral arguments, usually two to four days after the hearing has already occurred. Audio for the six cases the court heard this week will be posted sometime Friday afternoon.)Some think the travel ban cases — which touch on important issues of presidential power, religious discrimination and immigration policy — rise to the same level of public interest and deserve just as much openness from the courts.“More Americans are going to learn what this case actually is,” said Gabe Roth of Fix the Court, an advocacy group that pushes for greater media and public access at the Supreme Court and lower courts. “And the more Americans understand how federal courts work — it would be great if the president did as well — the better it is for our civic health.”But a number of justices still resist the idea of even live or almost-live audio being made available. At a judges’ conference last week, Justice Samuel Alito worried that his or his colleagues’ words could easily be twisted into sound bites that would then make the evening news.“The value of oral arguments in the decision-making process would be diminished,” Alito said, according to Law360. Other justices, including the late Justice Antonin Scalia, liked to say that the bulk of the Supreme Court’s work was too dull for television. Or that broadcasting it all could lead to the “miseducation of the American people.”But those who have been in the public-access game for a long time, like C-SPAN’s Murphy, believe that the public comes first.“I have a lot of faith in the American public, that they can understand what they’re hearing,” Murphy said. “Or if not, they can find out.”"
54,LATINO VOICES,First Latino Arab-American Running For Congress Views His Heritage As An Asset,Doha Madani,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/first-latino-arab-american-running-for-congress_us_58ff7561e4b0c46f07828bce,Ammar Campa-Najjar wants you to know he's more than a pretty face.,2017-04-28,Ammar Campa-Najjar is running for California's 50th District in the San Diego area. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ff90371400002000a9bc60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ammar Campa-Najjar is hoping to draw from his American, Mexican and Palestinian heritages to unite the communities in California’s 50th Congressional District, which has voted Republican for over 30 years. The 28-year-old communications specialist behind the Washington D.C-based consulting firm ACN Strategies became the first Latino Arab-American to run for a congressional spot when he announced his candidacy on April 5. He wasn’t sure about running but was encouraged by members of the community who he met as a field director for the 2012 Obama campaign. “I know it’s a tough sell,’ Campa-Najjar told HuffPost, in reference to having someone of his background win an election.Campa-Najjar grew up in San Diego with a Mexican mother and a Palestinian father and says it took years for him to reconcile his Latino and Arab identities. Now the congressional candidate hopes to use that personal experience to try to find common ground within the current divisive political climate. Campa-Najjar is willing to work with anyone, even Trump, in order to push through policies that he feels will benefit all Americans. That includes expanding job programs like ApprenticeshipUSA.“There’s braindead politics on both sides,” Campa-Najjar said. “There are certain situations, that for the sake of the American people, we need to put our differences aside and work together.”But there are issues that Campa-Najjar says he won’t compromise on, including Trump’s travel ban. Having grown up in a post-9/11 world, he feels we can’t undermine our liberty for the sake of security.Trump’s newest executive order might be legal in its language, he adds, but it is the spirit behind it that has lost Trump the trust of the Muslim community.“We were persecuted [after 9/11],” Campa-Najjar said. “I cannot imagine what would happen if that were allowed to happen under this administration.” Campa-Najjar’s family left San Diego for Gaza when he was 9 years old, only to leave a few years later when the second war between Palestinians and Israel broke out. The war went on from 2000 to 2005, killing more than 4,000 Palestinians and Israelis. “Why were me and my family left to live?” he said, in reference to the years he spent living in the war zone.His mother moved him and his brother out of Gaza and back to the U.S. just months before the September 11 attacks happened in New York City, and he recalls struggling to find his place in the world as a young Latino Arab-American. Campa-Najjar was often told he was “too American” to be Palestinian and, in the heavily-Hispanic San Diego area, he sometimes simply didn’t feel Latino enough. “As a Hispanic and an Arab, God gave me these really different experiences for a reason,” Campa-Najjar said.The reason, as he sees it, could be to bring people across political and cultural divides and figure out what issues and common interests exist. Campa-Najjar explained that families across the country, regardless of race, are struggling to find viable careers and pay for healthcare. Half of the U.S. is living paycheck-to-paycheck, only one health scare or emergency expense away from losing everything. And that fear is often channeled into anger, Campa-Najjar says, rather than becoming engaged in finding solutions. “You can find purpose in your pain,” he said. “That’s the alchemy of America, I think.” Since announcing his congressional bid, Campa-Najjar has also garnered internet attention over his looks. Headlines on websites like Buzzfeed and Mitú have focused on his appearance, but he says he’d rather have people focus on the issues.“I want people to think about my ideas,” Campa-Najjar said. “[My community is] so hopeful. I can’t let them down by making this a silly thing.”But not everyone is so comfortable with him. Campa-Najjar says he was once speaking to a Trump supporter in his district who said he didn’t want Campa-Najjar to bring in “Sharia law” to the area. Racial tensions have spiked since the beginning of the 2016 election. The Southern Poverty Law Center recorded 1094 hate incidents in the month after the election and anti-Islam hate crimes were up 64 percent in 2015. This year, immigrant communities have also had to deal with increased immigration raids and public harassment. “There is a way to pave a path to a unified future,” Campa-Najjar told HuffPost. “As Americans, we’re all fully contributing to our economy and way of life.” Financial security is the common thread Campa-Najjar focuses on to bring these very different communities together. He feels a rural family that loses their world when a manufacturing plant closes down isn’t that different from the immigrant family struggling to make a life in a new country. Campa-Najjar knows bringing attention to one community versus another can bring tension, but he’s learned from his experience in Gaza that it’s important for both sides to find sympathy.“I’ve seen people who are so similar find their differences and destroy each other over it,” he said. And the congressional candidate is hoping for a different reality in his district. “I’d rather lose exploring every opportunity to unite than win exploiting every opportunity to divide,” he added. "
55,POLITICS,Senate Intelligence Committee Divided On Whether It Has Enough Staff To Pull Off Russia Investigation,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-intelligence-russia-probe-more-staff_us_590283b4e4b0bb2d086c620a,Democrats want more than 9 staffers; Republicans say it's fine the way it is.,2017-04-28,Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Ranking Member Mark Warner (D-Va.),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5902849a1c00003a00e8225d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats and Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee are divided on whether the panel is devoting enough resources to its investigation on Russian election interference and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.Until this week, the committee’s investigation operated with just seven staffers who had access to classified intelligence community documents. As a result, though the investigation launched three months ago the committee has just now completed its first round of reviewing those documents. Members from both parties say the committee members are working well together, albeit at a slower pace than Democrats would like. But a simmering disagreement over the number and type of staffers needed to execute the probe could upend the fragile bipartisan cooperation. Democrats, including ranking member Mark Warner (D-Va.), have pushed for the committee to bring on additional staffers. They are particularly interested in hiring someone with a background in legal prosecutions, a Senate aide told HuffPost. The committee has no prosecutorial role ― but Democrats say that a prosecutor would bring a unique perspective to a probe that centers around the bizarre interactions between several members of President Donald Trump’s campaign team and Russian government officials.Two members on the panel confirmed ongoing discussions about hiring a prosecutor. “We’re not a prosecuting committee, we’re a fact-finding [committee] ― but people who have that mindset can think a little differently and see things a little differently,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) told HuffPost.Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said the committee is currently making good progress but that he would like to see a prosecutor added to the team at some point. “It’s a question of timing,” King. “We’ve established the resources that we need to do that.”But committee chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who has final say over hiring decisions, appeared to rule out bringing a prosecutor on board. If the committee discovers illegal activity, it would make a referral to the FBI or Justice Department, he told reporters Thursday. “It would never be the function of the committee to have any prosecutors,” Burr said. He added that he is open to hiring more investigators if the need arises ― but for now, he said, the committee has “a sufficient amount of bodies” to do its job.The committee filled two empty National Security Agency monitor positions this week, bringing to nine the total number of staffers cleared to review classified documents related to the Russia investigation. The Democrats’ pick, April Doss, is the former general counsel for intelligence law at the NSA and is scheduled to start next week. The Republicans declined to name their new hire, who also started this week. With a two-year budget of $1.2 million and such a small staff, the resources devoted to the Senate intelligence committee’s Russia investigation pale in comparison to those of other high-profile probes. The House Select Committee on Benghazi, for example, had 46 staffers and spent as much as $3.6 million a year.The two new hires were encouraging to Democrats, but they want to see more. “The reality is that we will need to bring on additional staff,” said the Senate aide, who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive investigation. “We’re starting to make some progress, but there’s no reason not to make this our central priority,” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told HuffPost. “We don’t have every skill set that we might need for this sort of investigation.”“Where we were before, we weren’t cranking through the material and potential witnesses that were necessary to get somewhere on this in a timely way,” Heinrich continued. According to Burr, the committee has reviewed thousands of pages of intelligence and has completed about 20 interviews at a rate of two to three interviews per week. Those interviews have been mostly limited to individuals who worked on the intelligence community’s assessment that Moscow interfered with the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping Trump win. They have not yet interviewed the Trump campaign officials suspected of unusual communication with Russian government officials, like former advisers Michael Flynn or Carter Page. Asked how Republicans react in private when Democrats push for an expanded staff, the Senate aide said their response has been mixed. “They have at various times been receptive to the idea when pushed, but I do think when approached you will find them saying, ‘We’re fine, this is all on track.’”The aide’s prediction was correct. “They’re doing an excellent job,” Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) said. “I’m very satisfied with how things are progressing.” The Idaho Republican dismissed calls for more resources as typical bureaucratic inefficiency. “Any time you have a government agency or a government enterprise, they always want more staff ― we’re doing just fine.”"

That starts with eliminating backdoor tax increases on working families and setting budget policy that generates revenue without harmful cuts.”Hall will caucus with Democrats, who have a majority in the state House.The Working Families Party considers his win a major step forward in its efforts to become a major political force. Hall is only the third state legislator to get elected on the Working Families Party ticket alone.Connecticut state Sen. Ed Gomes won as a Working Families Party candidate in a February 2015 special election after losing the Democratic nomination at a state convention. New York state assemblywoman Diana Richardson also won as a WFP candidate in a May 2015 special election.Unlike the Green Party or other independent left-leaning parties, the WFP frequently functions as a progressive faction of the Democratic Party in the handful of states where it has a large presence. Progressive Democratic candidates that elicit the WFP’s endorsement are often listed on their election slate.It is easier for the WFP to get candidates elected in races against Democrats in special elections where the two major parties’ influence often matters less.It can sometimes serve as a way for them to pack the Democratic Party with more progressive figures. Both Gomes and Richardson were subsequently re-elected as Democrats. In Connecticut’s 7th, Hall campaigned against a proposal by Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) to shift a portion of teacher pension contributions to local municipalities. The plan would cost Hartford alone $17 million, according to the Hartford Courant ― a sum that Hall said the city’s school system could not afford.Joe Dinkin, national communications director of the Working Families Party, said the election of President Donald Trump likely played a role in Hall’s election given the enthusiasm it has awakened in the party’s progressive base.“Right now voters are more hungry than ever for somebody with an aggressive approach to dealing with their problems and not somebody served up by the local establishment,” Dinkin said.Hall’s election is “huge,” said Gary Rose, chair of the department of government at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut.The Working Families Party win reflects a combination of progressive frustration with Malloy’s turn toward more fiscally conservative policies and the revival of the Democratic Party’s left wing nationally in the wake of the contentious primary between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), according to Rose. Malloy is seeking $1.6 billion in concessions from the state’s public-sector labor unions to patch a two-year budget deficit.“The Democratic Party in Connecticut has been a machine for many, many years but right now it is a party that is suffering from an identity issue in terms of what its values are and what it represents,” he concluded. “It’s perhaps something that is on the horizon here in Connecticut.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

57,ENTERTAINMENT,Ja Rule On Fyre Festival: 'NOT MY FAULT',Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ja-rule-fyre-festival_us_59038b44e4b02655f83d3840,"He also clarified that it was ""NOT A SCAM.""",2017-04-28,From left to right: A sandwich handed out at the Fyre Festival; hip-hop legend Ja Rule.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59038ffb1400001f00a9c788.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For years, people have asked one question: Where is Ja? Finally, we know the answer: On Twitter and pointing his finger.Following reports that his luxury music festival ― named the Fyre Festival and located on a “remote and private” island in the Bahamas ― had essentially descended into “Lord of the Flies”-like chaos, the hip-hop star released a statement over Twitter on Friday afternoon that somehow simultaneously took blame and assigned it elsewhere.“We are working right now on getting everyone of the island SAFE that is my immediate concern...,” he wrote. “I will make a statement soon I’m heartbroken at this moment my partners and I wanted this to be an amazing event it was NOT A SCAM as everyone is reporting I don’t know how everything went so left but I’m working to make it right by making sure everyone is refunded... I truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT... but I’m taking responsibility I’m deeply sorry to everyone who was inconvenienced by this...”Festival organizers advertised the festival as a sort of luxury getaway on an island once belonging to former drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. They enlisted models like Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski to help promote the event. Bands like Major Lazer and Migos were scheduled to perform. And most important, tickets reportedly ran anywhere from $5,000 to $250,000. The reality did not quite fit the promotional images. Feral dogs were seen on the premises. At least some of the housing provided appeared to be “disaster relief tents,” many of which were not put together. The meals were things like slices of cheese on cold bread. Blink 182 backed out because the band was “not confident that we would have what we need to give you the quality of performance we always give you fans.” “So Fyre Fest is a complete disaster. Mass chaos. No organization. No one knows where to go. There are no villas, just a disaster tent city,” one attendee wrote on Twitter. We could explain more, but the situation is still kind of chaotic, so why don’t you just look at these photos instead?By the way, a statement on the Fyre Festival webpage now reads:Fyre Festival set out to provide a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience on the Islands of the Exumas."

But if the disease is Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME",2017-04-28,"<p>The exact prevalence and incidence of ME is unknown, but one estimate places the prevalence at approximately 1 million affected individuals in the US general population. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59033d312600001f7ac483b1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When you are sick, very sick, you wait for medicine to work its magic. But if the disease is Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), you have to wait for the medicine to be invented.The bad news is that so little funding is going into solving the ME problem, commonly known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, that those sick today may be sick for the rest of their lives. They are living a life that is a nearly intolerable to themselves and a massive burden to their loved ones, spouses, parents and caregivers.What is known is that ME is a disease of the immune system. It is vicious and debilitating, leaving the patient confined to a marginal life, a parallel and unequal existence.Most infections are of healthy people who are struck down often, but not always, after exercise. The first symptoms can be flu-like: The sufferers feel a few days in bed will do the trick. But having ME is a life sentence. There also have been group infections, known as “clusters,” where hundreds have been stricken.If you have ME, the least exertion can force you to spend days in bed, exhausted, hurting in myriad ways from headaches to what one woman described as “feeling like your bones are exploding.”In severe cases, the patient cannot tolerate light or sound. A young man, newly married, and felled unaccountably, had to live in a closet for an extended period before he could handle light and sound. Symptoms vary but most of the time a victim feels, as one told me, “like you are a car that has run out of gas and your tank cannot be filled up again.” A teenager told me that if she is to go out with friends, she has to weigh that against days of bed rest, in a complete state of collapse.The National Institutes of Health (NIH) ― the principal researcher into ME and dozens of other perplexing diseases ― has historically given ME a pittance. In the last three years funding has been held to $5 million a year, although the Obama administration had promised more. To put this in perspective, the trade association of the pharmaceutical industry calculates that it costs $1.2 billion dollars to bring a new drug to market. Sadly that industry has not shown interest in ME, so the research is mostly funded by NIH and private groups and individuals.The news that the Trump administration is thinking of cutting the total NIH budget by $5 billion has ​caused a palpable anxiety to grip the ME community. The disease is cruel enough, does it need to be compounded by the government?That is why those who could manage it and members of their families were enthusiastic supporters of the March for Science. They were out there with a sense of being at the barricades as the barbarians massed on the other side.The United States has led the world for years in scientific discovery and implementation. It is deeply disturbing to think that the country would draw back from it. But the administration’s ambivalence is clear. The Department of Energy with 17 national laboratories, every one the envy of the world, is headed by Rick Perry​.W​hen he ran for president, ​he ​did so on a plank that included closing ​the department.​ The Environmental Protection Agency, with a history of struggling to get the regulatory science right, is headed by Scott Pruitt​. As​ attorney general of Oklahoma, ​he ​sought to hobble the agency with lawsuits.So across science, from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the research service of the Department of Agriculture, there is fear among scientists; fear for their jobs, fear for science and fear for America.In the sick rooms of the 1 million or so ME sufferers, despondency has reached new depths. You will not be cured if no one cares enough to look for a cure. Can you double down on despair?"

U.S.</em>, suing the federal government over climate change</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590339f32600001500c483ab.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak alongside several U.S. senators, lawyers, activists and the youth plaintiffs in Juliana v. U.S. who are suing the federal government over climate change. Below are my remarks from the rally, which took place at the steps of the Supreme Court before supporters and the media.I am a human rights lawyer, and my organization EarthRights International has worked for over 20 years to hold corporations—such as fossil fuel giants like Chevron, Shell, and ExxonMobil—legally accountable for human rights abuses.Human rights abuses such as rape, slavery, torture, and crimes against humanity. As such, over the course of my career, I have had a lot of experience with injustice.I am honored and proud to be standing here with these brave young people, their bold lawyers, and elected representatives who are standing up to the injustice of climate change.To borrow Judge Aiken’s words . . . “this is not an ordinary case.” I, too, am familiar with cases that are not “ordinary.”My colleagues and I at EarthRights International have represented some of the most marginalized communities across the planet against some of its most powerful corporations, and won!So let me say one thing to everyone involved in this lawsuit—and maybe especially to those who they are suing: The American system of justice is blind to the power of money, and sometimes—just sometimes—the good guys win!While this case may not be “ordinary,” it is absolutely necessary.Nobel Laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu has called climate change the human rights challenge of our time, and he’s right.And our time is running out.We have our work cut out for us. Present company aside, our government is doing worse than nothing.Our government has been hijacked by corporations, hijacked by fossil fuel companies and hijacked by big oil like Exxon and Chevron.They are pushing us backward, greenlighting pipelines and rolling back environmental regulations.But let us not make the mistake of thinking that this pattern began with Trump (though he may have perfected it). The truth is, our government has been under the influence of big oil for as long as I can remember!API, the American Petroleum Industry, has “intervened” in this lawsuit and they and their members have been “intervening” in our democracy for years.For decades, oil, gas and coal industries have paid hundreds of millions of dollars to “intervene” in our rights and our futures, and that needs to stop right now.That’s why these young people had to bring this historic case.All that they are asking is that our government do its job to protect their rights and their futures, and as Judge Aiken stated, to protect their “constitutional right to life and liberty.”Is that so much to ask?These most fundamental of rights are threatened by our government’s failure to protect our public trust—including a stable climate.The government has failed these kids.Instead, they’ve protected the rights of the polluting fossil fuel companies who have a stranglehold on Washington.We need a separation of oil and state. But until that day comes, I believe that our courts—state courts, federal courts, and yes, this Supreme Court—are our last great hope for protecting our precious American democracy from an all-out corporate takeover.I stand here on the steps of the Supreme Court as a parent who wants my representatives to care about my kids, my neighbors, and me.I stand here as a lawyer, who respects facts—real facts, not alternative facts, and science—real science.And I stand here today as an American who believes in the rule of law and the independence of the courts as the key to saving our democracy from corporate control.Like I said, corporations have hijacked our democracy, and these kids are standing up to take it back. They are standing not only for themselves but for the rights of all the world’s children who are threatened and who are already facing the injustice of climate change.These kids are raising their voices and saying “ENOUGH.”They are demanding that our government provide a science-based solution to climate change, and that our courts protect their human rights over corporate rights. They are what we, at my organization, call Earth Rights Defenders and we thank them.EarthRights International has litigated against corporations on behalf of Earth Rights Defenders who have been raped, tortured and killed, while corporations like Chevron, Shell and Exxon made billions. So it comes as no surprise to me that those who would abuse human rights in pursuit of their dirty business would not think twice about trashing the planet.But every one of us should be shocked when our government fails to regulate these companies and protect our public trust. We should be outraged that these kids have to go to court, to get the government to simply do its job.This case has been called the trial of the century and it is—any lawsuit that aims to vindicate the rights of our children, safeguard our constitution and planet can be nothing less.It is the first climate lawsuit in the U.S. to make it this far, but let me say loud and clear, it won’t be the last.As a lawyer from an organization that has no problem challenging the biggest, most abusive, most polluting companies in the world, I say one thing: there will be more trials of the century.We know who caused this problem.We know who covered it up.We know who procured bogus science to obscure the truth about their dirty industry, and we know who made billions doing it.Make no mistake: The lies, the cover ups, the fake science, and the lobbying does not make you above the law. Justice is blind and I still believe that our courts are the last great hope to protect the rights of living breathing human beings—like all of you–and all of us. Thank you."

And following a brewery team “bisque off,” they decided to take the plunge and transform the idea of the highly seasoned soup into a beer.They dropped the lobsters and other ingredients into the boil for 12 minutes, before removing the crustaceans and stripping them of their meat. Staff enjoyed a team lunch of lobster rolls as the shells were grilled to intensify their flavor and then put back in at the end of the boil. They then extracted all the food debris, added saison yeast and left it to ferment for one week and to undergo a period of maturation for two weeks.Only 120 Of The Sea kegs and 8,000 bottles, costing around $4.40, were put on sale, making it a limited edition.Lobster-infused beer is not new, with breweries in Maine and Delaware among those already putting their own spin on the drink.But Of The Sea isn’t the only offbeat beer that The Wild Beer Co, which will exhibit at the Bristol Craft Beer Festival in September, is producing.Of the 100 different drinks the company has sold over the past four-and-a-half years, it’s also used sake, coffee, chocolate, toffee apples and even mushrooms as sources of inspiration.Not all beers have hit the mark, though. Cooper described their 3.9 percent Deckchair brew as “meh.” “There were tonnes of elderflowers around us so we got them with local strawberries and it just didn’t quite work for us,” he said. “It’s one of the only beers we’ve ever gone, ‘it’s disappointing.’”The brewery’s enthusiasm to experiment with unusual or foraged ingredients appears to be succeeding, as it recently crowdfunded around $2.3 million to build a new brewery complete with a visitor center. It also operates two bars in nearby Bristol and Cheltenham and exports to 22 countries, including the U.S.Cooper hopes a willingness to try out different ideas will stand the brewery in good stead for the future, as he predicted the craft beer industry in the United Kingdom in particular was due “a bit of a rollup at some point.”“I think it’s inevitable as it’s going up at such a rate,” he said. “There’s going to be some more buyouts, some people go under, as I don’t think the U.K. beer consumer can support the number of breweries that are opening.”While he admitted there were no plans to copy San Diego’s Stone Brewing in making beer with treated sewage water, Cooper said his team would continue to innovate and surprise with upcoming beverages. “Yeah, this is different, but it’s fun,” he said of his company’s eclectic range of drinks. “But we make beer for a living. If you can’t have fun doing that, what can you do to enjoy yourself?”"

But today, the 17-year-old activist finds himself at the center of a much larger fight: climate change. Zephier, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, is among 21 children and young adults from around the country involved in a landmark lawsuit that accuses the federal government of violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property by promoting fossil fuel production and by failing to take action to combat climate change.On Thursday, Zephier and roughly a dozen other plaintiffs, joined by their attorneys and several Democratic senators, brought their call for a healthy environment to the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, which could ultimately hear their case. “It’s time to stop talking about the problem” and figure out a way to stop it, Zephier told HuffPost. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2015 against the Obama administration, now targets President Donald Trump and his team, who have acted quickly to derail U.S. actions to combat climate change and to roll back numerous environmental protections. Kelsey Juliana, a 21-year-old activist from Oregon and the lead plaintiff in the case, told roughly 100 people gathered in front of the Supreme Court that the lawsuit is not about money, but rather about forcing the government to implement a science-based climate recovery plan.“We are suing because none of us and none of you have time to wait,” she said. Plaintiff Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, a 16-year-old climate activist from Colorado, said it’s easy for young people to feel alone, given the weight of the climate crisis and the Trump administration’s environmental policies. But the lawsuit has brought together a community of young people who will not stand idly by, he said.“We stand united. We stand at a time when the world critically needs a voice that is championing for the voice of the unheard, the marginalized, people across the nation that are facing the impacts of climate change immediately,” Martinez said. “We are that voice, as a younger generation that is standing in our streets and now in our courts to demand justice for our generation and every generation to follow.”The plaintiffs, who now range in age from 9 to 21, had an important victory in November when U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken of Oregon rejected the government’s request for the case to be dismissed.“Exercising my ‘reasoned judgment,’ I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society,” Aiken wrote in her decision. “Just as marriage is the ‘foundation of the family,’ a stable climate system is quite literally the foundation of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.”The Trump administration has since filed an appeal of Aiken’s ruling, as The Washington Post reported.Joining the young plaintiffs in front of the Supreme Court were Julia Olson, lead counsel and executive director of Our Children’s Trust , an Oregon-based advocacy group leading the lawsuit; Philip Gregory, counsel for the plaintiffs; and Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D- R.I.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.). Whitehouse said the fossil fuel industry has constructed “a barricade of lies and dark money” in Congress.“That’s why this lawsuit is so important; because when you get to court, facts matter,” Whitehouse said. “When you get to court, witnesses must tell the truth or they can be punished. When you get to the court, lawyers even have to tell the truth, at least to the court. When you get to court, spin and industry nonsense can be cross-examined.”The courts, he added, “will surface the truth from the swamp of lies and calculated misinformation in which the fossil fuel industry traffics.” Gregory said he’s never been so proud to represent a group of clients, whom he called “unlikely heroes.” “This is not about us; this is about our country,” Gregory said. “This is about the science and the epic battle between youth versus government. This will be the trial of the century.

Asa Hutchinson (R), EU Ambassador to the United States David O’Sullivan wrote that the union “wishes to make an urgent humanitarian appeal” on Williams’ behalf.In 1999, Williams, who was already serving a life sentence for kidnapping and murder, escaped from prison and killed a 57-year-old farmer, Cecil Boren, according to USA Today. He then fled to Missouri, where he killed another person in a traffic accident. Williams was sentenced to death in August 2000. “It is my understanding that evidence was introduced at trial to show that Mr. Williams was intellectually disabled,” O’Sullivan wrote. “While at the time there was no categorical exclusion for the execution of the intellectually disabled, this is now the case. I also understand that three doctors have submitted reports to the courts this week finding that Mr. Williams meets the definition of intellectual disability. I believe this evidence should be heard and that Mr. Williams should not be executed.” Williams is one of eight inmates that Arkansas planned to execute this month before its supply of a lethal injection drug expired. Last week the state executed Ledell Lee. On Monday, it carried out a double execution — the nation’s first since 2000, putting to death Jack Jones and Marcel Williams. Four inmates have been granted a stay of execution. In his letter, O’Sullivan said the state’s string of executions had “regrettably put an end to the de facto moratorium” on capital punishment in Arkansas since it executed a man in 2005. And he called the pace with which Arkansas is carrying out these executions “unprecedented.”“The European Union is opposed to the use of capital punishment under all circumstances and accordingly aims at its universal abolition, seeking a global moratorium on the death penalty as a first step,” O’Sullivan wrote. “We believe that the elimination of the death penalty is fundamental to the protection of human dignity, and to the progressive development of human rights on a global scale.” He added that while the EU recognizes the “serious nature” of Kenneth Williams’ crimes and offers its “sincere sympathies” to the victims’ families and friends, it “does not believe that their loss will be mitigated by the death of Mr. Williams.”In an essay published earlier this month by The Marshall Project, Williams addressed his looming death. “God has transformed me, and even the worst of us can be reformed and renewed. Revealing these truths meant more to me then being granted clemency. I’m still going to eventually die someday, but to stand up for God in front of man, that’s my victory. To the families of my victims, to whom I have brought pain, great loss, and suffering, as shallow as ‘I am sorry for robbing you of your loved one’ can sound, I would rather say it, and mean it, than not say it at all.”The state of Arkansas is facing two federal lawsuits over this month’s parade of executions. On Wednesday, the Arkansas Supreme Court denied all requests for stays of execution for Williams, KARK 4 News in Little Rock reported. He is scheduled to be put to death at 7 p.m. CDT Thursday.Here’s the letter from Ambassador O’Sullivan:"

Quick reminder: Dr. Luke and his company, which he founded with Sony, owe the pop star most of its success.Billboard produced a history of Kemosabe’s history on its top chart, the Hot 100, on Wednesday, reporting that 22 songs by Kemosabe artists have made the list. Of those, 13 came from Kesha. The company also holds two No. 1 hits: 2010’s “TiK ToK” and “We Are Who We R,” both by Kesha. Seven of the eight Kemosabe songs that have reached the list’s top 10 range belong to Kesha, too.Kemosabe isn’t a big label, and Kesha is its most famous artist. Yet despite the fact that its biggest star claimed she was being abused by her producer, it took two and a half years before Sony nudged Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, out of the picture. According to The Guardian, his role as CEO terminated on March 31. That sluggish decision reportedly came down to simple bad PR. A source told The Wrap that Gottwald’s legal entanglements, which date back to 2014, had turned into “a public relations headache” for Sony. Both sides have waged a war in the media, most recently as the singer released damning emails from Gottwald, prompting him to respond in turn.Kesha now has not released an album since 2012’s “Warrior,” although a judge has ruled she is free to work with another producer under the Sony umbrella, and she released a song with Zedd one year ago.The Hot 100 is waiting for her return.Need help?

67,MEDIA,Let's Reconsider That Rachel Maddow Segment On Trump's Taxes That Everyone Hated,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rachel-maddow-trump-taxes_us_59023a9ce4b0026db1df9157,"Now that we have Trump's tax plan, it's worth a second look.",2017-04-27,Her segment on Trump's taxes was ridiculed in the media but it actually contained some revealing information.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59023af62600003596c48169.jpeg?cache=LycHxuanrx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On March 14 MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow took to the airwaves and presented an hour-long segment on two pages of President Donald Trump’s 2005 tax returns. Those documents, obtained by journalist David Cay Johnston, revealed that Trump made $150 million in personal income that year, on which he paid $38 million in taxes.It was one of the most hyped segments to air on cable news this year, with Maddow tweeting ahead of time, “BREAKING: We’ve got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. (Seriously).” It was also widely felt to be one of the most disappointing cable news segments of the year. The National Review’s Jim Geraghty opined that it was a “waste [of] everyone’s time.” Slate’s Willa Paskin called it “a cynical, self-defeating spectacle.” The Observer’s Ashe Schow summed it up as an “epic fail.”While most of the criticism centered on the lengthy way Maddow constructed the segment, perhaps unaware that such long wind-ups are her stock in trade, her critics had a point. It was weird, knowing that she’d only obtained two pages of documentation to bill the matter on Twitter the way she did ― only afterwards could you see that the phrase “we’ve got Trump tax returns” allowed her the linguistic wiggle-room necessary to claim to have billed the show properly. Moreover, the tax returns on hand were more than a decade old, and weren’t sufficient to get into the meat of Trump’s tax return mysteries ― like the extent to which he is leveraged by debtors, or the breadth of his international business entanglements. But while Maddow may have not delivered on the day, the segment nevertheless planted a seed of inquiry. And now that we have the broad contours of Trump’s tax cut proposals, there’s new light to be shone on what the MSNBC host did back in March.One of the few things that viewers were able to ascertain during Maddow’s segment was the amount of money Trump paid through the alternate minimum tax (AMT). In fact, that’s the vehicle through which Trump paid the bulk of that $38 million. In terms of regular federal income tax, Trump and his wife paid $5.3 million, which would peg his tax rate at less than four percent. However, the AMT collected $31 million in tax revenue.Trump has long wanted to eliminate the AMT, and guess what? His tax proposal would do just that.Trump is not the only person who’s called for the repeal of the AMT. While the AMT primarily hits high income earners, it’s not aimed at the mega-rich. As the Tax Policy Center summarizes, “The individual alternative minimum tax (AMT) primarily affects well-off households, but not those with the very highest incomes. It is also more likely to hit taxpayers with large families, those who are married, and those who live in high-tax states.” Those who want to eliminate the AMT can do so knowing that this isn’t a tax break that lets plutocrats off the hook ― it can be framed as a benefit for upper-middle class strivers and entrepreneurs.And liberals, like Bernie Sanders, have called for the AMT’s elimination as well ― though there are important distinctions to note. But as Business Insider’s Frank Chapparo reported back in March, Sanders also “called for a number of ‘provisions aimed at high-income households’ that would essentially do what the AMT was intended to do: make sure the extremely wealthy pay their fair share.” His aim: to secure the necessary proceeds to expand the safety net on more vulnerable Americans. Trump’s tax plan doesn’t make any attempt at doing this ― it’s just a straight up giveaway to the wealthy.Knowing that 81.5 percent of the taxes he paid in 2005 were facilitated through the existence of a tax he wants to eliminate puts Trump’s own interests under the spotlight. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, eliminating the AMT is one of the mechanisms in his tax plan that would pay off big for Trump down the line. Thanks to Maddow, we have a feel for how much he’ll save. (A lot!)But the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) estimates that another potential windfall awaits Trump through another part of his tax plan: his proposal to drop the tax rate on mechanisms called “S-corporations” down to 15 percent. S-corporations can be considered a federal government subsidy for the wealthy because they permit an entity to claim limited liability benefits while also allowing them to pay the corporate income tax rate.As the CEPR notes, Trump’s proposal would mean that “while the top marginal tax rate will ostensibly be 33 percent on the rich, those who are not too dumb to breathe will get their money through S-Corporations and pay just 15 percent.” This, they conclude, would “lead to tremendous job growth in the tax shelter industry, as hundreds of thousands of rich people rush to hire lawyers and accountants so that they can get all their income through pass-through corporations.”And Trump would benefit as well. Per the CEPR:While he has refused to release his tax returns he claims he has assets of $10 billion. Let’s say that he gets a 5 percent annual return, or $500 million a year, as income. This is certainly a very modest assumption for a person with Donald Trump’s business acumen.Of course, the CEPR can only guess at how much Trump stands to benefit because he has not released his tax returns. That we have only two pages of his personal tax returns from 2005 is not enough to evaluate how much skin Trump has in the game he’s asking the entire country to play.Given the fact that the man is indistinguishable from his business interests, perhaps we need to shut down Trump’s tax proposal until we know what’s going on. But what little we know, we know because of what Maddow and Johnston told us. And if that Maddow segment left audiences wanting more, well...maybe that was the point.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

68,POLITICS,Jerry Brown Explains How Trump Could Actually Be Good For Climate Progress,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerry-brown-trump-climate-change_us_59026ba4e4b02655f83b3b24,He said the president's scorn is galvanizing people to fight global warming.,2017-04-27,"President Donald Trump has given climate change denial ""a bad name,"" said Gov. Jerry Brown.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59026be1260000bd9ac48265.jpeg?cache=73CLZ58bol&ops=crop_13_161_2987_1806%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO ― California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) made the case Thursday that President Donald Trump’s anti-environment rhetoric could actually be a blessing for climate advocacy.The president’s indifference to the existence of man-made global warming may inspire other people to step up and support sustainable actions, Brown said. “Actually, Trump is one of the most positive things that has happened in the climate movement,” the governor declared at the Ceres Conference, where business leaders and investors had gathered in downtown San Francisco to discuss sustainability and climate issues. “He’s given climate denial really a bad name.” Brown said the “obvious absurdity of what is now being proposed in Washington” is so apparent that “thoughtful, ordinary people are going to react, and react in positive ways and a series of steps that will really get on the sustainable path.” Trump’s anti-climate actions have included appointing climate science denier Scott Pruitt to run the Environmental Protection Agency and rolling back some of President Barack Obama’s policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. But Brown said Trump is just one of many challenges facing environmental advocates. “Trump is only one of our problems, and he’s not the biggest problem,” Brown said. “That’s not to say he’s not a big problem. ... The biggest problem is waking up to the truth of our situation and responding in a thoughtful and wise way.” Mindless optimism, Brown argued, isn’t acceptable at this point. “It’s not fine,” he said. “It’s not getting fine.” He urged the business community to act on its own, citing developments like zero-emission cars. He also called on the audience to press lawmakers to find the “political will” to address climate change, noting that Republicans need to be on board to achieve real national progress.“Know that there’s time, but that time is running out, so it’s absolutely imperative that you do everything you can,” he said. Brown is one of the nation’s most prominent climate advocates. He represented the United States during the Paris climate talks in 2015 and has pushed through sweeping reforms in California to reduce emissions.He is also a fierce critic of the president and has vowed to fight Trump on climate policy. In March, he called Trump’s executive order upending Obama-era climate policies a “colossal mistake.” In his January state of the state address, he warned of the dangers of giving in to climate denial.“We’ve got the scientists, we’ve got the lawyers, and we’re ready to fight. We’re ready to defend,” Brown said in December. “If Trump turns off the satellites, California will launch its own damn satellite.”Brown’s remarks came two days ahead of the People’s Climate March planned in Washington and other cities around the country. Thousands are expected to attend the rallies in opposition to Trump’s climate policies. "

Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), right, is on the side of congressional colleagues who have spoken out and said the party should not have a litmus test on the issue.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ff6b8f2600003596c479ad.jpeg?cache=yqc9QZWD3I&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) is siding with prominent members of Congress instead of the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee in the party’s debate over the politics of reproductive freedom.DNC Chairman Tom Perez announced last week that no Democrat who broke with the party on abortion rights would get any support from the national party, reversing his previous decision on the matter.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with Democrats, have argued instead that there should be no litmus test and that the party should be open to supporting some Democrats who break with the party platform on the issue. Warren, in an interview with HuffPost as part of her book tour, began by re-affirming her own strong support for reproductive freedom. “Let me start with this part, because these are deep-down issues. I am strongly pro-choice. I am strongly pro-choice, and I will fight,” she said. But that’s not how everyone in the party feels, she said, and she respects that. “I recognize that not all of my colleagues agree with me. I’ll do everything I can to persuade them, but they are my colleagues, and that’s just how it is with the Democrats,” she said. “But I got to say, it does not dampen my energy in this fight.” The debate was not one that Democrats were necessarily looking to have, but it jumped out of Omaha, Nebraska, as the DNC and Sanders were headed to town to campaign on behalf of a Democratic candidate for mayor, Heath Mello, who was running against a rock-ribbed anti-abortion politician, the incumbent mayor. Mello, it turned out, had a long anti-choice record as a state legislator, and NARAL pounced, denouncing Democrats for again selling out women, who have been the driving force of the resistance movement. Perez and Sanders responded by saying the party ought to be a big tent; after a browbeating, Perez reversed himself and zipped the tent shut, but Sanders held firm. He was then followed by Pelosi and Schumer, who insisted that the party needs to support anti-abortion candidates in some circumstances.Take a survey: should Democrats support candidates who do not support support reproductive freedom?In at least one way, the debate over Mello is in the past, since he has declared that he will govern as mayor as if he were pro-choice, despite his personal views. But it has extra salience given the specific role Nebraska ― and Mello ― played in the abortion wars over the past decade.  In May 2009, George Tiller, a doctor who performed late-term abortions, was assassinated in the foyer of his Kansas church while handing out bulletins. He had been the subject of dozens of attacks by then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly and had become a central figure of scorn within the anti-abortion movement. In his first comments after the murder, O’Reilly declared that there would be “no back pedaling.”“Every single thing we said about Tiller was true, and my analysis was based on those facts,” O’Reilly declared. “Now, it’s clear that the far left is exploiting ― exploiting ― the death of the doctor. Those vicious individuals want to stifle any criticism of people like Tiller. That ― and hating Fox News ― is the real agenda here. Finally, if these people are soooo compassionate ― so very compassionate, so concerned for the rights and welfare of others ― maybe they might have written something, one thing, about the 60,000 fetuses that will never become American citizens. Or am I wrong?”Dr. LeRoy Carhart, who occasionally had worked with Tiller, said publicly that he would continue performing such procedures at his clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska. The Nebraska Legislature responded by banning abortions after 20 weeks. “I didn’t find this bill, it found Nebraska,” Mike Flood, the Nebraska legislature’s speaker said, referring to Carhart. In reality, such procedures are extraordinarily rare and typically the result of something catastrophic gone wrong with the pregnancy. The Nebraska law, however, said that they could only be performed if the mother were on the brink of death. The law, passed with Mello’s help, was flatly unconstitutional, a violation of Roe v. Wade, but abortion rights groups elected not to challenge it, worried the Supreme Court might use it as an opportunity to chip away at the law or overturn it altogether.Mello’s vote on the bill, though, was academic on one level: It passed 44-5. But the law became extraordinarily popular with the anti-abortion movement, and 20 states now have similar statutes on the books. With those wins pocketed, the movement is pushing to ratchet down the threshold, arguing on behalf of so-called “heartbeat” bills, which could ban abortion as early as six weeks.Mello also voted for a bill that would ban telemedicine in cases of abortion, a big deal particularly in a rural state like Nebraska, where such medications may be the best option for women. And he backed a controversial bill that began by requiring women seeking an abortion to undergo and view an ultrasound, an invasive and unnecessary procedure with no medical benefit. That measure was watered down to simply requiring doctors to offer one. Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and an ally of Mello’s, credited him with weakening the measure. “It was Heath’s credibility with pro-life legislators that enabled him to take mandatory ultrasounds off the table and substitute a bill that stated that women had a choice to have one and to see the image,” she told The Nation. Sofia Jawed-Wessel, who teaches sexual health at the University of Nebraska, also told the magazine that the local reproductive health community had made progress with Mello. “I wish the national organizations would respect the relationship we have been nurturing, instead of just assuming we don’t know what we’re doing,” Jawed-Wessel said. “Then they might have reframed their statement in a way that added momentum to someone we consider a strong ally.”While Mello may have come around on the issue, his opponent, Mayor Jean Stothert, remains committed against abortion rights. According to Nebraska Right to Life, Stothert supports defunding Planned Parenthood, overturning Roe v. Wade and banning abortion in all cases except rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. Mello, meanwhile, did not take the organization’s questionnaire. "

In the audio, first posted by TMZ, Soules, 35, can be heard explaining to a dispatcher that he “rear-ended a guy in a tractor,” throwing both the tractor and the man into a ditch.Soules, who provides his name in the audio, told the dispatcher that the victim was “not conscious” and didn’t appear to be breathing. Later, he said the victim had blood coming from his mouth but that he could feel a pulse.The dispatcher asked Soules to “stay on the phone with me” and whether he knew CPR, which Soules said he did not. Later, someone can be heard trying to give the victim what sounds like CPR. “You guys are on your way?” he asked near the end of the call.When the dispatcher said yes, he then asked, “Can I call you back really quick?” She said yes. He then hung up. Soules allegedly fled the scene soon after the call, but witnesses identified him to police, who eventually located and arrested Soules on the charge of leaving the scene of a fatal crash.TMZ has obtained documents that show police believe Soules, who was reportedly initially uncooperative with authorities, possessed alcoholic beverage containers at the time of the crash. The 66-year-old victim, Kenneth E. Mosher, was taken via ambulance to a hospital and later died as a result of the injuries he sustained."

Congresspeople from the six states covered by EPA Region 5 signed the Tuesday letter to Pruitt, including Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.).(Read the full letter below.) Multiple sources previously told HuffPost the White House aims to gut almost one-third of the EPA’s budget and eliminate 1 in 5 employees for the 2018 fiscal year. In an April 17 letter to EPA Region 5 employees obtained by HuffPost, Acting Region 5 Director Bob Kaplan said rumors of the office’s closure were “not true” and called them “pure speculation.”And in a visit last week to East Chicago, Indiana, which is grappling with a lead contamination crisis affecting both the water and soil, Pruitt reportedly denied to a resident of the town that Region 5 was on the chopping block.The denial from officials has done little to quell the concerns of the Region 5 employees.“Everyone here is very worried even though our regional management here denied [the rumors],” Michael J. Mikulka, president of Local 704, which represents the EPA Region 5 employees, told HuffPost last week.About a month ago, the union got three press calls in the same day asking if it had heard there was announcement Region 5 might be closed. The Office of Management and Budget also issued a memo in March asking the EPA to propose two regions for elimination. Then, two weekends ago, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued a statement in support of keeping Region 5 open following reports in the Chicago Sun-Times and Politico that it was on the chopping block.“If the mayor issues a press statement, it’s based on something. It’s not from his imagination,” Mikulka said.A veteran EPA employee who has spent decades at the Region 5 office said for years employees have heard rumblings of the agency getting rid of regions.“There are about 1,000 people in Region 5 and it has the most industrial regions of all of the EPA,” the employee, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, told HuffPost. “My question is, ‘Why us?’ We’re a big region in terms of geography. It takes four hours [flying] to get to the edge of the whole region.”According to the Sun-Times, if Region 5 shuttered, employees would go to Region 7, 20 miles south of Kansas City, Kansas.“There are a lot of folks who simply won’t do the move. And to be honest, that’s why it’s being suggested,” the employee said. “The Trump administration suggested getting rid of 31 percent of the budget ― about 3,000 employees, which is about 20 percent of the EPA workforce. How are they going to get there? It’s a lot easier to combine regions knowing that many of the staff in Region 5 would not want to move to Kansas City.”The employee predicted that if the closure came to pass, “at least half” of the Region 5 employees would not go.Several EPA employees said the demand for functions like water-testing and state oversight already outpaces the regional office’s resources. Members of Congress who signed Tuesday’s letter underscored the important role the region plays in ensuring a quick response to spills and contamination in the six states, which are criss-crossed with oil and gas pipelines ― spills often near the bulk of the nation’s freshwater supply and the Mississippi River waterways. Shutting down the Region 5 office would make the agency’s partnerships with state and local bodies more difficult and less efficient, with dubious overall cost savings, the letter argued. Mikulka, the EPA employees’ union president, said shuttering Region 5 would be an effective way to hobble an agency whose mission is largely at odds with the Trump administration’s deregulation-oriented, anti-climate-protection stance. “If we have the most industry and we do the most enforcement and get the greatest results, what better way to disembowel the EPA than going after Region 5?”"

Then, two weekends ago, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued a statement in support of keeping Region 5 open following reports in the Chicago Sun-Times and Politico that it was on the chopping block.“If the mayor issues a press statement, it’s based on something. It’s not from his imagination,” Mikulka said.A veteran EPA employee who has spent decades at the Region 5 office said for years employees have heard rumblings of the agency getting rid of regions.“There are about 1,000 people in Region 5 and it has the most industrial regions of all of the EPA,” the employee, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, told HuffPost. “My question is, ‘Why us?’ We’re a big region in terms of geography. It takes four hours [flying] to get to the edge of the whole region.”According to the Sun-Times, if Region 5 shuttered, employees would go to Region 7, 20 miles south of Kansas City, Kansas.“There are a lot of folks who simply won’t do the move. And to be honest, that’s why it’s being suggested,” the employee said. “The Trump administration suggested getting rid of 31 percent of the budget ― about 3,000 employees, which is about 20 percent of the EPA workforce. How are they going to get there? It’s a lot easier to combine regions knowing that many of the staff in Region 5 would not want to move to Kansas City.”The employee predicted that if the closure came to pass, “at least half” of the Region 5 employees would not go.Several EPA employees said the demand for functions like water-testing and state oversight already outpaces the regional office’s resources. Members of Congress who signed Tuesday’s letter underscored the important role the region plays in ensuring a quick response to spills and contamination in the six states, which are criss-crossed with oil and gas pipelines ― spills often near the bulk of the nation’s freshwater supply and the Mississippi River waterways. Shutting down the Region 5 office would make the agency’s partnerships with state and local bodies more difficult and less efficient, with dubious overall cost savings, the letter argued. Mikulka, the EPA employees’ union president, said shuttering Region 5 would be an effective way to hobble an agency whose mission is largely at odds with the Trump administration’s deregulation-oriented, anti-climate-protection stance. “If we have the most industry and we do the most enforcement and get the greatest results, what better way to disembowel the EPA than going after Region 5?”"

But he will no longer be involved in a key technology that allows autonomous vehicles to navigate, a company spokesperson told HuffPost. Eric Meyhofer, an Uber engineer and co-founder of Carnegie Robotics, will take over the division, Uber said.The shift comes as a potentially devastating lawsuit against Uber involving Levandowski heads toward trial. The suit, filed by self-driving car rival Waymo, accuses former employee Levandowski of stealing trade secrets. Levandowski played a key role in Google’s self-driving car program, later spun off into Waymo. Central to the lawsuit is the design of a circuit board for an essential technology called LiDAR, which helps driverless cars map their surroundings.Waymo claims Levandowski brought that circuit board design with him to Uber, giving the company a critical ― and illegal ― advantage. Uber has dismissed the claim.In an email to his team on Thursday (read it below), Levandowski wrote that Uber’s technology was built “independently, from the ground up.”A court hearing is scheduled for next week. The judge potentially could halt Uber’s self-driving program until the outcome of the trial.Here’s Levandowski’s email to Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group announcing the leadership change, first obtained by Business Insider.

But then he put on a pair of headphones and discussed the bombshell political news via web chat with Levin and TMZ co-executive producer Charles Latibeaudiere.“I’ve been honored to serve, but I just turned 50 years old and I’m sleeping on a cot in my office,” Chaffetz told the pair. “I’m away — more than 1,500 nights I’ve been away from my family. And I happen to have a wife I love and kids I adore and it’s time to re-evaluate my life. And sleeping on the cot gets to you after awhile.” He said in the days after the interview that he may leave office before his term is up. Levin said during the interview that he had become friends with Chaffetz in recent years. He said he’s visited Chaffetz’s congressional office-apartment, and could confirm it’s a “crappy existence.”A Chaffetz spokesperson confirmed the friendship, and said Levin reached out for an interview after news of the congressman’s decision not to run for re-election.Among the 400-plus members of the House, few have as big a national profile as Chaffetz ― a fast-rising congressman who runs one of the preeminent oversight committees on Capitol Hill.

Chaffetz also courted a less conventional source for political news: TMZ, which has built its brand with aggressive Hollywood coverage.Chaffetz has spoken to TMZ a few times over the years, including in 2015, when he talked about Republican Caitlyn Jenner, the transgender former Olympian. But he has appeared particularly accessible to the network in recent months. And TMZ has scored conspicuous scoops on topics directly under his committee’s purview, such as Secret Service security lapses.How a 50-year-old Mormon congressman from Utah became a fixture of a site known for coverage of Tinseltown is a curiosity to Capitol Hill aides. But the answer may have as much to do with TMZ’s growing desire to expand into the world of political journalism as it does to Chaffetz’s relationship with Levin.Though TMZ is best known for breaking major celebrity stories, like Michael Jackson’s death, Mel Gibson’s anti-Semitic rant, and NFL star Ray Rice punching of his fiancee in a casino elevator, the site has considered breaking into Washington in the past.TMZ doesn’t have a Washington bureau, but it doesn’t lack high-ranking sources. Last month, Levin visited President Donald Trump at The White House and reportedly broached the idea of the president appearing again on “OBJECTified,” his forthcoming Fox News series.The Trump White House, with top staffers like Sean Spicer and Kellyanne Conway crossing into the broader culture and getting celebrity treatment, has been good fodder for TMZ as well. Last month, the site dubbed Conway a “D.C. Rockster” during a “TMZ Live” segment showing the White House counselor repeatedly stopped by people on the street. In another segment, a reporter peppers Conway with questions, such as how she stays so beautiful and what she thinks of being parodied on “Saturday Night Live.”Such coverage reflects the basic ethos of the site, which has excelled in capturing stage-managed personalities off guard through verite-style video ambushes. And when TMZ has ventured into other political topics, it hasn’t swerved far from that model. The site recently covered House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), for instance, with an “exclusive” report on his trip to Universal Studios. TMZ’s coverage of Chaffetz and Chaffetz-related topics has had far more depth and actual reporting. Take, for instance, its sustained focus on the Secret Service, an agency Chaffetz has investigated and challenged. Dozens of Secret Service agents were disciplined last year over leaking information that Chaffetz ― who had been investigating the agency’s security failures ― once applied for a job there. The TMZ reports, like much of the site’s articles, have no bylines. Chaffetz is quoted as an on-the-record source in a couple of stories. But they most rely on unnamed sources.On March 7, TMZ reported that a White House fence jumper apprehended by the Secret Service was not on the agency’s “radar,” information attributed to law enforcement sources. In an “exclusive” March 17 story, TMZ reported that the fence jumper, Jonathan Tuan-Anh, had been on White House grounds for nearly 20 minutes before being caught. The site didn’t identify sources. That same day on “TMZ Live,” Levin and Latibeaudiere kicked off the show by discussing the theft of a Secret Service agent’s laptop that contained Trump Tower floor plans.On March 18, TMZ reported in another “exclusive” story that the White House fence-jumper had told the Secret Service he wanted to get inside before actually doing so. “Some members of Congress are outraged, one telling us it’s beyond comprehension the intruder was not on the radar of the Secret Service when he jumped the fence,” the site reported. In addition to covering Secret Service miscues, TMZ reported on March 19 how a Mar-a-Lago guest had not breached security, as had been claimed. TMZ, again citing law enforcement sources, reported on March 20 that the laptop thief was caught on video. “We’re told the video is grainy so it’s hard to make out the thief’s features, but it’s definitely a lead,” the site reported.On March 21, Chaffetz spoke to TMZ for an “exclusive” story about a White House fence-jumper’s ability to linger around the grounds without detection by Secret Service. “It was even worse than I thought,” he said. Following another, albeit botched, fence-jumping, Chaffetz told TMZ the next day that the suspect “was up there dangling on the fence, and the Secret Service grabbed him.”A TMZ spokesman did not respond to questions about the site’s coverage of Washington, and specifically Chaffetz.Chaffetz’s relationship to TMZ has been a two-way street, with the congressman providing quotes for the site, and TMZ providing fodder for the congressman. When TMZ first reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to use Muppets in an educational campaign to teach children about the Zika virus, Chaffetz quickly pounced, demanding a “written explanation” why the CDC was partnering with the Jim Henson Co.In a 2012 congressional hearing on innovations in mobile technology, Chaffetz referenced TMZ in saying how the site could hypothetically put “drones up flying to follow celebrities in their 10-mile zone. That’s what TMZ stands for, right?” (Close: It’s Thirty-Mile Zone).The relationship has indeed stretched back years. Chaffetz told TMZ in March 2009 that he sleeps on “a cot” during a segment on the preferred mattresses of members of congress.

It’s been a strong, admirable series, and ABC deserves credit for sticking with it despite modest ratings.That said, it’s been hard to figure out exactly what this season wants to say.It started with Mexican immigrant Luis Salazar (Benito Martinez), who was determined to reach the farms of North Carolina and find his teenage son. On one of those farms we met Isaac Castillo (Richard Cabral), a middle management guy whose job was recruiting new workers with a sucker sales pitch.One of his recruits was Coy Henson (Connor Jessup), a seemingly homeless American kid with a pill addiction.Then a fire killed multiple farm workers by trapping them in their overcrowded trailer. This took us to the family that owned the farm, led by matriarch Laurie Ann Hesby (Cherry Jones) and one of her sons, Carson (Dallas Roberts). They said the fire was a darn shame, but since the trailer was off-site, it wasn’t their problem. This indifference became a flashpoint for Carson’s wife Jeanette (Felicity Huffman), who decided her life was as empty as Carson’s conscience. She eventually left him, only to discover that the prospects for a middle-aged woman to create and support an independent life are pretty much zero. So she moved in with her sister Raelyn (Janel Moloney), whose own husband had recently left and who was also a convicted drug abuser with two very young daughters. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Nicholas Coates (Timothy Hutton) is trying to hang onto the family furniture company, which was once a gold standard and now can barely turn out enough cheap stuff to compete with foreign manufacturers. Nicholas already was having a chilly time with his wife Claire (Lili Taylor). The new financial pressure helped turn it into a deep freeze, with Nicholas evolving from stressed business owner into a truly vicious ogre. Claire, for her part, had hired Haitian nanny Gabrielle (Mickaelle X. Bizet) to help care for their young son, partly because Gabrielle speaks only French and thus could teach the boy a second language.Soon it turns out Gabrielle has serious emotional issues of her own, including an estrangement from her son back in Haiti. And that in turn connects to another subplot, wherein social worker Kimara Walters (Regina King) desperately wants a child of her, but instead finds herself scrambling to find shelters or homes for lost and runaway children who feel unwanted by anyone. Mostly we see Kimara trying to help 17-year-old prostitute Shae Reese (Ana Mulvoy-Ten) escape her pimp and accept a life that that’s more boring and less lucrative, but at least not potentially lethal. The history of “American Crime” tells us that dramas like Shae’s are by no means certain to end in happily ever after, which is one reason the show has been so strong. It acknowledges that in tragic complicated situations, all outcomes are not good.Most of this season’s dramas, in any case, haven’t ended at all. Last week, with just one episode to go, Ridley was adding more dramatic twists. And more characters.Each of the issues raised by these dramas is important. As viewers, though, we want to see how they weave together, and this year it feels as if there’s been much less of that.A season that began with a focus on the brutal lives of immigrant farmworkers a few weeks later spent most of an episode focusing on marital discord in an upper middle class white home.Scorecard, please.Now maybe John Ridley, a first-rate talent, has a plan for the final episode that will pull it all together and direct us to the points he wants us to take away.Even if he does, “American Crime” has set the benchmark for 2016-2017’s most oddly assembled show."

KeatingThe central story line for Born Anxious starts with stress methylation — an “epigenetic modification” that occurs early in life, in the womb or during the first year of an infant’s life. Like all epigenetic modifications, this specific one alters how the gene works, but doesn’t change the DNA in any way. There are kinds of biological embedding beyond this specific epigenetic methylation (of the gene NR3C1 that exerts control over the glucocorticoid feedback loop). These other kinds of biological embedding include epigenetic modifications of other key genes in response to social and physical exposures (that is, other genes also listen to the environment in early life), and other mechanisms that have an impact on gene expression.From this starting point, the consequences follow: it leads to stress dysregulation, keeping the stress response on a high alert status; this in turn leads to a lifetime of problems in development and health, from relationship difficulties, to school and work problems, to stress-related diseases in adulthood, and an elevated risk of early death; and the social distribution of these outcomes shows that inequality is a new predator, increasing both stress-dysregulation and a stress epidemic that shows up in increasing reports that we feel stressed, increasing biological markers of stress that lead to diseases, and more stress-related diseases. Among wealthy societies that are more unequal, and especially show increases in inequality, these consequences show up more than in societies with lower inequality.So why focus primarily on methylation of this stress gene for the central story line, that leads to such dramatic outcomes? First, it was the focus of the original groundbreaking work by Michael Meaney’s research group at McGill that largely launched the field of social epigenetics, and because the accumulating evidence for its similar operation across multiple species is strong. Second, the site of its action is the HPA-axis, and we know a great deal about how dysregulation of the stress-response system affects health and development across the lifespan. Third, this pattern of outcomes from stress dysregulation tracks closely with what we have learned about the nature of the social gradient in developmental health, supporting the view that it is a key player in how social inequality “gets under the skin.” Fourth, the links from micro to macro show a strong consilience — a jumping together of superficially unrelated findings — that raises our confidence in the main conclusion: a powerful dynamic system connects stress methylation to the effects of stress dysregulation across the lifespan, to the social gradient and social inequality, to how societies differ in the way that they deal with social inequality, and returns full circle to promote or inhibit stress methylation in subsequent generations.Most people in advanced societies today do not confront predators or similar threats of our ancient ancestors, when having a high alert stress system would have advantages. So what causes the level of stress to trigger stress methylation today? In some situations — war zones or highly dangerous neighborhoods, for example — the stress is similar, namely, threats to survival. And we do see differential methylation in those situations. But we also see evidence of it in individuals who experience economic deprivation and uncertainty, leading to early life adversity in their children.So it is easy to see how early life adversity from poverty or disadvantage could matter, but why would it affect middle or upper class families and individuals? As societies become highly unequal, such as we are experiencing today, being in the middle or even upper classes is no guarantee of maintaining that position. Significant downturns in employment or financial status, as in the Great Recession beginning in 2008, can make most anyone feel vulnerable. And if not for oneself, worries that we have for our children in a decreasingly mobile society, can generate stress in terms of them “sliding down” the social ladder.This might imply that everyday stress for anyone might trigger stress methylation throughout the population, so it’s important to ask how much stress does an expectant mom need to experience to trigger this? We don’t have (yet) a dose-response curve — we don’t know exactly how much stress is too much. In part, this is because research is just beginning to look at this in the population as a whole. But also, there is not a direct translation from external circumstances to the experience of stress — the perception of threats plays a major role in how stressed one feels. Everyday hassles and moderate stressors are likely not enough, but sustained levels of worry or stress at a significant level are.In addition to high stress during pregnancy, leading to cortisol levels in the fetus that can lead to stress methylation, a poor, high-stress nurturing environment in the first year or so can have the same effect. The kind of nurturing issues that can lead to stress methylation range from obvious extremes to those experienced in more typical circumstances. At the extreme, as in the Romanian orphanages through the 1980s, the absence of any contact other than cleaning and feeding leads almost inevitably to that outcome. In more typical circumstances, low levels of sensitive, warm, and responsive contact with the infant are sufficient. This can happen for a number of reasons, but very high levels of stress in the parents are clearly associated with problematic nurturing. Lack of experience in parenting or mental health challenges of the parents can lead to similar outcomes.The links from inequality to early life adversity to stress dysregulation seem enough to set up a spreading problem of stress with increasing inequality, but what evidence is there for a stress epidemic? There are several convergent lines of evidence. One is through surveys of self-reported stress, or symptoms of stress like feeling agitated, which show increasing reports of this. A repeated survey of a nationally representative population sample has shown steady increases over a number of years, as well as a recent spike coincident with the 2016 election and the 2017 Inauguration from a different survey by the American Psychological Association. A second line of evidence comes from the significant increases in stress-related disorders and diseases, as charted over years by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including metabolic disorders, obesity, sleep deficiencies, and others. Third, recent evidence at a population level shows an increase in physiological stress — such as cholesterol and markers of liver and heart function — from the late 1970s to today. And, the social inequality of that physical “stress load” has also gotten worse.We see the biological consequences of rising inequality in several ways. One is the direct measure of a physical stress load measure, as just noted. Another is that fraying of the social safety net can lead to insecurity about the basic necessities for a much larger part of the population. As well, even those not directly affected by this kind of insecurity at the moment will experience greater uncertainty about what the future may hold for them and for their children. As more people experience this inequality-generated stress — as the “new predator” — there is more stress around in general, carried from home to work to school, in a circle of contagion.Looking back over the story that links the epigenetic change of methylation in how our genes function, to the lifelong impact this can have on developmental health through stress dysregulation, to the role played by the new predator of increasing social inequality, we may begin to feel a bit overwhelmed by the seemingly insurmountable challenge this poses. It can seem even more like our inevitable destiny when we recall the other rub to the epigenetics story: this change to the stress gene can be biologically inherited. The amped-up stress system that it leads to may can be caused not only by excess prenatal stress on the mother or by early life stress that the infant experienced. Also, the methylated version might have been passed down from one or several generations back.With so many possible routes to poorly functioning stress systems, why isn’t everyone dysregulated? There is a real paradox here. We know that the long-term trend across human history is toward less conflict, less overall violence, lowered chances of dying from non-natural causes, and less harsh social environments. This is tough to square with a pandemic of amped-up, dysregulated stress throughout the whole population. And in comparing different countries today, we also find that some have steeper social inequality, to the detriment of their overall health and development. The countries that are more equal enjoy substantially better overall outcomes. Clearly, then, inequality is not destiny.What we have seen is that although there are no magic bullets, many things can help to break the cycle, which are discussed in some detail in Born Anxious. Understanding how the vicious cycle works is an essential first step, but so is understanding the ways that we can interrupt the cycle: for our children, for our loved ones, for ourselves, for the communities where we live and the places where we work, and even for our societies. Redirecting entrenched systems is not easy, but over time, many small changes add up, helping to put in place a virtuous cycle that benefits all of us — and can lead to enduring gains for society as a whole.DANIEL P.

KeatingThe central story line for Born Anxious starts with stress methylation — an “epigenetic modification” that occurs early in life, in the womb or during the first year of an infant’s life. Like all epigenetic modifications, this specific one alters how the gene works, but doesn’t change the DNA in any way. There are kinds of biological embedding beyond this specific epigenetic methylation (of the gene NR3C1 that exerts control over the glucocorticoid feedback loop). These other kinds of biological embedding include epigenetic modifications of other key genes in response to social and physical exposures (that is, other genes also listen to the environment in early life), and other mechanisms that have an impact on gene expression.From this starting point, the consequences follow: it leads to stress dysregulation, keeping the stress response on a high alert status; this in turn leads to a lifetime of problems in development and health, from relationship difficulties, to school and work problems, to stress-related diseases in adulthood, and an elevated risk of early death; and the social distribution of these outcomes shows that inequality is a new predator, increasing both stress-dysregulation and a stress epidemic that shows up in increasing reports that we feel stressed, increasing biological markers of stress that lead to diseases, and more stress-related diseases. Among wealthy societies that are more unequal, and especially show increases in inequality, these consequences show up more than in societies with lower inequality.So why focus primarily on methylation of this stress gene for the central story line, that leads to such dramatic outcomes? First, it was the focus of the original groundbreaking work by Michael Meaney’s research group at McGill that largely launched the field of social epigenetics, and because the accumulating evidence for its similar operation across multiple species is strong. Second, the site of its action is the HPA-axis, and we know a great deal about how dysregulation of the stress-response system affects health and development across the lifespan. Third, this pattern of outcomes from stress dysregulation tracks closely with what we have learned about the nature of the social gradient in developmental health, supporting the view that it is a key player in how social inequality “gets under the skin.” Fourth, the links from micro to macro show a strong consilience — a jumping together of superficially unrelated findings — that raises our confidence in the main conclusion: a powerful dynamic system connects stress methylation to the effects of stress dysregulation across the lifespan, to the social gradient and social inequality, to how societies differ in the way that they deal with social inequality, and returns full circle to promote or inhibit stress methylation in subsequent generations.Most people in advanced societies today do not confront predators or similar threats of our ancient ancestors, when having a high alert stress system would have advantages. So what causes the level of stress to trigger stress methylation today? In some situations — war zones or highly dangerous neighborhoods, for example — the stress is similar, namely, threats to survival. And we do see differential methylation in those situations. But we also see evidence of it in individuals who experience economic deprivation and uncertainty, leading to early life adversity in their children.So it is easy to see how early life adversity from poverty or disadvantage could matter, but why would it affect middle or upper class families and individuals? As societies become highly unequal, such as we are experiencing today, being in the middle or even upper classes is no guarantee of maintaining that position. Significant downturns in employment or financial status, as in the Great Recession beginning in 2008, can make most anyone feel vulnerable. And if not for oneself, worries that we have for our children in a decreasingly mobile society, can generate stress in terms of them “sliding down” the social ladder.This might imply that everyday stress for anyone might trigger stress methylation throughout the population, so it’s important to ask how much stress does an expectant mom need to experience to trigger this? We don’t have (yet) a dose-response curve — we don’t know exactly how much stress is too much. In part, this is because research is just beginning to look at this in the population as a whole. But also, there is not a direct translation from external circumstances to the experience of stress — the perception of threats plays a major role in how stressed one feels. Everyday hassles and moderate stressors are likely not enough, but sustained levels of worry or stress at a significant level are.In addition to high stress during pregnancy, leading to cortisol levels in the fetus that can lead to stress methylation, a poor, high-stress nurturing environment in the first year or so can have the same effect. The kind of nurturing issues that can lead to stress methylation range from obvious extremes to those experienced in more typical circumstances. At the extreme, as in the Romanian orphanages through the 1980s, the absence of any contact other than cleaning and feeding leads almost inevitably to that outcome. In more typical circumstances, low levels of sensitive, warm, and responsive contact with the infant are sufficient. This can happen for a number of reasons, but very high levels of stress in the parents are clearly associated with problematic nurturing. Lack of experience in parenting or mental health challenges of the parents can lead to similar outcomes.The links from inequality to early life adversity to stress dysregulation seem enough to set up a spreading problem of stress with increasing inequality, but what evidence is there for a stress epidemic? There are several convergent lines of evidence. One is through surveys of self-reported stress, or symptoms of stress like feeling agitated, which show increasing reports of this. A repeated survey of a nationally representative population sample has shown steady increases over a number of years, as well as a recent spike coincident with the 2016 election and the 2017 Inauguration from a different survey by the American Psychological Association.

79,POLITICS,Surge In LLC Contributions Brings More Mystery About True Donors,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surge-in-llc-contributions-brings-more-mystery-about_us_590222a7e4b00acb75f185a1,Donald Trump’s inaugural committee did well by almost any standard: Doubling the previous record for cash raised to fund,2017-04-27,"<p> Jeb Bush was a favorite recipient for LLC donations, with almost $6 million coming from the entities to his supporting super PAC.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590222d81400002700a9c353.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Ashley Balcerzak Donald Trump’s inaugural committee did well by almost any standard: Doubling the previous record for cash raised to fund festivities around a new president’s swearing-in, it took in contributions from every major sector of the economy, and from donors who had steered clear of his campaign prior to the election.The committee also received about $10.6 million — or about 10 percent of its total raised — from roughly 60 limited liability companies, or LLCs — structures often set up by small businesses that provide favorable tax treatment while also protecting their owners’ assets.But some exist mainly to mask people’s identities.Names of many of the inaugural LLC donors are straightforward, like Altria Client Services LLC, which clearly is affiliated with the tobacco company. Others read like a can of alphabet soup just exploded: HFNWA LLC, which gave $1 million; BV-2 LLC, $350,000; HGI DB Fund LLC, $250,000; HGIM LLC Corporate, same amount; or HJK LLC, $100,000, to name a few.OpenSecrets Blog and other news outlets tracked down the people behind some of these using state corporate records searches and similar sources. (Franklin Haney, Gordon Sondland, Chad Guidry and his brother Shane, and H.J. Kalikow were behind that batch of five.) But the individuals who control a handful of the others on the list — like BH Group, LLC, which contributed $1 million — haven’t been nailed down.By comparison, President Barack Obama’s 2013 inaugural committee received funds from just six LLCs, none of which had mysterious backers; they gave a total of $496,750.And inaugural committees aren’t the only recipients of surging LLC contributions — their donations to presidential campaigns and super PACs in 2016 also spiked: About 840 of them gave roughly $21 million in the last cycle — almost double the $12 million by 109 LLCs in 2012, the first presidential race after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.Who is that man behind the curtain?Exactly what LLCs can and can’t do in the political realm depends on how they file tax returns: as corporations, or not. If not, their revenues, losses and so on are included on the personal returns of the individual or partners who own the LLC.Corporate LLCs and LLPs (limited liability partnerships) can’t donate directly to candidates; the noncorporate kind can, as long as they report the names of the individuals responsible for the donations. The contributions count toward an individual’s giving limits ($2,700 per candidate per election, but there’s no limit on gifts to super PACs.)But many limited liability donations are reported with no names included. “LLC donations have created this whole new realm of transparency problems,” said Brendan Fischer, federal program director at the Campaign Legal Center. “They require minimal transparency and they are easy to set up, making them an appealing vehicle for a donor that doesn’t want his name attached.”A donation could also cross the legal line by allowing foreign or corporate funds to flow into an election.“A foreign national or a foreign individual or an agent could easily set up an LLC in Delaware, make a contribution and if the true source is not disclosed, the public would have no way of knowing,” Fischer noted.LLCs gave about $828,000 to presidential campaign committees in 2016 — a modest sum given that the cost of the presidential election was an estimated $2.4 billion, and 26 candidates raised $1.5 billion, but way up from the $7,500 that these organizations gave to White House campaigns in the 2012 cycle. Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) led the pack with $160,000, followed by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with $112,000 and Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) with $110,000. Trump came in at No. 7 with $49,000. (In our analysis, we only included donations from entities with “LLC” or “LLP” in their names, which means we have certainly undercounted.)But it is Trump’s LLC donations that have spurred the most queries from the Federal Election Commission, even though his haul from such companies was modest compared with that of other candidates. The agency wants to know whether around 140 LLC donations of $91,000 (about $52,000 of which went into Trump’s campaign committee) were legal. (This figure is larger than our count of Trump’s LLCs because it includes groups that are LLCs but don’t have those letters in their names.) In many cases, Trump didn’t report the partners’ names, as the rules require. One letter from the FEC highlighted a company with a headline-strewn past: Clean Energy Capital, LLC, which gave $1,000 to Trump’s Make America Great Again joint fundraising committee in early October. Two years earlier, it was a different agency, the SEC, that was interested in this Tuscon-based private equity fund and its CEO, Scott Brittenham, accusing them of misallocating funds. Brittenham and the fund settled the federal charges, paying roughly $2.2 million. The campaign reattributed the donation, $800 of which had been allocated to Trump’s campaign from the JFC, to Brittenham.The campaign has fixed some of the other LLC donations flagged by the FEC, too. At least six were refunded because the campaign could not determine if they were legal or not. In some other cases, the campaign amended its FEC report to include partnership attributions. At least one query from the agency, concerning nine LLCs, is still awaiting a response, which is due by May 12.“Our Committee has safeguards in place to ensure that all contributions are made by eligible contributors only,” wrote campaign treasurer Timothy Jost in September and November letters to the FEC.Most of the LLC donor action was with outside spending groups. Former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) led the presidential pack with $6 million in such contributions to his super PAC, Right to Rise. He was followed by a fellow Florida Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio, with $5.5 million from LLC donors to Conservative Solutions, the super PAC dedicated to electing him; and Kasich, who saw $2.2 million in LLC donations to his super PAC, New Day for America.Trump moved up, coming in at No. 4 with his groups getting $1.6 million from LLCs.With some of these organizations, it takes quite a bit of digging to uncover the name of the human responsible for the contribution. For instance, MMWP12, LLC gave $500,000 to pro-Kasich super PAC New Day Independent Media Committee. The Center for Public Integrity reported the entity was incorporated in Montana the day before it made the big gift, and is linked to another LLC, K2M, that lists a former Kasich staff member, Paul Johannsen, as one of its officers. Another example: The New York Times identified the true source of the $250,000 from V3 231, LLC to pro-Cruz Stand for Principal PAC: Ben Nash, the CEO of PCS Wireless. And the AP uncovered the original donor behind a half-million-dollar donation from IGX LLC in Delaware (in which three such names are registered) to Rubio’s super PAC.to be self-described investor Andrew Duncan of Brooklyn, N.Y., .Nobody was able to top the $11 million that Restore Our Future and other groups backing then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney scooped up from LLCs in 2012 — and which also triggered hunts for the real donors.Overall, the number of LLCs actively contributing at the federal level and the amount they gave to super PACs (including non-presidential ones) shot up in 2016, with around 850 of them doling out almost $32.2 million. That’s compared to the approximately 290 LLCs giving $8 million in 2014 for the mid-year elections, and 310 LLCs donating $22 million in 2012.Eight super PACs, with all but one supporting Republicans, received at least $1 million from LLCs last election. After the pro-Bush Right to Rise ($6 million) and pro-Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC ($5.5 million), the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is the super PAC offshoot of the National Republican Congressional Committee and works to elect GOP House candidates, was the third runner up, harvesting $2 million from these organizations.Trump himself is no stranger to doing business via LLCs. The Wall Street Journal estimated almost half the income listed on his financial disclosure reports (at least $304 million) came from assets held in 96 LLCs, and he owns more than 500 in all. These entities are frequently used in the real estate industry, with each project being set up as its own LLC, protecting the LLC owner from liability for debts and bringing advantageous tax treatment. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and another real estate maven, included 204 LLCs on his personal financial disclosure.Official inactionLLC contributions were a hot topic at the beginning of 2016, with advocacy groups filing multiple complaints with the FEC saying the corporate names were hiding the true sources of the funds. One target: Children of Israel LLC, which donated $150,000 to a super PAC supporting GOP White House contender Mike Huckabee, $400,000 to a pro-Cruz outside group and $334,000 to the Republican National Committee.The Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint against Children of Israel, alleging it was an illegal straw donor, and others against DE First Holdings, which gave $1 million to a liberal super PAC, Coalition for Progress, the day after it was incorporated, and Décor Services LLC, which gave $250,000 to a pro-Christie super PAC 16 days after it was formed. Another, IGX LLC, faced the same scrutiny after donating $500,000 to a pro-Rubio super PAC. The Associated Press reported the owner, Andrew Duncan, admitted to using the LLC to donate because “he was worried about reprisals.” The complaints are currently still pending, and the Campaign Legal Center has not heard back from the FEC.(The Intercept reported after the complaint was filed that big donor Saul Fox was the man behind Children of Israel by analyzing an amended RNC filing.)Separately, last month a federal court in Washington, D.C., rejected the FEC’s attempt to throw out a lawsuit by the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21 against the agency in connection with LLC contributions in the 2012 campaign cycle. The advocacy groups sued to force the FEC to investigate five cases involving LLC contributions to super PACs supporting Romney, Obama, and a group of Republicans; the agency had dropped the cases after failing to get the requisite four commissioners to vote to move forward.“I think this huge increase you’re seeing from one presidential election cycle to another is largely due to the deadlocks on the FEC,” said Brett Kappel, partner at Akerman LLP, “because contributors learn that if they use an LLC it’s unlikely there will be any issues with the FEC, which has to have a four vote majority to do anything.”In addition, says another close observer, the increase may foretell the next chapter in the post-Citizens United development of campaign finance strategy.“When super PACs first started out contributors generally consisted of individuals, so this phase two maturation is where we see more businesses like LLCs that are closely held and controlled by individuals,” said Caleb Burns, a partner at Wiley Rien. “I think this is the middle of a trend, where ultimately we will have other businesses in the not so distant future, including public companies becoming bigger players as super PAC donors.”Researcher Alex Baumgart contributed to this post.

Eric was in Dallas, Texas, the divorced dad of a daughter named Pakanli, or PK for short. Donovan was in Stockton, California, the divorced dad of a son named Desi. Eric and Donovan were both in their early 30s, both of their kids were the same age, and both men were of Mexican heritage.Needless to say, they had a lot in common. They exchanged numbers and began to speak to one another regularly on the phone.“I never did the long-distance relationship thing,” Eric says today.He moved out to California on New Year’s Eve last year and has started making a life with Donovan. The two plan to marry sometime next fall.But perhaps we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. Because in telling the story of these two gay dads, it’s important to figure out how they started, and what brought them to where they are today.BeginningsBoth dads come from Mexican backgrounds, with the kind of traditional and family-oriented roots that implies. Eric’s family was religious, Donovan’s less so.They each wanted to have children.“I was afraid to be me back then,” Eric says today. And so he did what he assumed men who wanted families did: He married a woman, even though he knew he was gay. Donovan did much the same.“Gay guys who are our age who wanted kids had a difficult time,” Donovan says.They faced a seemingly impossible task, reconciling a gay life as they understood it with the more traditional perspective of a two-parent family.Eric was married for a total of two years. He and his wife separated three times before finally splitting for good. He had been single for six years before meeting Donovan.Donovan and his wife had been together for nine years total; they divorced three years ago.Each man had an ex-wife and a child. Each man had to figure out what to do next.MeetingsNothing came easily as Donovan and Eric navigated these years. Their parents didn’t entirely understand when they came out. There were challenges in dealing with their ex-wives and custody matters.“It becomes difficult, especially when it comes to communication,” Donovan says. “My parents still argue and they’ve been divorced for 30 years.”But then, gradually, their lives began to change. Eric hit the age of 30 and became passionate about dancing. Donovan served on the board of directors for his local pride center. And then, the two met online.Once they made contact on the phone, Donovan says, “it seems like we never stopped talking. Every time I went out on a date or whatever, he came into my mind.”And ultimately, they decided to take the plunge, looking forward, not back. It meant making Desi and PK step-siblings. It meant Eric moving away from the state where his daughter lives with her mother.“It was a huge leap of faith that I took,” he says.Family lifeBut Donovan and Eric held hands and went over the edge together.Today, Donovan continues his career as a car salesman. Eric is an emergency room admitting clerk. They have come out to Desi and PK. And their parents are becoming more accepting.The two kids spent the summer together with the couple. The 10-year-olds get along well, too.“They have a good, strong place in our lives,” Eric says. “I feel like they can be themselves. We’re really blessed that they got along so well.”Desi, in fact, has urged the two to get married. “Why don’t you make it official?” he prodded.And Donovan and Eric see their union, and their two kids, as just the beginning. They want children, grandchildren, turtles, the whole nine yards. There have been early discussions about adoption.“We wanted a traditional family per se,” Eric says. “I’m really looking forward to it. The way I’m looking at it, we’re starting from step one.”"

Elijah Cummings (D-MD), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, gave a presser that left little to the imagination. Cummings concluded with a pointed question. A question many have asked privately, but very few have voiced publicly – why is the White House withholding documents on an employee it fired?Cummings reported on the denial of his committee’s formal request to review documents concerning ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn; documents that may potentially shed light on Flynn’s alleged financial ties to Russia. The request was originally evaded, then flat-out rejected by the Trump administration. Many believe the White House is actively stonewalling all requests regarding Flynn. Initially, the White House denied having any documents on Flynn, then it curiously cloaked itself in “executive privilege.” The intelligence community and the Department of Justice both voiced concerns over the consideration of Flynn for a cabinet position prior to Flynn’s appointment. Concerns, in hindsight, that appear to have been ignored by the Trump administration.Cummings, visibly disturbed, accused the White House of “playing games.” He also questioned Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan (R-WI), by name, and characterized him as a complicit co-conspirator. Cummings spoke plainly, and at times passionately, about the importance of maintaining a nonpartisan appreciation of the basic ideals espoused in the U.S. Constitution - namely, the separation of powers.The room fell silent after Cummings asked reporters to surmise the logical conclusion of a congressional branch that theoretically, no longer possessed the power to rein in its executive? Plainly put, what happens when the executive branch denies access to documents the congressional branch legally reserves the right to review? Cummings cautioned onlookers about the perils that accompany such a slippery slope.Not one in the room fielded or volleyed what Cummings questioned rhetorically – the very collapse of a democracy. Historically, an erosion of democracy is often precipitated by a consolidation of power. Hitler, Mussolini, Putin; men who all amassed a great deal of power and wielded it unwisely, often choosing to covet more power as opposed to championing goodwill. Hence, the hallmark of a democratic political system - with key checks and balances - to guard itself against tyranny.Fortunately, the Framers buttressed this great nation with a third pillar - the judicial branch. It’s safe to presume congressional subpoenas are imminent."

My father didn’t learn to swim because of concerns about the spread of polio in public swimming pools.The same year I came to CDC, the World Health Assembly announced a commitment to eradicate polio – and the crippling and potentially fatal infectious disease is now on the brink of extinction. Only five cases have been reported worldwide so far this year – three in Afghanistan and two in Pakistan. The reason for this remarkable accomplishment: widespread polio vaccination. With World Immunization Week currently under way, the on-the-ground gains of recent years are striking. An estimated 2.5 billion children have been vaccinated against polio since 1988. This progress was made possible through Global Polio Eradication Initiative partners including Rotary International, CDC, World Health Organization, UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and through the efforts of tens of thousands of health workers across the globe – some of whom have risked their own safety to distribute lifesaving vaccines in conflict zones. We are now closer than ever to achieving a polio-free world. Polio virus continues to circulate in three countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. Unfortunately, vaccinating children in these security-compromised areas can be a difficult and dangerous task. In Nigeria, for example, more than 360,000 vaccinators support a national polio campaign, and another 180,000 are engaged for sub-national campaigns. More than 80 percent of vaccinators work in the northern part of Nigeria, where they go house-to-house, including in high-risk areas, to administer vaccine to children. As a result, 4.7 million children received vaccine through special interventions in eight northern states in 2016. Female polio workers play a unique role in these efforts. In some regions, mothers and female caregivers will open doors only to women workers who are accepted where men cannot go. Without physical access to administer multiple doses of vaccine, it is not possible to reach these children and stop polio. Despite the obstacles, these countries are making substantial progress, largely due to the tireless efforts of these brave women and men. But as long as pockets of unvaccinated children exist, polio remains a threat to children everywhere. Physicians practicing in the U.S. today might never have seen a patient with polio. And around the world, the memory of the disease is becoming cloudy. Today, 16 million people who statistically would have been paralyzed by polio, are walking because of the polio eradication initiative. But until polio is gone everywhere in the world, the risk of new outbreaks persists. To accomplish this goal, we must continue working together to improve immunization delivery and vaccinate those children in hard-to-reach, insecure areas. A vast global laboratory and surveillance network and a well-trained public health workforce ready to respond to disease outbreaks is essential to this mission. We also depend on scientific and technical expertise that not only supports polio eradication, but has been essential to critical public health responses against measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases.It has been more than 35 years since the world eradicated smallpox, the first disease ever eradicated from humans. When we succeed in reaching and vaccinating almost every child against polio, we will eradicate it for good – and guarantee future generations a world that is forever free from polio. "

85,QUEER VOICES,#AMPLIFYing The Narrative: A Q&A With Lesbian Correspondent Sue Kerr,"Caitlyn Luce Christensen, Contributorsensitive crybaby",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amplifying-the-narrative-a-qa-with-lesbian-correspondent_us_59025126e4b03b105b44b6ec,The platform is a vehicle for conveying the perspectives within Pittsburgh's queer community.,2017-04-27,<p>#AMPLIFY’s contributors. Image provided by The Lesbian Correspondent.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5902532a2600001700c481f1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since 2015, Sue Kerr’s #AMPLIFY project has been documenting the lives and experiences of LGBTQ neighbors in Western Pennsylvania. Published on her Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents blog, #AMPLIFY is equal parts storytelling project, community art project, and historical archive. It couldn’t be more important for queer lives in Pittsburgh.Pittsburgh is often hailed as a progressive place for LGBTQ rights. However, like so much of what is really true about this “most livable city,” Pittsburgh’s politics are only good for some ― namely, white, cis individuals. An example of this was when Iggy Azalea was invited to headline 2015’s Pride festival despite her history of racist and homophobic statements. Iggy Azalea eventually pulled from the event, but that example is emblematic of how much work still needs to be done to support underrepresented members of the queer community.One of the reasons that #AMPLIFY is so important is that the project demonstrates that the queer community of this region is much more complex than a single narrative. These diverse stories, told in individuals’ own words, are living records of how identity impacts day to day experiences in this region.In recognition of the 200th milestone post of this project, Sue took a turn answering some questions about the project, its accomplishments, and the work that remains to be done.March 23rd’s profile of Rev Leonard was your 200th post profiling the life of an LGBTQ individual in Southwest Pennsylvania. What did it mean for you to reach this milestone?It is humbling to consider both the number of contributions and the robust picture they paint in terms of who has been responding. I’m proud of the many types of identities a reader will find in our existing archive.The milestone is remarkable when you consider the daunting prospect of asking 200 folks to take 30 or more minutes to answer questions about their personal lives. It takes about 6 to 8 hours of my personal time to generate one new Q&A and that’s mostly time spent recruiting participants, not editing the actual Q&A.Why did you start the #Amplify project? As part of an “artist in residence” project with Most Wanted Fine Art, I had to create a blog based community art project. I was interested in the idea of signal boosting other people’s words as well as tapping into the popularity of my previous Q&A format posts. People have been reading my words and my spin on things for 12 years ― it was an opportunity to pass the mic and still leverage my resources & privilege to promote the posts.How did you go about deciding what questions to include in profiling folks for Amplify? To what extent was it important to balance the political issues facing the queer community with personal stories? I started with the basics and asked each contributor to suggest a new question. Finding that balance remains important because this is a snapshot into the personal life of someone which inevitably reflects that larger political picture. It is important to me to give people an opportunity to talk about their priorities, their perspective on resources and their “agenda.” I think we’ve demonstrated very clearly that LGBTQ folks prioritize statewide non-discrimination protections. That energy, passion and commitment ― and frustration ― are untapped potential for statewide groups.Could you choose the most important questions from the AMPLIFY survey and answer them yourself? I think the most important question is “How do you describe your identity?” because it is rarely posed as an open ended question. Some people respond with one or two words, others give me paragraphs.I’m intentionally not putting my voice into the answers. I’ll submit a Q&A on the day we end the project to be included in the final archives, but really there are 12 years of my answers to these questions and more on the blog.What have you learned in the course of those 200 posts? Were there things about queer life in this region that surprised even you? I have a new appreciation for the experiences of the bi communities because of how many people have have shared their story ― nearly 50 at this point. The themes of feeling isolated, uncertain of their value to the LGTQ community and the endless erasure of their identity are significant. I wish we could invest in a bi-led organization to turn that around.One thing that did surprise me because it challenges a long held belief is how many LGBTQ folks want to live in rural communities, small towns and otherwise “not in Pittsburgh or any city.” They understand the trade-off ― there can’t be a community center in every town ― but would like the fundamental rights and freedoms their neighbors have.I’m also surprised how many people decline to talk about experiencing discrimination. My general impression is that they do experience microagressions, but we are conditioned to those so they don’t seem “as bad” as more overt and violent experiences.What are your goals for the project now? Our goal continues to obtain contributions from every county so that will be a shifting focus now - building relationships in the underrepresented areas (Cameron, Elk, Forest, McKean, Jefferson, Clearfield, Greene and Somerset counties). We also want to focus on audio recording the Q&A with community elders and other who do not have access to the Internet. Eventually, we’d like to take a closer look at including youth voices. And all along we will continue to work with archivists to prepare the entire project to be accessible as long as possible.What challenges have you faced with this project? I find that a personal invitation is the best way to solicit a contribution and that is a very time consuming aspect of the project - me inviting people, one by one. Or me asking other people to invite their friends, one by one. I’ve calculated that it takes about 8 hours of my time to generate one completed post and a fraction of that time is spent on the actual editing and layout of the post. And that does not account for time spent on other activities such as tabling, grant writing, responding to requests for information and referrals, etc.Having to invest that amount of time into the counties where I don’t have established connections and resources will require a significant financial investment and I’m unsure where we’ll find those resources.Another challenge is that we are not conveying the connection between storytelling and social change effectively. People think of archives as historical, dusty things not vibrant living resources. We are fortunate to have a professional archivist on our advisory team who has been amazing in helping us think about these issues now.These both feed into the challenge of fundraising. We’ve had private donations and some grants, but it has been a struggle to get our project considered for local fundraisers even though we have a formal fiscal sponsor (the Persad Center).What can people do to support you and your work, and what would this support mean for the queer community here? Read the posts. The site is setup to lead you from one to another similar post and there’s an index as well. That’s our end goal. Share your own story. Even if you feel uncertain that it will have an impact, know that it will - it will strengthen the entire project. Your investment of 30 minutes of time to complete the Q&A will generate dozens of hours of people reading the larger archive.I would love to see local fundraisers take us on as a beneficiary, both to raise funds and awareness of the project. I’d like more community leaders to share their stories to encourage their members to do the same.For the queer community, more support means more opportunity for voices to be included that might not participate in a video or oral history project. It means the archive will remain accessible as we continue to upgrade to the latest technology. Eventually, it means that the blog archive will be part of a formal collection and make the declarative statement that we the people control the narrative of what life was like for the LGBTQ commnity in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.What feedback have you received from the community about the project? What political impact do you hope that AMPLIFY will have in this region? Feedback has been positive - people contact me all of the time to tell me how much they enjoy/appreciate/connect with the posts. They mention those facts in their own posts. But there are a lot of people who don’t understand what we are doing and think things like “I’ve missed the deadline” or “my story isn’t very interesting” neither of which is ever the case.From a social change perspective, we have a group of people who have varying degrees of understanding of the challenges our community experiences, especially those who are not politically active or connected to community groups. But almost everyone is on Facebook specifically, so there’s a huge opportunity for every LGBTQ group in this region to up their social media game to better engage all of these folks, of all ages. That requires resources and planning.Something I’d like to see is a seed type grant project, much like the Buhl Foundation has led on the Northside in recent years - allow people a chance to experiment with their suggestions. Partner with Persad Center (my idea, not theirs) to act as fiscal sponsor and provide organizational management tools. And then someone can try offering childcare at LGBTQ events like Bingo and Pride Night at XYZ Venue to see if it does draw new attendees. Or offer bus tickets for community meetings. Or start a week of programming for Bi Visibility Week. Or pay for the consultant to a board of an emerging organization needs to get into place. Or rents a shuttle for elders to travel to a central location for social opportunities.Pittsburgh considers itself a progressive city, friendly towards queer individuals. Do you consider Pittsburgh to be progressive? Why or why not? No, I do not think Pittsburgh is progressive. I think it has aspirations of progressive values wrapped in moderate realities. As long as racial justice remains unaddressed, there is no progress for the queer community. Period. Pittsburgh has a lot to offer the queer community and there is always an opportunity for progress, but the lack of intersectional awareness precludes us from anything but incremental progress that will always prioritize somewhat affluent cisgender white gay men and lesbians. There are two Pittsburghs. That’s a reality many people deny.What advice do you have for young queer Internet writers/bloggers who might be interested in writing about Pittsburgh? We need you! We need you right now to starting writing. The best advice I can offer is to familiarize yourself with the history of the region in terms of politics and queer history. Take a look at the news clippings from the 1970s and 1980s. Take some time to learn how things work in our political system in Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh cannot do the same things as Philadelphia under our state constitution and that’s important to understand.What was the most pressing political issue impacting queer lives in SWPA when you started this project? What about now? When I started AMPLIFY, the emergent issue was racial justice within the LGBTQ community as per the response to Iggy Azalea headlining a Pride event. It was emergent in that it was on everyone’s tongue because of the headlines, not that it hasn’t been with us all along. The same is true now, minus Azalea. Contributor after contributor mention racial justice in all sorts of contexts. There are other substantive issues on that list - bi visibility, trans inclusion, poverty and socio-economic justice, HIV, youth issues and more. But my personal opinion is that racial justice is at the top of that list.What’s next for the #AMPLIFY project?The project continues to accept contributions - we plan to continue through at least 2018 as funding allows. For a six month period, from July to December 2017, we’ll be accepting ‘updates’ from folks who want the opportunity to discuss how their lives have changed since they first submitted. We’ll keep the original post intact, but this should add a robust element to the archive.This summer we have a fundraising event in partnership with Goodwill Industries, a LGBTQ ally, and a possible potlcuk or cookout event to bring folks together. We’ll also be doing a driving tour through the underrepresented counties and trying to build connections with the informal supports in those regions.Finally, we hope to secure funding to begin audiorecording and transcribing the Q&A with community elders and others who may not have access to a computer. Each Q&A will cost us between $125-250 to produce so we need to find a major funder before we launch that element.If you support the stories of LGBTQ individuals in Western Pennsylvania, please consider donating to #AMPLIFY today."

Take a look at the news clippings from the 1970s and 1980s. Take some time to learn how things work in our political system in Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh cannot do the same things as Philadelphia under our state constitution and that’s important to understand.What was the most pressing political issue impacting queer lives in SWPA when you started this project? What about now? When I started AMPLIFY, the emergent issue was racial justice within the LGBTQ community as per the response to Iggy Azalea headlining a Pride event. It was emergent in that it was on everyone’s tongue because of the headlines, not that it hasn’t been with us all along. The same is true now, minus Azalea. Contributor after contributor mention racial justice in all sorts of contexts. There are other substantive issues on that list - bi visibility, trans inclusion, poverty and socio-economic justice, HIV, youth issues and more. But my personal opinion is that racial justice is at the top of that list.What’s next for the #AMPLIFY project?The project continues to accept contributions - we plan to continue through at least 2018 as funding allows. For a six month period, from July to December 2017, we’ll be accepting ‘updates’ from folks who want the opportunity to discuss how their lives have changed since they first submitted. We’ll keep the original post intact, but this should add a robust element to the archive.This summer we have a fundraising event in partnership with Goodwill Industries, a LGBTQ ally, and a possible potlcuk or cookout event to bring folks together. We’ll also be doing a driving tour through the underrepresented counties and trying to build connections with the informal supports in those regions.Finally, we hope to secure funding to begin audiorecording and transcribing the Q&A with community elders and others who may not have access to a computer. Each Q&A will cost us between $125-250 to produce so we need to find a major funder before we launch that element.If you support the stories of LGBTQ individuals in Western Pennsylvania, please consider donating to #AMPLIFY today."

More than 800 organizations across the country are working together to rid our air and water from worsening pollution, while also creating solutions that create good jobs in our communities. We all share a vision that protects our families and the places we call home. On April 29, the communities most impacted by climate change in the US will lead the way to solutions that matter.Why? Under Donald Trump, the federal government has forsaken its responsibility to ensure that all Americans breathe clean air and drink clean water. He and his cronies have given up on ensuring a clean energy economy that provides green jobs to make our communities sustainable. Instead, the decisions coming out of the administration work to benefit corporations by unleashing them to spew toxins into the air and poison our waters, while hurting families and communities that need clean air, water and jobs to thrive.Here is the good news: The future of clean green jobs is no longer with the federal government. It is with people in progressive cities and states who recognize that the administration’s deeds are an opportunity in disguise. Communities of color, progressive elected officials and environmental advocates are focused on two key areas: Passing legislation at the city, county and state level that results in the clean environment we need now and creating green jobs in our communities to help us achieve it.Consider, that more than 1,000 mayors in U.S. cities have signed up to reduce their cities’ carbon emissions. Eighteen states are already set to meet their goals for reducing carbon emissions.Locally, community groups are leading the way with some of the most robust and creative efforts to make their neighborhoods sustainable. For example, communities in South Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. have been hard at work creating what they know they need – good paying green union jobs and concrete training programs focused on training and hiring unemployed community members to be successful in these new jobs.In Los Angeles, for example, Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education (SCOPE), a social justice group that represents the predominantly black and brown residents in South LA, where one in every three people are unemployed or underemployed. Faced with such dismal statistics, SCOPE, local advocacy group LAANE and the electricians’ union International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 18 formed a coalition of more than 40 LA groups made up of environmentalists and workforce development, labor and youth groups. The coalition, called Repower LA, pushes the city’s Department of Water and Power to install or require the installation of energy efficient systems in homes, small businesses and schools. That means installing efficient toilets and faucet aerators that use less water or light fixtures and bulbs that use less electricity.Thousands of businesses, churches, homes have received free energy efficient work in their buildings, which has lowered their utility bills month. Meanwhile, this effort has created a demand that has resulted in hundreds of new jobs at the utility for people to install the systems. Unemployed residents who undergo training and receive the proper certifications fill these new jobs. At the same time, they earning a living wage and health benefits that help them and their families succeed.This effort was not unique for SCOPE. A few years before, the organization worked with the city, as well as unions, environmentalists and community groups to establish an initiative that retrofitted more than 50 of the city’s buildings into more green and sustainable condition. A training program for unemployed residents to do the work underpinned this effort.On the other side of the country, the Washington Interfaith Network (WIN) has worked relentlessly to ensure that the Washington D.C. residents train and have access to new jobs that created to improve the district’s water quality. In D.C., a court settlement found that during heavy rains, the city’s sewer and water system discharged untreated storm water and wastewater into river and streams, causing toxic pollution.Outraged residents with WIN demanded more investment in cleaning up the waterways and pushed the city to ensure that at least 51% of local residents train in the jobs required for the cleanup. The group also successfully pushed for green infrastructure solutions to the storm water, run-off problems that include using permeable pavement, rain garden and wetlands construction to steer away toxic runoff from the D.C. water bodies.So on Saturday, we will raise our voices to be heard on these important issues. The marches will last just a few hours but our burgeoning movement will not be defeated.Elsa Barboza is a senior organizer at the Center for Community Change, where she leads efforts to create clean energy jobs for low-income communities of color nationwide."
88,BLACK VOICES,Lessons Learned From LA’s 1992 Civil Unrest,"Mark Ridley-Thomas, ContributorChairman, Board of Supervisors, Los Angeles County",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lessons-learned-from-las-1992-civil-unrest_us_59023961e4b0768c2682e423,"“A riot is the language of the unheard,” Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said. On April 29, 1992, the unheard were unleashed",2017-04-27,<p>A building burns in South LA at the height of the 1992 Civil Unrest </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59023cf82600001700c48172.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“A riot is the language of the unheard,” Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said. On April 29, 1992, the unheard were unleashed, leading to one of the most disturbing chapters in the history of Los Angeles. When the civil unrest over the verdict in the Rodney King case ended five days later, the toll included 54 people dead, 2,000 injured and 12,000 arrested. More than 1,000 buildings were set ablaze and 4,500 looted, resulting in over $1 billion in property damage. As a newly elected member of the City Council, I saw our recently renovated district office – a mini-City Hall – become a smoldering ruin.Even now, 25 years later, not all of the social and economic injustices that became kindling for “the unheard” have been snuffed out. And yet, I believe quite a lot has been done – just not enough. I call it strategic dissatisfaction.In 1992, 30 to 40 percent of the population in parts of South Central and Southeast LA lived below the poverty line. While the mean household income in the Westside approached $100,000, South Central and Southeast LA residents earned only about $25,000 and $22,000, respectively. That’s if they could find a job at all, with the unemployment rate at 13.7 percent and 17.4 percent in those neighborhoods, respectively, compared to 8.4 percent citywide.Watts was among the communities that struggled the most, with an unemployment rate of 26 percent and a household income of just $12,000, leaving almost half of its households reliant on some form of public assistance.Aside from crushing poverty and high unemployment, too many communities were also plagued by gang crime and a crack cocaine epidemic, along with indisputable racial and ethnic tensions. Back then, such areas were perceived as ominous. That is changing, and it’s a good thing.In recent years, South LA and the rest of LA County’s Second District have drawn tremendous public and private investment. This urban landscape, which once seemed to have a liquor store at every corner, now includes the $2-billion Crenshaw/LAX Line set for completion in 2019 and the new $1-billion Martin Luther King, Jr. Medical Campus in Willowbrook, poised for even further expansion.Still to come are the $2.6-billion National Football League stadium for the Rams and Chargers in Inglewood, as well as the $1-billion Lucas Museum of Narrative Art and the $350-million Major League Soccer stadium for the LA Football Club, both in Exposition Park. Meanwhile, the LA Memorial Coliseum, the Forum and Metro’s Willowbrook/Rosa Parks Station each set aside $270 million, $100 million and $66 million, respectively, for renovations. These and other projects in and around commercial centers targeted for destruction in 1992 have created thousands of jobs in recent years and will continue to do so. Residents are reaping the benefits of local worker hire policies, wage theft crackdowns, and increases in the minimum wage and living wage.All told, communities within LA County’s Second District have seen 5.5 percent employment growth over the last eight years, coinciding with a 20.13 percent increase in annual wages. If this trend continues, we should be able to chip away at the poverty rate, which, in South LA, has stubbornly refused to budge from about 33 percent since the time of the civil unrest. Homelessness remains at crisis levels but, for the first time ever, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just this March, voters made history by agreeing to tax themselves over a decade to provide unprecedented resources — $3.5 billion — for ending and preventing homelessness countywide. Measure H is the only revenue proposal ever attempted, much less approved, during an off-cycle election. It will go hand-in-hand with Proposition HHH, a $1.2-billion bond measure to build affordable housing in the city of LA.Even before voters approved either ballot measure, LA’s Second District saw 2,200 affordable housing units built over the last eight years, and 800 more are in the works. Increased government investment has also led to the construction or renovation of several parks, libraries and school-based health centers, though many more amenities are still needed.Law enforcement and policing remain problematic, though a number of reforms have been carried out over the decades. The LA Police Department has strived to increase diversity within its ranks to more closely resemble the city’s demographics, and has placed greater emphasis on community policing rather than being a militarized occupying force. The LA County Sheriff’s Department made similar changes and, for the first time, has both an Inspector General and a Civilian Oversight Commission looking over its shoulder.Despite these changes, complaints of racial profiling, excessive use of force, and other abuses have never gone away. These days, instead of Rodney King, we hear the names Ezell Ford and, elsewhere in the country, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and Sandra Bland, among others. The police shooting of Michael Brown triggered violent protests in the streets of Ferguson, Mo., as recently as three years ago.On April 29, 1992, the rage and anguish of a community that had long suffered injustice and neglect were finally laid bare. Against a fiery backdrop on primetime news, broadcast worldwide, they demanded social justice and economic progress. For a while, it seemed to have an effect – reforms were vowed, investments pledged, an uneasy truce declared.But, 25 years later, poverty still holds a firm grip on many in South LA, which has among the highest rates of homelessness in LA County. The streets are dotted with vacant lots where planned grocery stores, retail shops and restaurants never materialized. Meanwhile, after years of steady decline, violent crime is on the rise again in South LA, straining an already tenuous relationship between police officers and the community. We cannot afford to wait yet another quarter of a century before heeding the call of “the unheard.” On April 29, 2017, we are closer than ever to delivering on promises of jobs and community revitalization, and to ensuring that law enforcement is professional and accountable. We must seize this momentum and pick up the pace, if we are to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past as we chart a path for the future."

Unfortunately, that can make it harder for those who recognize that climate change is a legitimate threat to fully understand the science and impacts of rising global temperatures.I recently visited the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO and met with climate scientists Dr. Kevin Trenberth and CU Boulder’s Dr. Brian Toon to have a different discussion. I wanted better answers about what climate change is, what its effects could be, and how can we prepare for the future.The discussion that follows has been edited for clarity and brevity, and I’ve added occasional comments for context. You can also listen to the podcast here or read the full transcript here for more in-depth insight into these issues.Our discussion began with a review of the scientific evidence behind climate change.Trenberth: The main source of human-induced climate change is from increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And we have plenty of evidence that we’re responsible for the over 40 percent increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times, and more than half of that has occurred since 1980.Toon: I think the problem is that carbon dioxide is rising proportional to population on the Earth. If you just plot carbon dioxide in the last few decades versus global population, it tracks almost exactly. In coming decades, we’re increasing global population by a million people a week. That’s a new city in the world of a million people every week somewhere, and the amount of energy that’s already committed to supporting this increasing population is very large.The financial cost of climate change is also quite large.Trenberth: 2012 was the warmest year on record in the United States. There was a very widespread drought that occurred, starting here in Colorado, in the West. The drought itself was estimated to cost about $75 billion. Superstorm Sandy is a different example, and the damages associated with that are, again, estimated to be about $75 billion. At the moment, the cost of climate and weather related disasters is something like $40 billion a year.We discussed possible solutions to climate change, but while solutions exist, it was easy to get distracted by just how large – and deadly ― the problem truly is.Toon: Technologically, of course, there are lots of things we can do. Solar energy and wind energy are both approaching or passing the cost of fossil fuels, so they’re advantageous. [But] there’s other aspects of this like air pollution, for example, which comes from burning a lot of fossil fuels. It’s been estimated to kill seven million people a year around the Earth. Particularly in countries like China, it’s thought to be killing about a million people a year. Even in the United States, it’s causing probably 10,000 or more deaths a year.Unfortunately, Toon may be underestimating the number of U.S. deaths resulting from air pollution. A 2013 study out of MIT found that air pollution causes roughly 200,000 early deaths in the U.S. each year. And there’s still the general problem that carbon in the atmosphere (not the same as air pollution) really isn’t something that will go away anytime soon.Toon: Carbon dioxide has a very, very long lifetime. Early IPCC reports would often say carbon dioxide has a lifetime of 50 years. Some people interpreted that to mean it’ll go away in 50 years, but what it really meant was that it would go into equilibrium with the oceans in about 50 years. When you go somewhere in your car, about 20 percent of that carbon dioxide that is released to the atmosphere is still going to be there in thousands of years. The CO2 has lifetimes of thousands and thousands of years, maybe tens or hundreds of thousands of years. It’s not reversible.Trenberth: Every springtime, the trees take up carbon dioxide and there’s a draw-down of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but then, in the fall, the leaves fall on the forest floor and the twigs and branches and so on, and they decay and they put carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. People talk about growing more trees, which can certainly take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to some extent, but then what do you do with all the trees? That’s part of the issue. Maybe you can bury some of them somewhere, but it’s very difficult. It’s not a full solution to the problem.Toon: The average American uses the equivalent of about five tons of carbon a year – that’s an elephant or two. That means every year you have to go out in your backyard and bury an elephant or two.We know that climate change is expected to impact farming and sea levels. And we know that the temperature changes and increasing ocean acidification could cause many species to go extinct. But for the most part, scientists aren’t worried that climate change alone could cause the extinction of humanity. However, as a threat multiplier – that is, something that triggers other problems – climate change could lead to terrible famines, pandemics and war. And some of this may already be underway.Trenberth: You don’t actually have to go a hundred years or a thousand years into the future before things can get quite disrupted relative to today. You can see some signs of that if you look around the world now. There’s certainly studies that have suggested that the changes in climate, and the droughts that occur and the wildfires and so on are already extra stressors on the system and have exacerbated wars in Sudan and in Syria. It’s one of the things which makes it very worrying for security around the world to the defense department, to the armed services, who are very concerned about the destabilizing effects of climate change around the world. Some of the instabilities around the world today are already leading to discussion about the possibility of using nuclear weapons. But too many nuclear weapons could trigger the “other” climate change: nuclear winter.Toon: Nuclear winter is caused by burning cities. If there were a nuclear war in which cities were attacked then the smoke that’s released from all those fires can go into the stratosphere and create a veil of soot particles in the upper atmosphere, which are very good at absorbing sunlight. It’s sort of like geo-engineering in that sense; it reduces the temperature of the planet. Even a little war between India and Pakistan, for example ― which, incidentally, have about 400 nuclear weapons between them at the moment ― if they started attacking each other’s cities, the smoke from that could drop the temperature of the Earth back to preindustrial conditions. In fact, it’d be lower than anything we’ve seen in the climate record since the end of the last ice age, which would be devastating to mid-latitude agriculture.This is an issue people don’t really understand: the world food storage is only about 60 days. There’s not enough food on that planet to feed the population for more than 60 days. There’s only enough food in an average city to feed the city for about a week. That’s the same kind of issue that we’re coming to also with the changes in agriculture that we might face in the next century just from global warming. You have to be able to make up those food losses by shipping food from some other place. Adjusting to that takes a long time.Concern about our ability to adjust was a common theme. Climate change is occurring so rapidly that it will be difficult for all species, even people, to adapt quickly enough.Trenberth: We’re way behind in terms of what is needed because if you start really trying to take serious action on this, there’s a built-in delay of 20 or 30 years because of the infrastructure that you have in order to change that around. Then there’s another 20-year delay because the oceans respond very, very slowly. If you start making major changes now, you end up experiencing the effects of those changes maybe 40 years from now or something like that. You’ve really got to get ahead of this.The atmosphere is a global commons. It belongs to everyone. The air that’s over the US, a week later is over in Europe, and a week later it’s over China, and then a week later it’s back over the U.S. again. If we dump stuff into the atmosphere, it gets shared among all of the nations.Toon: Organisms are used to evolving and compensating for things, but not on a 40-year timescale. They’re used to slowly evolving and slowly responding to the environment, and here they’re being forced to respond very quickly. That’s an extinction problem. If you make a sudden change in the environment, you can cause extinctions.As dire as the situation might seem, there are still ways in which we can address climate change.Toon: I’m hopeful, at the local level, things will happen, I’m hopeful that money will be made out of converting to other energy systems, and that those things will move us forward despite the inability, apparently, of politicians to deal with things.Trenberth: The real way of doing this is probably to create other kinds of incentives such as through a carbon tax, as often referred to, or a fee on carbon of some sort, which recognizes the downstream effects of burning coal both in terms of air pollution and in terms of climate change that’s currently not built into the cost of burning coal, and it really ought to be.Toon: [There] is not really a question anymore about whether climate change is occurring or not. It certainly is occurring. However, how do you respond to that? What do you do? At least in the United States, it’s very clear that we’re a capitalistic society, and so we need to make it economically advantageous to develop these new energy technologies. I suspect that we’re going to see the rise of China and Asia in developing renewable energy and selling that throughout the world for the reason that it’s cheaper and they’ll make money out of it. [And] we’ll wake up behind the curve."

But too many nuclear weapons could trigger the “other” climate change: nuclear winter.Toon: Nuclear winter is caused by burning cities. If there were a nuclear war in which cities were attacked then the smoke that’s released from all those fires can go into the stratosphere and create a veil of soot particles in the upper atmosphere, which are very good at absorbing sunlight. It’s sort of like geo-engineering in that sense; it reduces the temperature of the planet. Even a little war between India and Pakistan, for example ― which, incidentally, have about 400 nuclear weapons between them at the moment ― if they started attacking each other’s cities, the smoke from that could drop the temperature of the Earth back to preindustrial conditions. In fact, it’d be lower than anything we’ve seen in the climate record since the end of the last ice age, which would be devastating to mid-latitude agriculture.This is an issue people don’t really understand: the world food storage is only about 60 days. There’s not enough food on that planet to feed the population for more than 60 days. There’s only enough food in an average city to feed the city for about a week. That’s the same kind of issue that we’re coming to also with the changes in agriculture that we might face in the next century just from global warming. You have to be able to make up those food losses by shipping food from some other place. Adjusting to that takes a long time.Concern about our ability to adjust was a common theme. Climate change is occurring so rapidly that it will be difficult for all species, even people, to adapt quickly enough.Trenberth: We’re way behind in terms of what is needed because if you start really trying to take serious action on this, there’s a built-in delay of 20 or 30 years because of the infrastructure that you have in order to change that around. Then there’s another 20-year delay because the oceans respond very, very slowly. If you start making major changes now, you end up experiencing the effects of those changes maybe 40 years from now or something like that. You’ve really got to get ahead of this.The atmosphere is a global commons. It belongs to everyone. The air that’s over the US, a week later is over in Europe, and a week later it’s over China, and then a week later it’s back over the U.S. again. If we dump stuff into the atmosphere, it gets shared among all of the nations.Toon: Organisms are used to evolving and compensating for things, but not on a 40-year timescale. They’re used to slowly evolving and slowly responding to the environment, and here they’re being forced to respond very quickly. That’s an extinction problem. If you make a sudden change in the environment, you can cause extinctions.As dire as the situation might seem, there are still ways in which we can address climate change.Toon: I’m hopeful, at the local level, things will happen, I’m hopeful that money will be made out of converting to other energy systems, and that those things will move us forward despite the inability, apparently, of politicians to deal with things.Trenberth: The real way of doing this is probably to create other kinds of incentives such as through a carbon tax, as often referred to, or a fee on carbon of some sort, which recognizes the downstream effects of burning coal both in terms of air pollution and in terms of climate change that’s currently not built into the cost of burning coal, and it really ought to be.Toon: [There] is not really a question anymore about whether climate change is occurring or not. It certainly is occurring. However, how do you respond to that? What do you do? At least in the United States, it’s very clear that we’re a capitalistic society, and so we need to make it economically advantageous to develop these new energy technologies. I suspect that we’re going to see the rise of China and Asia in developing renewable energy and selling that throughout the world for the reason that it’s cheaper and they’ll make money out of it. [And] we’ll wake up behind the curve."
