She then fell to the floor, spitting out some pancake bits, according to the Fairfield Citizen.“She starts to choke on pancake and someone recognized it ― one of the nursing students at the competition ― and she caught her and brought her slowly to the ground,” Fairfield Police Lt. Robert Kalamaras told the New York Post. “And then she began CPR, basic life support, until officers showed up less than two minutes after the emergency call was made by one of the nursing students.”Nelson, who hailed from Clark, New Jersey, was taken to St. Vincent’s Medical Center in Bridgeport and subsequently transferred to Columbia University Medical Center in New York, where she died on Sunday.Because Nelson had several food allergies, it was initially thought they might have played a factor in her death, but it was ultimately determined that was not the case. “It was a tragic accident,” Kalamaras told TAPinto.net.The young woman’s father, James Nelson, was a Port Authority police officer who died in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. He was 40 years old at the time. She was 5, according to the Connecticut Post.Sacred Heart University held a candlelight vigil for Nelson on Sunday night.David Moye covers viral stories. Tips?

She also encouraged other moms to embrace their way of parenting. “If you’re confident with what you’re doing even if that’s some weird, bizarre parenting technique that you know works for your kid or you feel happy about, do it!” she said. “Don’t let anyone tell you you shouldn’t be doing that.” The mom of two had similar advice earlier this year, when she told Babble she won’t let others make her feel embarrassed when her kids have a tantrum in public because they’re simply being kids.“That shouldn’t make me feel ashamed or embarrassed in any way,” she said. “Only you can make you feel a certain way.”While chatting with CafeMom, Bell discussed breastfeeding and why the idea of being uncomfortable with mothers feeding their children is “comical” to her. When she breastfed her daughters, she was concerned about them, not where she was nursing.“If you’re aroused by that, I think it’s safe to say that’s your problem and not mine,” she said. “If it makes you uncomfortable, it’s your responsibility to move away, not mine to cover up.”The actress also had an important reminder for overwhelmed moms who push their well-being to the wayside to focus on their kids: “Know when to take a break.”Read more of Bell’s interview at CafeMom.

They don’t have depth.

To that notion, the Academy Award nominated-director says his ultimate goal in developing the series was as a result of what he describes as a void in the displaying of heroic black women on television.“Rebel is a character that you follow and see what she does, and how she emotionally handles things,” Singleton told HuffPost. “We haven’t seen a heroic black woman [on television] in a very long time. And I just felt like, let me just try to make it real, but at the same time make it a heroic film character, but make it real. There’s a whole other thing to Rebel, when you talk about what the experience of black women in America is.”“She’s an army veteran, and she’s a detective and then things happen and then she ends up not wanting to be a part of this whole system that she’s already been a part of. So it’s a different element for a character, because it’s one thing to be a rebel and not really be a part of the system, but to be apart of the system and then rebel against it is a whole other thing.”Prior to her most recent multi-dimensional role on a network series, Truitt was active in addressing the misuse of police force by producing an open discussion and performance event called #MoreThanAHashtag.In the future she plans to amplify her influence around issues affecting the African American community by pursuing additional progressive roles, as well as developing a forthcoming film titled, “Unsound” ― which chronicles a woman suffering from mental issues and multiple personality disorder.“I wanna make characters that are real and that people can really connect with,” she said. “And it’s not always about, black people looking good – to me that is not going to do us any good in the world, because the truth of the matter is, everyone is flawed and going through stuff. And that is what people connect to. People don’t connect to your perfection, they connect to the drama because we all have it prevalent in our lives.”She went on to add, “I just wanna bring forth characters that are fully developed and I do wanna talk about issues that are kind’ve shied away from, and then also stories that uplift.”“Rebel” airs Tuesday’s at 10pm/9pmC on BET."

Tom Carper says Scott Pruitt provided nothing to justify his decision.,2017-04-03,Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) speaks during a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee confirmation hearing in January.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e29ddf16000021004d8782.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) has requested all documents related to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt’s decision to go against the scientific recommendation of his own agency and refuse to ban a widely used pesticide that’s been linked to learning disabilities in children.In a Friday letter to Pruitt, Carper, a ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said he is “troubled” by the agency chief’s order to allow chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide that’s been used since the 1960s, to remain on the market for agricultural use. Pruitt “did not present any new scientific or legal analysis” to justify the decision, Carper noted.“The previous finding to ban chlorpyrifos was based on extensive data, models and research developed by industry, government and academic scientists,” Carper wrote. “Absent such justification, this decision to lift the proposed ban could undermine the trust the public has in the agency to keep its food, water and air safe.”In November 2015, under the Obama administration, the EPA proposed to permanently ban the use of the chemical on food crops, citing potential risks to human health. The move stemmed from a 2007 petition filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network North America.In announcing his reversal, Pruitt said the proposed ban relied largely on studies “whose application is novel and uncertain.” He claimed that his decision was about “returning to using sound science in decision-making — rather than predetermined results.”Critics quickly condemned Pruitt and President Donald Trump, accusing them of valuing corporate profits over public health. And environmental groups, including NRDC and Earthjustice, promised to fight the EPA in court.Chlorpyrifos, also known by its trade name Lorsban, is used in nearly 100 countries on more than 50 different crops, including corn, soybeans, cranberries and broccoli. It was largely banned for at-home use in the U.S. in 2000, but continues to be widely used on thousands of American farms. Dow Chemical Co., the chemical’s producer, says it “remains confident that authorized uses of chlorpyrifos products offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety.” However, even low-dose exposure to organophosphates, particularly in the womb, has been found to harm brain development in children, leading to higher risk of disorders like autism.The Washington Post reported Friday that a new EPA plan calls for laying off 25 percent of the federal agency’s staff and eliminating dozens of programs, including pesticide safety.Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, is a longtime critic of the EPA who denies the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. A recent email dump revealed his close relationship with the oil, gas and utility companies he’s now tasked with regulating. Carper has asked the agency to provide him with copies of all documents and communications related to Pruitt’s decision on chlorpyrifos by April 28. You can read Carper’s full letter here."

They were quickly taken down. The early alerts from the generally pro-Trump Post, which is owned by Trump pal Rupert Murdoch, praised the president. The later messages warned that there was still time to repent before the “fate” of “your soul” was decided (”salvation remains within reach”).“Hear me now, for I speak as an angel in the words of God,” read one of the alerts. “In casting truth into the darkness of your shadow, you have gravely sinned.”Another urged: “Open your heart to those you do not understand and listen to all those you fear and look down upon.”Still another cautioned: “For the fate of your soul is soon to be decided.”One line — “Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, but don’t be late” — is from the 1991 Nirvana song “Come As You Are.”The messages appeared to be signed: “With Lucid Love, Selah.” The word selah is used dozens of times in the Hebrew Bible at the end of passages. It’s not entirely clear what it means; the word could be some kind of musical direction at the end of psalms or an exhortation to pay attention.The Post apologized to readers on Sunday, saying the account had been “compromised.”Trump did not respond to the alerts."

15,POLITICS,"Washington Won't Fix Obamacare Costs, So These States Are Doing It Themselves",Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-state-innovation-waivers_us_58e24e27e4b0ba3595966b33,Alaska and Minnesota are leading the way with big ideas.,2017-04-03,Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said Republicans and Democrats in his state agreed they needed to find health care solutions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e2bdc32c00006268ff2070.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Washington had its turn to remake the health care system when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act seven years ago, and again this year when the effort by President Donald Trump and the GOP Congress to repeal and replace the law collapsed. Now, it may be up to the states to finish the job.Large premium increases and diminishing choice among insurers are a real problem in some states’ Obamacare markets. Alaska and Minnesota, which suffered among the biggest premium increases this year, are at the forefront in trying to find solutions.And the Affordable Care Act itself can help them obtain federal funding for those new ideas.“Our market got skewered last summer,” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D) said in an interview Friday. “I don’t know how political leaders in other states handle that, but in Minnesota, I think we pretty much ― Republicans and Democrats ― agreed we needed to respond.”On Monday, Minnesota became the second state, after Alaska, to establish a special fund that reimburses health insurers hit with extraordinarily high costs because of a small number of very sick policyholders. Alaska set up its two-year, $55 million “reinsurance” program using state funding in 2016. The happy result: What was expected to be an average 42 percent rate hike for Alaska’s individual insurance market this year turned into a 7 percent increase.Minnesota is hoping to replicate that success with a $542 million program to backstop insurance company expenses. Because of looming rate hikes, the North Star State had already provided relief to people who buy their health insurance plans directly from insurers or use the state’s exchange, MNSure, in the form of rebates financed with $326 million in state money.Other states could look to these models as ways to shore up their health insurance markets in the face of high prices for unsubsidized policies sold on HealthCare.gov, state-run marketplaces like MNSure and directly from insurers or through brokers.The health of Affordable Care Act markets varies greatly from state to state. Those with large rural areas, like Alaska and Minnesota, tend to have bigger problems, largely because the cost of providing health care in remote regions is higher and the potential scale of insurance markets there is smaller and less attractive to insurance companies.“Alaskans want every medical service that you would expect to get in a large city, and to provide that to a small population, it’s expensive,” said Lori Wing-Heier, director of the Alaska Division of Insurance.The Affordable Care Act has an option that allows states to try new ideas while receiving federal money to make them happen. If a state can devise another way to provide comparable health coverage to the same number of people as the Affordable Care Act does, it can apply for federal permission to do so. So-called state innovation waivers, also dubbed Section 1332 waivers after the part of the statute that authorizes them, run five years.States across the nation are weighing whether to use these waivers, which first became available this year, to customize Obamacare for their residents. Alaska submitted its application in late 2016 to transition its state-funded reinsurance program into one that receives federal money, and Minnesota plans to do the same. What’s more, despite Trump’s continued commitment to eliminating the Affordable Care Act itself and his veiled threats to undermine the law, his administration is encouraging states to apply for innovation waivers.“We are seeking to empower states with new opportunities that will strengthen their health insurance markets,” Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price wrote to governors on March 13. “We welcome the opportunity to work with states on Section 1332 State Innovation Waivers,” he wrote, specifically highlighting Alaska’s efforts as a blueprint for others.“It will spread,” Wing-Heier said. “When Secretary Price issued his letter encouraging people to apply, I think people had to at least give it serious thought.”The Alaska and Minnesota model works like this: States authorize funding to set up reinsurance programs, which reimburse certain costs to insurers. Those costs are thereby moved off the insurers’ books, meaning they aren’t factored into the following year’s rate increases, which in turn reduces rate hikes and makes coverage more affordable for all customers.Lower premiums also mean less federal spending goes to health insurance subsidies. So the Section 1332 waivers would allow states to finance their reinsurance pools by tapping into that money that would’ve otherwise been spent on subsidies.Price specifically urged states to consider their own reinsurance programs or to set up high-risk pools for the costliest enrollees. The Affordable Care Act had offered a national reinsurance program, but it expired last year.Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, a Republican-turned-independent, and the state’s GOP-led legislature acted swiftly last year when Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska requested a large rate increase and Moda Health announced it was leaving the state’s individual insurance market. The state instituted its two-year reinsurance plan and now hopes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will approve its waiver request, which would extend the program through 2021.“We expect that it will be approved by Secretary Price,” Wing-Heier said. In January, then-HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell wrote the governor that the preliminary assessment indicated Alaska’s request would be granted.Dayton, Minnesota’s governor, said his administration has been in talks with federal officials about a waiver and could submit the documentation as soon as this week. “The timing is very crucial,” he said. Insurers have to submit their rate increase requests for next year in less than three months.Still, Dayton had several serious misgivings about the legislation, approved by Minnesota’s majority-Republican legislature last week, to establish the reinsurance program. On Monday, he notified lawmakers that he wouldn’t veto the bill but would allow it to become law without his signature.The Minnesota program doesn’t require insurance companies to pass along their savings from reinsurance payments by lowering premium increases for customers or to remain in the state’s individual insurance market, Dayton said.“Given the amount of money it was going to cost the state treasury, I thought ― not just myself ― I thought all Minnesotans were entitled to answers and assurances,” he said.The governor wrote letters to the four relevant insurers last month seeking such promises. “I did not receive a single reply from a single one of the insurance companies to whom I sent that, which I find shocking that they would not even have the decency to respond,” he said.Dayton also wanted to turn the MinnesotaCare program, which is currently available to lower-income people who earn too much for Medicaid coverage, into a state-based public option that anyone could choose to buy into. The legislature rejected the idea.Looking beyond the Alaska and Minnesota programs, states can use innovation waivers to transform their health care markets in other ways, nudging them in more conservative or liberal directions.The most ambitious potential waiver request might have come from Vermont, which planned to use the tool to implement a single-payer system. But the state abandoned the effort in 2014 when policymakers couldn’t agree on how to finance such a system. The federal government has already approved Hawaii’s waiver to make smaller tweaks to its insurance market to align with previous state laws, and California has applied for permission to enroll undocumented immigrants on its state exchange, Covered California.In Oklahoma, the state government is weighing a sweeping array of reforms to its troubled health insurance market that would utilize the innovation waivers, according to a 65-page outline published last month. Among other things, Oklahoma may abandon the federal HealthCare.gov platform for a state-based enrollment system, simplify health insurance benefit design, and provide subsidies to lower-income households while cutting them off for some middle-income people.The Trump administration has a strong incentive to work with states that want to find their own solutions to insurance costs and competition. Unless the White House really expects to score political points by allowing the Obamacare markets to suffer through inaction or sabotage, these waivers provide an opportunity to help ordinary Americans without congressional action or additional funding."

17,EDUCATION,"In Africa, For-Profit School Chain Plays Legal Hardball","Alan Singer, ContributorSocial studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of c...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-africa-for-profit-school-chain-plays-legal-hardball_us_58e223bfe4b0ca889ba1a7bc,"When money is involved, big business gets mean. In Kenya, a multi-national for-profit private school company is using threats",2017-04-03,<p>Do private for-profit schools address the needs of Kenyan children?</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e224d72c00003c00ff1df3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When money is involved, big business gets mean. In Kenya, a multi-national for-profit private school company is using threats of lawsuits against teacher unionists and dissidents to protect their profits.Bridge International Academies claims to be the “world’s largest chain of nursery and primary schools bringing world-class education to families living below the international $2-a-day poverty line.” A U.S. company founded in 2007, Bridge operates more than 400 private for-profit “academies” in east and West Africa and is trying to expand into India. The Wall Street Journal reports that Gates, Zuckerberg, and Pearson have made more than a $100 million investment in Bridge. The company is also funded by World Bank’s private sector lending arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC).The secret behind Bridge’s ability to delivery cheap education in Third World countries appears to be cheap education designed for the Third World. In Bridge International Academies teachers are no longer teachers, but classroom managers who deliver scripted instruction. Many barely have high school educations themselves. They are tracked by academy managers who submit data on student and teacher performance to headquarters in Nairobi and Massachusetts. The school buildings are also built on the cheap with corrugated metal sides and roofs.Bridge is now adding legal intimidation to its business plan. Lawyers for the for-profit chain secured a temporary court order preventing Wilson Sossion, General Secretary of the Kenyan National Union of Teachers (KNUT), and the union or its “agents,” from publicly criticizing Bridge “pending” a court hearing. Bridge accuses Sossion of putting a “malicious post on twitter about the institution.” Sosson accused Bridge of recruiting the “richest of the poor at great cost of those families.”Bridge is pushing hard in Kenya because last year its Uganda schools were shut by the Government because of the companies disregard for Ugandan legal and educational requirements. More than 80 percent of Bridge teaching staff in Uganda were not qualified. According to Education International, in Kenya more than 70% of Bridge teachers are unqualified. One teacher told researchers, “We do not plan any lesson. We follow the tablets to the letter. We are robots being directed by tablets.” The corporate take-over and privatization of education in sub-Sahara Africa has been sharply criticized by United Nations officials and advocates for investment in public education. In a 2015 statement, 190 education advocates from 91 countries, called on governments in the under-developed/mis-developed world to stop education profiteers and the World Bank to stop financing these efforts.The United Nations proclaims education as a fundamental human right. Its committees on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Rights of the Child, and on the Elimination of all Forms of Discriminations against Women all warn against the impact of the unregulated privatization on education in Third World countries. In Chile privatization contributes to increased class stratification and ethnic segregation. In Nepal courts held exorbitant private school fees responsible for expanded social inequality. In India, Pakistan, and Uganda girls are victimized as families use limited resources to educate sons. In France, the Minister in charge of development aid recently declared, “France will act against any attempt at commercialisation of education.” France considers education a “public service” and a “common good that cannot be traded.”In a revealing video on the Fortune website, Pearson CEO John Fallon described how Pearson, working with Save the Children, aids Syrian refugees in Jordan. But Fallon also added how the he also saw “business opportunities” in the project. Do refugee children deserve food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and education if their hardship doesn’t provide Pearson and other for-profit companies with “business opportunities”?And if you don’t care about education in Third World countries, you still need to worry about what is going on in the United States. Donald Trump is threatening a campaign to rewrite libel law to make it easier to sue and silence critics of his regime.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8 "
18,QUEER VOICES,'Get That Monster Out Of The White House!' Larry Kramer Electrifies Gatherings In NY And Fla.,"Lawrence D. Mass, M.D. , ContributorPhysician and Writer, Co-founder of Gay Men's Health Crisis an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/get-that-monster-out-of-the-white-house-larry-kramer_us_58dd0195e4b04ba4a5e25115,Larry Kramer himself is now upping the ante.,2017-04-03,David France (left) and Larry Kramer (right) at GMHC’s 35th Anniversary Gala.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd1fbf14000029000725ce.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Much has been written about the early breakup of Larry Kramer and GMHC, most notably by Kramer himself in his celebrated play and film, The Normal Heart, but also by me in my Larry Kramer anthology, We Must Love One Another or Die, and more recently by David France in his history of AIDS, How To Survive A Plague. The crux of the play is that the greater activism Kramer was pushing for was rejected by GMHC’s other co-founders in favor of thinking and acting inside the box. The apposing view is that Kramer wanted GMHC to become a lot more like the organization he then went on to found, ACT UP, a transformation that felt too drastic for the fledgling information, education and service organization that GMHC was in those early pre-gay-civil-rights years. Should GMHC have become more like ACT UP?While the answer to that has seemed to be that we were all better off for having both organizations, Larry Kramer himself is now upping the ante. Two years ago, working with current GMHC CEO Kelsey Louie, Kramer re-emerged as a major presence at GMHC, after years of estrangement and disparagement of the organization in the wake of his earlier ouster-resignation. That night, May 24, 2015, to an enthusiastic and prolonged ovation, Kramer became the first recipient of the new Larry Kramer Activism Award. Although frail and with limited vocal strength, Kramer not only accepted the award with a rousing speech, but stayed for the full 5 hour length of the event.The evening crackled with new energies, likewise on display the following year when Mary Fisher received the Larry Kramer Activism Award for her brave speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention, where she came out as a person with AIDS and exhorted the Republican leadership to begin dealing with AIDS more forthrightly, robustly and humanely.This year, as GMHC marked its 35th anniversary, these energies were even more palpable. Kramer was a tough critic of GMHC’s move to its current location, just north of the High Line, when the area was an even worse nightmare of construction obstacles, and much harder to get to and navigate. But all that seemed to fade in the excitement of being in the epicenter of what is now indisputably Manhattan’s hottest neighborhood. The High Line is an explosion of cultural and real estate development that seems to boast every big name in art, design, fashion, architecture, culture and real estate, except one: Donald Trump.Louie began the proceedings by affirming GMHC’s proud history as a leading provider of supportive services, which are now expanding to include substance abuse treatment, mental health resources and housing. Paying tribute to Larry Kramer, he then noted that in the current governmental and humanitarian crisis looming under the Trump presidency, which has proposed massive cuts in AIDS funding, GMHC will need to become much more activist. At this juncture of the Trump onslaught, no one could disagree with him.Larry Kramer is legendary for not mincing words. He never did. He still doesn’t. At 82, and with some physical and vocal weakness, he is still exactly the same passionate, galvanizing firebrand he always was. Since that GMHC 33rd anniversary gala, there have been several notable appearances by Kramer, including a recent historic visit to South Florida as well as the 35th Anniversary Gala. In both situations, sell-out crowds hung on every word. On both occasions, the atmosphere was electric. What everybody was responding to so strongly was not only Larry Kramer, the great gay and AIDS activist hero, but Kramer in his role as visionary and leader as we once again face a terrifying, potentially overwhelming life-and-death crisis—i.e., the Trump presidency.Alas, though a part-time South Floridian myself, I was not at the Fort Lauderdale-Wilton Manors events, but I heard about them from multiple sources. The stretch of coast between Palm Beach and Miami Beach is called South Florida and boasts one of the largest gay communities in the world. Halfway between Trump’s Palm Beach compound Mar-A-Lago and the South Beach stretch of Miami Beach is Sunny Isles Beach, where more properties boast the Trump logo than any other trademark. Many of the residences here have been bought up by wealthy Russian investors, hence the eponym for that area, “Little Moscow.” Apart from bigger questions of the relationships between Russia and Team Trump, aren’t these buyers worried about the beachfront erosion from global warming that is already causing frequent and ever-worsening flooding? I don’t think you’re any more likely to find that detail in Trump property brochures than you are likely to find Trump promoting initiatives for climate control.During his recent visit to Florida, and on the eve of ACT UP’s 30th anniversary, Kramer paid tribute to the landmark World AIDS Museum and Education Center that was established in Wilton Manors in 2011. In the course of several events, he signed copies of Volume 1 of his magnum opus, The American People, was interviewed by Vanity Fair’s Kevin Sessums, author of Mississippi Sissy, and showcased by the Gay Men’s Chorus. Holding up ACT UP’s new t-shirt that reads: “I Can’t Believe I Still Have to Protest This Fucking Shit”, he reminded us that “We have to be seen and shove it in their fucking faces!”Not surprisingly, activism was the GMHC 35th anniversary Gala’s keynote and theme. After Louie presented the first award to corporate and financial leader, Barclay’s CEO Jes Staley, his brother Peter Staley was given this year’s Larry Kramer Activism award, presented both by Kramer and David France, whose book on the history of AIDS I’ve recently commented on (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/58c92b90e4b0009b23bd948e). Staley is the celebrated ACT UP activist showcased by France, first in his 2012 documentary film, How To Survive a Plague, and now in the book with that same title. Notwithstanding some bruising observations about Kramer’s role in ACT UP reprising personality-centered confrontations with GMHC, France’s great respect for Kramer’s surpassing role as the august figure of AIDS activism was palpable, just as I trust my own is, even after comparing (in my commentary on Plague) Kramer’s penchant for confrontation with that of Donald Trump!Staley’s self-taught knowledge of pharma, business acumen, gay pride and street activist savvy—inspired by and occasionally in some conflict with the strategies of his acknowledged “activist father” Kramer—has resulted in the saved lives of countless millions. As France noted, the superlatives may have been exhausted, but the wonder and gratitude just keep growing. Staley graciously accepted the award, but with characteristic generosity, insisting it be on behalf of all those in ACT UP and activism, and with special appreciation for younger activists.President Bill Clinton was to have received an award for his tireless, not forgotten efforts on behalf of AIDS globally. On short notice, he left to attend the funeral of Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinniss with whom he’d worked closely to broker peace in Northern Ireland. In his place, daughter Chelsea Clinton spoke from the heart (no notes) about her family’s commitment to the LGBT and AIDS communities. Honestly confronting her father’s early, much-resented endorsement of DOMA, she noted how he subsequently committed himself not only to acknowledging what a mistake that was (in an Op Ed piece he wrote for the Washington Post), but committing himself to a wide range of initiatives in support of LGBT rights, the gay community, and AIDS globally. I’d no idea she was such a confident and effective public speaker.Concluding the evening was the Larry Kramer of legend—of hope and courage in the face of crisis. He had written an open letter to President Bill Clinton that he had planned to read before the gathering, which was to have included Clinton. Kramer called on Clinton and former Presidents Carter and Obama to join any other past presidents willing to take a much stronger public stand in new efforts to “GET THAT MONSTER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE!” This was vintage Kramer, asking more than what might seem reasonable from people who are otherwise friends and allies in circumstances that might seem questionable. Putting people on the spot. Making demands. Denouncing enemies in the strongest terms. Demanding activism from all of us, NOW! As the evening’s special guest star Billy Porter, fresh from his triumph in Kinky Boots and on the eve of a new blues album, put it, “We’re galvanized again!”"
19,ENTERTAINMENT,Ghost In The Shell:  This Cyborg Gets Closure,"Julie Wosk, ContributorProfessor and author of  MY FAIR LADIES: FEMALE ROBOTS, ANDROI...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ghost-in-the-shell-this-cyborg-has-soul_us_58e232f7e4b03c2b30f6a83c,"In the opening sequences of Rupert Sanders’ new film Ghost in the Shell, a woman lying on a lab gurney gasps for air as a",2017-04-03,"<p>Scarlett Johansson as Major, Paramount Pictures</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e233382c00002500ff1e09.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the opening sequences of Rupert Sanders’ new film Ghost in the Shell, a woman lying on a lab gurney gasps for air as a reassuring voice tells her, “Just breathe!” This is the birth of a female cyborg (played by Scarlett Johansson), a hybrid creature with a synthetic shell of a body, a human brain, and a “ghost” or soul.Her birth ― with her floating nude figure covered in dripping white liquid — has echoes of the acclaimed 1995 anime version of Ghost in the Shell directed by Mamoru Oshii based on the manga by Masamune Shirow. Both film versions are long way from the dramatic creation of the robot Maria in Fritz Lang’s iconic 1927 silent film Metropolis with its flashing electricity and floating rings or the creation of a companion for the Monster in James Whale’s now campy 1935 film Bride of Frankenstein where the bride’s bandages are dramatically unwrapped and Henry Frankenstein cries out ecstatically, “She’s alive!”The birth scenes may be different but some of the main themes in these films and others, including Blade Runner and Ex Machina, are very much the same. When human beings are artificially created using technology, what happens to our notions of human identity? What is the nature of these new creatures that blur the distinction between the artificial and the real? What does it feel like to be a robot or synthetic creature?Major, the cyborg woman also known as Mira Killian in the new Sanders film, was designed as an anti-terrorist agent in Section 9, and is tormented about the nature of her own identity. She looks at herself, stares at her damaged hand with its exposed mechanical innards, curiously touches the face of a human woman, and hunts up information about her own mysterious origins.Scarlett Johansson has a tough assignment: she has to put her own stamp on the role of this simulated woman who is both powerful and vulnerable. In the film, she mostly displays a kind of stoicism, aside from an occasional small smile when Batou says he has her pegged as a cat person rather than a dog person, and she rarely shows even a flicker of emotion other than fierce intensity in the film’s many fight scenes. More memorable are the anguished cries of “Help me!” by the gynoids in the original 1995 film’s follow up, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004) where the captured girls groomed to be sex slaves turn murderous before self-destructing. Still, Johansson brings to the role her signature ability to be both blunt and enigmatic so that we imagine her to have hidden sensitivities we do not see.Mira/Major does make some poignant admissions, but usually with a poker face. When Dr. Ouelet (played by Juliette Binoche) warns her, “You’re not invulnerable. I can’t protect you,” and also tells her, “You’re what everyone will become one day,” Major says, “You don’t know how alone that makes me feel.” ( In the 1995 film, after diving down deep into water, she says a little more: “I feel fear, cold, alone,” and adds that sometimes, “I even feel hope.” )As an actress, Johansson has had her own identity issues with this film. She’s had to deal with the fact that the film’s creators have been roundly criticized for not casting an Asian actress in Major’s role. She’s also had to deal with the paradoxes of playing the role of a robot: How do you convey that you are artificial yet also show some signs of humanity? How do you show a sense of individuality when you are an imitation of a real human being? (Adding a surreal twist , a British man in 2016 created his own robot double of Johansson herself.)Like the birth scenes, Sanders’ Ghost in the Shell is haunted by other ghosts of films past. The film’s CG images of a futuristic city have echoes of earlier cinematic sci-fi cities seen in Metropolis  and Blade Runner’s Off-World Colony set in 2019. But what works specially well in the new film are the mammoth holographs of female figures amidst the high rises ― towering females and mannequins that may be advertisements and eerie, spectral reminders of this highly synthetic world.Another ghost is the theme of technology and its worrisome impacts. In the 1995 Ghost in the Shell, a blonde-haired robotic woman lying on a lab table utters ominously, in a male voice, “Humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization” (the “woman” is actually the menacing Puppet Master in the film). Ghost in the Shell 2017 reminds us once again that in our increasingly digital universe dominated by computer code, humanity itself is under siege.The film — with its explosions and violence, its menacing spider tank, its futuristic urban scenes, its meditations on technology — does not open up much new territory. But near the end it becomes surprisingly effective when Major meets and later, embraces the woman who may be her original mother (movingly played by Japanese actress Kaori Momoi). It is at this moment where she comes closer to discovering who she once was and it may give her some closure and peace.Near the end she seems to finally cast off her uncertainty. When she again says, “My name is Major and I give my consent,” she really seems to have agency. Likewise, she is assured when she says fatalistically but firmly, “I know what I am and what I need to do.” Her identity as a cyborg with a soul may still remain problematic, but for her — and for now ― she has gained a sense of self."

Sicily is a striking example, with its cultural strata of ancient Greek, Arab, Norman, Spanish and French dominance. Another is Trieste, on the Adriatic Sea in the Friuli-Venezia-Giulia region adjacent to Slovenia. For us as tourists, one difference is that Sicily’s travails took place in the relatively distant past, while the political status of Trieste and its region wasn’t entirely settled until well after the Second World War, following millennia of Roman, Byzantine, Venetian and Austro-Hungarian rule. Politics apart, the city has long prided itself on being a diverse place where people of many origins and religions live together pretty much without the frictions that have been seen elsewhere.Our planning began, as it often does, with a search on the OperaBase website for performances at the early-nineteenth-century Teatro Verdi in Trieste and at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, a two-hour train ride away. We found one of each within a couple of days of each other: a production of Carmen in Venice and, in Trieste, a little show we’d never seen: Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari’s 1901 Il segreto di Susanna, a one-act comedy whose plot hinges on a young wife trying to hide her cigarette-smoking from her husband. It lasts only an hour, but that still counts as a charming new opera and a gorgeous new theater for us. (The performance was excellent, part of an interesting mini-season of one-act operas, with tickets at only €10 apiece.)An even bigger reason to go to Trieste (apart from the city itself) was the food. How can you not be curious about a city whose restaurants serve sparkling fresh seafood in dishes that recall nearby Venice and that also has a tradition rooted in Central European cooking, with lots of pork, sauerkraut and horseradish, as well as variations on goulash, dumplings and much else? There is also a café culture with Austrian and Hungarian-accented pastries, such as strudel, Sacher torte and the fruit and nut roll called a presnitz – and with its own coffee vocabulary, which has been usefully explained on the website SlowItaly.It’s impossible to grasp a city’s food in three days, especially when there is also intensive tourism to fill the day, but we did our best to cover a few of Trieste’s diverse styles of cooking: Venetian, Central European and modern (though not high-tech Modernist). We arrived in the evening, a little frayed from our journey by air from London then by train from Venice, so we started by having dinner in our hotel, the Savoia Excelsior Palace, a handsome, grand structure built in 1911 to the tastes of the Austrian Emperor, with broad views over the Gulf of Trieste. The ornate sea-facing façade is as it was, and some interior spaces, such as the ample and relaxing bar, retain elaborate plasterwork and gilding from before World War I, all beautifully spruced up. Other areas, along with the guest rooms, have been modernized in a sleek, clean way without trendy gimmicks; we liked the peaceful “library” lounge, sky-lit during the day and atmospherically dark at night. Trieste is not a huge city – we walked everywhere – but it was nice to be in such a central location, a minute’s amble from the vast main square, the Piazza Unità d’Italia.The hotel’s Savoy restaurant only sometimes serves what a Triestine grandmother might prepare for her family. Some of the cooking is more innovative than that, but the menu includes versions of many traditional local dishes, and even the more creative recipes have firm Adriatic foundations. We were happy to let the chef, Andrea Stoppari, put together a short sequence of his favorites. These included a terrific risotto with little matchsticks of squid – uncannily full of flavor and texture – and small long-stemmed artichokes. For a New Yorker, who will have to wait until the height of summer for such things to appear in the farmers’ market, seeing mountains of artichokes in the local shops induced moderate envy. In these parts, whipped-up reconstituted dried cod (baccalà mantecato) is traditionally served with polenta; Mr. Stoppari substituted lemony mashed potatoes. Was it better that way? Perhaps not, but the potatoes were a wholly successful alternative. The entire meal was delicious and was gracefully served in a tranquil though underpopulated dining room with picture windows looking out onto the sea (not that we could see it at night: the view was better at breakfast time). While offering some wines from beyond the region, the well-organized wine focuses on regional producers, well known and less so.Along with pastries (do not fail to taste the ones at Viezzoli), one of the more notable Middle European contributions to Trieste’s dining customs is the buffet. Here, a buffet is not a help-yourself steam table, but a place where meats – mainly pork, mostly cured and often smoked – are served with freshly grated horseradish, mustard, a side of sauerkraut and a dish of boiled potatoes crushed and pan-fried with bacon and onions: patate in tecia. A few years ago, a friend of mine wrote about the best-known of the Triestine buffets – Buffet da Pepi – and his story says it all. At least on your first visit, order a mixed platter of meats from the caldaia (literally cauldron); we were three at the table, and a portion for two was ample, so do the arithmetic and order accordingly. There are only a few wines that they immediately admit to, but if you tell the waiter that you have something more interesting in mind he will probably suggest some delightful wines made in the region, such as the white vitovska (an indigenous grape) produced by Sturman. Or you can drink beer, like many of the regulars (who are legion).On our final evening we walked ten minutes to Osteria l’Istriano, which had been recommended as a friendly, no-fuss neighborhood fish restaurant, which is exactly what it was: there were surely some non-Triestines there, but we were the only non-Italians. We ordered what pretty much everybody else did: a mixed plate of warm and cold seafood antipasti, followed by one portion of grilled seafood (sweet monkfish, shrimps and tiny cuttlefish) and one of fried (the breaded fish were sadly overcooked, but the more lightly fried shrimp and calamari were perfect, as was everything in the mixed grill). This might not have been the most interesting seafood option in town, but it provided a good slice of local life.There was a lot we missed, and in visiting Trieste we barely got a taste of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia and its food and wine.

Even now, here, we see people are being detained, provocateurs appear.”There were some 100 protesters in the center of Moscow, a significantly smaller group than at last week’s protests, reckoned to be the biggest since a wave of anti-Kremlin demonstrations in 2011/2012.The protests come a year before a presidential election in which Vladimir Putin is expected to run for a fourth term.“People have some questions and they have not been given any answers. And when people tried to speak out about it, detentions took place,” said Ksenia, another student from Novosibirsk.Before Sunday’s protests, Russian authorities had blocked access to several Internet pages promoting what the government said was “a planned illegal anti-government protest” in or near Moscow’s Red Square.The organizers of the rally say they are “young people and ordinary students from Moscow” and have nothing to do with Navalny, who is serving out a 15-day jail sentence for his role organizing the March 26 protests.Among the detainees on Sunday was 17-year old high-school student Roman Shingarkin, whose father is a former member of parliament who supports President Vladimir Putin, a witness said.An image of Shingarkin sitting on top of a lamp-post during last week’s rally became a David-and-Goliath style symbol of defiance."

During his interrogation, the custodian told police he believed his victims were out to kill him, said Zulfiqar Hameed, Regional Police Officer for Sargodha.“Waheed told police that he killed the people because they had tried to kill him by poisoning him in the past, and again they were there to kill him,” Hameed told Reuters.Reuters could not immediately find contact details for Waheed or any lawyer representing him.With its ancient hypnotic rituals, Sufism is a mystical form of Islam that has been practiced in Pakistan for centuries.But in recent months, Sufi shrines have been targeted by extremist Sunni militants who consider them heretics, including a suicide bombing by Islamic State that killed more than 80 worshippers at a shrine in Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine in southern Sindh province.Last November, an explosion ripped through another Sufi shrine, the Shah Noorani in southwestern Pakistan, killing at least 52 people. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for that attack."

The high school freshman had gone to the store and her mother became concerned when she did not return.The incident was among several in recent months in Chicago in which the social media site played a role in broadcasting apparent crimes.The shooting death in February on the city’s West Side of a 2-year-old boy was captured on Facebook Live by his aunt, who was also shot.

First, colleges and universities would be required to tell law enforcement about any report of campus sexual assault, or other felony, whether or not the survivor consented to that. Second, campus officials would be barred from or at least limited in conducting internal investigations. Third, accused students would be required to be provided with “due process” protections, something already required at state institutions by the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, that were undefined.While touted as a measure to protect public safety by requiring reporting to law enforcement, and to uphold the “due process” rights of the accused, survivors along with their advocates argued this bill would not accomplish these things because it would chill reporting. Under this arrangement accused students would be far more likely to benefit from never even facing campus discipline than from redundant, and at best vaguely defined procedural safeguards.“Survivors overwhelmingly tell us that, if they knew their school had to forward their sexual assault reports to the police, they would tell no one at all,” said eleven local, state, and national advocacy organizations in a joint letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee. “By discouraging survivors from telling anyone, the bill would result in fewer opportunities for administrators to hold wrongdoers accountable and remove those who pose a continuing threat to the campus community.”While the bill sailed through the state House relatively quickly, despite significant opposition by student activists, both Republicans and Democrats on the state Senate Judiciary Committee gave the measure its first serious review. Chairman Jesse Stone, a Republican, took the time to make sure all voices were heard, and gathered significant information on the subject as did other Committee members, notably Elena Parent a Democrat.The call to table the measure for the year was also bi-partisan. “This is truly a complicated matter,” said state Sen.

In the heat of this ongoing moment, the discussion itself becomes the topic, taking precedence over the artwork and the contexts in which the painting was created and presented.When considering a controversial artwork, whether one seeking to bait headlines or one subject to unpredicted reaction, sometimes it is best to locate and consider the merits of an opposite artwork. Finding an opposite artwork to contrast to this picture can bring the discussion back on the thing that will outlast all protests, actions, “takes”, socal media posts and the inevitable careerist symposia: the actual artwork. In this exercise, the wonder and potential liberation from the ordinary that art offers us can be better measured when the things that are absent in one artwork are achingly present in the other. Can the thesis survive an encounter with its antithesis?Imagine the riveting solo show by Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle “The Evanesced” at the California African American Museum as possibly the opposite artwork from Schutz’ “Open Casket”. Schutz, a white woman, has painted an abstracted version of an iconic image of black trauma that was a catalyst in propelling the civil rights movement forward. Hinkle, an African American woman, has painted expressionistic images of anonymous contemporary black women who have disappeared with many, it is feared, having been kidnapped and murdered. Hinkle paints the horror of not knowing a specific trauma yet knowing specfic trauma is being perpetuated. In a sensitive curation, CAAM’s deputy director Naima Keith places large, almost life-sized portraits of vanished women, leading us to a back wall hosting a seeming infinity of smaller, but no less intense, renderings of the same subject… the nameless, and here sometimes shapeless missing.Schutz has the comfort of sixty years separating her from the gruesome murder of Emmett Till and, as evinced by the title of her piece, investigates from the perspective of a mother (a point she reiterated in defending her picture to the attacks and protests it has engendered). The context of Dana Schutz’ race has been debated ad nauseum, but in contrast, as a black woman, Hinkle delivers the pictorial equivalent of the Phil Ochs ode, “There But For Fortune Go I”. If Schutz meant for her Till portrait to carry forth the image of that murder into a different medium - and the jeremiads about her motives in doing just this have been downright unfair and border on the self-serving - she cannot evade the scrutiny of having made a prop out of the whole Till epic.Painting’s capacity to mythologize is its conceptual strength, but with great strength comes great responsibility. One can see that the aim of the Schutz piece is to avoid caricature, but she falls short of any impact that the infamous documentation of Till’s actual open casket did not already convey. Bringing nothing new to the subject she unwittingly made herself the subject, hence the endless contextualizing of the picture as inextricably linked to its author’s whiteness.Ever the opposite, “The Evanesced” gives viewers what contemporary painting is best at delivering. Hinkle’s ambiguous subjects are concretely defined by their fate as the casual expressionism of her brushwork evokes the anonymity of the subjects. She expertly marks what might be trauma with spatial composition that vaguely illustrates what also might be movement. We see the subjects as present yet evasive. They are both both form and concept. Alive and yet ellusive, they are concretely evanescent.To nail a concrete paradox is a masterful accomplishment not every artist will come close too in their lifetime. Schutz reached to make an epic pictorial statement and failed. The punishment in the press for this failure is not what painters need to see. Risks need to be taken, and therefore encouraged, or painting is just the home decoration wing of the entertainment-industrial complex. Hinkle meanwhile delves into the invisible horrors right in front of us all and creates work that avoids exploitation, balancing the tragic with the poignant. It is too bad the firestorm of scorn aimed at Dana Schutz cannot somehow be transfigured into accolades for Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle.“Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle: The Evanesced,” curated by Naima J. Keith, runs at the California African American Museum in L.A.’s Exposition Park until June 25."

For me the first impetus go get involved happened during my senior year in high school with the murder at UTK of Tommy Baer in 1988, the boyfriend of a classmate of mine. My first work on campus safety came through the Student Government Association, where I served on the Student Senate, the Campus Safety Committee, and a University task force to suggest improvements to the campus police department.Then on February 20, 1991 I skipped my philosophy class to eat lunch, and was watching the NBC News program “A Closer Look” which was focusing on campus crime shortly after the murder of Yale University student Christian Prince. One of the segments was an interview with Dana Getzinger a University of Georgia (UGA) student who along with her family had founded an organization called Safe Campuses Now (SCN). They offered campus area crime tracking, a housing rating system, educational programs, public policy, and a community crime patrol. I immediately recognized these as programs that could also benefit UTK, and later that day reached out directly to them to discuss bringing the programs to Tennessee.Shortly thereafter SCN also connected me with noted victims’ rights attorney Frank Carrington, then counsel to Security On Campus, Inc. (SOC) the national non-profit campus safety organization founded by Connie and Howard Clery after the murder of their daughter Jeanne at Lehigh University in 1986. Our SGA team had already been involved with an effort to free campus police reports from being kept private under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) something Mr. Carrington was working on as well. We successfully secured a change to this law in 1992. He also brought us in on the initiative to develop and pass the Campus Sexual Assault Victims’ Bill of Rights, which Congress enacted in 1992.On Saturday, April 27, 1991 the SGA Campus Safety Committee held the first SCN meeting with Dana Getzinger’s father Jim.

The “Newswatch” program tracked crime on and around campus, and in the pre-world-wide web era was shared on campus via posters, and faxed to offices across campus.

Our team would often pile in a van at 5:30 AM to make the roughly three-hour drive to the Capitol in Nashville.

For me the first impetus go get involved happened during my senior year in high school with the murder at UTK of Tommy Baer in 1988, the boyfriend of a classmate of mine. My first work on campus safety came through the Student Government Association, where I served on the Student Senate, the Campus Safety Committee, and a University task force to suggest improvements to the campus police department.Then on February 20, 1991 I skipped my philosophy class to eat lunch, and was watching the NBC News program “A Closer Look” which was focusing on campus crime shortly after the murder of Yale University student Christian Prince. One of the segments was an interview with Dana Getzinger a University of Georgia (UGA) student who along with her family had founded an organization called Safe Campuses Now (SCN). They offered campus area crime tracking, a housing rating system, educational programs, public policy, and a community crime patrol. I immediately recognized these as programs that could also benefit UTK, and later that day reached out directly to them to discuss bringing the programs to Tennessee.Shortly thereafter SCN also connected me with noted victims’ rights attorney Frank Carrington, then counsel to Security On Campus, Inc. (SOC) the national non-profit campus safety organization founded by Connie and Howard Clery after the murder of their daughter Jeanne at Lehigh University in 1986. Our SGA team had already been involved with an effort to free campus police reports from being kept private under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) something Mr. Carrington was working on as well. We successfully secured a change to this law in 1992. He also brought us in on the initiative to develop and pass the Campus Sexual Assault Victims’ Bill of Rights, which Congress enacted in 1992.On Saturday, April 27, 1991 the SGA Campus Safety Committee held the first SCN meeting with Dana Getzinger’s father Jim. For the next three and a half years SCN operated campus safety programs with me as the student director and numerous student volunteers pitching in. The “Newswatch” program tracked crime on and around campus, and in the pre-world-wide web era was shared on campus via posters, and faxed to offices across campus.

One of the five suits, involving former producer Andrea Mackris, made headlines in 2004. Another suit, involving Fox News employee Juliet Huddy was only reported in January. The other three had not been previously reported. A sixth woman, Dr. Wendy Walsh, told the Times that she rebuffed O’Reilly’s advances and he later didn’t follow through on an offer to make her a network contributor. In a release, Bloom said Walsh will speak out at a press conference Monday in Los Angeles and they “will reveal their new demands to the network.”The revelations about O’Reilly only shed more light on the toxic culture inside Fox News. Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who built the network with Rupert Murdoch in 1996 and ran it for two decades, resigned in July following a sexual harassment lawsuit from former Fox & Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson and amid widespread allegations from women inside the network, including former primetime host Megyn Kelly and many others throughout the executive’s five decades in media and politics. Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros is also suing Ailes and top executives at Fox News, which she compared to a “Playboy Mansion-Like Cult.”Federal investigators are currently looking into whether parent company 21st Century Fox didn’t properly notify investors about payments to Ailes’s accusers and other business practices.While Fox News recently posted its highest quarterly ratings ever, and enjoys the best access to President Donald Trump, the post-Ailes network continues to be embroiled in scandals related to allegations of employee mistreatment. Last month, 21st Century Fox reached a settlement with former Fox News contributor Tamara Holder after she accused former network Fox executive Francisco Cortes of sexual assault. And last week, two black employees, Tichaona Brown and Tabrese Wright, filed a racial discrimination suit against longtime comptroller Judith Slater, Fox News, and 21st Century Fox. The network had fired Slater just days earlier for what it dubbed “abhorrent behavior.”O’Reilly, however, has remained seemingly untouchable at Fox News despite the headline-grabbing allegations of sexual harassment over a decade ago and the latest revelations. That’s presumably because “The O’Reilly Factor” draws nearly 4 million viewers nightly, the most in cable news, and his show brought in more than $446 million in advertising revenue from 2014 to 2016, according to the Times. “Just like other prominent and controversial people, I’m vulnerable to lawsuits from individuals who want me to pay them to avoid negative publicity,” O’Reilly said in a statement on his website. “In my more than 20 years at Fox News Channel, no one has ever filed a complaint about me with the Human Resources Department, even on the anonymous hotline.”In a statement to HuffPost, 21st Century Fox ― the Murdoch-family owned parent company of Fox News ― noted that no current or former network employee used the company’s hotline “to raise a concern about Bill O’Reilly, even anonymously.” The company said it had “looked into these matters over the last few months and discussed them with Mr. O’Reilly. “While he denies the merits of these claims, Mr. O’Reilly has resolved those he regarded as his personal responsibility,” the statement continued. “Mr. O’Reilly is fully committed to supporting our efforts to improve the environment for all our employees at Fox News.”The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., reported Saturday that O’Reilly’s contract, originally set to expire at the end of this year, was recently renewed.Correction: This article previously described Wright and Brown as no longer with Fox News. Wright is still with the company. And Fox told The Times last week that Brown remains employed, though the suit contended she had been fired. "

One boy, since identified as Bryan Douglas Watts, died en route, local station WNDU reported.Hotel staff members and police officers who responded to the emergency were also taken to area hospitals after being exposed to the toxic air.According to WNDU, the CO levels were later determined to be 16 times the safe limit.Niles Fire Department Capt. Don Wise said he suspects the pool’s heater is to blame. “Anything that has a natural gas heater has a potential of putting off carbon monoxide,” Wise told reporters at the scene. “Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless and tasteless. You’ll end up getting flu-like symptoms... Patients will get nauseous, maybe vomit.”Wise added that it was pure chance the children were found when they were. He credited the hotel’s staff with opening the doors, which allowed fresh air to get in.“Staff just happened to walk by the window and [see] the kids unresponsive on the deck, and then they reacted,” he said. “But no one really knows when the last time somebody saw them actively moving around [was].”One hotel guest described hearing the children playing before laughter turned to screams.“At first I thought someone drowned, because when I came out of my room, there was a body lying on the floor in the hallway and then there was five of them lying by the pool,” the woman, who was not identified, told Reuters.As authorities worked to remove and resuscitate the children, the hotel was evacuated as a precaution. Wise said the pool area did not have a carbon monoxide detector."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e14ca62c00006568ff1ca1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An independent criminal justice reform commission in New York City has released a report with one simple conclusion: “We must close the jail complex on Rikers Island. Period.” The Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform on Sunday officially released the blueprint for the city’s 10-year plan to shut down Rikers Island, the city’s notorious jail complex that’s considered among the worst in the U.S.“With the dedicated efforts of this Commission, along with support from Mayor [Bill] de Blasio, today, we can say that the dream of closing Rikers Island will finally become a reality,” New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito (D) said in a statement Sunday.Mark-Viverito commissioned a report last year on the possibility of closing Rikers. The 146-page findings were posted Friday ahead of Sunday’s formal announcement. The 10,000 inmates at the facility include men, women and juveniles. Many Rikers prisoners are pretrial detainees too poor to afford bail, or nonviolent offenders with sentences too brief to justify a transfer to a new facility. Per the report, a crucial step to closing Rikers would be halving its population to less than 5,000 so it could be replaced by a smaller, borough-based jail system. The five facilities of that system would be located near various courthouses. Such a system would cost over $10 billion.The commission offers a number of proposals to help cut the Rikers population in half, including an overhaul of the bail bonds process; investing in neighborhood crime prevention strategies; alternative sentencing for low-level offenses; job training and employment opportunities for people leaving jail; improved mental health access and treatment; and raising the city’s age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18.Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said on Sunday that shrinking the city’s correctional footprint and maintaining public safety are not mutually exclusive goals. “We’ve shown in the past several years you can do both: You can have a fair criminal justice system that protects the community ― with one stand of justice for everyone ― but also lower the number of people being incarcerated,” Gonzalez said at a news conference. “You don’t have to incarcerate your way to public safety.” The city has been under increasing pressure to shutter Rikers amid years of exposes, scathing Justice Department reports and a flurry of expensive lawsuits.A backlogged and sluggish court system means that detainees spend an average of nine months awaiting trial while being housed in a facility notorious for its abuse, violence by inmates and guards and the capricious use of solitary confinement. The scrutiny reached new heights in 2015 after Kalief Browder, a Bronx teenager, hanged himself following his time in Rikers. Browder was jailed at 16 for allegedly stealing a backpack. He went on to spend three years at Rikers without a conviction ― including 800 days in solitary confinement. In the report released Sunday, commissioners called Rikers Island a “stain on our great city that leaves its mark on everyone it touches,” including inmates, corrections staff, attorneys and the taxpayers who “devote billions of dollars each year to keep the whole dysfunctional apparatus running.”“Put simply,” the report said, “Rikers Island is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem.” Advocates for mass incarceration reform have long called for a closing of Rikers, and have been supported in recent years by local officials like Mark-Viverito and state officials like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) had been more reluctant to move ahead with the Rikers closure until there was a clear idea of what would take its place. His stance has softened on account of the city’s falling crime rate, which he said makes Rikers’ closure more attainable on a 10-year timeline. “A year ago, we didn’t think it could be done,” de Blasio said last week, according to NPR. “It would [have] been irresponsible for me to say we had a plan if we didn’t have a real plan.

41,POLITICS,Here's How NYC Corrections Could Change After Rikers Island Shuts Down,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rikers-island-closing_us_58e11f22e4b0ba359595b7b5,"""Rikers Island is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem.""",2017-04-02,"Rikers Island is seen in an aerial photograph taken in New York on Oct. 31, 2012.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e14bd816000021004d8490.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An independent criminal justice reform commission in New York City has released a report with one simple conclusion: “We must close the jail complex on Rikers Island. Period.” The Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform on Sunday officially released the blueprint for the city’s 10-year plan to shut down Rikers Island, the city’s notorious jail complex that’s considered among the worst in the U.S.“With the dedicated efforts of this Commission, along with support from Mayor [Bill] de Blasio, today, we can say that the dream of closing Rikers Island will finally become a reality,” New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito (D) said in a statement Sunday.Mark-Viverito commissioned a report last year on the possibility of closing Rikers. The 146-page findings were posted Friday ahead of Sunday’s formal announcement. The 10,000 inmates at the facility include men, women and juveniles. Many Rikers prisoners are pretrial detainees too poor to afford bail, or nonviolent offenders with sentences too brief to justify a transfer to a new facility. Per the report, a crucial step to closing Rikers would be halving its population to less than 5,000 so it could be replaced by a smaller, borough-based jail system. The five facilities of that system would be located near various courthouses. Such a system would cost over $10 billion.The commission offers a number of proposals to help cut the Rikers population in half, including an overhaul of the bail bonds process; investing in neighborhood crime prevention strategies; alternative sentencing for low-level offenses; job training and employment opportunities for people leaving jail; improved mental health access and treatment; and raising the city’s age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18.Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said on Sunday that shrinking the city’s correctional footprint and maintaining public safety are not mutually exclusive goals. “We’ve shown in the past several years you can do both: You can have a fair criminal justice system that protects the community ― with one stand of justice for everyone ― but also lower the number of people being incarcerated,” Gonzalez said at a news conference. “You don’t have to incarcerate your way to public safety.” The city has been under increasing pressure to shutter Rikers amid years of exposes, scathing Justice Department reports and a flurry of expensive lawsuits.A backlogged and sluggish court system means that detainees spend an average of nine months awaiting trial while being housed in a facility notorious for its abuse, violence by inmates and guards and the capricious use of solitary confinement. The scrutiny reached new heights in 2015 after Kalief Browder, a Bronx teenager, hanged himself following his time in Rikers. Browder was jailed at 16 for allegedly stealing a backpack. He went on to spend three years at Rikers without a conviction ― including 800 days in solitary confinement. In the report released Sunday, commissioners called Rikers Island a “stain on our great city that leaves its mark on everyone it touches,” including inmates, corrections staff, attorneys and the taxpayers who “devote billions of dollars each year to keep the whole dysfunctional apparatus running.”“Put simply,” the report said, “Rikers Island is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem.” Advocates for mass incarceration reform have long called for a closing of Rikers, and have been supported in recent years by local officials like Mark-Viverito and state officials like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) had been more reluctant to move ahead with the Rikers closure until there was a clear idea of what would take its place. His stance has softened on account of the city’s falling crime rate, which he said makes Rikers’ closure more attainable on a 10-year timeline. “A year ago, we didn’t think it could be done,” de Blasio said last week, according to NPR. “It would [have] been irresponsible for me to say we had a plan if we didn’t have a real plan. We now have a real plan.”In announcing news of the plan on Friday, de Blasio called Rikers “an example and an expression” of the nation’s mass incarceration crisis.“The mass incarceration crisis did not being in New York City, but it will end here,” de Blasio said. “We are going to end the era of mass incarceration by making this important change.”The long-term plan, once Rikers Island is emptied of prisoners, is to redevelop it.There would be a number of unique challenges and costs associated with redeveloping an isolated island once used as a dumping ground for garbage.

I think he was excelling in a sport that we weren’t so it was pure jealousy.”“I think he was the only kid in school that we could beat up,” he added. “You know, I’m not bragging about this, this is terrible. I was a stupid kid, I didn’t want to beat him up. In fact, I think at one point I tried to turn it into love play.”Even though Perry expressed remorse, that wasn’t good enough for Trudeau, who in his challenge on Saturday ― which was April Fools’ Day ― correctly noted that Chandler, Perry’s character on “Friends,” has a very punchable face. Guys, just one request: If this goes down, just make sure it’s streamable ― not some of that pay-per-view bull crap. "

Chris Stewart (R-Utah) Friday evening at a town hall meeting in Salt Lake City, where audience members questioned him on issues including immigration and President Donald Trump’s Russia ties.More than 1,000 people attended Friday’s town hall at West High School, the first held in the state since Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) claimed protesters at a forum he held in February were paid. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that members of the audience frequently shouted at Stewart to “do your job,” called him a “liar” and asked “who are you in bed with?” They also held up signs that read “agree” or “disagree” to show the congressman how they felt about his responses to questions.Stewart had backed Trump in the 2016 election despite once calling him “our Mussolini,” in reference to the late Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. The congressman faced several questions about the investigations into whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials during the presidential campaign. (Stewart sits on the House Intelligence Committee, which is probing those ties.) One audience member questioned whether Stewart has held the administration accountable.“I have said from the beginning, if there’s evidence that someone has done criminal wrongdoing, we will turn that information over to the FBI and they will have to pursue it,” he said. Another asked whether he’s concerned by potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election, or just the leaks in the administration of classified information.“I’m equally concerned about both and we want to find out the answer to both,” he replied.The crowd loudly objected to that answer, according to The Associated Press.Stewart was also booed for professing support for Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and for claiming that Congress is “trying to make [health care] better for you” by attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He did, however, earn applause from the audience when he said he supported helping some undocumented workers gain legal status, KSL reported.Stewart is one of several Republicans who have faced angry crowds at town halls this year. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) was similarly booed at a forum Friday, as was Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) last Saturday.Many of the members who held town halls during the February congressional recess faced strong opposition from constituents concerned about efforts to repeal Obamacare.Faced with the prospect of potential public embarrassment, some members declined to host any public forums, instead opting for conference calls with constituents.

Justin Amash (R-Mich.), one of the group’s most unflinching members.President Donald Trump’s social media director Dan Scavino first needled Amash on Friday, tweeting that the Great Lakes State congressman refused to back the Republican Obamacare replacement bill because “he puts politics before [Michigan.]” Scavino included screenshots of articles about the congressman’s decision not to vote for Trump, and of an Amash tweet criticizing the president’s rants about Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) in January.Amash, known for his stubborn independence from party leadership, was defiant as ever, defending opposition to the bill he called “#Swampcare because it’s just another version of #Obamacare.”Scavino continued hammering Amash on Saturday, calling for Trump supporters to primary Amash in the coming election cycle.Amash responded in less than an hour, claiming the Trump administration and establishment “have merged into #Trumpstablishment.”If the White House is serious about ousting Amash, it will not be easy. A more mainstream Republican backed by the party establishment tried to defeat the four-term congressman in a 2014 primary and failed miserably.Amash has emerged as the congressional Republican perhaps most willing to criticize Trump. He has maintained this maverick approach during the public feud that has erupted between Trump and the Freedom Caucus in the past few days. The president has settled on a deliberate strategy of calling out the Freedom Caucus for its role in sinking the Republican Obamacare replacement bill. The group of hardline fiscal conservatives argued that the legislation preserved too much of the Affordable Care Act’s original structure, noting that it would provide tax credits for individuals to purchase insurance on exchanges.Trump tweeted on Thursday that Republicans “must fight” Freedom Caucus members if they “don’t get on board,” implying that they would be subject to primary challenges. On Friday, he singled out GOP Reps. Mark Meadows (N.C.), Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Raul Labrador (Idaho) ― all Freedom Caucus members ― in more conciliatory tweets that seemed aimed at cajoling them into cooperation.Scavino’s call to initiate a primary challenge against Amash is the most explicit indication yet that the White House plans to try to push these members out if they stand in the way of the broader GOP agenda."

An aggravated felony is a wide-ranging category of which the conviction could trigger at least a one-year sentence. One of the individuals is Chamrouen Phan, who was barely a year old when he and his family arrived in the US in 1984.

The families of these individuals call them the “MN8” and have been organizing since then to have their loved ones released.In February, one of these individuals was released after he was able to explain to the immigration court why his absence would cause extreme hardship to his US citizen wife and children. Four other MN8 members were less fortunate as they were deported to Cambodia earlier this week. All of these men have been caught up in an immigration system that since 1996 strictly limits the abilities of immigration judges to consider issues of family ties, atonement and rehabilitation. The deportation of Cambodian Americans began swiftly following a 2002 repatriation agreement between the US and Cambodian governments.Each of the MN8 has a past aggravated felony conviction, which triggered the deportation orders. An aggravated felony is a wide-ranging category of which the conviction could trigger at least a one-year sentence. One of the individuals is Chamrouen Phan, who was barely a year old when he and his family arrived in the US in 1984. Chamrouen’s conviction stemmed from three broken windows at a St. Paul bar one regrettable night in 2009. Chamrouen has now been in ICE detention for 8 months. For the broken windows that triggered his deportation orders, he served 40 days in jail.These men have served their sentences and were leading otherwise regular lives with spouses, children, and jobs when they were detained. Their mistakes were made years, some even decades ago. The men have since moved on to become responsible, contributing members of their communities. To rip them away from their families now is unconscionable. And yet, this is what ICE has done to some families.Chamreoun has never actually been to Cambodia since he was born in a Thai refugee camp. His family fled the “Killing Fields” in Cambodia, which was overseen by the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. Prior to the Khmer Rouge’s takeover, Cambodia (and neighboring Laos) experienced massive US bombing raids across its countryside in the early 1970’s. US military forces sought to disrupt Vietnamese communist supply lines, disregarding the neutrality of both Cambodia and Laos during the Vietnam War. These bombings both devastated Cambodia’s agricultural infrastructure and contributed significantly to political instability that eventually gave rise to the Khmer Rouge. Thus, the MN8 are ostensibly children of the Vietnam War, an era that produced Southeast Asian refugees. And so, the US government ought to recognize its role in contributing to the conditions that forced Chamrouen’s family to leave their homeland and seek refuge abroad. The ReleaseMN8 campaign and the plight of too many others highlight the dangerous mixture of US militarism, unjust immigration policies, and a prison-industrial complex that targets vulnerable communities of color.Recently, Chamreoun learned that a motion to reopen his case was granted by the court. This means that he will have an opportunity to explain to an immigration judge why it is critical for him to receive deportation relief and stay with his family. Two other members of the MN8 are currently waiting to learn if their motions to reopen will be granted.We must reconsider policies that tear families apart and deport individuals who arrived here as refugee infants and children. The MN8 families have a Tumblr page where you will find more information about these men and the campaign, as well as a link to a Fundraiser where you can donate to support their legal defense."

When he did, the device popped in an explosion that knocked him to the ground and covered both boy and dog in an orange powder, the Idaho State Journal reported on March 17.Quick-thinking Canyon used snow to rub the orange powder off of himself, but when he went to find his dog, what he saw was horrific.“I sprinted toward him and landed on my knees and saw this red froth coming from his mouth and his eyes turning glassy and he was having a seizure,” he told the State Journal.Casey died within minutes, killed by what’s known as an M-44, a spring-activated cyanide trap that the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services sets to kill coyotes.The traps are scented to lure coyotes, and work by cyanide rendering cells unable to absorb oxygen, suffocating the animal to death.The devices have killed more than 3,400 “non-target” animals — including domestic dogs like Casey — between 2006 and 2012, according to a Sacramento Bee investigation.And this one could have killed Canyon, too.“We didn’t even know cyanide bombs existed,” Canyon’s mother, Theresa Mansfield, told HuffPost in an email. “Even all of the deputy sheriffs, the hazmat team and the Bannock County Sheriff did not know these things existed. As a result there was a delay in figuring out what it was and therefore a delay in getting my son to the emergency room. Thank God he is alive; just inches from death.”But although Canyon thankfully lived, his ordeal is not over. Aside from the psychological trauma of watching his beloved pet die a horrible death, Canyon has suffered from a myriad residual physical symptoms, his mother said.“He had a lot of cough, nausea and some vomiting early on,” his mother said. “He’s had severe headaches so his case was discussed with a toxicologist, anesthesiologist, and neurologist.” But she added that since there just isn’t much data on the effects of cyanide on children, “All we can do is wait.”USDA Wildlife Services confirmed the incident to HuffPost in a statement, calling it what happened a “rare occurrence.”“As a program made up of individual employees many of whom are pet owners, Wildlife Services understands the close bonds between people and their pets and sincerely regrets such losses,” the statement said. “We are grateful that the individual who with his dog when it activated the M-44 device was unharmed, however, we take this possible exposure to sodium cyanide seriously and are conducting a thorough review of this incident.”The statement also said that such traps are designed to “minimize unintentional actions with domestic pets” and that M-44s are accompanied by signs and warnings for humans. But in this case, both Canyon and Bannock County sheriff Lorin Neilen told the Idaho State Journal that there were no readily apparent warning signs near the trap.“Obviously, they did not follow their policies as they look at them with each accident as they promised or we would not be in this situation,” Mansfield told HuffPost. She added that while the USDA has released statements to several media outlets, the agency has not directly apologized or even contacted her family.In response to the incident, she and her husband, Mark Mansfield, created a White House petition calling for a ban on M-44 devices,.“Wildlife Services uses cyanide to indiscriminately kill unintended animals and injure humans despite more scientifically sound methods of predator control available for ranchers,” the petition states. “The USDA maintains they resolve conflict between wildlife and people ‘in the safest and most humane ways possible’ but the nature of the cyanide bomb is neither safe nor humane.”The Mansfield family said they simply want to prevent other people from experiencing the same tragedy or worse.“Our first and foremost concern is our child; nothing else matters above that,” she said. “Secondly we are concerned about our neighbors in this county, state and in our nation. There has to be a better way for Wildlife Services and we want to pass a Federal law to make sure that this never happens again.”"
55,QUEER VOICES,What It's Like To Be A Transgender Teacher In Donald Trump's America,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/transgender-educators_us_58dec765e4b0ba3595950638,These are the effects of the Trump administration attacking the rights of transgender students.,2017-04-01,"Bahar Akyurtlu, in her classroom in Harlem, New York City, has restarted her school’s previously dormant Gay Straight Alliance club in the wake of the Trump administration's rollback.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ded6551400008806072b47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Bahar Akyurtlu had been teaching for about four months at a high school in Harlem before several students began bullying her. When she walked down the halls, clusters of students would shout at her, referring to her as “mister.” In stairwells, students would yell that her voice sounded like a man. The harassment didn’t surprise her, even if it stung, cutting to the core of her identity. Sadly, she sees it as one of the occupational hazards of being a transgender teacher, she said. In February, the Trump administration rolled back protections for transgender students. It rescinded guidance that called on school districts to allow students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender. LGBTQ students were not the only people in schools that this action impacted. Transgender educators ― even if the move did not necessarily impact the bathroom they use ― had to watch as the rights of LGBTQ students were severed, while facing their own, unique workplace challenges.The exact number of transgender people who work as educators are unknown, and overall, exact data on the issue is hard to come by. But the ones who do work in education often have to navigate a sticky web of parents, students and colleagues who have varying levels of acceptance, amid a backdrop of minimal workplace protections, The Huffington Post found after interviewing seven transgender educators in March. These educators are a self-selecting group who have been open about their gender identity at work. Not all transgender people have the same luxury or choose the same path. Trump’s bathroom rollback was unsurprising for Akyurtlu, who is in her second year of teaching math at a high school for teens who are behind in credits. The 31-year-old teacher said she is “well aware that any protections we do have are extremely recent and extremely tenuous.” That’s why she is trying to coach her students to be vigilant about fighting for social justice. Earlier this month, she restarted her school’s previously dormant Gay Straight Alliance club. Indeed, she has formed supportive relationships with some of the school’s LGBTQ students. They sometimes act as her protector if any students targeted her. Last year, she watched as some of them got in shouting matches with their intolerant peers.While Akyurtlu feels lucky to have an accepting school administration and colleagues, she wishes there is more she could do for her transgender students, she said in a recent interview in her teacher’s union office. Last year, she kept a watchful eye on the few transgender students who attended the institution.Akyurtlu would remind their teachers to refer to them using the proper pronouns and call them by the correct names. When she would spot these students in the hallways ― they tended to stick together ― she would try and cram in as much advice as possible.“Anytime I saw them I would bring them aside and be like OK, ‘Where are you getting your healthcare needs taken care of? What kinds of hormones are you taking? Here’s some organizations you can go to if you get into legal trouble ― just try to educate them about their health needs and rights,” said Akyurtlu, who started working as a teacher after spending time as a graduate student at Cornell University and then working in the nonprofit sector with LGBTQ groups. “Hell, I didn’t have any teachers growing up who would have supported gay kids. Hell, sometimes they were the nastiest ones.”It breaks Akyurtlu’s heart, though, that the students didn’t end up sticking around. Several months before a few of them would have gotten their high school diplomas, they dropped out. She doesn’t blame them for leaving school ― noting that they had “all of these needs and all of these traumatic things going on, and I’m supposed to teach you geometry?” Thankfully, she has heard that at least one of them is alive and seems to be doing OK. She worries about the others. With a group that has high rates of criminalization and suicide, the statistics can be daunting. “We have to make a priority of them and not just settle for the kids with accepting parents or the school that unveils unisex bathrooms. I think we have to really be willing to not just admit these girls exist but that they are part of our community,” Akyurtlu said.Sam Long, a transgender educator in Denver, had a vastly different experience from Akyurtlu in explaining his gender identity to students. While Akyurtlu did not have control over how and when her kids made this discovery― she supposes they found out on the internet ― Long prepared a carefully crafted speech for his students. Long didn’t initially plan on telling his students his story this year. Long works at a charter school that just opened and currently only serves ninth-graders. He wanted to wait and see how the school’s culture developed.  Then the election happened. Suddenly it seemed urgent to open students’ eyes to the diversity that surrounds them, especially after he heard wise-cracking students make jokes about LGBTQ issues.Long asked his administration if he could tell his story to the students in a daily school-wide meeting. Based on scheduling, they said, he wouldn’t be able to do it until February. Soon, February became March. The day before the event, he was nervous, repeatedly reminding himself to watch for students’ reactions instead of rushing through the speech. But he was ultimately surprised at how well it went. Weeks later, he said he could see what a positive effect his words had on his relationship with students. Standing in front of the entire grade in the school’s front hall, Long told attentive students and colleagues how he transitioned between his sophomore and junior year of high school, and faced intense discrimination from his school administrators. Long’s high school wouldn’t let him use the male restrooms, so he would either wait to secretly use a male restroom in an isolated part of the school, or go in the woods outside. When he tried to go on an overnight field trip with the school’s jazz band, he was told he wouldn’t be allowed to room with male or female students, and would have to pay his own way for a single room if he wanted to attend. He didn’t have the money. After facing so much intolerance from teachers and administrators, he sued the school years later so that future students might not have to face the same isolation ― a story which he thinks his students appreciated.“I talked about how much of a gift it is to have your identity and be comfortable with your identity,” Long said. “I think they noticed how important it was symbolically for me to share my story. To show that level of vulnerability is important to this community.”Referencing an old quote from the author John Shedd, he wanted to show his students that “ships are always safe in the harbor but that’s not what ships are made for.”Whereas Long thinks some of his students might have previously thought of him as a “boring straight man” or “as somebody to whom school and academics has always come easy to,” they soon learned the reality. “I had a horrible time at school and a hard time at home and I was homeless for a period of time,” he said. “That’s definitely not something they would have assumed.” Long and Akyurtlu are lucky in that they are both able to be open about their identities at their jobs. In many ways, they are exceptions. All around the country, transgender teachers have been fired and punished for their identity.  But Akyurtlu hopes this won’t hold other transgender people back from going into education. “I know it seems like possibly the hardest job in the world to do when you’re transgender and you will deal with some things, and it will be hard, but it’s hard for everybody, and we can do it,” Akyurtlu said. “I think it’s really necessary for students to be able to see a transgender person in this role, to normalize it in such a day to day constant way really makes a big impact.” ― ― Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

In more recent years, the local community has been using the crater to store water.The herd had apparently become stuck in the muddy pit, unable to scale the steep sides, when they wandered in to drink and bathe, according to LiveScience. By the time the local farmers spotted them on Sunday, it was clear they had been there for some time.“They obviously had been in there at least a couple of days … because the little baby was very exhausted and the mud was so sticky,” Jemma Bullock of Elephant Livelihood Initiative Environment told Cambodia Daily. She added that the elephants would likely have soon died from exhaustion had people not intervened.The people who saw the elephants contacted the provincial environmental department, which brought in representatives from ELIE, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and Wildlife Alliance Cambodia to help. Staff from those groups teamed up numerous people from the local community to dig into the side of the crater and construct a makeshift ramp for the herd.Video footage of the rescue (above) shows the elephants making their way up the ramp and walking free. While 10 of them escaped this way, the final elephant — a young one weakened by the ordeal, had to be lifted out using ropes.Tan Setha of WCS told LiveScience that the deaths of the entire herd ― which included three adult females and eight juveniles — would have seriously hindered conservation efforts in the sanctuary.“These elephants represent an important part of the breeding population in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, and their loss would have been a major blow to conservation,” he said."

A schism is brewing within the administration over what to do about a somewhat-obscure EPA ruling that, for the last eight years, has been the bedrock of policy to fight global warming: the scientific conclusion that greenhouse gases cause climate change, which is bad for humans and should be regulated. A 2007 Supreme Court ruling found that the agency is obligated to regulate any type of air pollution that “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare” under the 1970 Clean Air Act. The George W. Bush administration’s EPA determined that greenhouse gases were, in fact, a danger, but decided not to do anything about it. The Obama administration’s EPA took the issue up shortly after taking office and, in December 2009, issued its conclusion ― commonly called the endangerment finding ― which compelled the agency to start regulating those emissions. The endangerment finding is the foundation of all of Obama’s global warming regulations, including the Clean Power Plan, which strictly limits emissions from power plants, the major contributors of U.S. emissions. With an executive order signed Tuesday, Trump began the process to dismantle the power plant rules, which the Supreme Court had already blocked in response to the state lawsuits Pruitt spearheaded in his previous job.However, the order Trump signed made no mention of the endangerment finding. It’s unclear if earlier drafts had addressed it, since the Trump campaign had said in written statements that he would overturn the finding, but it was Pruitt who argued against including it, Politico and CNN reported, insisting the language would trigger a difficult, years-long legal battle.Pruitt’s approach puts him at loggerheads with Myron Ebell, the emphatic climate science denier who led Trump’s EPA transition team. Soon after the inauguration, Ebell, who oversees global warming and environmental policy at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, submitted a petition to the EPA requesting the agency reconsider the endangerment finding. The EPA has yet to respond. On Thursday, Ebell accused the White House of playing hot potato with a process he says is critical to prevent courts or a future administration from policing greenhouse gases, which he does not believe cause global warming.“There’s a kind of passing of responsibility here,” Ebell told The Huffington Post by phone on Thursday. “I don’t know what advice [Pruitt] has listened to, but I’ve consulted a lot of lawyers on this, too.”“If I had it my own way, I would advise the president to reopen the finding,” he added.Ebell acknowledges that leaving the endangerment finding in place would make undoing the Clean Power Plan a legal nightmare. “If you take down the building but leave the foundation, you’re going to get in trouble,” Ebell said. “We need to excavate the foundation and cart it away. The endangerment finding is the foundation.” (He tempered the comparison moments later, admitting: “I don’t like analogical thinking. It’s very misleading to think analogically.”)But overturning the endangerment finding wouldn’t be easy. White House attorneys would need to prove in court that the finding was arbitrary and capricious. Meeting that standard would require them to debunk the overwhelming scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming. “I don’t see on the horizon anything that would permit them to overturn this and have it legally upheld,” said Lisa Heinzerling, a law professor at Georgetown University who is credited with crafting the strategy of states and environmental groups in Massachusetts v. EPA, a 2007 ruling that said the EPA should regulate greenhouse gases. “That’s because of the strength of the scientific evidence and because of the law.”The legal odds are overwhelmingly in environmentalists’ favor. In 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a challenge to the endangerment finding from Pruitt himself. The court’s reading of the Clean Air Act found that the law requires a precautionary approach to scientific uncertainty. As a result, the roughly 3 percent of actively publishing climate scientists who don’t believe that greenhouse gases cause global warming represent too small a fraction to tilt the scales in favor of doubt, Heinzerling said. Plus, the Clean Air Act gives exclusive jurisdiction to the D.C. Circuit, meaning the Trump administration would need to sway the same court that unanimously upheld the endangerment finding five years ago.“Bottom line is the enviros would welcome that fight,” said David Bookbinder, who in 2007 served as counsel to The Sierra Club in the Supreme Court case that laid the groundwork for the endangerment finding. He’s now chief counsel at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank. “The president can’t just stand up and say, ‘no endangerment finding,’” he added. “The court would say, ‘Everything you told us you now think is wrong is based on what? Some crank scientists representing 1 percent of the world’s science and their nutcase views?’ It’s not going to fly. They have to have a rational basis for doing this.” But Ebell’s not the only Trump associate who wants him to try to throw the endangerment finding out.Breitbart News, the far-right news site run until recently by chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, accused Pruitt of “failing to drain the swamp at the EPA” in a blaring headline Monday. Citing unnamed sources, James Delingpole, a London-based columnist and hard-line skeptic of climate science, accused Pruitt of putting his political ambitions ahead of his promise to “take on the Green Blob.” “True, his credentials as a climate sceptic are not much in doubt. Yes, he might even agree with President Trump that there’s a swamp out there that sorely needs draining,” Delingpole wrote a day before the executive order came out. “The problem is, insiders explain, is that the future of the EPA is of far less interest to Pruitt than his prospects of becoming either one of Oklahoma’s next senators or its next governor.”Absent White House support, zealous critics of climate action say they plan to lobby members of Congress to pass a bill to strip the EPA of its regulatory powers by amending the Clean Air Act. Possible allies include Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the antagonistic chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology; and Sens. John Barrasso (R-Pa.) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who once infamously displayed a snowball on the Senate floor as proof that global warming doesn’t exist.A spokeswoman for the House Science Committee said there is no current legislation being considered. Mike Danylak, a spokesman for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which Barrasso chairs, said, “Congress has never explicitly given the EPA the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and the Senate EPW committee has no plans to do so.” But he said Barrasso is not exploring legislation to target the endangerment finding. Inhofe’s spokesperson did not return a request for comment. “If Congress passed that law, Trump would sign it,” said H. Sterling Burnett, a research fellow on energy and the environment at the Illinois-based Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank. “That would put the kibosh on it right there.” The White House referred HuffPost to the EPA, which did not respond to a request for comment. Burnett said he’s holding out hope that Trump will fulfill his campaign promise to overturn the endangerment finding and, ultimately, withdraw from the 195-country Paris Agreement, the historic first global deal to reduce carbon emissions that includes the U.S. and China. But he sees battle lines being drawn in the White House. He views Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ― who has said the U.S. should maintain its seat at the negotiating table by remaining in the agreement ― and the president’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who serves as a top adviser to the president, as getting in the way of that. “To the extent that he has people pushing back on this within his own administration, it’s a matter of the public’s responsibility to hold his feet to the fire,” Burnett said of Trump. “He didn’t say ‘I’ll renegotiate the Paris Agreement.’ He said he’d withdraw. It’s public. It’s out there. It’s in print.”He warned that failure to do so could turn voters against Trump if he runs for reelection in 2020.“Come next election, we’ll punish him at the ballot box,” Burnett said. “If he doesn’t reverse the endangerment finding ― which he’s said is a terrible thing, it’s job killing ― if he doesn’t do that, we’re going to hold him accountable.” "

Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you how to make it stop.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dc07bb1d0000f72c7d1339.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s pretty incredible how often you hear managers complaining about their best employees leaving, and they really do have something to complain about—few things are as costly and disruptive as good people walking out the door.Managers tend to blame their turnover problems on everything under the sun, while ignoring the crux of the matter: people don’t leave jobs; they leave managers.The sad thing is that this can easily be avoided. All that’s required is a new perspective and some extra effort on the manager’s part.Organizations know how important it is to have motivated, engaged employees, but most fail to hold managers accountable for making it happen.When they don’t, the bottom line suffers.Research from the University of California found that motivated employees were 31% more productive, had 37% higher sales, and were three times more creative than demotivated employees. They were also 87% less likely to quit, according to a Corporate Leadership Council study on over 50,000 people.Gallup research shows that a mind-boggling 70% of an employee’s motivation is influenced by his or her manager. So, let’s take a look at some of the worst things that managers do that send good people packing.1. They overwork people. Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It’s so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is perplexing; it makes them feel as if they’re being punished for great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don’t get anything out of working more.If you must increase how much work your talented employees are doing, you’d better increase their status as well. Talented employees will take on a bigger workload, but they won’t stay if their job suffocates them in the process. Raises, promotions, and title-changes are all acceptable ways to increase workload. If you simply increase workload because people are talented, without changing a thing, they will seek another job that gives them what they deserve.2. They don’t recognize contributions and reward good work. It’s easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it’s a raise; for others, it’s public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you’re doing it right.3. They fail to develop people’s skills. When managers are asked about their inattention to employees, they try to excuse themselves, using words such as “trust,” “autonomy,” and “empowerment.” This is complete nonsense. Good managers manage, no matter how talented the employee. They pay attention and are constantly listening and giving feedback.Management may have a beginning, but it certainly has no end. When you have a talented employee, it’s up to you to keep finding areas in which they can improve to expand their skill set. The most talented employees want feedback—more so than the less talented ones—and it’s your job to keep it coming. If you don’t, your best people will grow bored and complacent.4. They don’t care about their employees. More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee’s success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts. Bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. It’s impossible to work for someone eight-plus hours a day when they aren’t personally involved and don’t care about anything other than your production yield.5. They don’t honor their commitments. Making promises to people places you on the fine line that lies between making them very happy and watching them walk out the door. When you uphold a commitment, you grow in the eyes of your employees because you prove yourself to be trustworthy and honorable (two very important qualities in a boss). But when you disregard your commitment, you come across as slimy, uncaring, and disrespectful. After all, if the boss doesn’t honor his or her commitments, why should everyone else?6. They hire and promote the wrong people. Good, hard-working employees want to work with like-minded professionals. When managers don’t do the hard work of hiring good people, it’s a major demotivator for those stuck working alongside them. Promoting the wrong people is even worse. When you work your tail off only to get passed over for a promotion that’s given to someone who glad-handed their way to the top­­­­­­­, it’s a massive insult. No wonder it makes good people leave.7. They don’t let people pursue their passions. Talented employees are passionate. Providing opportunities for them to pursue their passions improves their productivity and job satisfaction. But many managers want people to work within a little box. These managers fear that productivity will decline if they let people expand their focus and pursue their passions. This fear is unfounded. Studies show that people who are able to pursue their passions at work experience flow, a euphoric state of mind that is five times more productive than the norm.8. They fail to engage creativity. The most talented employees seek to improve everything they touch. If you take away their ability to change and improve things because you’re only comfortable with the status quo, this makes them hate their jobs. Caging up this innate desire to create not only limits them, it limits you.9. They don’t challenge people intellectually. Great bosses challenge their employees to accomplish things that seem inconceivable at first. Instead of setting mundane, incremental goals, they set lofty goals that push people out of their comfort zones. Then, good managers do everything in their power to help them succeed. When talented and intelligent people find themselves doing things that are too easy or boring, they seek other jobs that will challenge their intellects.Bringing It All TogetherIf you want your best people to stay, you need to think carefully about how you treat them. While good employees are as tough as nails, their talent gives them an abundance of options. You need to make them want to work for you.What other mistakes cause great employees to leave?

60,POLITICS,2 Democratic Senators Say Neil Gorsuch Refused To Meet With Them,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-senate-democrats_us_58de7fc8e4b0ba3595948896,Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.) will both vote against Trump's Supreme Court nominee.,2017-03-31,Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) says she can't vote for a Supreme Court nominee who won't even meet with her.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58de810a2c00002000ff190a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Two U.S. senators, Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), say President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, has refused to meet with them in the weeks leading up to his confirmation vote.Both senators noted this detail in statements this week announcing they plan to vote against him.“Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch has not made the effort to meet with me in person to answer the serious questions I have about his record and he in fact cancelled a meeting we had previously scheduled,” Duckworth said. “I refuse to vote to end debate on a nominee who refuses to provide any answers to my questions.”“Unfortunately, after requesting a meeting with the Judge for several weeks, he has refused to honor this request,” Cortez Masto said. “The U.S. Constitution has entrusted the Senate with the role of advising the President on the highest court of the land and in refusing to meet with me, he has disrespected our nation’s founding principles and pillars core to our democratic institutions.”In Duckworth’s case, the two had a meeting scheduled on Wednesday, but Gorsuch canceled and did not provide any dates or times that worked for him to reschedule. Duckworth’s office “made multiple efforts and offered multiple times/dates for both the first meeting and for rescheduling after the cancellation,” according to her office, but Gorsuch didn’t follow up.“If Judge Gorsuch had wanted to meet with the Senator, he shouldn’t have cancelled their meeting without offering any additional times that worked for him,” Duckworth spokesman Ben Garmisa said via email.Cortez Masto spokesman Rey Benitez said Gorsuch’s team told her office it had to justify why the Supreme Court nominee should meet with the senator.“They said, ‘Give us a good reason why the judge should sit down with the senator,’” Benitez said. “That’s ridiculous that they’re asking us to do that. She’s a U.S. senator and she’s trying to do her job.”Another Democratic senator, Kamala Harris (Calif.), did not meet with Gorsuch either. She never got an offer to meet with him, per her office.A White House spokesman, who spoke only on background, said Gorsuch has met with most senators and is still open to meeting with Cortez Masto.“Judge Gorsuch has met with nearly 80 Senators,” the spokesman said in an email. “In early February, the White House nominations team reached out to Senator Cortez Masto requesting a meeting be scheduled. The Judge was more than willing to meet with the Senator and both sides have been trying to find a mutually agreeable date that would work.”Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who has been shepherding Gorsuch through his Senate meetings, said it’s not true that he’s been refusing to meet with certain senators.“No one has been rebuffed,” Ayotte said in a Friday press call. “We reached out to Senator Cortez Masto in early February and we’ve been trying to come up with a mutually convenient time. But obviously the judge had hearings and everything else. And we were doing meetings as late as last week as well. So no one’s been rebuffed and the judge has made every effort, and gone to almost 80 senators, so I don’t think that that characterization is accurate.”Christopher Kang, a former White House staffer who led Senate outreach for the confirmations of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said his team offered a courtesy meeting to all 100 senators.“These meetings are about more than just trying to win votes,” Kang wrote in a Thursday blog post on HuffPost. “They are about respect for the Senate as an institution ― a co-equal branch of government that is constitutionally responsible for providing advice and consent on Supreme Court nominations. If you don’t understand this, that raises serious questions about your judgment and independence.”Latino advocacy groups are outraged by the perceived slights to Cortez Masto, who is the first Latina senator, and to Duckworth, a decorated veteran.“Sen. Cortez Masto represents the growing diversity of our nation. She has a right to ask questions of the nominee to the highest court in the land,” said Ben Monterroso of Mi Familia Vota, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement in Latino and immigrant communities. “Why won’t he meet with two senators who represent the diversity of our country? Is he afraid he will be asked about women’s rights?”“The refusal to meet with Senator Cortez Masto seems to demonstrate unwarranted hostility, extreme obtuseness, or acquiescence in a political strategy marked by disrespect for the Latino community,” MALDEF President Thomas Saenz said. “While we hope that mere oversight may explain Gorsuch’s refusal to meet with the two senators, the record to date suggests otherwise.”Gorsuch’s confirmation vote is set for April 7, and it could be dramatic. Democrats are vowing to deny him the 60 votes he needs to move forward, and Republicans are threatening to blow up Senate rules to force through his confirmation on 51 votes. The partisan nastiness of it all is making senators sad.This article has been updated with comment from Kelly Ayotte."

As part of our “Women and Jihad” series, we meet the young female ballplayers who are challenging lingering Islamist ideology in the city.MOGADISHU, Somalia – Her name is Mulki Noor Mudey, but she introduces herself simply as Coach. Standing at the side of Mogadishu’s dilapidated basketball and handball stadium, her bright blue “Hagen” team jersey shimmering under the unrelenting Somali sun, it’s hard to imagine her as anything but an athlete.Only a few months ago, Mudey had stood in that same spot, teeming with nerves. It was the Somali women’s handball championship game. With only four minutes to go and the stadium’s seats packed with spectators, the score was tied.“When the game is happening, you’re so nervous and so anxious,” she says. “And as a coach, there’s only so much you can do.”A slow 60 seconds passed. Then another. With two minutes left, a Hagen player scored, winning the championship game.Thirty years ago, women playing sports at the Wiish Stadium was nothing remarkable. But over the past 26 years, Somalia has experienced a brutal civil war and the emergence of an extremist Islamic insurgency, both of which reversed women’s rights across the country. Today, as relative peace returns to the capital, the resurgence of female athletes is itself a symbol of defiance.Since the appointment of the first special advisor to the United Nations secretary-general on sport for development and peace in 2001, sports have been recognized internationally as a means of peace building and reconciliation. In Somalia, basketball has been used to defuse clan rivalries and revive gender equality in the aftermath of the civil war.But the country’s female athletes also play a role in the ongoing battle to delegitimize the claim by al-Shabab, the al-Qaida-linked terrorist organization born out of the rubble of Somalia’s civil war, that it offers a viable alternative to the federal government. On the crumbling concrete court in Mogadishu, the simple act of young women shooting hoops dilutes al-Shabab’s attempts to spread its extremist ideology, influencing the attitudes of the young men in the stands – potential recruiting targets for the terror group – in the process.“Somali women, we have always been powerful,” says Ridwan Abdullahi Ali, her bright green headscarf draped over her Hagen T-shirt. “Our playing basketball is making people talk in our society about girls’ roles and how we can do these things, like physical things, that the boys are doing.”Ali began playing handball and then basketball when she was 20, after she passed by the stadium and saw her neighbor, Fatuma Ahmed Warsame, a respected basketball player among young people in Mogadishu, playing with her team. After sitting down to watch their practice, Ali came back the next day, and the next, until Warsame convinced her to pick up the ball and join them.“That day I just carried the ball with me. You need to dribble it, but I ran with it instead and people were laughing, telling me I couldn’t just run with it,” Ali says, smiling and bouncing a slightly deflated basketball expertly between her legs.At 22 years old, Ali is part of a younger generation in Somalia that grew up during the country’s civil war, which began in 1991, and the subsequent rise of al-Shabab. The group once controlled much of Mogadishu and – despite the presence of roughly 20,000 African Union peacekeepers – still controls large swaths of the country.Under al-Shabab’s rule, women’s rights in Somalia, once a beacon of gender equality in the region, were nearly completely reversed. Prior to the civil war and insurgency, women wore bikinis and sipped cappuccinos at Lido Beach, a popular hangout just down the road from the sports stadium. By 2012, at the height of the al-Shabab insurgency, women were banned from wearing bras, working and walking or talking in public with nonrelated men. In the large pockets of Mogadishu that were controlled by al-Shabab, women wearing pants – much less playing sports – was an offense punishable by death.“When al-Shabab came suddenly, we were not allowed to play any basketball,” says Mudey. A veteran of the court at Wiish Stadium, she started playing basketball in 1982, when she was 15, and went on to play for the Somali national women’s basketball team. At that time, she would walk in her sports clothes, hair uncovered, to the court to play.“Life was normal, people here were peaceful and open-minded,” she says. “That was a different era, very different from today.”Now Mudey’s players walk to the stadium with their sports attire hidden under colorful abayas, their bright orange and yellow trainers peeking out from beneath long, loose-fitting skirts. At Lido Beach, women have to swim in their full dresses. The socially imposed dress code is a testament to al-Shabab’s lasting impact on the city. Though the group no longer controls many neighborhoods of Mogadishu, after African Union peacekeepers pushed them out of the city in 2012, religious leaders – who became hard-line at the height of the insurgency – are still speaking out against female athletes. Since the girls began playing again, Somali clerics have been releasing public statements admonishing young women for playing basketball, declaring the act “un-Islamic” and “a threat to their faith.”“Some people still say … religion doesn’t allow a woman playing ball. Their argument is that the coach is a man, the referee is a man, the audience are men. That’s their justification,” says team captain Fadumo Ali Abdirahman, 30. “It is difficult for the community to accept us playing, but you need to force your way. Most of the girls you see here are probably sneaking out of the house to come and play.”And with 70 percent of the country’s population under the age of 30, much of the discourse surrounding women’s roles in Somali society is being held not in the halls of government offices nor in soft-carpeted mosques, but in the parks and on the beaches and basketball courts where young people are once again beginning to gather and talk, as their parents’ generation did before the civil war.Today, at the sports stadium, both the women’s and men’s teams practice together. As Abdirahman blows her whistle and the girls run to the side to huddle, a member of the boys’ team grabs the ball Nimo Abdullahi is dribbling, starting a spontaneous one-on-one game.“You always have people who have that negative attitude about women playing, but when you play all the guys will cheer for you and clap for you,” Abdullahi says. “They are happy during the games.”Al-Shabab’s hold on the capital may be diminished, but the group’s influence can still be felt everywhere. And the young men filling the stadium seats to watch the women playing are still at risk of being lured into fighting for the insurgency. But the hope for many in Somalia’s basketball community is that the more Abdullahi and her peers play ball with those young men, the less appealing al-Shabab’s extremist messaging becomes.“A lot of change is coming,” Abdullahi says. “You’ll find in empty areas women are playing basketball now, more encouragement is there. A lot of things for women are starting to improve.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub. For weekly updates, you can sign up to the Women & Girls Hub email list."

On the crumbling concrete court in Mogadishu, the simple act of young women shooting hoops dilutes al-Shabab’s attempts to spread its extremist ideology, influencing the attitudes of the young men in the stands – potential recruiting targets for the terror group – in the process.“Somali women, we have always been powerful,” says Ridwan Abdullahi Ali, her bright green headscarf draped over her Hagen T-shirt. “Our playing basketball is making people talk in our society about girls’ roles and how we can do these things, like physical things, that the boys are doing.”Ali began playing handball and then basketball when she was 20, after she passed by the stadium and saw her neighbor, Fatuma Ahmed Warsame, a respected basketball player among young people in Mogadishu, playing with her team. After sitting down to watch their practice, Ali came back the next day, and the next, until Warsame convinced her to pick up the ball and join them.“That day I just carried the ball with me. You need to dribble it, but I ran with it instead and people were laughing, telling me I couldn’t just run with it,” Ali says, smiling and bouncing a slightly deflated basketball expertly between her legs.At 22 years old, Ali is part of a younger generation in Somalia that grew up during the country’s civil war, which began in 1991, and the subsequent rise of al-Shabab. The group once controlled much of Mogadishu and – despite the presence of roughly 20,000 African Union peacekeepers – still controls large swaths of the country.Under al-Shabab’s rule, women’s rights in Somalia, once a beacon of gender equality in the region, were nearly completely reversed. Prior to the civil war and insurgency, women wore bikinis and sipped cappuccinos at Lido Beach, a popular hangout just down the road from the sports stadium. By 2012, at the height of the al-Shabab insurgency, women were banned from wearing bras, working and walking or talking in public with nonrelated men. In the large pockets of Mogadishu that were controlled by al-Shabab, women wearing pants – much less playing sports – was an offense punishable by death.“When al-Shabab came suddenly, we were not allowed to play any basketball,” says Mudey. A veteran of the court at Wiish Stadium, she started playing basketball in 1982, when she was 15, and went on to play for the Somali national women’s basketball team. At that time, she would walk in her sports clothes, hair uncovered, to the court to play.“Life was normal, people here were peaceful and open-minded,” she says. “That was a different era, very different from today.”Now Mudey’s players walk to the stadium with their sports attire hidden under colorful abayas, their bright orange and yellow trainers peeking out from beneath long, loose-fitting skirts. At Lido Beach, women have to swim in their full dresses. The socially imposed dress code is a testament to al-Shabab’s lasting impact on the city. Though the group no longer controls many neighborhoods of Mogadishu, after African Union peacekeepers pushed them out of the city in 2012, religious leaders – who became hard-line at the height of the insurgency – are still speaking out against female athletes. Since the girls began playing again, Somali clerics have been releasing public statements admonishing young women for playing basketball, declaring the act “un-Islamic” and “a threat to their faith.”“Some people still say … religion doesn’t allow a woman playing ball. Their argument is that the coach is a man, the referee is a man, the audience are men. That’s their justification,” says team captain Fadumo Ali Abdirahman, 30. “It is difficult for the community to accept us playing, but you need to force your way. Most of the girls you see here are probably sneaking out of the house to come and play.”And with 70 percent of the country’s population under the age of 30, much of the discourse surrounding women’s roles in Somali society is being held not in the halls of government offices nor in soft-carpeted mosques, but in the parks and on the beaches and basketball courts where young people are once again beginning to gather and talk, as their parents’ generation did before the civil war.Today, at the sports stadium, both the women’s and men’s teams practice together. As Abdirahman blows her whistle and the girls run to the side to huddle, a member of the boys’ team grabs the ball Nimo Abdullahi is dribbling, starting a spontaneous one-on-one game.“You always have people who have that negative attitude about women playing, but when you play all the guys will cheer for you and clap for you,” Abdullahi says. “They are happy during the games.”Al-Shabab’s hold on the capital may be diminished, but the group’s influence can still be felt everywhere. And the young men filling the stadium seats to watch the women playing are still at risk of being lured into fighting for the insurgency. But the hope for many in Somalia’s basketball community is that the more Abdullahi and her peers play ball with those young men, the less appealing al-Shabab’s extremist messaging becomes.“A lot of change is coming,” Abdullahi says. “You’ll find in empty areas women are playing basketball now, more encouragement is there. A lot of things for women are starting to improve.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub. For weekly updates, you can sign up to the Women & Girls Hub email list."

Standing at the side of Mogadishu’s dilapidated basketball and handball stadium, her bright blue “Hagen” team jersey shimmering under the unrelenting Somali sun, it’s hard to imagine her as anything but an athlete.Only a few months ago, Mudey had stood in that same spot, teeming with nerves. It was the Somali women’s handball championship game. With only four minutes to go and the stadium’s seats packed with spectators, the score was tied.“When the game is happening, you’re so nervous and so anxious,” she says. “And as a coach, there’s only so much you can do.”A slow 60 seconds passed. Then another. With two minutes left, a Hagen player scored, winning the championship game.Thirty years ago, women playing sports at the Wiish Stadium was nothing remarkable.

In the interest of protecting American jobs, the order threatens state and local governments’ ability to plan for extreme weather events and will make it even more difficult for the United States to achieve the goals laid out in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. All of this may sound like a matter of politics, but for the Rev. James Martin, a Catholic priest and the editor at large of America magazine, climate change is at its core a moral and religious issue.In a video for America Magazine, the Jesuit priest spoke about three reasons why “policies that fail to protect our planet are not only against Catholic teaching but are also immoral.”First, Martin said, Christians believe that all creation is a gift from God and that humans are given the task of caring for the earth. Secondly, climate change disproportionately affects poor people and those in the developing world. “Remember, Jesus said that we would be judged on how we treat the poor. That includes how our decisions on climate change affect them,” Martin said.And lastly, Martin believes that not considering the effects of climate change is a form of selfishness or indifference. “You cannot care for creation if your heart lacks compassion for your fellow human beings,” he said. The priest’s line of thought mirrors that of Pope Francis, who wrote about the moral case for addressing climate change in his 2015 encyclical, “Laudato Si.” In that document, Francis linked climate change to human activity and calls on Catholics to make caring for the environment a top priority.  Francis and other leaders at the Vatican have shown strong support for the Paris climate agreement.On Thursday, a top Vatican official said that he hoped “dissenting voices” in the United States would encourage Trump to reconsider his environmental policies. “We as a Church, are full of hope that (Trump’s positions) will change,” Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, who has advised the pope on environmental and immigration issues, told Reuters.

A month later, Rhode Island Bishop Thomas J. Tobin posted a message on Facebook discouraging the practice.“Help is always right,” Pope Francis said in response to a question about almsgiving. He qualified that by saying: “Certainly, it is not a good thing just to throw a few coins at the poor. The gesture is important, helping those who ask, looking them in the eyes and touching their hands. Tossing the money without looking in the eyes, that is not the gesture of a Christian.”In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Tobin echoed the pontiff’s sentiment but urged against giving money to homeless people altogether.“It is a practice that enables a few dishonest individuals to prey upon the compassion of others to ask for money, even when they don’t have legitimate needs,” Tobin said in a three-point argument.The bishop’s warning that “dishonest individuals” prey on the kindness of strangers parallels an argument Francis said he’s heard before.“There are many arguments to justify oneself when you do not give alms. ‘But what [if] I give money and then he spends it on a glass of wine?’” the pope told the Milan newspaper. “If a glass of wine is the only happiness he has in life, that is fine.” The Argentinian pope has demonstrated a deep affinity for those who are homeless and disenfranchised. He has on a number of occasions opened the doors of the Vatican to homeless people, invited them to Mass and recently celebrated his 80th birthday by dining with several homeless individuals.”People who live on the streets understand immediately if there is true interest on the part of the other person or when there is, I do not want to say that sentiment of compassion but certainly of suffering,” Francis told Scarp de’ tenis.Tobin didn’t refer to the pope’s interview comments in his post, and a spokesperson for the bishop told the Associated Press the Facebook message wasn’t intended as a response to Pope Francis.Tobin even included a quote from the pontiff to back up his argument. “Pope Francis has said: ‘The great danger, or temptation, when aiding the poor, is falling into an attitude of protective paternalism that, at the end of the day, does not allow them to grow,’” the bishop wrote.Francis addressed the issue of paternalism in his comments to Scarp de’ tenis, saying almsgiving should never be about “offloading one’s own sense of guilt.”“It is touching, looking at our inner poverty that the Lord understands and saves,” the pope said. “Because we all have inner poverty.”"

Author and activist Cleve Jones, whose book, When We Rise, inspired the recent ABC miniseries of the same name, also shared the news on his Facebook page. Baker, who was born in Kansas, designed the first rainbow flag in 1978 after he was approached by San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk to create a symbol for the LGBTQ community. Just months before his assassination, Milk rode in the city’s June pride parade under Baker’s original flag, which featured eight colored stripes: hot pink, red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, indigo and violet. The original design changed to the iconic, six-barred rainbow flag in 1979. “The rainbow came to mind almost instantly as an obvious expression of diversity and acceptance,” Baker told CBS Chicago in 2012. “It’s beautiful, all of the colors, even the colors you can’t see. That really fit us as a people because we are all of the colors. Our sexuality is all of the colors. We are all the genders, races and ages.” In a second Facebook post, Jones noted that a memorial would be held Friday in San Francisco’s Castro neighborhood. Like what you see?

68,POLITICS,Missouri GOP Wants To Keep Voter ID Policy But Not Pay To Tell People About It,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missouri-voter-id_us_58deaccae4b0b3918c834456,"""This is the whole playbook of voter suppression.""",2017-03-31,"The state Capitol building in Jefferson City, Missouri. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58debd561400002000072ae5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Missouri voters approved a voter ID measure last year, lawmakers in the state promised to pay for costs associated with implementing the policy and educating residents about it. Now that they’re faced with a budget shortfall, however, Republicans are looking for ways to curb such spending. Republicans in Missouri championed voter ID law for years before voters approved a ballot measure to require people to display identification at the polls. The measure came with the caveat that the state would provide free identification and documentation to anyone who needed it. Several other states with voter ID laws have made similar promises.Democrat Jason Kander, who was serving as Missouri’s secretary of state at the time, estimated last year that implementing the policy and educating people about it would cost $5.2 million. The law goes into effect on June 1.Kander told The Huffington Post that he shared that figure with his successor, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft (R), and that Ashcroft didn’t raise any objections. But Ashcroft drastically cut his funding request for the law to $1.4 million as state lawmakers debated how to fill a budget shortfall of $456 million. Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) requested just $300,000 for it.Ashcroft has said he plans to save money by cutting television ads and direct mailings to registered voters in the state, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. He has chosen to rely on personal interactions with voters and partnerships with community groups. However, Democrats and other critics of the voter ID requirement say the law will likely generate enormous amounts of confusion. They argue that the Republicans’ current plan is inadequate and doesn’t show a real commitment to making sure every valid voter can make their voice heard. “I think that it’s absolutely ridiculous that politicians ― who, when they run campaigns either locally or statewide, spend insane amounts of money on direct mail and TV advertising ― say, ‘Well, we don’t need those things to reach voters,’” said state Rep. Peter Meredith (D). He recently tried to add $3 million to funding for the law, but the move was blocked.Even states that have invested in extensive outreach efforts have seen considerable confusion among voters and DMV workers, said Denise Lieberman, a senior attorney in the voter protection program at The Advancement Project. The organization has challenged photo ID laws in other states.“In North Carolina, they sent three direct mailings to every single voter and we argued in court that that was not enough,” she said. “Jay Ashcroft’s budget doesn’t even allow for television advertising of the new law. At best, the most education voters are gonna receive is seeing a poster when they walk into some place. They’re not gonna get anything in the mail. They’re not gonna see any information on TV. What we’ve seen in other states is that that is a recipe for disaster.” Such laws disproportionally hurt people of color, young people, low-income voters, seniors and voters with disabilities, she said. Missouri isn’t the only state where Republicans insist that they can implement voter ID at a low cost. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate (R) has said he won’t request any additional money to implement a voter ID law if it is approved by the legislature. Pate has estimated that it will cost $1 million to implement the law, provide as many free IDs as necessary and educate the public. Democrats and critics of the proposal, however, have accused Pate of underestimating how much funding he’ll really need to roll out the program. Kander estimated that 224,000 registered voters lacked acceptable voter identification in 2014. Republicans have accused him of inflating this number to make the law look bad, according to the Post-Dispatch. “We stand by our numbers, and [Republicans] have provided no facts to dispute them. They just say that they don’t think they’re right,” Kander said. “Now, all of a sudden that they have to actually do it, suddenly they’ve come up with different math, although it’s interesting that they won’t really show their work.”“This is the whole playbook of voter suppression, which is you create obstacles to voting and then you create obstacles to the obstacles. That’s what they’re doing here,” he added. “Now these folks in Jefferson City are just making up numbers now to try and fit within a budget. And that’s just not how this is supposed to work. Their legislation was that they were promising that they were gonna meet to making sure everybody knew how to navigate the process and they’re not doing that.”In-person voter fraud in the United States is extremely rare. Still, Republicans in a number of states have adopted voter ID laws and argued that they’re necessary to fight perceptions of voter fraud. But in many cases, Republicans are the ones who have created that perception.The negotiations over funding in Missouri indicate that Republicans have never been serious about making sure all eligible voters could vote, Lieberman said.“This budget process demonstrates how disingenuous lawmakers have been in promoting this photo ID law and in making promises to take care of all voters to ensure they’re not kept away from the polls,” she said. “This budget makes it impossible for them to keep that promise and it reveals this law for what, members of the voter protection coalition and other voters knew all along is that this is a law that’s designed and intended precisely to do what it’s gonna do and that is keep voters from voting.”Even if the voter ID measure is adequately funded, some people will inevitably face obstacles in the process of obtaining required documentation. Many people, Lieberman said, may be discouraged from going to the polls simply because they won’t be sure if they have the proper identification. “The result of all of this is that valid, eligible voters are going to have more difficulty being able to cast a ballot,” Lieberman said. “The ultimate crime of this budgetary insufficiency is that valid voters are gonna pay the price for lawmakers’ failure to fund this law.”Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said when the voter ID law goes into effect. It is effective June 1."

The decision comes after a year of aggressive crusading to shut down the prison from the #CLOSErikers campaign, which was founded by activist and former Rikers prisoner Glenn E. Martin.In a statement sent to The Huffington Post, Martin said that he’s “grateful” the mayor has realized that the only solution to the prison’s problematic nature is to close it.“For too long, New Yorkers – especially poor people of color – have languished in this grist mill, where human rights abuses are routine,” Martin said. “Countless failed attempts at incremental reform have proven that the only viable solution is to close Rikers.”The campaign, which Martin founded in 2016, has done everything from follow the mayor to Florida to ensure he hears their concerns surrounding the prison to create a commercial calling the mayor out on his inaction around Rikers.Martin, who was imprisoned at Rikers twice and currently has a brother in the prison, said the mayor’s announcement was “especially meaningful” to him.“Mayor de Blasio has finally heard the demands of the #CLOSErikers campaign, and we thank him for recognizing that the problem with Rikers is Rikers,” he continued.Martin is also a member of the Lippman Commission which, in a 97 page report provided to the mayor, outlined ways to successfully go about closure of the prison. Aside from his intent to close the island and open other jails in its place, the mayor’s full plan has not yet been released. But is expected to include some of the suggestions from the commission’s report.You can read more about the mayor’s announcement here. "

Or, at least, Osgood “Oz” Perkins, the guy who played Dorky David, is a movie director ― twice and counting. He’s also the son of Anthony Perkins, aka “Psycho” creepster Norman Bates, and the great-grandson of pioneering fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who introduced the wrap dress in the 1930s. “Legally Blonde” fandom aside, the 43-year-old Oz Perkins is only now breaking through.The nightmarish psychological thriller “The Blackcoat’s Daughter” opens in select theaters and premieres on VOD platforms this weekend. Purchased by then-burgeoning indie distributor A24 at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, it’s the first feature Perkins directed, but the second to unleash its chills onto the public. After Perkins turned down Netflix’s pitch to acquire “Blackcoat’s Daughter,” the streaming service, seeking to build its library of originals, gave Perkins carte blanche to make a movie of his choosing. Out of that came another psychodrama, “I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,” which premiered at 2016’s Toronto Film Fest and debuted on Netflix one month later. Maybe growing up as the son of Norman Bates ― and playing a young version of the oedipal murderer in 1983’s “Psycho II” ― has invaded Perkins’ psyche. “The Blackcoat’s Daughter” and “I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House” are both twisted tales about women experiencing supernatural and/or demonic terrors. But Perkins, who at 17 wanted to be the next Tim Burton, hasn’t relied on family connections for gain, nor has he felt pressure to make a name for himself in Hollywood beyond simply wanting to “resonate” with his artist-heavy ancestry. Still, we’re talking about someone who considered Sue Mengers, the storied talent agent to whom Barbra Streisand served as maid of honor, a de facto aunt. (In addition to Perkins’ papa, Mengers represented Paul Newman, Candice Bergen, Cher, Gene Hackman, Gore Vidal, Faye Dunaway and others.) As a kid, he and younger brother Elvis put on plays for houseguests like Clint Eastwood and Judy Collins. Perkins is also a guy who sought industry counsel from Mike Nichols, the director of “The Graduate” and “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” who, after Perkins’ father died from AIDS-related pneumonia, invited Perkins to work for him on the set of the 1994 hit “Wolf,” starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. Later, he found mentorship from “The Omen” and “Bird on a Wire” screenwriter David Seltzer.“It’s being handed a very good cast to grow up around, but I’m not scene-y at all,” Perkins told The Huffington Post last week, reflecting on a life surrounded by luminaries. “That’s not my thing. I’d just as soon be at home.” (He swears the only person who would still catch him starstruck is Bob Dylan.)In his mid-20s, before realizing acting was not the path for him, Perkins landed supporting parts in “Legally Blonde” and “Secretary.” He stood in line to audition just like everyone else ― specifically for Dorky David, in the case of “Blonde.” “Not Another Teen Movie” found Perkins playing an illustrious role credited as Uninterested Guy.But tragedy intervened when his mother ― actress, photographer and socialite Berry Berenson ― died in one of the hijacked planes that crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. That morning, Perkins was preparing to shoot a guest arc on a sitcom. He never made it to work.It took another decade, during which he had two children and got sober, for him to recuperate enough to return to what he’d longed to do upon first starting college at New York University: direct. “You get knocked sideways enough that when you straighten up again, you’re like, ‘Oh, right, a lot of shit’s wrong. A lot of stuff’s misplaced,’” Perkins said. “In the rapture that follows some cataclysmic event like that, you’re in a daze for a while. But then, when you wake up, you really wake up. You wake up in a way that you’re recalibrated.”It was an enough-with-the-bullshit situation, Perkins said in regard to his acting pursuits, for which he realized he never had passion. (Though he did appear on “Alias” and in the 2009 “Star Trek” reboot along the way.) Recalling his Tim Burton aspirations, he wrote “The Blackcoat’s Daughter” and “I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,” casting veteran youngsters Kiernan Shipka, Emma Roberts and Lucy Boynton in the former, which they shot in Ottawa, Canada, during negative-40-degree temperatures, and Ruth Wilson and Bob Balaban in the latter. Perkins dedicated “I Am the Pretty Thing” to his father and incorporated “Psycho” parallels in “Blackcoat,” chiefly the use of a dagger as murder weapon. Shipka’s bedeviled boarding-school character’s knife plunges toward the camera, reminiscent of the famous Hitchcock shower scene starring Janet Leigh. Perkins’ brother, a singer-songwriter, composed spooky scores for both films. It’s still a family affair.Now, hoping to secure a director-driven project that crosses over the way “Get Out,” “The Witch” and “It Follows” did, Perkins is working on another female psychodrama, a Satanic-panic thriller set in the 1950s. He’s also prepping a TV show, because that’s what it takes to be make a splash these days, right? (Even his idol David Lynch knows that.) In between, “Legally Bonde” enthusiasts still recognize him as good ol’ Dorky David, who once wavered on whether to stake his Harvard classmate’s life on an Aristotle quote.“I really didn’t get my footing until recently,” he said. “I’m careful not to get too flaky about all of it, but once you open yourself to ― I don’t want to say a higher power, but once you believe that the universe is essentially organized, once you believe that stuff is actually out there waiting for you to pick it off of a tree, you tap into allowing for that.

71,ENTERTAINMENT,"What Do Norman Bates, 'Legally Blonde' And Barbra Streisand Have In Common?",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oz-perkins-the-blackcoats-daughter_us_58dd05eae4b05eae031d78a1,Oz Perkins.,2017-03-31,"Oz Perkins attends the ""Legally Blonde"" premiere in Los Angeles on June 26, 2001.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd72a01d0000f42c7d179c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_47_1329_1205%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Dorky David, the fumbling orphan dewormer whom Reese Witherspoon (or Elle Woods, rather) slapped on the street in “Legally Blonde,” is now a movie director. Or, at least, Osgood “Oz” Perkins, the guy who played Dorky David, is a movie director ― twice and counting. He’s also the son of Anthony Perkins, aka “Psycho” creepster Norman Bates, and the great-grandson of pioneering fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who introduced the wrap dress in the 1930s. “Legally Blonde” fandom aside, the 43-year-old Oz Perkins is only now breaking through.The nightmarish psychological thriller “The Blackcoat’s Daughter” opens in select theaters and premieres on VOD platforms this weekend. Purchased by then-burgeoning indie distributor A24 at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, it’s the first feature Perkins directed, but the second to unleash its chills onto the public. After Perkins turned down Netflix’s pitch to acquire “Blackcoat’s Daughter,” the streaming service, seeking to build its library of originals, gave Perkins carte blanche to make a movie of his choosing. Out of that came another psychodrama, “I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,” which premiered at 2016’s Toronto Film Fest and debuted on Netflix one month later. Maybe growing up as the son of Norman Bates ― and playing a young version of the oedipal murderer in 1983’s “Psycho II” ― has invaded Perkins’ psyche. “The Blackcoat’s Daughter” and “I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House” are both twisted tales about women experiencing supernatural and/or demonic terrors. But Perkins, who at 17 wanted to be the next Tim Burton, hasn’t relied on family connections for gain, nor has he felt pressure to make a name for himself in Hollywood beyond simply wanting to “resonate” with his artist-heavy ancestry. Still, we’re talking about someone who considered Sue Mengers, the storied talent agent to whom Barbra Streisand served as maid of honor, a de facto aunt. (In addition to Perkins’ papa, Mengers represented Paul Newman, Candice Bergen, Cher, Gene Hackman, Gore Vidal, Faye Dunaway and others.) As a kid, he and younger brother Elvis put on plays for houseguests like Clint Eastwood and Judy Collins. Perkins is also a guy who sought industry counsel from Mike Nichols, the director of “The Graduate” and “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” who, after Perkins’ father died from AIDS-related pneumonia, invited Perkins to work for him on the set of the 1994 hit “Wolf,” starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer.

72,POLITICS,"Already Struggling, Farms Stand To Lose Under Trump Trade Agenda",Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/farms-trump-trade_us_58de976fe4b0ba359594aab4,Farmers don't want to lose access to foreign markets.,2017-03-31,John Deere has laid off factory workers in recent years. REUTERS/Rick Wilking,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58de9afb2c00002100ff197f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While the broader U.S. economy has been humming along, the farm economy is entering its fourth straight year of declining incomes and rising debt, thanks to low prices for crops like corn and wheat. “We are on the cusp of another 1980s-style farm depression, where thousands of family farmers would lose their historical lands,” said Joe Logan, 68, who farms 450 acres in northeast Ohio.President Donald Trump has said hardly anything about agriculture policy, though he’s made a lot of noise about trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. That worries some farmers. While Trump complains that the U.S. as a whole imports much more than it exports, the farming sector has boasted a trade surplus for decades because people in other countries buy a lot of American crops. “Talking about renegotiating NAFTA causes people some concern because from the agriculture perspective, NAFTA wasn’t a bad agreement at all,” said Joe Outlaw, a professor and agriculture expert at Texas A&M University. “What the president’s said about redoing trade agreements has caught everyone’s attention in agriculture.”So far, the Trump administration has taken only baby steps on trade policy. Though Trump said he’d ditch NAFTA at the beginning of his presidency, it was only this week that his administration started making moves, and experts said the administration’s plans appear relatively modest. But Trump’s harsh rhetoric has already had consequences. Lawmakers in Mexico, for instance, have proposed importing corn from countries other than the U.S. If Mexico stopped buying U.S. corn, prices for that commodity could drop even further, because the unsold corn would exacerbate the oversupply problem that’s already hurting prices. “When we start bashing our trading partners and start threatening them,” Logan said, “we know we have the potential to screw up a market that is already in pretty bad shape.”Logan and his brother raise corn, soybeans, wheat, hay and beef cattle. He said they lost money farming last year, and the outlook is not so good this year, either. “If we’re lucky, and we don’t have serious machinery breakdowns or problems in the course of the year, we can plant crops and harvest them and just about pay our bills,” Logan said.Farmers’ woes affect other workers, too. John Deere, a big manufacturer of tractors and other agricultural machinery, laid off more than 2,000 workers last year. The company, which is publicly traded, said in its most recent annual disclosure to investors that it expected agricultural equipment sales in North America to fall 5 percent to 10 percent this year, citing “low commodity prices and weak farm incomes.”Tom Ralston, who represents John Deere workers as president of the local United Auto Workers union in Waterloo, Iowa, said he’s optimistic that things will get better ― partly because some workers had recently been recalled to work. “My hope is that we’ve plateaued out and the only to go from here is up,” Ralston said. He cited the threat of trade policy and also domestic policy as reasons for concern, since tax changes, for instance, can play heavily into a farmer’s decision to buy a tractor. “If we have bad economic policies come out of Washington, it could drastically affect us.”The federal government operates an array of programs designed to offset the risks of running a business sensitive to the vagaries of nature. Yet Trump, despite the support he’s gotten from rural America, has seemed indifferent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s farm safety net. He nominated his agriculture secretary last among other Cabinet positions, and he proposed cutting the department’s budget by 21 percent. The Republican chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, which has been drafting changes to agriculture policy for next year, blasted the Trump budget. “I think it is very important to remember that net farm income is down 50 percent from where it stood just four years ago,” Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) said. Anne Weir Schechinger said farmers’ laments are overblown. Schechinger is a policy analyst with the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that generally argues agribusiness is overly subsidized by the government. “Most farmers depend on off-farm income,” Schechinger said, pointing to USDA data showing that despite declines in farm incomes, farm households are expected to earn more this year, thanks to money from other jobs, such as those held by farmers’ spouses. Experts tend to dispute the idea that the current agriculture downturn is as bad as the one in the 1980s ― a crisis partly triggered by U.S. farmers losing access to the Soviet Union’s wheat market. But it’s still pretty bad, said Brent Gloy, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University. He said the USDA data on farm household incomes doesn’t reflect reality for the subset of operations that grow the most food.  “If you look at the people who produce 90 percent of the farm products, they’re feeling the stress of [low commodity prices] significantly,” Gloy said. “They’re much less likely to have off-farm jobs and off-farm income.”Gloy and Schechinger agree that while farm incomes are down and debt is rising, debt levels are still near historic lows, and farmland remains relatively valuable. Plus, the downturn that started in mid-2013 followed several years of strong growth that put money in farmers’ pockets. Barry Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, said the real problem is that farmers lack economic power due to decades of corporate consolidation. With fewer and fewer companies dominating food distribution and retail, for instance, food growers have diminishing ability to set prices for the crops they grow.  “Most farmers are selling into markets that are really not markets at all, they’re selling on a contract basis to corporations,” Lynn said. “They [the corporations] really don’t have any competition.” The New America Foundation, a liberal think tank, has reported in recent years that consolidation in the food industry has not only hurt farmers, but also agriculture workers and consumers, who’ve been left with fewer choices in the supermarket. The foundation faulted the Obama administration for doing nothing to stop increasing monopolization. Nobody expects the Trump administration to be any more aggressive on antitrust issues. “The system now is designed to put all the pain on the little guy at every single level,” Lynn said. There has also been a lot of consolidation of farms themselves, as larger operations increasingly dominate agriculture production. Just 2.9 percent of U.S. farms accounted for 42 percent of all production in 2015, according to the USDA. The median size of farms has more than doubled since 1982, to 1,234 acres as of 2012.Logan said he has no spouse and no other job, though he does serve as the president of the Ohio Farmers Union. He and his brother are the fifth generation of Logans to manage their farm in Kinsman, Ohio. Logan said his son and daughters have grown and moved to more urban settings. He’s talked to them about returning to work on the farm someday, and they like the idea, sort of. “They all understand you can’t make any money or support a family doing that,” he said. “I’ve told them that I’m going to try to hold onto the farm as long as I can. That’s my objective right now. We’ll see if we’re successful or not.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misnamed Anne Weir Schechinger. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dd99e11400002000072806.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s executive order on climate change threatens state and local governments’ ability to prepare for and cope with extreme weather events, climate and planning experts warn. The executive order, issued Tuesday, goes beyond undoing Obama-era commitments to clean energy. It revokes an Obama-era executive order aimed at planning for natural disasters linked to climate change, including sea-level rise, droughts, hurricanes, wildfires and extreme heat.That now-revoked 2013 executive order, entitled “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change,” charged federal agencies with helping states and localities improve resilience to natural disasters and established a task force of state, local and tribal leaders dedicated to determining needs.Trump’s action could sever those governments from important federal data and tools to help them prepare for extreme weather, experts said. “It’s almost as if we think if we don’t have the information, it won’t happen,” said Rachel Cleetus, a lead economist and climate policy manager with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “But that’s not true. We can bury our heads in the sand, but the facts are still the facts. All we’re doing is preventing people from being able to take protective measures ahead of time.”The task force established by the 2013 executive order has played an important role guiding cities and states in climate-smart planning. In 2014, the task force released recommendations for how federal agencies can aid the rest of the country, and helped develop the Climate Resilience Toolkit, a continually updated online database with climate data and projections, case studies on responses to past disasters, and directories of experts and funding opportunities. The toolkit was assembled with climate information gathered by federal agencies.The toolkit has helped places like low-lying Tybee Island, Georgia, prepare for the impacts of sea-level rise, which can contribute to more frequent and widespread flooding. Last year, the island’s city council approved plans to improve the only road to the island, retrofit stormwater drainage systems and stabilize shorelines to block high water. Cleetus said it’s unclear what revoking the Obama order will mean in practice. Nor is it certain how far the Trump administration will go to halt climate-preparedness efforts at federal agencies, or to curb access to resources like the Climate Resilience Toolkit. But Trump’s order doesn’t bode well.“It really goes after some of the core missions of these agencies,” Cleetus said, pointing to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s help with coastal flooding and wildfires as an example. “It’s terrifying to see a government that actually wants to go backwards when there’s so much work to do,” she added.Revoking the Obama executive order may be part of a twofold assault on some federal agencies. Those that help with climate change response and resilience efforts, such as FEMA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, all are threatened with steep cuts under Trump’s budget proposal.“It’s not some theoretical threat in the future,” Cleetus said. “We’re already experiencing these impacts, so it’s a real dereliction of responsibility to say they essentially don’t care, that they’re not going to help.”The possible effects of climate change have already been widespread: Years of severe drought in California and other Western states followed by a record-wet winter, a series of “1-in-1,000-year” floods last summer, and a decade of record-low Arctic sea ice. Trump’s order “sets everyone up for a lot more of these disasters,” warned Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.Some big cities may be spared. Steven Cohen, executive director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute and a former EPA official, said he expects efforts like New York City’s nearly $20 billion plan to fortify the city will move forward. “This will continue without the federal government, but would benefit from federal infrastructure funding and additional federal funding on the science and engineering of climate change and climate science,” Cohen said. “Even though removing these federal policies is not helpful, real estate developers, insurance companies, power companies and many other organizations are assessing the financial risks of climate change and factoring it into their decision making.”Trump’s action could be especially bad news for smaller communities lacking the resources to collect their own data, said climatologist Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University.“The regions with those who are least well off, who have the least adaptive capacity and the least resilience ... rural regions and the South,” are most likely to suffer, Mann said. “Many of the very people who voted for Trump are being directly hurt by his policies.”Want to know more about how Trump’s executive order will affect efforts to prepare for the impacts of climate change?

75,PARENTS,Woman's Viral Blog Post Celebrates Single Dads Who Do It All,Emily McCombs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/womans-viral-blog-post-celebrates-single-dads-who-do-it-all_us_58de74a1e4b0ba3595946f43,"""My dad handled everything: periods, shaving, broken hearts.""",2017-03-31,"When Tiana Sheehan's mother passed away, her dad took on both the “mom” and “dad” roles. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58de7b741d0000cf3b7d19da.jpeg?cache=Op08srxs6v&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tiana Sheehan was 9 years old when her mother died after a long battle with lung cancer. “The first Christmas after she passed, my dad had five quilts made out of her pajamas ― my mom LOVED pjs ― and gave them to my sisters and my nephew, along with letters my mom had written all of us before she passed,” Sheehan told The Huffington Post.He also took on the tough job of handling both the “mom” and “dad” roles, including dealing with “girly” things like periods and leg-shaving. It was the latter that inspired her recent post on the Love What Matters Facebook page in celebration of her dad and other single fathers like him.Inspired by seeing a mother talking to her daughter about shaving and razors in a store, she shared the memory of when her father taught her how to shave her legs. “I remember coming up to dad and being so embarrassed to ask him for help, but man, did he handle it like a champ!” she wrote. “For a moment he put his head down; and then he turned the TV off, took me into the bathroom, gave me a new blade on his razor, gave me his shaving cream, and taught me how to shave my legs.”Sheehan says that single parents don’t get the credit they deserve and that hers kept her from ever feeling that she was missing out.“He handled everything with humor and grace, like when I accidentally shaved my eyebrow off because I didn’t know to tweeze them, or when 11-year-old me accidentally bought a package of thongs instead of bikini-style undies,” she told The Huffington Post. “He brought tampons to marching band practice. He surprised me and snuck a prom dress home in the trunk of our car that we couldn’t afford after I fell in love with it at the store. I don’t know how he handled it all, but he loves me and my sisters, so he did.”She says that because he never acted uncomfortable or inconvenienced, she rarely felt embarrassed to ask her dad for help with intimate things. And whenever she asked for advice or help, he always ended his response with a hug or an “I’m proud of you, child-of-mine!”“Looking back now, I can’t believe I was able to talk to him about the things I did, but in the moment I was just asking my dad for help,” she told HuffPost. “He bought me books to teach me about periods and self care, he took me school clothes shopping every year and would give me a bear hug when I thought I was ‘too fat’ to find anything. He didn’t understand why I wanted to dye my hair but always told me it looked nice.”Ultimately, Sheehan used the post, which has been liked over 26,000 times, as a “big public thank you” to her father for “never, ever, ever being too much of a man to be my mom.” Many commenters have responded with stories of their own awesome single dads.

It was the latter that inspired her recent post on the Love What Matters Facebook page in celebration of her dad and other single fathers like him.Inspired by seeing a mother talking to her daughter about shaving and razors in a store, she shared the memory of when her father taught her how to shave her legs. “I remember coming up to dad and being so embarrassed to ask him for help, but man, did he handle it like a champ!” she wrote. “For a moment he put his head down; and then he turned the TV off, took me into the bathroom, gave me a new blade on his razor, gave me his shaving cream, and taught me how to shave my legs.”Sheehan says that single parents don’t get the credit they deserve and that hers kept her from ever feeling that she was missing out.“He handled everything with humor and grace, like when I accidentally shaved my eyebrow off because I didn’t know to tweeze them, or when 11-year-old me accidentally bought a package of thongs instead of bikini-style undies,” she told The Huffington Post. “He brought tampons to marching band practice. He surprised me and snuck a prom dress home in the trunk of our car that we couldn’t afford after I fell in love with it at the store. I don’t know how he handled it all, but he loves me and my sisters, so he did.”She says that because he never acted uncomfortable or inconvenienced, she rarely felt embarrassed to ask her dad for help with intimate things. And whenever she asked for advice or help, he always ended his response with a hug or an “I’m proud of you, child-of-mine!”“Looking back now, I can’t believe I was able to talk to him about the things I did, but in the moment I was just asking my dad for help,” she told HuffPost. “He bought me books to teach me about periods and self care, he took me school clothes shopping every year and would give me a bear hug when I thought I was ‘too fat’ to find anything. He didn’t understand why I wanted to dye my hair but always told me it looked nice.”Ultimately, Sheehan used the post, which has been liked over 26,000 times, as a “big public thank you” to her father for “never, ever, ever being too much of a man to be my mom.” Many commenters have responded with stories of their own awesome single dads. Sheehan’s father has now seen the post she wrote and she says he seemed pretty surprised by how big it’s gotten. “He said I made raising me easy and he’s lucky to be my dad, two things I’m lucky enough to have heard my whole life,” she said. “Before we got off the phone, I got a little choked up and said ‘We made it, Dad.

77,QUEER VOICES,Candace Cameron Bure: ‘Loving Jesus Doesn’t Mean I Hate Gay People’,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/candace-cameron-lgbtq_us_58de942de4b0ba359594a600,"The actress got caught in a heated exchange with a ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" star.",2017-03-31,"“I’m not homophobic and [it’s] always sad when people think otherwise,"" Candace Cameron Bure said. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58de94de2c00002000ff1967.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Fuller House” actress Candace Cameron Bure and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” veteran Bianca del Rio engaged in a heated Instagram exchange Thursday... over a T-shirt. The feud began when Bure, 40, posted the following photo to her Instagram account. The phrase “not today, Satan” was popularized by Rio, who said it on an episode of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” in 2014. The drag queen has a merchandise line emblazoned with the phrase, and it also happens to be the name of her recent tour. Once Rio caught wind of Bure’s photo, she quickly reposted it to her own Instagram, along with a caption blasting the former “View” co-host, who is known for her conservative Christian views, as “homophobic.” Many of the drag queen’s followers then headed over to Bure’s page, where they blasted the actress in the comments below her photo for wearing the shirt, which does not appear to be one of the many sold on Rio’s website.“People of the LGBTQ community are tired of straight cis people taking things from us and using it for their own and not crediting community,” one person wrote. Added another: “To go against gay rights, to sh*t on our lives, and then parade yourself around in OUR clothing and OUR phrases is insulting.”Still, others came to the star’s defense. “Just because she’s Christian doesn’t mean she’s homophobic,” one person wrote. “She didn’t even say anything bad, it’s just how it got interpreted.”The furor then prompted Bure to write to Rio directly on Instagram. The drag queen shared a screenshot of the comment.“I’m not homophobic and [it’s] always sad when people think otherwise. Loving Jesus doesn’t mean I hate gay people or anyone,” Bure wrote. “You sent a bunch of hateful people to my page writing horrible things.” She then urged Rio to “spread love and kindness, even when you disagree with people.”Of course, Bure has a checkered history when it comes to the LGBTQ community. In 2015, she defended bakeries who turn away same-sex couples looking to purchase wedding cakes, arguing that business owners’ decision to reject those customers was “freedom of association” and “First Amendment rights.” She also tweeted her support of Chick-fil-A after the fast food chain ignited a media firestorm when its president, Dan Cathy, spoke out against same-sex marriage. Last year, however, she said she’d be open to a gay plotline on “Fuller House,” noting, “I’m an actress on a television show and I support all things that we go through as human beings and would love all our characters to explore whatever issues that are current in our culture and our society today.”Like what you see?

78,POLITICS,Progressive Groups Pressure Democrats Not To Fund Senators Who Back Gorsuch,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressives-pressure-dscc-senators-gorsuch_us_58dec7c0e4b0b3918c838a3b,They're taking their demands right to Senate Democrats' campaign HQ.,2017-03-31,"As Democratic opposition to Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch mounts, progressive groups are pulling out all the stops.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58deca342c00002000ff1a2f.jpeg?cache=oQutml1g2r&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Major progressive organizations are pushing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to deny funding to any Democratic senator who votes for, or otherwise enables the confirmation of, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.Credo, AllofUs, UltraViolet, Friends of the Earth Action, Demand Progress and other online activism heavyweights have already amassed hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition to be delivered to the DSCC. Representatives from the groups plan to deliver the petition to committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Monday and demand a meeting with DSCC chair Sen. Chris Van Hollen (Md.). Some liberal leaders are also scheduled to speak out against Gorsuch at a rally in lower Manhattan on Saturday. “We need clear lines in the sand that demonstrate whether or not Senate Democrats are with us or against us. One of the clearest lines is where money flows from the DSCC,” said Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth Action, an environmental organization.Progressives are adamant about blocking Gorsuch’s confirmation, because of his extremely conservative legal record. They believe he will pose a threat to major environmental regulations, abortion rights, worker protections and campaign finance laws.They’re also still angry that Senate Republicans refused to grant hearings to Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. Garland was far more moderate than Gorsuch, they note.“Given how the Senate Republicans treated Merrick Garland, there is no reason to capitulate to the Republican demands,” Pica said.The actions in the coming days are designed to win over centrist Democratic senators considering backing Gorsuch, refusing to filibuster him or cutting some other kind of bipartisan deal that would ensure his confirmation. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), both of whom are up for re-election in states President Donald Trump won handily, announced on Thursday that they would vote for Gorsuch. But Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), who also faces a tough re-election battle, declared Friday that she would join an attempt to filibuster Gorsuch. This brings the number of Democrats who have vowed to block the nominee to at least 38. Senate Democrats need 41 of their caucus members to agree to filibuster Gorsuch to prevent his nomination from coming up for a vote. Republicans could respond by eliminating the filibuster altogether, but Democrats are skeptical that they have the votes to do so and are willing to test the GOP’s resolve.The progressive groups intend to show that not blocking Gorsuch would mean paying a significant political price ― more significant for red-state Democrats, even, than breaking with the president. The success Democrats had in opposing Republicans’ Obamacare replacement bill makes their argument more compelling, according to some of the progressive activists behind Monday’s action.Some activists even argue that it is not worth the cost of helping seat someone they regard as dangerous if blocking Gorsuch proves a political liability for some vulnerable Democrats.“Any Democrat who would help advance Gorsuch’s nomination is helping Trump attack vulnerable communities, and especially women. I don’t think we need those Democrats,” said Karin Roland, chief campaigns officer of the women’s rights group UltraViolet."

What does that do to our sense of self? That’s what it felt like for me as an 8-year-old girl in the classroom looking at all the presidents, being like, ‘Man, man, man.’ It’s similar for people of color: ‘White, white, white.’ It’s such a shattering feeling for a child. There is no story to explain why you’re ‘less than.’ You just are.”Mock echoed those sentiments, recalling the concerns she had about the impact that identifying as transgender would have on her career. “I was scared that if I came out, I would only ever be able to tell trans stories. And a part of that is kind of true because we don’t allow marginalized folk—whether they’re queer or LGBT, or folk of color—to tell any stories other than their personal ones,” Mock said. Moving forward, she would like more conservative Americans would be exposed to her inclusive message. “I can guarantee you that my book is not going to be on the front bookshelves at the Barnes & Noble in the South, in these rural places,” she said. “They’re going to choose not to carry my book because they’re going to say this black trans girl’s book is not going to resonate with our audience—[who won’t] even have the chance to walk across the shelf and see it. Yes, the material exists, the story exists, the show exists, but certain people will never have access to it.”Page, 30, recalled on her decision to open up about her sexuality publicly for the first time at a Human Rights Campaign event in 2014. “In subtle ways and not-so-subtle ways what you’re told: You can’t come out. I was wearing dresses and heels and all these things that I’m not comfortable in,” she said. “How absurd to think that, Oh, you’re not gay because you’re wearing dresses and heels. But that’s what it comes down to.

He was narrowly confirmed as EPA head last month despite Democrats’ calls to delay the vote until the release of new documents detailing his relationship with oil and gas companies while he was attorney general.A group of law professors last month filed a “professional misconduct” complaint against President Donald Trump’s chief counsel Kellyanne Conway with the Washington, D.C., Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the Board of Professional Responsibility, which addresses complaints about members of the local bar. They argued that Conway’s several lies (including linking immigrants to a fictitious “Bowling Green massacre”) was bringing “shame upon the legal profession.” "

What’s more: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who once all but disowned Trump, has signaled that he approves of the president’s crusade.Trump broadcast his decision on his favorite medium, tweeting what seemed like a threat of electoral retaliation against Freedom Caucus members.“The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!” he wrote.He followed up with slightly milder tweets calling out several of the faction’s members.If Reps. Mark Meadows (N.C.), Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Raul Labrador (Idaho) “would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform,” Trump tweeted.The president intermittently criticized the House Freedom Caucus in the days after he and Ryan withdrew the health care bill ahead of a House vote scheduled for last Friday. But he had also publicly blamed congressional Democrats, despite never reaching out to them. And many people understood his tweet instructing people to watch a specific Fox News show to be tacit disapproval of Ryan, as the host called on the speaker to resign.Trump’s steady volley of comments aimed at the Freedom Caucus suggest that he has finally homed in on the recalcitrant group of conservatives as the culprits for the health care debacle ― and decided to make them the focus of his persuasion efforts. New reporting has revealed that Trump’s tweets about the Freedom Caucus were not a case of spontaneous venting. Senior aides, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, encouraged the president to target members of the group, according to The New York Times. “There has been a stricter imposition by aides to make sure there is a strategic imperative behind his posts” ever since Trump used Twitter to accuse former President Barack Obama of wiretapping several weeks ago, the Times reported, citing conversations with “two people briefed on the process.”These advisers apparently believe Trump must chasten the Freedom Caucus and re-establish credibility with it ahead of negotiations over the budget and other matters, the Times added.The Times’ account is consistent with an earlier report that Bannon had advised the president to keep a “shit list” of the Republican lawmakers who had defied him. And when the White House was still trying to win hardliners, Bannon apparently believed he could dictate terms to the Freedom Caucus. “This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill,” he reportedly said.What makes Trump’s latest maneuver so interesting, however, is that Ryan ― who Bannon tried to oust while running the ultraconservative Breibart site ― appears to back it. Asked to respond to Trump’s Twitter barrage aimed at the Freedom Caucus, Ryan simply told reporters, “I understand the president’s frustration.”“I share frustration,” he added.That suggests the new strategy is not a showdown between the fiscally moderate nationalists embodied by Bannon and pro-immigration reform fiscal conservatives like Ryan. Rather, it seem to be a tactical alliance against the smaller group of hardline fiscal conservatives that populate the Freedom Caucus.Whether the ad hoc anti-Freedom Caucus coalition will work is another question, of course. On paper, it looks like an uphill climb ― even with Trump and Ryan working together. The group’s 30-odd members hail from deeply conservative, safe Republican districts and enjoy the backing of financially flush outside groups like Heritage Action."

The visuals are a totally accurate depiction of the debilitating symptoms that can accompany the mental health condition.“As someone who has dealt with anxiety myself, and also knowing many people who have also dealt with it, I wanted to bring this subject into the light and show people that even though you can’t necessarily see it, it’s there,” Blanchard told The Huffington Post.Blanchard was 15 when she first started feeling the effects of the condition, and has channeled her diagnosis into her art. She decided to make anxiety the focus of a photo assignment for a class at Gloucestershire University in England, where she’s studying photography. The series features her friend, Emily Terrett, as the model.“Everyone experiences anxiety differently, but I wanted to show the variety of symptoms and feelings through my photographs,” Blanchard said.Those symptoms can include excessive worry, rumination, feeling panicked or like you’re losing grip on reality. They can also include poor sleep, which Blanchard highlights in her photos. An estimated 40 million Americans have an anxiety disorder. Blanchard hopes her project will eliminate some of the negative misconceptions surrounding anxiety and get people to talk about mental health more frequently. Research shows stigma often silences people with mental health issues and prevents them from seeking treatment.“My advice for people who are dealing with anxiety is to talk to someone about it,” she said. “There is nothing worse than to keep those feelings bottled up.”Take a look at Blanchard’s photo series, titled “Disquiet,” below:H/T Women’s Health"

For his latest project, he highlighted a special group of dancers: children.“Tiny Dancers Among Us” features kids and teens with a passion for movement. Matter, who has two children himself, spent two years photographing creative kiddos in locations across the U.S., Europe and North Africa. After Matter’s 2012 book, Dancers Among Us, became a bestseller, he struggled to come up with a concept for his next big project. “Then one afternoon when my daughter was shoveling snow, I grabbed my camera,” he told The Huffington Post. “She looked right at me and hit an arabesque. ‘Tiny Dancers Among Us’ immediately popped into my head, and my next book was born.”The photographer has found many of his “Tiny Dancers” subjects through his popular Instagram account. He’s also received emails from children and parents asking to participate in the shoots. These emails usually include a few photos and personal notes about what dance means to these kids.“One 10-year-old wrote such a persuasive email that I flew from NYC to LA just to photograph her,” Matter said. “When I shoot, I rely on serendipity. None of the photos have been planned ahead of time, I just pick a central location and walk around until I see something interesting. Then the dancer and I work together to construct a pose that tells a story.”Matter believes his photos celebrate the nostalgia and everyday moments of childhood. “As we become adults, we seem to lose our innocent wonder, and our imagination is often replaced with indifference,” he said.While photographing the dancing children, he tries to see the world through their eyes and remember his childhood sense of joy, wonder, excitement, fear and more. Matter finds the kids he’s photographed inspiring. Said the photographer, “I am struck by their talent, dedication, passion, tenacity and most importantly, imagination!”Matter is currently looking for even more “tiny dancers” to photograph. He teamed up with the photo software developer, Macphun, to launch a contest for kids to win an opportunity to appear in the book.“We are asking every dancer to submit two photos and a personal story,” he explained. “The contest started last week, and we’ve already heard from hundreds of kids.”To learn more about the contest and see more of Matter’s photos, visit his “Tiny Dancers Among Us” website."
