Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park Saturday night was littered with evidence of President Donald Trump’s cultivation of the far right: protest signs with messages like “The Jewish Media Is Going Down,” “The Goyim Know” and “We Support President Donald Trump.”Only several hours earlier here, white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters had engaged in open combat for hours. The sounds of screams had mixed with the sounds of people coughing, their lungs full of mace. Tear gas canisters and rocks and full water bottles and bags of feces flew through the air. Blood stained the sidewalk.A few blocks away at the intersection of Fourth Street and Water Street Saturday night, police collected evidence from where a 20-year-old white supremacist named James Alex Fields Jr. had allegedly plowed his car into marching counter-protesters, sending bodies flying. A 32-year-old paralegal named Heather Heyer was killed and at least 19 others were injured. Police removed metal barricades from the street as a helicopter circled overhead. Nearby bars, usually bustling on a Saturday night, were shuttered and empty. On the sidewalk, a lone “Always Anti-Fascist” poster — dropped or discarded during the day’s chaos — stared up from the sidewalk.Meanwhile, at a friend’s house in the area, 25-year-old Eli Mosley stepped away from a party he and his white supremacist buddies in the “alt-right” group Identity Evropa were enjoying to talk to HuffPost over the phone. His voice was hoarse. He had spent the day screaming and chanting among thousands of like-minded people carrying Nazi and Confederate flags to protest the potential removal of the giant Lee statue in the park. The Anti-Defamation League said it was the largest gathering of white supremacists in more than a decade.“Our people are feeling real good right now,” he said. “We view this is as a civil rights movement at this point. We’re advocating for white rights and white people, who will soon be a minority in this country. This day was a milestone pushing us into our next stage. We had a large turnout.”“We’re coming back to Charlottesville,” he added defiantly.The clashes like the one in Charlottesville are largely a phenomenon of the Trump era. Over the past year, HuffPost has followed the white nationalists in their escalating war with their extremist opposite, from Berkeley to Portland to New Orleans to Gettysburg. In May, again in Charlottesville, white nationalists marched with torches and chanted Nazi slogans. Over the course of these battles, each side has grown angrier, and more heavily armed.Eli Mosley is typical of the “alt-right” movement ― the latest incarnation of organized racism in America ― which has grown exponentially larger since Donald Trump announced his run for the White House. He’s young and media-savvy and knew how to bring thousands of white supremacists together for Saturday’s “Unite The Right” rally. Years ago people like Mosley saw themselves as a fringe group in American politics. Now, under Trump, they feel like their views are gaining momentum, even becoming mainstream, they say.In Trump’s statement about Charlottesville Saturday, he refused to specifically condemn the white supremacists who besieged this picturesque college town. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides,” he told reporters during a late-afternoon news conference in New Jersey. White supremacists were more than pleased with his reaction. “Trump’s comments were good,” read a post on the prominent white nationalist site Daily Stormer as they live-blogged yesterday’s events. “He refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him,” the post continued. “No condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him.”With a president of the United States not condemning Nazism, and after over a year of signaling his support for white nationalism, experts are deeply concerned that we’re in store for political violence even worse than the kind that visited Charlottesville.That’s because an emboldened fringe right, has in turn, emboldened the far left. Professor Brian Levin, head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said in an interview with HuffPost by phone that the fatality and injuries Saturday ensure that the “much smaller and less coalesced far left,” which includes anti-fascist or Antifa protesters, would go looking for “revenge.”“It’s a reciprocal dance of extremism,” Levin said.Heidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, agreed. When anti-fascists show up to violently fight white supremacists, she said, it only gives “oxygen” to the white supremacist cause.“We’re concerned this is going to spill out of Charlottesville into many other places,” she added.Something that would go a long way in breaking this vicious cycle, they both agreed, is decisive action from the White House.In a statement Sunday the Anti-Defamation League spelled out what that action could be. The group called on Trump to “terminate all staff” with any ties to white nationalists, likely referring to prominent White House advisers Steve Bannon, Steven Miller, and Sebastian Gorka, all of whom are linked to racist, fringe figures and groups.“This is a moment that demands moral leadership,” ADL President Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “President Trump should acknowledge that this is not a matter of equivalence between two sides with similar gripes. There is no rationalizing white supremacy and no room for this vile bigotry. It is un-American and it needs to be condemned without hesitation.”On Sunday morning, Eli Mosley said he was preparing to leave the house where he had partied and slept the night before with his fellow white nationalists. He said he thought Trump’s comments were “neutral in a way” that he liked.He claimed to have lost his job three months ago after being exposed as a white nationalist online. He said he’s working full-time now as an alt-right organizer. For this new life, he said he was preparing to drive home to Pennsylvania Sunday so he could pack his things for a move to Virginia.In Virginia, he said, he could more easily organize the next big alt-right rallies in the state capital, Richmond, and of course, in Charlottesville.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

I was recently invited to Whitefish, Montana by the Human Rights Network to address the community-at-large – a population recently terrorized by an online cadre of white supremacists. And it was there that I came face-to-face with “alt-right” poster boy Richard Spencer.Video: “Healing From Hate: The Intervention of Richard Spencer.” Excerpted and adapted from the forthcoming feature documentary: “Angry White Men: Healing From Hate.” Director: Peter Hutchison. Copyright © 2017 Big Tent Productions.I had invited him to a lecture I was giving in town. Call it a gentle taunt or soft troll on my part, but Spencer showed up. And I was delighted.Let me be very clear: I despise the ideas that Richard Spencer spews forth and what the rally in Charlottesville stood for. I despise them because they were once my own–the same misinformed and dangerous ideas I deployed to manipulate vulnerable people 30 years ago. The look may be different today – the shaved heads and Doc Martens replaced with smart suits and “fashy” haircuts – but the scam, and danger, remain the same.For those unfamiliar with recent events in Whitefish, let me catch you up. Rallied by the popular white nationalist (read, “neo-Nazi”) website Daily Stormer and its founder Andrew Anglin, an anti-Semitic “troll storm” and virtual hate campaign were unleashed upon a local Jewish realtor involved in a trivial business dispute with Sherry Spencer, Richard Spencer’s mother. Spencer splits his time between the Washington D.C. suburbs and Whitefish, where his mother, his Russian-born wife Nina, and their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter live full-time. The attacks escalated further when the local rabbi also began receiving death threats, many in Whitefish’s Jewish community had their home addresses and phone numbers maliciously published online, and an armed white supremacist march down Main Street was threatened. The Southern Poverty Law Center recently filed a federal lawsuit against Anglin.As the Q&A following my talk wound down, it was clear that the populace remained deeply shaken. The final question came from a long-haired, twenty-something guy in the crowd: “Our local racist, Richard Spencer, if he were here this evening–what would you say to somebody like him?”“Hello, Richard,” I said into the mic and turned, locking eyes with Spencer, whom I had spotted earlier sitting alone in the first row of the mezzanine opposite from where the question originated. “Let’s have coffee.”When the last of the attendees cleared out of the O’Shaughnessy Center, it was just me and him. I walked over to Spencer, firmly shook his hand, and thanked him for accepting my invitation. We talked for two hours.I did a lot of listening that night, paying attention to what we at Life After Hate call “potholes” – things like trauma, abuse, neglect, abandonment, lack of opportunity, untreated mental illness, and addiction – that can detour promising young lives down dark paths. I asked Richard about his childhood and relationship with his father – and how it felt being a father to his own little girl. The idea of masculinity and “aggrieved entitlement” is an important driver in violent extremist movements. I was genuinely interested.At times, Richard Spencer personified the brash serial scapegoater one would expect. But when I tuned out the familiar rhetoric and listened closely, what I heard instead were the insecure, all-too-human whispers of a man pleading for help – not the bold demagoguery of everyone’s favorite white nationalist punching bag.It was getting late and I needed to head to the rabbi’s house, where I was staying the night with her family. I bid Spencer farewell, signed a copy of my memoir for him, and we parted ways, agreeing to meet again.It’s important here I fully acknowledge that my own reality and human connection were once broken, just like Richard Spencer and those demonstrating in Charlottesville. I also recognize that we must stand firm against those who foster hate and divisiveness. But, I wasn’t able to shed my own blinders until my “enemies” – those I had directed my hate towards – took it upon themselves to disarm me with empathy. Ultimately, receiving compassion from the people I least deserved it from, when I least deserved it, was what helped me reconnect with society. To be clear, I don’t shirk away the notion that we must defend ourselves and protect each other against those who wish to harm us, but we must also recognize that violence is rarely ever the place to begin or end a conflict.Richard Spencer is merely a byproduct of what is happening in America currently – something also amplified by the highest levels of our government, and trickling down through our broken political, education, and justice systems. Let’s not forget the now almost-daily, hate-inspired, white extremist terror attacks like those in Charlottesville, Portland, NYC, Oak Creek, Las Vegas, and Charleston, to name just a few. Not to mention the hate crimes against Muslims, Jews, and people of color that have skyrocketed across the U.S. since Election Day, and the googols of hate speech and misogyny online. People typically hate other people because they fear them, or need a target to project their own pain. Isolation and ignorance breed fear. Prejudices feed the belief in a threatening “other.” More often than not, racists have never even had a meaningful interaction with those they claim to hate. I don’t think I’m blowing anyone’s mind by stating that, as a society, we are largely disconnected and living in alternate dimensions.How do we solve this? Be the wormhole, I say. Build a bridge between those alternate realities and begin by listening and finding what we have in common: our need for love, security, meaning, happiness. Start there and build on common ground, then address the differences by showing the fearful haters that we are more similar than they believe.We can only dismantle hate with an outpouring of humanity and a commitment to help repair those metaphorical potholes in people – not with fists, clubs, or fiery rhetoric. Dare yourself to strike a preemptive blow of compassion instead. Don’t adopt the values of the people whose ideas you despise. I’m a different man than I once was. I can’t emphasize enough how repugnant I find Richard Spencer’s ideas – but I do understand how and why he was led to them, and that he needs compassion, not hate or violence, to abandon them. Our two hours together didn’t change him. I didn’t expect they would. But I did plant a seed I look forward to cultivating.Richard, I still owe you that cup of coffee. Bring your comrades Bannon, Gorka, and Miller with you. You have my number."

Yet one voice is conspicuous by its absence: the voice of those most affected by the war – the people who have fled their homes, their livelihoods and their futures.The ASDA’A Burson-Marsteller Arab Youth Survey – the most important research of its type into this crucial demographic across the Middle East – has itself excluded young Syrian voices since 2011, due to the security situation there.This year, as part of the survey’s ninth edition, we are redressing that omission. For the first time, we conducted a supplementary poll alongside the Arab Youth Survey 2017, surveying 400 young Syrians, aged 18 to 24, living in refugee camps and settlements in Lebanon and Syria.Six years of civil war in Syria have forced half of the population – more than 11 million people – from their homes, including 6 million people who have fled the country itself. This is the defining humanitarian catastrophe of our times, and one that will leave a bitter legacy for years, if not decades, to come.The damage done to the Syrian economy is estimated by the World Bank at $226 billion, or more than four times the country’s prewar annual GDP. Less tangible, but inestimably worse, is the damage to a whole generation who have seen their education disrupted and their opportunities to find work and build livelihoods vanish.We believe what they say really matters.If the sheer scale of the crisis is alarming, our findings from this survey are sobering. Our key finding is that more than half of the young Syrians we surveyed – all living in testing conditions, in cramped refugee camps just miles from their homeland – say they don’t think they will ever permanently return to Syria. They look to North America, to Europe and – in the Arab world – to the UAE as safe havens in which they might be able to rebuild shattered lives.The reality, however, is that their lives are on pause – according to the UNHCR, various nations have pledged to permanently resettle just 170,000 registered refugees in 2017.Our survey reveals an interesting gender split into attitudes toward this issue: the men we surveyed think Europe can best help their plight by addressing their futures, by opening borders further and allowing more refugees to settle; the women, however, want Europe to address issues relating to their situation right now, by providing more aid to the camps and settlements in which they live.Another striking finding reveals that young refugees are apathetic toward the political issues that drove the civil war they have fled. When asked what needs to happen in order for them to return home, the war ending was cited by nearly half (47 percent), while the so-called Islamic State (known locally as Daesh) leaving Syria was cited by a quarter (25 percent). This is a generation that is disillusioned with politics and weary of war.One other important finding, and one that correlates with findings from the wider Arab Youth Survey, is that young Syrian refugees do not believe military action alone can defeat extremism. Young people across the Middle East believe education and the provision of good jobs is equally important, with young Syrians saying that they see media campaigns expressly de-linking the ideology of Daesh from the true practices of Islam as the most important tactic against extremism.This is a critical finding – it shows that young Syrians’ beliefs are clearly aligned with their peers throughout the region on these important issues.As important as it is, it is my sincerest hope that this special survey on refugees is a one-off; and that in future young Syrian voices are once again heard alongside those from the 16 nations surveyed in the Arab Youth Survey, discussing their hopes, their fears and their aspirations not from camps or settlements on the borders of their homeland but from their home towns and villages themselves.The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of News Deeply.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply, and you can find the original here.

A local NGO is stepping in to help sex workers uphold their rights and teach police to look past the stigma.GABORONE, BOTSWANA – Although there is no law against prostitution in Malawi, sex workers routinely face abuse and wrongful arrest by police who give in to social stigma and misunderstand the law, according to campaigners. That leaves them vulnerable to violence, because they can’t rely on police to help them when they are assaulted by their clients.Zinenani Majawa, national coordinator with the Female Sex Workers Alliance, says the group’s members often report incidents of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of customers and police officers.“In one of our meetings,” she remembers, “one member said, ‘I feel like someone who has no rights … Police officers continue to abuse us and do not offer protection, service or justice; they harass us, saying that we are spreading HIV, [that we are] immoral and sinners.’”With sex workers in Malawi unable to trust the police, one organization has taken on the task of ensuring the women are aware of their rights, giving them a safe place to report abuse.The Centre for Human Rights Education Advice and Assistance (CHREAA) focuses on the protection of vulnerable groups. Its executive director, Victor Mhango, says the organization noticed a disturbing trend of mass arrest of sex workers three years ago. When they looked into it, they discovered that the police were wrongly arresting sex workers using the “rogue and vagabond law” – which allows police to detain anyone on public property whom they suspect of engaging in illegal or disorderly activity – or under section 146 of the penal code, which prohibits someone from living on money made through prostitution, a law originally designed to protect sex workers from being exploited.CHREAA also confirmed allegations by sex workers of abuse while in police custody. “Our research proved that indeed most of them were being harassed sexually or were being raped, or harassed in other ways while in police custody,” Mhango says.Those findings prompted the organization to launch a project in 2016 to protect sex workers from police abuse. The main focus of the project is to make the community aware of sex-worker rights. CHREAA conducts rights-awareness training programs with both sex workers and police, and plans to expand the program to include health workers and other members of the community.The organization also runs awareness campaigns in bars that sex workers frequent and has set up a toll-free line that they can use to report abuse. It places its paralegals in police stations across the country to assist sex workers in custody.But to ensure sex workers don’t always have to rely on CHREAA to represent them, the organization trained one to become a paralegal last year. It plans to offer this training to more people involved in the trade in the hope that they will be able to provide legal assistance to and educate each other.Since the launch of its project, CHREAA has also been challenging the laws used by the police to justify the arbitrary arrests of sex workers. Over the past year, the organization, with the assistance of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC), has managed to appeal the convictions of 19 sex workers for living on the earnings of prostitution. And in January this year, the CHREAA and SALC succeeded in having the rogue and vagabond law declared unconstitutional and invalid.But the lingering stigma around sex work will be more difficult to tackle, say campaigners.Majawa from the Female Sex Workers Alliance says that, despite the invalidation of the vagabond law, most sex workers still do not feel safe because they have been previously abused by the same people tasked with protecting them.She would like to see an independent unit, set up by an organization outside the police, that sex workers can go to to report cases of abuse. And she calls for an end to discrimination against sex workers.“Being a sex worker does not mean you are not a human being,” Majawa says. “We are also human beings who have to be respected and accepted in our communities. We do not expect to be discriminated against and abused by both the community and the police.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls, and you can find the original here.

The impact of new arrivals in Europe will depend on governments learning the right lessons.THE ARRIVAL OF more than a million refugees and migrants in Europe has brought widespread concern they will become an economic drain on the countries that welcome them. As with any large social shift, deep concerns are reasonable.But these economic effects are not obvious. A newcomer who takes a job washing dishes may prevent a native worker from taking it. But that person also complements natives who wait on tables, manage the restaurant or own it. And a newcomer who receives benefits today can generate tax revenue tomorrow.No one can understand the economic consequences of large migrations without careful economic research on the ripple effects – subtle, invisible, delayed. When politicians brush this aside they are trying to con you. When economists have studied past influxes of refugees and migrants they have found the labor market effects, while varied, are very limited.The nature of these effects also depends on other policy choices by the host countries. More than anything else, the economic effect of migrants and refugees is a decision. In a new paper with Jennifer Hunt we looked at large flows of people from Algeria to France in 1962; from Cuba to Miami in 1980; from the former Soviet Union to Israel in the 1990s; and from the Balkans to the rest of Europe in the 1990s.Each of these episodes brought a sudden flood of new workers on a scale comparable to recent flows to Europe, offering a chance to compare what happened in jobs and occupations where the migrants clustered.The sudden movement of over a million people from Algeria to France raised the unemployment rate for low-skill French workers by about one fifth of a percentage point. Balkan refugees across Europe also seem to have caused a small, short-term increase in native unemployment, though this effect cannot be reliably distinguished from statistical noise.The other flows had either no effect or a positive effect on the local labor market. The arrival of 125,000 Cubans into Miami had no effect at all on unemployment and was followed by a small rise in average low-skill wages. And the movement of Soviet refugees into Israel, enough to raise the country’s population 12 percent in just four years, saw a substantial rise in the wages of the occupations they crowded into.While this research focuses on wealthier destination countries, the evidence in developing countries – which receive the bulk of refugees – seems similar. In Turkey there appears to be a small negative effect on native employment caused by the influx of Syrians, but not in Jordan.These studies are limited because they measure what happens to native workers who stay in the places and occupations where migrants cluster. They do not fully account for adaptation by natives who change or move to a new place, job or skill level.A recent study looked at the effect of waves of refugees like Iraqis and Afghans into Denmark. It uses a national database that follows each individual Dane over two decades, even as they change residences and jobs. They found that refugees did initially displace small numbers of native workers but most often into jobs requiring more complex tasks and native language skills, where they were more productive. The most affected natives typically ended up earning 3 percent more than they had before.This churn in the Danish labor market suggests one reason why the labor market impacts of migrant inflows vary from place to place. To capture the opportunity that these inflows offer, workers must count on flexible labor markets that allow them to adjust.The unemployment effects of Balkan refugees in the 1990s were different in different parts of Europe. Specifically, countries with the most rigid labor market institutions – rules that make it more costly to take on and lay off workers – saw the biggest rise in unemployment. The choice to protect incumbent workers made it more difficult for unemployed natives to find new jobs where they could complement rather than compete with newcomers.In the context of large migrant flows, labor market policy is a form of refugee policy. The economic effect of the inflow is in large part a policy decision.Nowhere is this clearer than in the fiscal effects of refugees. Almost all refugees receive substantial public assistance when they arrive and years afterward. Countries vary in how much of this assistance refugees are asked to pay back later. But by far the most important determinant of the net fiscal effect is how quickly refugees integrate into the labor market and start generating tax revenue.In the U.S., the average refugee becomes a net contributor to public coffers eight years after arrival. The assistance they received when they arrived was, in purely monetary terms, an investment with a positive return. Countries that actively deter asylum applicants from working are making the decision to increase their net fiscal burden.There is significant room for innovation to reduce the short-term fiscal burden of refugees. The organization Talent Beyond Boundaries (TBB) is developing new ways to match skilled Syrian refugees to jobs overseas, while an international loan fund has been proposed to help cash-constrained refugees. Canada has pioneered private sponsorship of refugees, and other countries are considering following suit. My colleagues at the Center for Global Development have proposed a fund to help nontraditional destination countries bear the upfront fiscal cost of assisting refugees.Almost a million people arrived in Germany in 2015 because other countries did not accept substantial shares of them. The labor market effects on Germany appear to be minimal so far. But those effects would be negligible on all countries concerned if the burden had been broadly shared.The clearest historical experience in this regard is the enormous flow of Hungarian refugees into Austria in 1956. They produced a spike of 3 percent in the population of Austria. Had Austria been left alone to assist them, there is little doubt that those 200,000 Hungarians, trapped in Traiskirchen and other camps, would have become a large economic and fiscal burden.What happened instead was that a coalition of 37 countries, on many continents, shared the responsibility. They moved so quickly that they had resettled over half of the refugees within 10 weeks. They were nothing but an economic boon to the countries they went to; one of them came to the U.S. and ended up founding the tech giant Intel. Coordination eliminated the burden.The economic effects of the new wave of asylum seekers and other migrants will be complex. The International Monetary Fund projects that this wave will raise economic growth over the long term by providing Europe with young and energetic workers. The labor market effects and fiscal effects are likely to be negative and small in the near future for some countries but more positive in countries with more flexible labor market regulations.But the greatest determinant of these effects will be the extent to which continuing flows are shunted to just a few destinations or broadly shared. This depends less on migrants’ decisions than on the policy decisions of the recipient countries and their allies.The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Refugees Deeply.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply, and you can find the original here.

Martinez said the former KYGO radio DJ can’t prove the pop star got him fired.Mueller, 55, sued Swift in 2015 for damages, saying that the singer had falsely accused him of groping her, according to Reuters.Mueller said that Swift and her team “pressured station management to oust him from his $150,000-per-year job.”The judge said that “Taylor Swift did not act improperly.” Martinez did say there’s evidence to support a damages claim over the KYGO contract but not for future earnings. The verdict means Mueller could sue only for up to $300,000, the amount remaining on his contract.Swift’s attorney Douglas Baldridge argued in court Friday that Mueller’s grievance “is with KYGO, not with my client.”“KYGO did him wrong, and he didn’t sue KYGO,” Baldridge added. The judge will allow Mueller’s claim to continue against Swift’s mother, Andrea, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell, both of whom reported Swift’s groping accusation to station management, BuzzFeed reported.Martinez’s decision Friday does not affect Swift’s assault case against Mueller. She is suing for $1 and wants her case to serve “as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.”Mueller’s legal team rested its case Friday after hearing testimony from Swift’s former bodyguard Greg Dent, according to NBC News.Dent testified that he saw Mueller reach under Swift’s skirt just before a photographer snapped their picture during the now-infamous meet-and-greet.Dent said he did not intervene because he did not get any cues from Swift.Shannon Melcher, Mueller’s former girlfriend, who was also in the photo with Swift, testified that Swift moved into her just before the photo was snapped, according to The Denver Post. “I wasn’t paying attention directly to what he was doing to get into the photo. It happened very quickly, to be honest. I was aware that he was trying to get into the frame.” She added that she didn’t see any groping because “I was facing forward. I don’t have eyes at the back of my head.”On Monday, both parties will have 60 minutes for closing statements as well as an opening statement and rebuttal. After that, the jury will deliberate the claims against Andrea Swift and Frank Bell."

The policy, adopted after a recommendation from the Commission to Combat Campus Sexual Violence, requires college athletes and administrators to annually complete sexual violence education.While the NCAA announced this policy to fanfare, it merely follows what is already required under the federal Jeanne Clery Act (which includes nearly $55,000 per violation fines for colleges that violate the requirement), and more is required for there to be true accountability for violent behavior in collegiate athletics. What it doesn’t contain is enforcement or accountability that approaches penalties reaching the level as the purchase of a hamburger for a student-athlete.The school president or chancellor, athletics director and Title IX coordinator will be required to annually attest that the education was conducted. This provides slightly more accountability than the Clery Act, amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which merely requires that all incoming students and employees receive sexual violence education, and that there be ongoing educational campaigns. It, however, is far short of the types of reforms that both of us, and other advocates, have been seeking for several decades.This policy was approved by the NCAA Board of Governors, representatives from conferences who are either presidents or chancellors. Concerning is whether these Board of Governors, overseeing major national universities, did not know that this policy simply mirrors existing federal policy or they did know and passed it off as groundbreaking because the general population do not know what the Clery Act is.The NCAA was lobbied in 2010 to address sexual assault and domestic violence by emulating the standards in Title IX and adding accountability. When female athletes have become victims of male athletes, then the NCAA should absolutely have a policy as the governing body of all student-athletes. In fact, collegiate athletic conferences have chosen to take steps much more effective than the NCAA, such as a transfer policy and denying entrance to athletes investigated for sexual assault or domestic violence.The NCAA doesn’t have a policy that would have addressed the allegations of violence against Ezekiel Elliott during his time at Ohio State, leaving it to the NFL to act now. But, the NFL is an employer. The NCAA has an unpaid labor force.The NCAA says it cannot be a state actor, a status the NCAA has fought for in NCAA v. Tarkanian all the way to the Supreme Court, but remains debatable given other state athletic association rulings and the NCAA’s own investigations into Penn State and Montana. In fact, the NCAA’s “lack of institutional control” infraction should be cited by the NCAA for a program, like Baylor, who has shown exactly that. They could have used it in the new “policy” as an enforcement measure. They didn’t.At the very least, when a collegiate athlete has been found responsible for or convicted of an act of violence they should lose their privilege to compete on behalf of their institution. Competing, and serving as an ambassador of the institution, is an honor and a privilege that is not deserved by those who commit senseless violence. Of course now if a student athlete leaves one school they can simply transfer to and play for another institution, unless they are one of the institutions or are in one of the conferences that banned transfers or incoming freshmen athletes with a violent history. That’s leadership.S.

Last night in Charlottesville, Virginia, there was a large and violent white supremacist, neo-nazi, “alt-right” riot called “Unite the Right.” The participants were chanting things like “blood and soil” “you will not replace us” “anti-white” and “white lives matter” while carrying torches and doing the Nazi salute. The video below shows people chanting, fighting and throwing torches.If you think that hateful events like this have nothing to do with Donald Trump, then you are delusional. And if you chose to stop reading this post right there, then you are part of the problem. Here is a GREAT article (that was actually written last year) that proves that white supremacists feel emboldened with Trump in the White House. It also follows the timeline of what he has done to embolden these people/groups and give them platforms.If the article isn’t enough, here’s a video of David Duke, former Imperial Wizard (leader) of the KKK, from this morning talking about how the rally last night “fulfills the promises of Donald Trump.”I am almost never the type to say “it’s 2017, this shouldn’t still be happening,” because as a black woman, I know that racism and bigotry are still VERY much alive even in 2017. The day that people who think we’re “past” racism envision when they think of racism were not long ago at all. However, I am saying now that we cannot, in this day and age, allow this type of white supremacist activity to gain momentum. I unfortunately have a feeling this riot was only the beginning, and bigger events will take place (especially since there was hardly any police presence at this violent riot, which says a lot about how whiteness is protected even at its worst... but we’ll save that for another post) if:1) Trump is not removed from office.2) If everyone doesn’t take the necessary action to keep this country from reverting back to the days of Jim Crow.Trump supporters who claim not to be racist, who claim to be all for “equality,” who say “I don’t agree with everything he says, but...” what YOU can do to combat things like this are:1) Stop supporting him. Like literally it’s as easy as thinking “you know what... I actually don’t like this guy.”2) Educate yourself about why his rhetoric, policies, and ways of operating are not only un-presidential but also dangerous.3) Take action. Educate others, use your voice. If you have the resources, then organize meetings or give speeches or whatever you need to do to combat this (Trump and these kinds of events).Democrats and liberals whose favorite slogans is “love trumps hate,” you already got the first step down, but it’s time to be about that action. Just typing out “love trumps hate” on Facebook does absolutely nothing. If you really want to see a change, follow steps 2 and 3 from the above paragraph.Being “on the fence” or “down the middle” or whatever idiom for inaction is popular at the moment is helping people like the participants of this rally. Doing nothing is doing something. This country needs to make a radical shift in action and ideology if we are to continue the progress that has been made thus far. Everyone talks about one day having a better world for their kids and grandkids to live in, but everyone needs to be willing to do something to make that world a reality."
13,POLITICS,"Whiteness Is Always Protected, Even At Its Worst","Tyler Payton, ContributorYoung black woman with a lot to say",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whiteness-is-protected-even-at-its-worst_us_598f77d9e4b063e2ae05802b,"We have a group of white supremacists and literal Nazis who are starting fights and throwing torches, and this is somehow still only being called a protest/rally/march.",2017-08-12,"<p>Neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, VA.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598f89ca22000015001a5a4e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last night a bunch of white supremacists and Neo-Nazis marched on University of Virginia’s campus holding torches and chanting things like “blood and soil,” “white lives matter,” “you can’t replace us,” and “anti-white.” Participants were also doing Nazi salutes and some fights broke out among the participants and counter-protesters.I find it interesting (and frustrating) that most news coverage on this event is calling it either a protest, rally or march rather than what it should have been called: a riot. Google “Charlottesville” and see what comes up. I would bet money that you would have to scroll until you find an article or headline that refers to last night’s event as a riot. The same thing is happening on Twitter. I have seen many, many tweets about what has happened, but I have not seen it being called a riot.The reason this is interesting and frustrating to me is because I know, based on the past three years or so, that if it had been a group of black people protesting for their right to live, it would have immediately been deemed a riot. However, here we have a group of white supremacists and literal Nazis who are starting fights and throwing torches, and this is somehow still only being called a protest/rally/march. While the dictionary definition of “riot” doesn’t necessarily mean that there is physical violence, it obviously carries a much more dangerous and less respectable connotation to us than “protest” or “rally” or “march,” which all carry the connotation (at least to me) of people just exercising their political right.At first thought, it may not seem like such a big deal that different protests are called different things. But I have said it before and I’ll say it again, words are powerful. If they weren’t, political candidates wouldn’t give speeches, commercials wouldn’t have catchy slogans, and you probably wouldn’t be reading this.So, the difference in what these events are being called is important. This difference highlights the fact that whiteness is always protected, even at its worst. Even when there is violence and racism involved on a large scale, whiteness is still protected. This was showcased by this riot not only in the way that it’s being talked about, but also in the lack of police presence. Judging from photos and videos on Twitter, it seems that there were not many police, and the officers that I saw were not in riot gear. This can be compared to the many instances we’ve seen online of black people protesting and having to face off against swarms of police, many in riot gear and willing to get physical with anyone. An example can be seen in this now famous photo.People have commented on this stark difference between how the “protesters” last night were treated by the police versus how people of other races would be treated in similar situations. Since the birth of this nation, there has been nothing as strongly valued and protected as whiteness (capitalism is a close second). That is clear not only from the riot that took place, but also by the way it is being discussed in the mainstream media — using names that soften the impact of what happened — and the way that these rioters were much more free than other protesters of color to do what they wanted.

Google “Charlottesville” and see what comes up. I would bet money that you would have to scroll until you find an article or headline that refers to last night’s event as a riot. The same thing is happening on Twitter. I have seen many, many tweets about what has happened, but I have not seen it being called a riot.The reason this is interesting and frustrating to me is because I know, based on the past three years or so, that if it had been a group of black people protesting for their right to live, it would have immediately been deemed a riot. However, here we have a group of white supremacists and literal Nazis who are starting fights and throwing torches, and this is somehow still only being called a protest/rally/march. While the dictionary definition of “riot” doesn’t necessarily mean that there is physical violence, it obviously carries a much more dangerous and less respectable connotation to us than “protest” or “rally” or “march,” which all carry the connotation (at least to me) of people just exercising their political right.At first thought, it may not seem like such a big deal that different protests are called different things. But I have said it before and I’ll say it again, words are powerful. If they weren’t, political candidates wouldn’t give speeches, commercials wouldn’t have catchy slogans, and you probably wouldn’t be reading this.So, the difference in what these events are being called is important. This difference highlights the fact that whiteness is always protected, even at its worst. Even when there is violence and racism involved on a large scale, whiteness is still protected. This was showcased by this riot not only in the way that it’s being talked about, but also in the lack of police presence. Judging from photos and videos on Twitter, it seems that there were not many police, and the officers that I saw were not in riot gear. This can be compared to the many instances we’ve seen online of black people protesting and having to face off against swarms of police, many in riot gear and willing to get physical with anyone. An example can be seen in this now famous photo.People have commented on this stark difference between how the “protesters” last night were treated by the police versus how people of other races would be treated in similar situations. Since the birth of this nation, there has been nothing as strongly valued and protected as whiteness (capitalism is a close second). That is clear not only from the riot that took place, but also by the way it is being discussed in the mainstream media — using names that soften the impact of what happened — and the way that these rioters were much more free than other protesters of color to do what they wanted. Black protesters have to worry about being beaten by a cop with a baton, or maybe even worse, while these Neo-Nazis felt free to start fights and throw torches in part because of the lack of police presence. White supremacy doesn’t always look like a group of white people marching on a college campus holding torches and giving the Nazi salute; it often looks like doing whatever is necessary to still somehow hold whiteness on a pedestal no matter what is taking place."
15,POLITICS,Millennials Are The Ones Leading The Resistance Against Trump,"Aysha Mahmood, ContributorJournalist. Lover of literature. Chocolate Enthusiast.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/say-what-you-will-against-millennials-but-theyre_us_598e569ee4b0ed1f464c0acc,The one place where millennials undoubtedly shine is politics.,2017-08-12,<p>Protesters watch the inauguration of President Trump.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598e8c5715000024008b63fa.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From undermining the home ownership industry to killing department stores, the oil industry, and yes, even napkins, millennials have been blamed for destroying many aspects of society. However, the one place where millennials undoubtedly shine is politics.If only millennials voted in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton would have won. According to Bloomberg, 55 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds voted for Clinton as opposed to the 37 percent that voted for Trump.Over the course of the time Trump has been in office, millennials continue to disapprove of his presidency.According to the recent University of Chicago survey polling firm GenForward, 62 percent of millennials from the ages of 18 to 34 disapprove of Trump. This is 2.4 percent higher than the national average, which according to Huff Post is currently at 59.6 percent.Other notable results of the study include:61 percent believe the country is “going off on the wrong track.”Although the study reveals that white millennials approve of Trump more than any other ethnicity, the majority of white millennials surveyed still disapproved of his presidency.So a majority of millennials don’t like Trump, but does that mean they’re really stepping up and leading the resistance?Two weeks after the election, Run for Something, a progressive organization that recruits and supports those who wish to run for office, reported that more than 3,300 people under 35 signed up on their site, many referencing the election results as motivation to run.Similar organizations, such as She Should Run—which recently announced their goal to get women to fill half of the more than 500,000 elected positions in the U.S. by 2030—have also had success recruiting after the election.Someone who has already stepped up to the plate is 30-year-old Jon Ossoff, who ran in the Georgia special congressional election. Although he loss, his candidacy sent a huge message to Republicans that liberal values were prevalent in a district heavily held by conservatives. Millennials are also eager to run at the local level as well. The Atlantic Black Star recently featured three millennials who are seeking office, the youngest of which is Daniel Graves, 26, who is running to represent Cleveland’s Ward 7 on the Cleveland City Council.Youth magazines have also stepped up their coverage politically and have consistently encouraged activism. In fact, Teen Vogue has featured articles about how to plan a rally and how to stay politically active during the summer season. They are additionally hosting their first ever Teen Vogue Summit in December, where participants will have the opportunity to learn about topics such as activism and civil leadership.So the question now becomes, why are more millennials than any other generation resisting in the Trump era?The answer has to do with demographics. According to a 2016 Brookings analysis, “racial diversity will be the most defining and impactful characteristic of the millennial generation.” In fact, the younger the generation is, the smaller the population of whites. According to the analysis, this racial gap is “spilling over into national politics ... on issues like government spending, affirmative action, and immigration.” This explains why more millennials have a more liberal stance on matters pertaining to race equality, gender equality, LGBTQ rights, universal healthcare, and free education.In the most recent election, younger people tended to gravitate toward the 74-year-old Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran the most progressive platform.What’s interesting is that Sanders identifies as an Independent and according to the GenForward poll, so do a majority of millennials. It seems that millennials are identifying more with values than they are with an actual party. But one thing is for sure, their views are significantly more liberal than the generations before them.But how much of an impact will millennials actually make? Only time will tell."

But as the state began rolling out its response plan, North Korea successfully test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July with ranges within reach of Hawaii. Then a very public exchange of threats and one-upmanship began between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.“Of all the worst things that can happen is to stoop to the level of North Korea [with] threats of destruction and nuclear weapons,” Carl Baker, director of programs at the Honolulu-based Pacific Forum Center for Strategic and International Studies, told HuffPost.Though most experts are certain the risk of a North Korean attack on Hawaii, much less anywhere in the continental U.S., is still very low, Baker said the president’s “rhetoric isn’t doing anybody any good.” “Most people are dismissive [of North Korea’s threats] and understand that this isn’t a problem,” said Baker, a retired Air Force officer who served as an intelligence analyst for U.S. Forces Korea. “But when you ratchet up the rhetoric like that and you get the bombast from both sides, it just makes everyone more uncertain.”Hawaii is one of the first states to begin preparing for a nuclear strike from North Korea. Gov. David Ige requested the attack response plan from the state’s Department of Defense in December after military officials briefed him on North Korea’s potential threats to Hawaii.“It’s only a matter of time that North Korea will be able to strike Hawaii with any kind of accuracy,” Lt. Col. Charles Anthony, a spokesman for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, told HuffPost.“We want to get ahead of” the threat, Anthony added. “To us, it made much more sense to try to get a public information campaign out there before [North Korea] had a series of successful ICBM tests.”If a missile were to be launched at the islands, officials say, the state would have approximately 20 minutes to respond. The U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii would identify the launch within five minutes, giving the islands’ 1.4 million residents a mere 15 minutes to take shelter. This scenario is what the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency is preparing residents for with a public information campaign, a revised set of nuclear response guidelines and the restoration of statewide attack warning sirens that had been turned off after the thawing of the Cold War in the late 1980s. Ideally, all this would’ve rolled out without stirring up fears ― a just-in-case plan.“When we started this process, North Korea was zero for five in terms of ICBM missile tests,” Anthony told HuffPost, referring to the five failed ICBM tests. “About a week after we rolled out the public information campaign [on the state’s nuclear response guidelines], North Korea had successfully tested the second ICBM.”Anthony said that Trump’s increasingly intense exchanges of threats with North Korea aren’t disturbing the state’s plans to prepare residents and visitors for an attack.An attack on Hawaii also wouldn’t be a smart move for North Korea ― and they know that, according to Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu who focuses on North Korea.As Trump’s threats to North Korea appear to be intensifying with every new statement, officials in Hawaii are calling for a de-escalation. In a statement sent to HuffPost, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) called for “steady American leadership” in order to de-escalate the tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.“Bluster and saber-rattling will only exacerbate an already difficult situation,” Hirono said.Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) criticized Trump’s exchanges with North Korea in a series of tweets this week, calling the president’s statements “unwise in tone, substance,” and urging Americans to listen to the Pacific Command and U.S. Forces Korea commanders instead. Responding to reports that Trump improvised his North Korea remarks, Schatz said, “Am I supposed to be reassured?”Amid all this war talk, some in Hawaii want to remind the president who he is endangering when threatening North Korea with nuclear war. “Trump’s rhetoric puts Hawaii and even more Guam ... on the front line,” DeSoto Brown, Honolulu Bishop Museum historian, told HuffPost, likening the situation to Hawaii’s positioning during World War II. “The situation is again beyond our capacity to control it,” DeSoto said of a possible nuclear threat.“It’s just as it was in 1941 because of our geographic location and because of ... the country we are a part of,” he added, referring to the attack on Pearl Harbor. “There’s nothing we can really do about it except either ignore it or try to think seriously about what would we do.”"

What ties these officials up in knots are their efforts to square the circle of their “love of Israel,” their opposition to BDS, their support for a “two-state solution,” and their commitment to free speech. The bill in question, S720, was introduced on March 23, 2017 by Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD). S720 opposes calls by the United Nations to boycott or “blacklist” companies that support Israeli activities in the territories occupied in the 1967 war. The bill further prohibits any US person from supporting this UN call to boycott and establishes stiff fines and/or imprisonment for Americans who violate this prohibition. There are a number of problems with the legislation. In the first place, supporters of S720 grossly mischaracterize the intent of the UN approach as “anti-Israel.” In fact, as S720, itself, acknowledges, the UN Human Rights Council specifically targets only businesses that engage in activities in “territories occupied [by Israel] since 1967.” The UN target is not Israel, but Israeli actions that serve to consolidate its hold over the occupied territories. Then there is the concern that by making illegal either the act of boycotting Israel, or advocating for such a boycott, S720 is criminalizing free speech and stifling legitimate peaceful protest.Finally, the legislation continues to build on earlier Congressional legislation using slight of hand language in an attempt to erase the distinction in U.S. law between Israel and illegal Israeli settlements in occupied territories. While earlier legislation accomplished this by referring to “Israel and areas under Israel’s control,” S720 notes that its boycott prohibition applies to “commercial relations...with citizens or residents of Israel, entities organized under the laws of Israel, or the Government of Israel.”Since S720 quickly gained 48 co-sponsors (35 Republicans and 13 Democrats) and has been supported by AIPAC and the Anti-Defamation League, one might have expected it to sail effortlessly through the Congress and be put on the President’s desk for his signature. That, however, has not been the case due to the efforts of many, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other progressive organizations led by MoveOn. While the ACLU has based its opposition on the concern that the legislation violates the free speech rights of American citizens, MoveOn has taken a more expansive approach addressing both the concern with free speech and the fact that S720 “erases the distinction in US law between Israel and Israeli settlements.”Given the capacity of both organizations to influence and organize liberal opinion, some Democratic senators have felt compelled to either justify their support for the bill or to distance themselves from it. In too many instances, these efforts have been awkward. Two sponsors, Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) have gone to great, but unconvincing, lengths to explain that S720 does not violate an individual’s right to free speech. They argue that the bill is only directed at businesses or individuals who boycott Israel in response to international entities (like the UN or the European Union). But what they cannot explain is how punishing an American citizen who advocates for a UN boycott would not violate that citizen’s right to free speech. Cardin, Wyden, and other Democrats who support S720 also go to great lengths to pledge their support for a “two-state solution.” But their pledges are hollow since they fail to acknowledge that the provision of S720 that protects Israel’s settlement enterprise (“entities organized under the laws of Israel”) makes realization of a “two-state solution” impossible — given the location, size, and continued expansion of these illegal settlements. Even those who have come out against S720 have had some difficulty explaining themselves. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand‪​ (D-NY), for example, was one of the bill’s early endorsers. She courageously removed her name as a sponsor after learning of the free speech concerns of constitutional lawyers, saying “…I cannot support the bill in its current form if it can be interpreted as stifling or chilling free speech... So I took my name off the bill.”Gillibrand, nevertheless, felt the need to balance her free speech concern with her support for Israel and her opposition to BDS adding ‪​“I cannot state this more clearly: I vehemently oppose the BDS movement.”It’s this last point that requires closer examination. While Israel and its supporters make a brave show of shrugging off the threat of BDS, they clearly feel threatened — otherwise why the hyper-activity to punish BDS. S720 isn’t the first such effort in the Congress and nearly one-half of the 50 states have been pressed to pass their own versions of anti-BDS resolutions. In order to build support for their effort, advocates for Israel have tried to portray BDS in the harshest of terms. They have made Israel the victim and while portraying advocates of BDS as “virulently anti-Semetic” aggressors. All of this has been done to obfuscate the reality that BDS is nothing more than a “strategic Palestinian-led form of nonviolent resistance to the occupation and denial of human rights.”After 50 years of occupation, Palestinians have taken it upon themselves to challenge the world community to act. They have had enough of seeing their homes demolished and lands confiscated to make way for Jewish-only roads and settlement colonies in their midst. They want an end to the daily humiliation of being a captive people denied basic freedoms and justice. Instead of submitting to the occupier, they have decided to boycott and have urged those who support their human rights to join them in their call for an end to the occupation. Their action is as legitimate as was the call of African Americans in the Deep South in the ’50s, and that of Nelson Mandela in South Africa in the ’80s.For the Senate to oppose or to punish those who support this Palestinian call to individuals, businesses, and governments to boycott, divest, or sanction Israel for its oppressive occupation would put the Senate in the position of saying that: they support Israeli practices; they don’t want Palestinians to use non-violent means to protest their treatment; and/or they simply don’t believe that Palestinians are equal humans who deserve to have their rights protected.And so the messages we should send to senators are clear. To those who support S720: “Shame on you.” To those who oppose S720: “Thank you for your opposition, but think again about whether the problem is BDS or the occupation that gave birth to it.” And to all senators: “Stop hiding behind your hollow profession of support for ‘two states.’ If you are serious about peace, justice, and equality, stop enabling the occupation that makes the realization of those goals impossible.”Follow @jjz1600 for more."

One person died and 19 others were injured in the incident.By Saturday evening, multiple publications were reporting that suspect James Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, had been arrested in connection with the tragedy. “James Alex Fields Jr.... is charged with one count of 2nd degree murder, 3 counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death,” Col. Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, told HuffPost in an email.Kumer provided a mug shot of Fields.Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer announced the death on Twitter, hours after the governor declared a state of emergency. Hospital officials confirmed to The Associated Press the number of casualties. Fifteen other injuries related to the rally were reported, the City of Charlottesville said.The victim who died was a 32-year-old woman, Chief Al Thomas of the Charlottesville Police Department said at a news conference.Following a morning of clashes, the white supremacists at the rally and counter-protesters began to clear out Saturday afternoon after police threatened arrests. Hundreds of counter-protesters had met together to oppose the white supremacist gathering, marching in solidarity with marginalized groups and chanting “Black Lives Matter!” among other slogans.“It was an incredible scene,” 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik, who captured the anti-racist counter-demonstration on video, told HuffPost. “It was the most beautiful counter-rally.”Moments later, a car plowed into the crowd, and bodies went flying.“It was just terrifying,” said Pilnik, who has lived in Charlottesville for five years and works as an administrator for the University of Virginia’s school of engineering. “I remember people flying into me, telling me to run and get out of the way and watching people fly like they were just bowling pins.”Pilnik added that it was a “beautiful moment ripped away from us.”Pilnik believes the driver’s action was deliberate.“There is nothing in my mind that would ever tell me that this wasn’t an intentional act,” he said. “The way he plowed into the crowd and then reversed at full speed was nothing short of intentional. If he had been scared and made a mistake and rammed the people and hit the back of a car, there’s no way he would have shifted into reverse and slammed on the accelerator to run them over again.”Video shows the vehicle reverse back at a high rate of speed, running over people who’d just been struck, Pilnik said. Pilnik said white supremacy is all too real. And it’s time to take it seriously.“It’s taken me a long time to process, but I think it’s the fact that these [white supremacists] aren’t laughable,” he said. “They aren’t trolls, we actually have domestic terrorism going on and we’ve spent months, if not years, laughing them off.

One person died and 19 others were injured in the incident.By Saturday evening, multiple publications were reporting that suspect James Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, had been arrested in connection with the tragedy. “James Alex Fields Jr.... is charged with one count of 2nd degree murder, 3 counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death,” Col. Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, told HuffPost in an email.Kumer provided a mug shot of Fields.Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer announced the death on Twitter, hours after the governor declared a state of emergency. Hospital officials confirmed to The Associated Press the number of casualties. Fifteen other injuries related to the rally were reported, the City of Charlottesville said.The victim who died was a 32-year-old woman, Chief Al Thomas of the Charlottesville Police Department said at a news conference.Following a morning of clashes, the white supremacists at the rally and counter-protesters began to clear out Saturday afternoon after police threatened arrests. Hundreds of counter-protesters had met together to oppose the white supremacist gathering, marching in solidarity with marginalized groups and chanting “Black Lives Matter!” among other slogans.“It was an incredible scene,” 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik, who captured the anti-racist counter-demonstration on video, told HuffPost. “It was the most beautiful counter-rally.”Moments later, a car plowed into the crowd, and bodies went flying.“It was just terrifying,” said Pilnik, who has lived in Charlottesville for five years and works as an administrator for the University of Virginia’s school of engineering. “I remember people flying into me, telling me to run and get out of the way and watching people fly like they were just bowling pins.”Pilnik added that it was a “beautiful moment ripped away from us.”Pilnik believes the driver’s action was deliberate.“There is nothing in my mind that would ever tell me that this wasn’t an intentional act,” he said. “The way he plowed into the crowd and then reversed at full speed was nothing short of intentional. If he had been scared and made a mistake and rammed the people and hit the back of a car, there’s no way he would have shifted into reverse and slammed on the accelerator to run them over again.”Video shows the vehicle reverse back at a high rate of speed, running over people who’d just been struck, Pilnik said. Pilnik said white supremacy is all too real. And it’s time to take it seriously.“It’s taken me a long time to process, but I think it’s the fact that these [white supremacists] aren’t laughable,” he said. “They aren’t trolls, we actually have domestic terrorism going on and we’ve spent months, if not years, laughing them off. And that just can’t happen, it can’t continue to happen, it shouldn’t have happened in the first place, but what I’ve seen today just proves to me that it’s not a joke.

Terry McAuliffe (D), who declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, condemned the violence during a press conference that evening, sending a message to the white supremacists.“Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth,” he said. “Shame on you.”“Please go home and never come back. Take your hatred, and take your bigotry,” McAuliffe added.Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said 35 people were treated for injuries by city personnel on Saturday, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening.Three people died Saturday, including a 32-year-old woman who was hit by a car that plowed into a group of counter-demonstrators and two others who perished in a helicopter crash near the protests.James Alex Fields Jr., 20, was arrested in connection with the car incident. He was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death, police Col. Martin Kumer told HuffPost.“It was just terrifying,” said 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik, a Charlottesville resident who witnessed the crash. “I remember people flying into me, telling me to run and get out of the way and watching people fly like they were just bowling pins.”As of 10 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, police had made three other arrests related to the rally:“You came here today to hurt people and you did hurt people,” McAuliffe said at Saturday’s press conference.Groups in Charlottesville beat each other with flagpoles and bats, threw punches, chanted slogans and used chemical sprays on each other at a downtown park. Some reporters covering the event were doused in raw sewage.“There was a cloud,” said a witness, who asked not to be named. “Things were flying. Most people managed to get out of the way.”Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Saturday night that U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has opened a federal investigation into the violence at the rally, with the full support of the Justice Department.The U.S. attorney’s office and regional FBI office also announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deadly car crash.“The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,” Sessions said in a statement. “When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.”The “Unite the Right” rally was promoted by white nationalist Richard Spencer and drew several different groups, including activists from the so-called “alt-right,” Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other white supremacists, some of whom dressed in militia uniforms and were openly carrying long guns. Counter-demonstrators and anti-fascist groups also attended.After demonstrations got heated Friday night, tensions were running high even before the rally officially began at noon, with members of the “alt-right” chanting the Nazi phrase “Blood and soil!” and “White lives matter!” as they marched toward Emancipation Park. With Confederate flags and Nazi memorabilia on full display, they also chanted “Fuck you faggots!”James Allsup, who was in Charlottesville for the “Unite the Right” rally, told Mediaite that “white people are tired of being told by the cosmopolitan elites that we are the problem.”“This is the biggest racist rally in recent memory,” a 23-year-old anti-fascist from Michigan, who wouldn’t give his name, told HuffPost. “And we are all out here opposing these motherfuckers and trying to get a temperature check where the right is ― where the far right is at ― and how they’re organizing, and where we can apply radical strategies to defeat fascism.”Early Saturday, McAuliffe asked on Twitter for a stop to the violence.As violence among the groups grew on Saturday morning, some fled the scene, while others coughed and cried from the chemical sprays. Two fences and a line of cops helped separate the opposing groups, though police did not immediately intervene in the violence.Police donned riot gear as fights escalated. Meanwhile, hundreds more white supremacists joined in the fray through the afternoon, making their way under a banner hung by the city that read “Diversity makes us stronger.”Those standing on the sidelines were baffled as to why police weren’t immediately stopping the skirmishes.“If this were Ferguson, riot gear, tear gas, everything would have been used,” said Anthony Bennett, a pastor from Connecticut, referring to the Missouri town where protests broke out in August 2014 after Darren Wilson, at the time a police officer, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. “There’s a different standard here in Charlottesville.”Unidentified militia members brandishing guns also showed up at the scene.Just minutes before the planned noon rally was set to begin, police threatened arrest for “unlawful assembly.” Thousands of people began to disperse, but it wasn’t immediately clear where they were going.Eventually, arrests began.Late Friday night, a white nationalist march at the University of Virginia campus painted a sobering picture of what was to come. A torch-bearing procession of hundreds that included Spencer, at least one man wearing a Nazi SS T-shirt and another carrying a bat, ended with a clash at the campus rotunda where a Thomas Jefferson statue stands. Spencer admitted on Twitter that a group surrounded counter-protesters at the statue. Counter-protesters told HuffPost that some among their ranks were then hit with some type of irritant Friday night ― they claim it was Mace, unleashed by the white supremacists. Protesters on the fringe left, who come to these events to battle the fringe right, often try to hide their identities for fear of retaliation.Some counter-protesters threatened a HuffPost reporter with a gun when he attempted to photograph, from a distance, those recovering from the irritant. “Don’t make me use my gun on you,” a woman said, grabbing a holster on her hip.Punches and torches were thrown during the fracas, but local police eventually dispersed the crowds.President Donald Trump did little to denounce the white supremacists, instead saying Saturday that “many sides” were responsible for the violence.“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides,” Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. “It’s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It’s been going on for a long, long time.” According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S. since avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof massacred nine parishioners at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy.“These efforts have made us a target for folks around the country who oppose telling the full story of race,” Signer told HuffPost on Friday. “They don’t want the narrative changed or to tell the full story of race. I think this will have the effect of redoubling our progress. To become an honest society, I don’t think we have any choice but to tell the full story.”The rally’s real purpose, however, shines through in the event’s advertising, which looks a lot like Nazi propaganda and reads like a poorly billed concert:Spencer’s followers claimed that that violence was coming to Charlottesville in the form of “roving mobs” of Antifa ― groups of black-clad, masked anti-fascists, anarchists and socialists. It’s a scare tactic that white nationalists use regularly to pull crowds of people to a city in defense of it.They were able to draw hundreds to Gettysburg over the Fourth of July weekend after claiming members of Antifa were coming to desecrate graves. Antifa never came, but the Ku Klux Klan did, and the only bloodshed came when a lone patriot shot himself in the leg.The weeks and days leading up to the rally in Charlottesville had the city gearing up for war. The city had seen this type of menacing before: White supremacists showed up with torches at the Lee monument in May, an act that evoked Ku Klux Klan symbolism.Some businesses closed down Saturday to keep employees safe. Others reportedly opened their doors solely as a safe space in case of an emergency. Some locals were prepared to take drastic measures to protect their city.“As a lifelong resident of Charlottesville and a mother of two, this is about making the world more equitable for my children,” Leslie Scott-Jones of Solidarity C’Ville wrote in a news release. “I am not naive about the urgent threat of August 12, nor do I believe the threat ends there... My family has been here since the 1700′s, this is my home, and I have no other choice than to protect it.”This article has been updated with new details, including comments from Trump and anti-fascist demonstrators, information about Fields and information about the various investigations into Saturday’s events.Sebastian Murdock, Paige Lavender and Carla Herreria contributed to this report."

It seems that China is rushing to actively check the North with the belief that there will be nothing good about it if the tensions between the North and the U.S. actually lead to military clashes. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently urged North Korea to actively respond to the United States' ""Four Nos"" principle - in which the U.S. does not seek regime change, the collapse of the regime, an accelerated reunification of the Peninsula or an excuse to send the US military into North Korea. According to the Western sources in Beijing on Thursday, the principle was revealed by the U.S. secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the 7th East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Manila, Philippines, on August 7. Ri Yong-ho, the North's foreign minister, has not shown a positive attitude in response. But China's position is completely different. In a way, China views that the 'Four Nos' principle as the most appropriate and well-balanced change in U.S. attitude toward 'peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula', which has been always emphasized by itself. No wonder China is strongly pressuring North Korea to accept it. China's ambassador to North Korea recently said, ""The missile launch test violates the Security Council's resolution on North Korea. China has no choice but to take the same stance as the international community."" This remark should be also seen as a part of China's pressure on the North. It's a kind of warning that the North will face more severe sanctions if the North launches additional missiles in the future. It also means that the North should be careful about its Hwasong-12 missile threat on Guam, a US territory in the Pacific. China seems to be also considering military and economic options if North Korea continues to ignore its advice. In fact, China has recently conducted large-scale military drills in Yellow Sea and the North-China borders. Besides, the sources say that China is also reviewing to cut oil supplies to North Korea for a long time. China's firm attitude won't change if the North does not take enough measures to relieve tension on the Korean Peninsula. Perhaps, the U.S.' complaint that China isn't doing more to stop North Korea is exaggerated. + This article was originally published on AsiaToday. (See original version)"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598e0be615000021008b639b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most call themselves Guamanians, while the indigenous peoples prefer “Chamorros.” Some jokingly use the moniker “Guamy Bears.” Lately, the governor of Guam has been reminding the world of another identity: American citizens.Roughly 160,000 people live on Guam, a South Pacific island that’s considered sovereign U.S. territory, and they’re all U.S. citizens. Guam Governor Eddie Calvo reminded Fox News of that on Wednesday (the network evidently needed a lesson), hours after North Korea threatened to fire four missiles at the island.While the prospect of a newly emboldened North Korea has made many Americans anxious, Guam, located 2,200 miles southeast of the rogue state, has lived with the possibility of an attack for far longer. And for the most part, its residents think everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down.“North Korea has a history of saber rattling,” Eric Tydingco, a lifelong resident of Guam and the CEO and president of the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Guam & CNMI, told HuffPost in an email. “I’m not changing anything about my daily routine, and I believe most folks here feel the same.” Tydingco said he’s confident that the American military, which has a large presence on the island, is capable of minimizing the threat, should it come to that. Guam is equipped with a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system designed to shoot down incoming missiles.  “We’ve got two military bases here (which is the obvious reason we’re even considered a target),” he said, “and I’m certain that the US military installations have already planned to deter any missile launch directed here.” Karly O’Neal, a mechanical engineer who has lived in Guam for 10 years, said the threat posed to Guam by North Korea has probably been overhyped.“I don’t feel like North Korea has the targeting capabilities to hit Guam,” she said in an email. “And even if they could successfully target us, the U.S. military installations here have defense capabilities which I feel pretty confident would keep anything from actually hitting us.” Calvo, for his part, struck a similarly levelheaded tone in his interview with Fox.“These bellicose statements, this is something that is no different than [what North Korea] has been doing since 2013,” the governor said Wednesday.“There is concern and worry but there’s no panic,” he added. “We encourage everyone to go through their lives and live them like you would do any other day.”Not everyone is sanguine. Chamorro poet and activist Craig Santos Perez told The Atlantic he’s both concerned and angry that Guam is in this position to begin with.“Definitely concern was the first feeling, but then of course anger that Guam is put into the crosshairs of the situation,” he said. “My opinion is the American military presence... has made Guam a target most of all. Really, the answer is not THAAD or more weapons, but demilitarization and thinking about how we can create peace in the region and have the de-proliferation of nuclear weapons, both in Korea and in the United States.” More so than an actual attack, O’Neal said she’s concerned about the political rhetoric surrounding North Korea’s capabilities. She fears that even a failed attempt on that country’s part could spiral into something much more damaging to many more people beyond Guam.“They could TRY to hit us... and that in itself might just start WWIII,” she said. “So I feel like the threat is as real to everyone else as it is to Guam.”Beyond having commonsense discussions and drafting emergency plans, O’Neal’s daily routine hasn’t changed. She suspects the same is true of many other Guamanians.Should Trump and Kim continue to issue belligerent statements, however, she does worry about what it might do to tourism, which brings in 60 percent of Guam’s yearly business revenue.“I feel like we are on the brink of another possible Cuban Missile Crisis type of situation, where one wrong move could lead to a disastrous outcome,” O’Neal said. “We need someone with a cool head in charge. But since we don’t have that, we need Trump to do his best to act like one.”“If I could tell Trump one thing,” she said, “it would be... when dealing with an unstable powder keg, don’t be a match.”"

Africa’s 830 Million Young People By 2050,"Siddharth Chatterjee, ContributorUnited Nations Resident Coordinator, Kenya",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/promise-or-peril-africas-830-million-young-people_us_598c608de4b08a4c247f28a1,"This article has been co-authored with Honourable Mr. John Dramani Mahama, the former President of the Republic of Ghana",2017-08-11,<p><em>Many migrants use the dangerous sea route crossing between North Africa and Italy in search of a better life. </em> </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598c65672200001a001a555f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This article has been co-authored with Honourable Mr. John Dramani Mahama, the former President of the Republic of Ghana and was originally featured in Reuters.Last month, Spanish charity workers rescued 167 migrants arriving from Africa aboard a small boat. 2016 was the deadliest for migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean, with at least 3800 deaths recorded. Most know the dangers they face on the route, yet still choose the possibility of death in overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels over the hopelessness of life in areas they reside.Consider this. Every 24 hours, nearly 33,000 youth across Africa join the search for employment. About 60% will be joining the army of the unemployed.A report from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees released this month claims that seven in ten of those heading for Europe are not refugees fleeing war or persecution, but economic migrants in search of better lives. 12 August 2017, is International Youth Day.Africa’s youth population is growing rapidly and is expected to reach over 830 million by 2050. Whether this spells promise or peril depends on how the continent manages its “youth bulge”. According to the World Bank, 40% of people who join rebel movements are motivated by lack of economic opportunity. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted, “The frustration generated in young people that have no hope in the future is a major source of insecurity in today’s world. And it is essential that when Governments plan their economic activities, when the international community develops forms of cooperation, they put youth employment, youth skills at the centre of all priorities...” Some estimates indicate that more than half a million Africans migrated to European Union countries between 2013 and 2016, adding to the millions flowing in from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghnistan and parts of Asia. Many of Africa’s young people remain trapped in poverty that is reflected in multiple dimensions, blighted by poor education, access to quality health care, malnutrition and lack of job opportunities. For many young people–and especially girls– the lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services is depriving them of their rights and the ability to make decisions about their bodies and plan their families. This is adversely affecting their education and employment opportunities.According to UNDP’s Africa Human Development Report for 2016, gender inequalities cost sub-Saharan Africa US$ 95 billion annually in lost revenue. Women’s empowerment and gender equality needs to be at the top of national development plans.Between 10 and 12 million people join the African labour force each year, yet the continent creates only 3.7 million jobs annually. Without urgent and sustained action, the spectre of a migration crisis looms that no wall, navy or coastguard can hope to stop. “The future of Africa’s youth does not lie in migration to Europe, but in a prosperous Africa”, the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, has said.Africa’s population is expected to reach around 2.3 billion by 2050. The accompanying increase in its working age population creates a window of opportunity, which if properly harnessed, can translate into higher growth and yield a demographic dividend. In the wake of the Second World War, the Marshall Plan helped to rebuild shattered European economies in the interests of growth and stability. We need a plan of similar ambition that places youth employment in Africa at the centre of development. For example, one sector that Africa must prioritise is agribusiness, whose potential is almost limitless. Makhtar Diop, World Bank Vice President for Africa Region has said, “We cannot overstate the importance of agriculture to Africa’s determination to maintain and boost its high growth rates, create more jobs, significantly reduce poverty….”. The World Bank says African agriculture and agribusiness could be worth US $1 trillion by 2030. Agriculture can help people overcome poor health and malnutrition. Given the importance of agriculture for the livelihoods of the rural poor, agricultural growth has the potential to greatly reduce poverty – a key contributor to poor health and undernutrition. In the meantime, the aging demographic in many Western and Asian Tiger economies means increasing demand for skilled labour from regions with younger populations. It also means larger markets for economies seeking to benefit from the growth of a rapidly expanding African middle class. Consumer spending in Africa is projected to reach US $1.4 trillion in the next three years and business-to-business spending to reach $3.5 trillion in the next eight years.Whether the future of Africa is promising or perilous will depend on how the continent and the international community moves from stated intent to urgent action and must give special priority to those SDGs that will give the continent a competitive edge through its youth. The core SDGs of ending poverty, ensuring healthy lives and ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education all have particular resonance with the challenge of empowering youth and making them effective economic citizens. As we mark International Youth Day, there is hope. Many young people in Africa are taking charge of their futures. There is a rising tide of entrepreneurship sweeping across Africa spanning technology, IT, innovation, small and medium enterprises. They are creating jobs for themselves and their communities. The African Development Bank is working on creating 25 million jobs and equipping at least 50 million youth to realize their full economic potential by 2025.The African Union established the theme for 2017 as “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend Through Investments in Youth.” This will determine Africa’s enormous promise to realise its economic and social potential as well as reap a demographic dividend (video).Honourable Mr John Dramani Mahama, is the former President of the Republic of Ghana, follow him on twitter.

And it is essential that when Governments plan their economic activities, when the international community develops forms of cooperation, they put youth employment, youth skills at the centre of all priorities...” Some estimates indicate that more than half a million Africans migrated to European Union countries between 2013 and 2016, adding to the millions flowing in from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghnistan and parts of Asia. Many of Africa’s young people remain trapped in poverty that is reflected in multiple dimensions, blighted by poor education, access to quality health care, malnutrition and lack of job opportunities. For many young people–and especially girls– the lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services is depriving them of their rights and the ability to make decisions about their bodies and plan their families. This is adversely affecting their education and employment opportunities.According to UNDP’s Africa Human Development Report for 2016, gender inequalities cost sub-Saharan Africa US$ 95 billion annually in lost revenue. Women’s empowerment and gender equality needs to be at the top of national development plans.Between 10 and 12 million people join the African labour force each year, yet the continent creates only 3.7 million jobs annually. Without urgent and sustained action, the spectre of a migration crisis looms that no wall, navy or coastguard can hope to stop. “The future of Africa’s youth does not lie in migration to Europe, but in a prosperous Africa”, the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, has said.Africa’s population is expected to reach around 2.3 billion by 2050. The accompanying increase in its working age population creates a window of opportunity, which if properly harnessed, can translate into higher growth and yield a demographic dividend. In the wake of the Second World War, the Marshall Plan helped to rebuild shattered European economies in the interests of growth and stability. We need a plan of similar ambition that places youth employment in Africa at the centre of development. For example, one sector that Africa must prioritise is agribusiness, whose potential is almost limitless. Makhtar Diop, World Bank Vice President for Africa Region has said, “We cannot overstate the importance of agriculture to Africa’s determination to maintain and boost its high growth rates, create more jobs, significantly reduce poverty….”. The World Bank says African agriculture and agribusiness could be worth US $1 trillion by 2030. Agriculture can help people overcome poor health and malnutrition. Given the importance of agriculture for the livelihoods of the rural poor, agricultural growth has the potential to greatly reduce poverty – a key contributor to poor health and undernutrition. In the meantime, the aging demographic in many Western and Asian Tiger economies means increasing demand for skilled labour from regions with younger populations. It also means larger markets for economies seeking to benefit from the growth of a rapidly expanding African middle class. Consumer spending in Africa is projected to reach US $1.4 trillion in the next three years and business-to-business spending to reach $3.5 trillion in the next eight years.Whether the future of Africa is promising or perilous will depend on how the continent and the international community moves from stated intent to urgent action and must give special priority to those SDGs that will give the continent a competitive edge through its youth. The core SDGs of ending poverty, ensuring healthy lives and ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education all have particular resonance with the challenge of empowering youth and making them effective economic citizens. As we mark International Youth Day, there is hope. Many young people in Africa are taking charge of their futures. There is a rising tide of entrepreneurship sweeping across Africa spanning technology, IT, innovation, small and medium enterprises. They are creating jobs for themselves and their communities. The African Development Bank is working on creating 25 million jobs and equipping at least 50 million youth to realize their full economic potential by 2025.The African Union established the theme for 2017 as “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend Through Investments in Youth.” This will determine Africa’s enormous promise to realise its economic and social potential as well as reap a demographic dividend (video).Honourable Mr John Dramani Mahama, is the former President of the Republic of Ghana, follow him on twitter.

Some people were still stuck inside the trains, a medical official told state TV.State television showed dozens of people crowding around the damaged train cars, with bodies strewn on the ground.“The train I was riding was going very quickly,” said passenger Moumen Youssef. “I found myself on the floor. When we came out, we found four train cars crushed and a lot of people on the ground.”Egyptians have long complained that successive governments failed to enforce basic safeguards for the railways, leading to a string of fatal crashes.In 2012, a train plowed into a school bus south of Cairo and killed 50 people, mostly children, inflaming public anger over Egypt’s antiquated transport network.In Egypt’s worst train disaster, a fire tore through seven carriages of an overcrowded passenger train in 2002, killing at least 360 people.(Reporting by Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, Mahmoud Mourad and Ellen Francis; Additional reporting by Mostafa Hashem, Haitham El Sheikh and Osama Naguib; Writing by Ellen Francis; Editing by Richard Balmforth)"

And seven times—predictably—the motion was defeated. The eighth time was different. With the blessing of the Constitutional Court, the Speaker of the House announced on Monday, August 7 that the vote on the following day would be by secret ballot. This extraordinary move, vigorously debated by my South African friends on social media, seemed to fly in the face of the democratic principle of transparency. Despite assurances to the contrary, it threatened to set a dangerous precedent in a country with a 23-year young democracy. But a climate of harassment and violence—including death threats received by a parliamentarian from the President’s own party who dared suggest that a secret ballot would allow legislators to vote their conscience—led to Speaker Mbete’s surprise decision.As someone who had watched from the gallery several times during parliamentary deliberations and votes, August 8 was impressive. The heated debate, punctuated by numerous points of order, was par for the course. But when, after a pause in the proceedings, four large voting booths and two ballot boxes were arranged in the well, any similarity to anything that had ever taken place in that room ended. The doors were locked. The ballot boxes were displayed with a flourish in much the same way a magician shows that the top hat is empty. Parliamentary staff took turns reading the list of 400 names in alphabetical order. Parliamentarians took their paper ballots—printed with ‘yes’ ‘no’ and ‘abstain’—into the booth, made their mark, and deposited the folded papers into the boxes. The booths were removed, and the counting table set up in the center of the well, tightly surrounded by the Speaker and a representative of each party. Even before the results were announced, members of the African National Congress (ANC)—President Zuma’s party—began singing and dancing on the floor. The result: 198 opposed; 177 in favor; and 9 abstentions meant that President Zuma lived to fight another day. But it also meant that about 35 ANC members voted ‘no confidence’ in the leader of their party, an extraordinary move in a system where party loyalty is mandated. As an American I could not help but wonder what a vote of ‘no confidence’ in President Donald Trump would look like in the U.S. Senate. Although party loyalty is not mandated under our representative system of government, in recent years Republicans have—with few exceptions—voted lock-step with their party leader. They’ve even NOT voted in lock-step. Perhaps the best example of this was their absolute refusal to allow for even a committee debate on President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. When three Republicans dared put the interests of their constituents above party loyalty by opposing an ill-conceived, rough draft health care bill that threatened to raise insurance rates and leave millions without health care, they were excoriated by the Republican media machine and threatened with dire retaliation by the President, among others. The health care vote was in the open and transparent but there’s reasonable speculation that behind-the-scenes threats and wealthy PACS and political donors successfully pressured some of those Republicans who had been sitting on the fence. Watching South African parliamentarians mark their secret ballots led me to fantasize about what it might be like if the U.S. Senate similarly voted on a ‘no confidence’ motion on President Trump. Of course our Congress is not a parliament, and no confidence is an impossible non-starter when it comes to the president.But maybe there are other votes that might serve to gauge the legislature’s ‘confidence’ in the chief executive? What if the Senate used a secret ballot to vote the next time President Trump nominates an intemperate, inexperienced extremist (for example John K. Bush, among others) to a life-time seat on a federal court? After all, confirming a Trump nominee carefully vetted for judicial views that align with those held by him and others calling the shots in the White House only serves to enshrine those views well into the future. What if the health care vote had been by secret ballot? Frustrating though it would be for those of us who fiercely advocated our point of view with the senators who represent us, I can’t help but wonder if there would have been more Republicans voting their conscience without worrying about getting punished by the President and Senate Majority Leader (which certainly seems to be more frightening than the possibility of losing support from voters at home).I don’t expect to ever see voting booths installed in the U.S. Senate in my lifetime and, fantasy aside, that’s a relief. The August 8 secret ballot exercise did not by any means end the effort to remove South Africa’s President whose corruption and “derelict leadership” are a continuing and dangerous drama with new revelations daily. Unlike the South African parliament, the U.S. Congress has only dipped its toe in a process that may lead to the end of an American President whose corruption and derelict leadership are a continuing dangerous drama with new revelations daily. As they say in both countries—stay tuned."

Combustible language is common: In response to U.N. Security Council sanctions in 2013, the country threatened to engulf Washington, which it called a “stronghold of evils,” in a “sea of fire.” In 2012, North Korea threatened to reduce South Korea’s government “to ashes in three or four minutes.” Similar threats were leveled a year earlier, with promises to turn Seoul’s presidential palace, the Blue House, into a “sea of fire.” Flame-related phrases have been in use since at least 1994.Revere described the cyclical threats as part of an attempt to be heard on the international playing field.“Their bombastic words, those threats to turn neighbors into seas of fire ― they feel that this is something that the United States will take seriously, and will not respond to kinetically,” Revere said. “It’s distasteful. It’s uncomfortable. But if you look at their words, there is a logic and a rationale in the North Korean mind.”Others point to the reclusive nation’s longevity as an authoritarian regime as evidence of a fully formed diplomatic strategy, since other countries ― like Myanmar, China and Vietnam ― have seen such total control fall away.“If Kim Jong Un were crazy and irrational, North Korea wouldn’t exist in 2017,” said Sokeel Park, director of research and strategy for the refugee resettlement group Liberty in North Korea. “Looking at the history, we really have to ask ourselves: How has North Korea been able to maintain such a system, against all the odds? We’re in a situation where in 2017, North Korea is last man standing in terms of totalitarian states.”Previous U.S. presidents have condemned such bombastic statements from the North, but still sought to bring the country to the bargaining table in an effort to convince the Kims to give up long-held aspirations for a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. President Donald Trump ― the first American leader confronted with a North Korean missile that experts believe could reach California, and possibly a nuclear weapon to fit on top of it ― has taken such denunciation to new extremes.On Tuesday, Trump made his own threat of “fire and fury like the world has never seen” against North Korea. On Thursday, he said his earlier comments may not have been “tough enough,” as North Korea has been “doing this to our country for a long time, for many years.” And on Friday, he tweeted that the U.S. military was “locked and loaded,” should North Korea “act unwisely.”Trump has previously described Kim as possibly “a total nut job,” and others in his administration have offered similar appraisals. “We are not dealing with a rational person,” Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in March. “If this was any other country, we would be talking about that, and it wouldn’t be an issue. This is not a rational person, who has not had rational acts, who is not thinking clearly.”Some experts, however, argue that Kim knows exactly what he’s doing. Kuyoun Chung, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a think tank funded by the South Korean government, described North Korea as “very rational.” Behind each promise of fire, she said, lies an opportunity for “regime survival.” “Describing North Korea as irrational and crazy [in the U.S.] might demonize the existence of the Kim Jong Un regime, or provide the rationale to criticize or kind of act more coercively towards North Korea,” Chung said. “But that does not really help the security of the United States and the security of northeast Asia.”Rather, analysts say, Kim may be trying to push back against international efforts to strip the country of its nuclear might, with the aim of being recognized as a world power on par with the United States and China.“He learned how power works from [an] early age,” Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Seoul’s Dongguk University, told The New York Times in a lengthy profile of Kim. “Kim Jong Un is here to rule for decades, playing the long game. Over time, he believes that the world will have no option but to accept his country as a nuclear power.”Revere said that despite the recent threats toward Guam ― which he described as “bizarre” ― he didn’t think the North would preemptively attack the United States, because Kim “understands what the consequences might be” and isn’t “suicidal.”“Despite the reality of growing North Korea military capabilities, I don’t see us on the brink of war,” he said. “I don’t see us on the brink of a nuclear exchange, unless someone miscalculates greatly.”On the other hand, Revere pointed to Trump’s own escalation of rhetoric as a “troubling” deviation from past strongly worded messages from American leaders.“The North Koreans may see it as bluff,” he said. “But our allies are listening to it very carefully, and are clearly unnerved by it.”"

Cameras at the July 14 press event, which was intended to drum up excitement for the pair’s Aug. 26 boxing match in Las Vegas, captured the moment for posterity.While some questioned whether or not the verbal attack had been staged, many Twitter users branded the 40-year-old boxer a homophobe.Days after the clip went viral, Mayweather’s rep attempted to do damage control, telling TMZ that his client felt compelled to lash out at McGregor because the UFC fighter had addressed him with racial slurs, including “monkey,” offstage. Mayweather doubled down on that explanation in a Thursday interview with Yahoo Sports, noting, “There are certain boundaries you just don’t cross.”“I apologized, but him calling us monkeys, you have to realize, we went through years and years of up and down,” he said. “Black Americans went through a lot.”Describing himself as a “strong individual,” Mayweather encouraged fans to put his heated exchanges with McGregor on their press tour aside and let the forthcoming match speak for itself.“We live and we learn,” he said, “and hopefully after Aug. 26, he won’t be speaking that same language.”Find ways to combat bigotry by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

Diaz-Balart’s office in Miami for the #Not1Dollar campaign</em> </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598dea13140000301aed04e7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Thomas KennedyDonald Trump spent a good portion of the 2016 election cycle mindlessly chanting “build that wall” alongside his supporters, amid promises that he would somehow make Mexico pay for the estimated $67 billion that a wall along the southern border would cost.In a phone call which took place on January 27th, Trump attempted to pressure Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto into not voicing any opposition to his public plan of having Mexico pay for the wall, saying: “If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,"" and stating that any opposition should not be made public. “You cannot say that to the press,"" Trump said.The Trump administration is now singing a different tune, stating that the U.S. government will pay for the initial cost of the wall just to get the project off the ground, but that Mexico will eventually reimburse it for the full cost. An impossible prospect.The border wall funding is just another piece in Trump’s larger immigration crackdown, as his administration seeks to weaponize the federal budget as a tool to be used against immigrant communities in an effort to deport and terrorize hardworking families.The cruel budget proposed by the Trump administration seeks to allocate draconian anti-immigrant expenditures such as $1.5 billion to detain and deport undocumented immigrants, $300 million to bring in 1,500 new immigration agents, $1.2 billion to expand the nations detention centers to their biggest capacity in history and about $75 million to hire immigration judges and support staff.Overall the Trump administration is requesting about $4.6 billion to fund its agenda of family separation and mass criminalization at a time when the country is seeing low record numbers of border crossings.It is up to our community to put a stop to this senseless spending and demand that Congress protect our loved ones. This week in Miami, after a powerful convening hosted by the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), over 70 youth activists from all over the country rallied outside the office of GOP Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart to both protest his vote in favor of the border wall and demand that he vote NO on Trump’s anti-immigrant budget.Video by Diario Las Americas. Other activists worried that they or their families would soon be at risk of deportation if their Temporary Protective Status (TPS) or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) were revoked, and hoped that Representative Diaz-Balart would support them, as he has been supportive of pro-immigrant legislation in the past such as the DREAM Act.It’s now up to Congress to do the responsible thing and reject this cruel and senseless budget. Instead of spending taxpayer dollars on the criminalization and separation of families that are contributing to the economic engine of this country, lawmakers should instead allocate those funds to much needed programs that help the public, with a focus on healthcare and education.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow with the Center for Community Change."

But the hotel’s $660.28 average nightly rate― far higher than the rate of comparable hotels in the area ― made it a lucrative property. And as The Wall Street Journal points out, the hotel also received a higher-than-normal portion of its revenue from food and beverages. The General Services Administration, the property’s landlord, posted detailed information about the hotel’s finances online on Thursday. “The documents were posted inadvertently and have been removed from the website,” a spokesperson for the GSA told HuffPost in a statement.The new records bolster concerns about the hotel and the Trump Organization. Because Trump did not fully divest from his businesses, he still benefits financially from the hotel, which ethics groups have suggested leaves him open to major conflicts of interest, including bribery. In June, lobbying records revealed that the hotel received nearly $270,000 from Saudi Arabia, which had been pushing the U.S. to abandon legislation allowing U.S. citizens to sue foreign governments over terrorism. Trump eventually said he would donate the Saudi payments to the Treasury.The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington alleged in January that Trump was violating the hotel’s lease by not divesting from his company.“The potential conflicts of interest with regard to President Trump’s company’s lease of the Old Post Office Building are serious and real,” CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said. “President Trump now both owns the lessee, Old Post Office LLC, and controls the lessor, GSA, whose administrator is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the president.”It’s not the only Trump property that has benefited financially from its namesake’s presidency. Many of Trump’s other properties, including the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the Turnberry golf club in Scotland, have also increased their membership fees since the election.

It’s made the drag icon an asset to comic legends past and present and allows her to make light of the unimaginable ― from AIDS to racism. The razor-tongued diva tackles frustrations about the current state of U.S. politics with equal aplomb. “This is like going in for heart surgery and finding a donkey holding the scalpel,” said Beat of President Trump during a recent, expletive-laden interview with Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. Though she jokes about the state of affairs in America today, as she does many other tragic topics, Beat notes the country’s leadership woes are no laughing matter. The comedy pro expressed her extreme disgust with Trump — “He goes on late night tweeting sprees like a 14-year-old girl!” — even before the President began escalating already-strained U.S. relations with North Korea this week. ""This is something we have never dealt with before,"" Beat said during her extended conversation on Podomatic's No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast.""Kids, please wake up! Get mad!"" she implored. ""Please get pissed off; please talk shit about the President.""Beat frequently expresses her strong political views and disdain for the U.S. President via social media. The response of some followers, she admitted, arouses concern that youth, in particular, do not recognize the gravity of what the nation faces. ""I get these comments from young kids saying 'Why are you being negative?' 'Don't you know giving [Trump] this negative energy just makes him more famous?'"" shared Beat. “More famous?!

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598cc3b42200002d001a569f.jpeg?cache=Qz9VR7IWXg&ops=crop_6_0_2494_1543%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In March 2013, former Steubenville high school students Ma’lik Richmond and Trent Mays were convicted of raping an unconscious 16-year-old girl at a party in 2012. Now, 20-year-old Richmond (who spent less than a year in a juvenile detention center and had to register as a sex offender) attends Youngstown State University in Ohio and recently joined the school’s football team as a defensive tackle.The decision, and Richmond’s new and high-profile position on campus, have stirred up strong reactions from other Youngstown students ― especially survivors of sexual assault who say participation in athletics is a privilege that Richmond lost the moment he raped a 16-year-old girl. “I strongly believe that education is a right and sports are a privilege,” 21-year-old YSU student and sexual assault survivor Rachel* told HuffPost. “I believe that Ma’lik should have been forced to hang up his cleats the night he raped that young girl.” Rachel, along with 11,000 others, have signed a Change.org petition urging the school to remove Richmond from the team. Richmond had been practicing with the team from February to April 2017 and, according to YSU, earned a spot as a walk-on on Aug. 2. “As YSU students prepare to return to school and spend fall nights watching their football team play, there is a huge problem,” the Change.org petition, created by YSU student Katelyn Davis, reads. “That problem is that Richmond will be on the field, playing a game. He will be representing the university and all that it stands for. President Tressel and Coach Pelini, are you more concerned with your football team’s status than the disgusting rape of a young girl?” Students HuffPost spoke to are mainly upset with head football coach Bo Pelini. According to local newspaper the Vindicator, Richmond wasn’t look to play football at YSU; it was Coach Pelini who approached him about playing.“The kid is humble and he wants to put [his past] behind him,” Pelini told The Vindicator. “He’s been going to school. He’s been here as a student. He’s proved he can be part of the student community.” Students organizing against Richmond aren’t only at odds with Pelini and the school administration ― they’re going up against other students as well. On Aug. 6 other YSU students created a petition in support of Richmond titled “Second Chance For Ma’lik.” “Ma’lik was convicted and has served his punishment and has since earned the right to attend Youngstown State and participate on the football team,” the petition in support of Richmond reads. “Being that he has accepted his punishment and has served his time we are in full support of Youngstown State University giving this young man a chance to have an impact on society.”As of Friday morning, the petition had received over 1,000 signatures. In response to the mounting controversy surrounding Richmond, the school sent an email to all YSU students on Wednesday evening explaining that Richmond will be a “practice player” and will not compete in any games during the fall 2017 football season. While the school wrote that it’s “fully aware of the gravity of the situation,” Richmond will remain on the team. “YSU does not restrict any student’s ability to take part in extracurricular activities as long as they are in good standing with the institution,” the statement reads. “YSU believes that extracurricular activities assist in a student’s ability to succeed.”Read the full YSU email below, provided to HuffPost by a YSU student.Even though YSU is making Richmond sit out this season, he’ll most likely still have one more year of eligibility to play football in 2018. YSU sophomore and sexual assault survivor Alyssa,* who also signed the petition, was not satisfied with YSU benching Richmond. She wants to see him off the team altogether.“I do not think this has resolved the problem, since Ma’lik is still a member of the team,” she said. “His presence strikes fear into survivors and victims ― a campus should be a safe space for anyone and everyone, but by not only accommodating a convicted rapist, but allowing him the privilege of representing the school, people who have experienced sexual assault and harassment will be forced to relive these traumatic events and fear that they are attending a school that condones such things.”Other supporters of the petition voiced their disappointment that Richmond will remain on the football team in a Facebook group for a Sept. 9 protest. The protest, which will take place at a football tailgate, will specifically call out YSU President Jim Tressel and Coach Pelini for allowing Richmond on the team, and to stand in solidarity with survivors on campus. “Only until next season [will Richmond be sitting out]. Then he can play. The wording is misleading on purpose,” one member of the Facebook group wrote, referring to YSU’s emailed statement on Richmond.Another member of the Facebook group was more optimistic, writing: “I feel that it is a step in the right direction and I’m impressed that our voices have been heard and at least acknowledged.” Ciddy Howlett, a 23-year-old YSU student, told HuffPost that the university’s decision to bench Richmond for a year is good but not great. “I do feel that the school’s administrators heard our concerns; and I am glad to see that he won’t be actively playing this season,” she said. “That being said, I wish they would have cut him from the team in general. I have no real problem with Ma’lik attending classes. Education plays a key role in rehabilitation. Playing football and serving as a representation of the university does not.” *Names have been changed for privacy purposes."
38,POLITICS,Trump's FCC Chair Backed Off Obama-Era Rule On Inmate Calls That Hurt An Ex-Client,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fcc-chairman-ex-client-inmate-calling_us_598e0f99e4b090964297093d,An inmate advocacy group publicized Ajit Pai's prior work this week.,2017-08-11,"Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, did legal work for Securus Technologies before he became an FCC commissioner.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598e0ff615000021008b63ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai backed off from Obama-era regulations that sought to make phone calls more affordable for inmates but that also hurt one of Pai’s former clients: Securus Technologies, an inmate calling service provider.The Human Rights Defense Center, an inmate advocacy group that brought Pai’s disclosure about his work for Securus to light this week, finds the connection troubling. However, an FCC spokesperson told HuffPost that his work “was cleared through the ethics office.” Pai listed Securus as one of the “few clients” that he did a “limited amount of work for” between April 25, 2011, and May 6, 2012, as a partner with the law firm Jenner & Block. (He also listed AOL, HuffPost’s parent company.) Pai disclosed his client list to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in 2011 before he was confirmed as an FCC commissioner, and again in 2017 for his pending confirmation as chairman. Jenner & Block and Securus did not respond to HuffPost inquiries about the nature of Pai’s work.When inmates and family members stay in touch, that can lower recidivism and assist with rehabilitation. Until the 1990s, inmates could make calls at about the same rates as other people, according to The New York Times. But over the next few decades, companies like Securus made enormous profits by charging inmates and their families more money. Securus warned in 2015 that an Obama-era proposal capping inmate phone rates and fees could be a “business-ending event.” After the rule passed in a 3-2 vote (Pai dissented), providers, including Securus, sued to overturn it. About a week after Pai became chairman, the FCC said it would no longer defend the key part of that rule. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the Obama-era regulations on in-state calls from jails and prisons in June, advocates blamed the decision in part on the FCC’s retreat. (The D.C. Circuit majority said the provisions could not survive legal review.)  The lack of price caps has permitted companies like Securus to charge more than $11 for a 15-minute intrastate call from more than 60 correctional facilities in Michigan, according to Lee Petro, pro bono counsel for a group of prisoner advocates known collectively as the Wright Petitioners. (Petro declined to comment on the filing.) The Human Rights Defense Center claims Pai’s prior relationship is a conflict of interest and is asking Pai to recuse himself from all actions and decisions involving Securus and other inmate phone service providers. They are also asking Pai to disclose any financial relationship he may have with these companies. It’s not so uncommon for FCC officials, both Republican and Democrat, to have prior ties with companies they oversee. Pai, for example, previously worked as an attorney for Verizon, HuffPost’s other parent company. In his disclosure, Pai noted that during his time working with Securus and other companies, he did not appear before the FCC, Congress, executive agencies or in any court in connection with that work.But while Pai’s work with Verizon is well-documented, the newly publicized Securus tie raises questions, in part because inmate calling services are dominated by only a few providers.“Hopefully the [Senate] committee will ask for more information about what exactly he did for them before holding a confirmation vote,” Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told HuffPost. “For there to be conflict, there needs to be more than just the previous relationship. It’s really important to know what that relationship actually entailed.” Pai will need to be reconfirmed by the Senate before the end of the year to continue as FCC chairman."

Mark Keam (D), left, and Philadelphia City Council member Helen Gym (D), right.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598e1fb5140000421aed0562.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Twenty Korean-American elected officials sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Thursday urging him to avoid “dangerous language” on North Korea and to instead focus on a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.“While we agree that measures must be taken to reduce or end the tensions on the Korean peninsula,” they wrote, “we respectfully urge you to reconsider the way you and your Administration are reacting to this situation by avoiding dangerous language that could end up unnecessarily escalating the conflicts even more.”They also urge Trump to “fully staff your State Department with policy experts who understand the Korean peninsula.”The letter marks the first time Korean-American elected officials have joined together to speak publicly on a national issue, according to Virginia Del. Mark Keam, who spearheaded the effort with Philadelphia City Council member Helen Gym. Earlier this week, Trump threatened to rain “fire, fury … the likes of which this world has never seen before” down on North Korea. Keam and Gym, both Democrats, realized they needed to bring Korean-Americans’ perspectives to the president’s attention.“I think it’s incredibly important, especially as I’m watching generals, war hawks and pundits talk about Asia and its people as pretty much disposable collateral damage,” Gym told HuffPost.The letter notes that there are 1.8 million Korean-Americans in the United States. While they make up one of the fastest-growing immigrant communities in the country and the fifth-largest Asian community, there are no Korean-Americans serving in Congress.Someone needed to share Korean-Americans’ concerns about the prospect of a new war on the Korean peninsula, Keam told HuffPost. Considering the lack of Korean-American political representation at the national level, he and Gym thought, “Why not us?”“I kind of realized, maybe me being a state legislator, maybe I am in a position where I have a little bit of an obligation to speak, not on behalf of everybody, but at least raise a concern that I know they have,” Keam said.A war between the U.S. and North Korea ― particularly a nuclear war ― would likely cause millions of casualties in both North and South Korea. But that point is often dismissed by the president, his White House aides and pro-war members of Congress.Last week, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that “If there’s going to be a war to stop [Kim Jong Un], it will be over there. If thousands die, they’re going to die over there. They’re not going to die here.”Many Korean-Americans are first- or second-generation immigrants with close relatives on the Korean peninsula. They don’t see their family members as collateral damage. And they’re not only worried about potential deaths in South Korea, but in the North as well.Gym is a second-generation Korean-American. Her father was born in Pyongyang before the Korean War, which separated him from his mother and sisters. Gym’s grandmother has since died, but her aunts may still be living in the North.“One of the things that has been really difficult ... is the idea that somehow the North Korean people and the South Korean people are completely different entities, when, in fact, we’re one people divided by war,” Gym said.She added, “There’s no question that I’m one of millions of Korean families who’ve seen our families torn apart by all of this. What we’re looking for is not only an end to the brinksmanship and not only a peaceful resolution; we actually want to see a unified Korea.”Noting that she is not “naive” about the North Korean dictatorship, Gym said, “We just have to reject this narrative that somehow there’s this othering of all of North Korea, including its people, because I think it’s a danger to our humanity and civilization.”Keam also noted that war on the Korean peninsula would threaten approximately 150,000 American citizens who currently live in South Korea. This includes 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Yongsan district of Seoul. (The governor of Guam has made a similar point, noting the many American citizens who live on Pacific islands.)Citing memories of both the Korean War and the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Japan at the end of World War II, the elected officials write, “The cost of maintaining peace may be difficult, but it is always a better deal than paying the ultimate price of war. And when it comes to atomic or nuclear weapons, we must collectively say, ‘Never Again.’”It’s just the beginning of Korean-American leaders’ efforts to speak out on this issue, Gym and Keam said.“Even though we’re all Korean-Americans serving in state and local elected positions, we’ve never really come together before this week on behalf of Korean-Americans or Korean issues ― mainly because we have just diverse constituencies,” Keam said. “It would be shocking to me for a community of that caliber and that relevance to just sit there and say this doesn’t really affect us.”Read the letter 20 Korean-American elected officials sent to Trump below.August 10, 2017"

Amanda Zilliken told HuffPost she hopes the nurse-in at Elevation Church - Ballantyne on August 20, will help normalize breastfeeding in sacred spaces. The mothers are planning to spread themselves out in the main sanctuary and nurse their babies.Elevation Church is a multi-campus Southern Baptist megachurch led by the popular pastor Steven Furtick. The evangelical Protestant church is known for worship sessions that look like rock concerts, with stadium seating and lighting. It’s been criticized in the past for a “culture of celebrity” that surrounds Furtick, and for reportedly organizing “spontaneous” mass baptisms that turned out to be planned in advance.Zilliken, a 29-year-old mother from Lancaster, South Carolina, is responding to an incident she claimed happened at the Ballantyne branch of the megachurch on Sunday. The mom says she was breastfeeding with a cover on when a volunteer asked her to step out of the main sanctuary.The mom, who says she’s been attending Elevation on and off since 2015, said she’d never had an issue with nursing her baby in the sanctuary before. She typically feeds her daughter through the sermon, just to keep her quiet. “My daughter had not made a sound, there was no distraction,” she told HuffPost. She said that a volunteer at the church came up to her during the pastor’s sermon, shone a flashlight near her so she could see in the darkness of the church, and asked her to come along to the mothers’ area. The light supposedly attracted the attentions of people nearby. Zilliken’s baby had unattached and was beginning to fuss. “I wasn’t going to have a conversation with her on the spot,” Zilliken said. “In that kind of situation, I just did what I was told to do in terms of the moment, and then addressed it later.”Zilliken said she was led to a restroom to finish nursing. The volunteer reportedly came back later and told the mom could come back to the sanctuary when she was done. From the bathroom, the mom posted a photo of the incident to Facebook. “I just got kicked out of church for breastfeeding with a cover on and directed to the bathroom ..... Shame on you elevation,” she wrote in the post.Zilliken said she later tried to tell Elevation Church staff members and the volunteer about her concerns about being relocated. She claims the response she got from staff members wasn’t adequate. “I told [the volunteer] it was wrong to pull me out of the Word of God to take me to a restroom,” Zilliken said. “Her response was just, ’Honey, my job as a volunteer is to provide comfort for everyone, not just you.”″Cherish Rush, communications director for Elevation Church, told HuffPost in a statement that the church does not have a policy that nursing mothers can’t be in the sanctuary. “A volunteer had a conversation and felt both parties arrived at the same conclusion to exit mutually. We are sorry that this in any way offended anyone. We welcome everyone and anyone to attend elevation church,” Rush said. “We have several designated areas for nursing moms at Ballantyne specifically- one private to allow pumping and it’s close to the auditorium for convenience and the other in the actual baby area with a TV to allow mothers to still be part of the worship experience.”Zilliken told HuffPost she didn’t want to feed her baby in those separate areas. “If I didn’t want to be [in the main hall], I wouldn’t have been in the first place. I was in there because that’s what I wanted to do,” she said. “People don’t understand that it’s already hard to just go out in public and breastfeed because it’s such a controversial issue. You never know how people are going to respond. You get looks, it’s very demanding.”“A nursing mother should never be approached at all. No one should have been paying attention to me, they should have been paying attention to the sermon. If I was bottle feeding, it wouldn’t have mattered,” she added. According to North Carolina’s laws, mothers can breastfeed their children in public or private locations. After Zilliken posted about her experience on Facebook, she was contacted by Ariel Tauro, a breastfeeding activist and birth doula from New Jersey. The two are working together to organize the “Nurse-In” at Elevation on August 20. Zilliken said that the moms who have volunteered to participate are a mix of people from out of state, locals, and mothers who regularly attend Elevation. “I really just hope that it’s normalized. I hope people understand that we aren’t doing anything to get attention. It’s not for any other reason except for we know that this is what’s best for our children,” she said. “This is how we were designed to feed our children, not with artificial things. That’s how God intended our bodies to work and to be shunned out of a church for it is kind of awful.” "

The mothers are planning to spread themselves out in the main sanctuary and nurse their babies.Elevation Church is a multi-campus Southern Baptist megachurch led by the popular pastor Steven Furtick. The evangelical Protestant church is known for worship sessions that look like rock concerts, with stadium seating and lighting. It’s been criticized in the past for a “culture of celebrity” that surrounds Furtick, and for reportedly organizing “spontaneous” mass baptisms that turned out to be planned in advance.Zilliken, a 29-year-old mother from Lancaster, South Carolina, is responding to an incident she claimed happened at the Ballantyne branch of the megachurch on Sunday. The mom says she was breastfeeding with a cover on when a volunteer asked her to step out of the main sanctuary.The mom, who says she’s been attending Elevation on and off since 2015, said she’d never had an issue with nursing her baby in the sanctuary before. She typically feeds her daughter through the sermon, just to keep her quiet. “My daughter had not made a sound, there was no distraction,” she told HuffPost. She said that a volunteer at the church came up to her during the pastor’s sermon, shone a flashlight near her so she could see in the darkness of the church, and asked her to come along to the mothers’ area. The light supposedly attracted the attentions of people nearby. Zilliken’s baby had unattached and was beginning to fuss. “I wasn’t going to have a conversation with her on the spot,” Zilliken said. “In that kind of situation, I just did what I was told to do in terms of the moment, and then addressed it later.”Zilliken said she was led to a restroom to finish nursing. The volunteer reportedly came back later and told the mom could come back to the sanctuary when she was done. From the bathroom, the mom posted a photo of the incident to Facebook. “I just got kicked out of church for breastfeeding with a cover on and directed to the bathroom ..... Shame on you elevation,” she wrote in the post.Zilliken said she later tried to tell Elevation Church staff members and the volunteer about her concerns about being relocated. She claims the response she got from staff members wasn’t adequate. “I told [the volunteer] it was wrong to pull me out of the Word of God to take me to a restroom,” Zilliken said. “Her response was just, ’Honey, my job as a volunteer is to provide comfort for everyone, not just you.”″Cherish Rush, communications director for Elevation Church, told HuffPost in a statement that the church does not have a policy that nursing mothers can’t be in the sanctuary. “A volunteer had a conversation and felt both parties arrived at the same conclusion to exit mutually. We are sorry that this in any way offended anyone. We welcome everyone and anyone to attend elevation church,” Rush said. “We have several designated areas for nursing moms at Ballantyne specifically- one private to allow pumping and it’s close to the auditorium for convenience and the other in the actual baby area with a TV to allow mothers to still be part of the worship experience.”Zilliken told HuffPost she didn’t want to feed her baby in those separate areas. “If I didn’t want to be [in the main hall], I wouldn’t have been in the first place. I was in there because that’s what I wanted to do,” she said. “People don’t understand that it’s already hard to just go out in public and breastfeed because it’s such a controversial issue. You never know how people are going to respond. You get looks, it’s very demanding.”“A nursing mother should never be approached at all. No one should have been paying attention to me, they should have been paying attention to the sermon. If I was bottle feeding, it wouldn’t have mattered,” she added. According to North Carolina’s laws, mothers can breastfeed their children in public or private locations. After Zilliken posted about her experience on Facebook, she was contacted by Ariel Tauro, a breastfeeding activist and birth doula from New Jersey. The two are working together to organize the “Nurse-In” at Elevation on August 20. Zilliken said that the moms who have volunteered to participate are a mix of people from out of state, locals, and mothers who regularly attend Elevation. “I really just hope that it’s normalized. I hope people understand that we aren’t doing anything to get attention. It’s not for any other reason except for we know that this is what’s best for our children,” she said. “This is how we were designed to feed our children, not with artificial things. That’s how God intended our bodies to work and to be shunned out of a church for it is kind of awful.” "

He was 113.Kristal was born to a Jewish family in 1903 in Poland and became an orphan when his father was killed near the end of World War I, his mother having died in 1910.He moved in with his uncles and opened a candy shop with one of them in the city Lodz, in central Poland. But then Nazis invaded and occupied Poland in 1939, marking the beginning of World War II, and Kristal was moved to a ghetto in the city with his wife, Chaja Feige Frucht, and their two children.His children died in the ghetto and he and his wife were sent to the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz, where she was killed.Kristal survived the ordeal and moved permanently to Israel in 1950 with his second wife, Batsheva, with whom he had a further two children.Last year, Kristal made headlines after finally getting to celebrate the bar mitzvah he missed out on in 1916. With his mother dead and his father drafted into the Russian army, there was no one for the boy to celebrate with. Instead, Kristal was able to celebrate his bar mitzvah and 113th birthday with his two surviving children, nine grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren, The New York Times reported. “My father is a religious man, and it was his dream his whole life to have a bar mitzvah,” his daughter Shulamith Kristal Kuperstoch, told the Times. “It was a miracle after everything that he has been through in his life. What else can you call it?”In March of 2016, the Guinness World Records officially named him the world’s oldest man.“There have been smarter, stronger and better looking men than me who are no longer alive,” he told the Guinness World Records at the time. “All that is left for us to do is to keep on working as hard as we can and rebuild what is lost.”A spokeswoman for Guinness said it was with deep “regret and great sympathy” that they announced his death.“Guinness World Records is consulting with our expert Gerontologists to verify the potential successor and will announce the new record holder as soon as we are in a position to do so,” spokeswoman Sofia Rocher said in a statement.Kristal was one month away from celebrating his 114th birthday. He is survived by his two younger children and his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. "

45,ENTERTAINMENT,77 Years Old And Raising All Hell,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-cromwell-interview_us_597fa420e4b0d6e28a0fcc58,Actor James Cromwell has been repeatedly arrested and recently jailed -- all for his beliefs. Don't you dare ask him if he's going to slow down.,2017-08-11,Actor James Cromwell poses for a portrait on July 31.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597fa482210000a31afc982a.jpeg?cache=oIQc8sEDgg&ops=crop_26_791_2998_3745%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"James Cromwell said goodbye to his friends, raised a fist into the air and then entered through a door into darkness. Standing there in the garage-like space that greets the newest inmates of Orange County jail, Cromwell couldn’t see any cameras, nor much of anything at all. He suspected the powers that be wanted it that way ― on the off chance a new inmate needed a little roughing up. After making his way through another set of doors, the darkness washed away, only to be replaced by the sterile world he’d call home for the next three days. “There is no humanity [in there],” he told me last week. “The desk is not human, the chairs are not human, the color of the floor, the ceiling ― nothing. There’s nothing to hold onto.”The guards first made Cromwell strip and lean over to spread his cheeks. They asked him if he was anxious about being raped, he said, and then if he was anxious to rape someone himself. Finally, the guards led him to his gray, seven-by-nine-foot cell, complete with two sets of underwear and the white jumpsuit doled out to uncategorized inmates. The foam that had once made up his mattress was long gone, leaving a bed made of metal and plywood, which felt hard on the 77-year-old’s back. On one of the walls, Cromwell spotted a series of inscribed words: “God is love. Love is pain. Get me out of here.” Cromwell could have avoided the Orange County jail had he just paid the $375 fine the state wanted. He had been arrested a few years back for his role in a sit-in on the site of a prospective natural gas-fired power plant near his home in Warwick, New York ― part of a larger movement to fight its completion. But he felt he had done nothing wrong, and viewed the idea of paying the fine akin to admitting his own guilt.So, from July 14 to July 17, 2017, there he lay. Ever since the election of Donald Trump last November, numerous Hollywood celebrities have positioned themselves as part of “the resistance,” denouncing the president and everything he represents on platforms ranging from Twitter to the Academy Awards. But Cromwell is something different: a rabble-rousing hell-raiser of a man.The actor has been removed from corporate events and escorted out of Democratic Party fundraisers. He has been arrested in Virginia, Wisconsin, New York and California. At 77 years old, it can’t be easy. These days, the actor ― who has played characters including George H.W. Bush and Prince Philip in major motion pictures ― walks with a clear hitch in his step, one made all the more apparent by his towering frame.But ask him if he’s ever considered slowing down, stopping all this political nonsense and enjoying something like retirement, and Cromwell replies with what could be best described as a scoff. That makes sense: Even at 77, Cromwell exudes energy.When I asked how he was upon meeting him in Manhattan, he launched into the details of whether the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation would or would not soon grant a particular permit related to the power plant. As he was leaving, he hurried back over to me and asked that I make sure to include information about one of his causes, which, he wants you to know, can be found at protectorangecounty.org.In between, he told me with pride about a 60-mile bike ride he took the day before. And all the while, he spoke in a voice that boomed with passion while discussing the world and its ills.Whatever you think about the individual merits of his various causes, it’s hard to argue with one thing: James Cromwell genuinely seems to give a fuck.It didn’t always seem like things would go this way for Cromwell. Born in 1940 in Los Angeles, he was a child of Hollywood stardom. His mother, Kay Johnson, racked up more than 20 acting credits to her name over the course of her career; his father, John Cromwell, more than 40 directorial credits, including 1934′s “Of Human Bondage.”The two divorced when Cromwell was just a boy, landing the then-6-year-old with his mother on the East Coast, where he later attended prep school. His father wrote him letters, which Cromwell refused to read, he said, “as a way of punishment.” Consequently, Cromwell did not understand until his late teens just how dramatically his father’s career had been affected after being blacklisted by Hollywood during the Joseph McCarthy era.After high school, Cromwell attended Middlebury College and Carnegie Mellon University. Eventually, the same interest in theater that consumed his parents overwhelmed him, too, leading Cromwell in 1964 on a trip through the deep South with the Free Southern Theater, a community theater group closely associated with the civil rights movement.Before the trip, the young man from the Northeast possessed only a superficial knowledge of what was happening in the southern United States in the mid-1960s. When he spotted a “Colors Only” sign the first night, he thought it was a relic from the Civil War. When he and John O’Neal, one of the founders of the Free Southern Theater, were told they weren’t welcome at a restaurant because O’Neal was black, Cromwell could barely control his indignation, while O’Neal calmly told the man he was violating their civil rights. As they played throughout states including Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, Cromwell learned about firebombed churches. A young black girl told him how she had been beaten, kicked and spat upon while trying to integrate a local lunch counter. “I not only couldn’t believe that I was there, [I couldn’t believe] that my people ― this,” he said as he pointed to his skin, “had done this to her. How could these black men possibly contain their fury?”“I began to understand what had happened, how slavery had been transformed into Jim Crow, and what Jim Crow meant ― the injustice of it,” he continued. “From then on, that becomes the prism through which [I saw].”When Cromwell returned to the Northeast, he was changed. He directed a piece of protest art in Connecticut while the Black Panthers’ Bobby Seale was on trial in Connecticut and housed members of the Black Panthers at his father’s apartment without his knowledge. In 1971, he was arrested on May Day in Washington, D.C., while protesting against the Vietnam War.He felt an anger boiling inside him as authorities shot unarmed college students at Kent State University, and the FBI’s counterintelligence program went after people deemed subversive. He eventually started to doubt the importance of acting. “I thought, I’m in the wrong profession, nothing I can do is going to address [all this].” And so, he left to travel the world ― and, by motorcycle, the U.S., too. During that time, he came upon stockyards in Texas that convinced him to become a vegetarian. In the mid-1970s, Cromwell eventually found his way back to Los Angeles. In need of a job, he asked the only person he knew in the city, a Middlebury alum named Michael Sevareid, for help. Sevareid introduced him to a casting director, who got him an audition on a show he’d never seen called “All in the Family.” He was the last person to read, he says, but he got the part of Stretch Cunningham anyway. It was a brief role for a few episodes. But for Cromwell, by then in his mid-30s, it was a big break; a real part on a hit CBS show. Over the next two decades, he would would appear in dozens of TV shows and movies. He would get parts in “M*A*S*H” and “Three’s Company” and “Little House on the Prairie,” in “Knight Rider” and “The Twilight Zone” and “Star Trek.”“All in the Family” gave him a way to make a living. But in retrospect, he can see it pulled something inside him out, as well. “It was sort of a period of incredible mindlessness,” he now says of that time. “I didn’t know that politics existed.”He started eating meat again, and as he entered his 40s, he found himself getting angry not at injustice, but at the the sight of a 20-year-old man in new jeans with a Rolex on his wrist. He blamed his disconnected feelings on his “love-hate relationship” with Hollywood, which he associated with his father. “I probably was regressed,” he admits now.Not until the mid-1990s did he come to, when he landed a role as a farmer named Arthur H. Hoggett in a film about a pig. Cromwell thought the film, “Babe,” sounded “silly” at first, but eventually came to find the story touching. Others did too, and the film netted more than $250 million at the box office, earning Cromwell a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 68th annual Academy Awards ― one of seven nods for the film.“Babe” would give Cromwell’s career a jolt, helping him to land blockbuster gigs in films including “The People vs. Larry Flynt,” “L.A. Confidential” and “Deep Impact.” But the film also gave Cromwell himself a much-needed jolt, too. He recommitted to vegetarianism and started working with the animal rights group PETA in what would become a decades-long partnership. He narrated videos for the group and began to attend its protests. In 2001, he was charged with trespassing at a Wendy’s in Tysons Corner, Virginia, during a demonstration. He appeared at non-PETA protests as well, marching with celebrities like Mike Farrell and Martin Sheen in opposition to the Iraq War in 2003.It wasn’t until the current decade, when Cromwell pushed past 70, however, that things really started to get rowdy. Since then, he has been arrested and kicked out of so many events, so many times, it’s getting hard to count. He’s been arrested at the University of Wisconsin for breaking into a Board of Regents meeting to protest “cruel and wasteful experiments” on cats. He’s been arrested in Watkins Glen, New York, for disorderly conduct while protesting a facility that would store methane, propane and butane below a nearby lake that provides local drinking water. He has protested against Air France’s treatment of monkeys at LAX and been booted out of fundraisers attended by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.Today, Cromwell views his age as an advantage, allowing him to see issues more clearly. “The difference is now I know a great deal more than I did,” he said. He’s never confused anymore. He knows how power works, and how Washington works, and how the police work. While attending protests at places like Standing Rock, he has come to realize how people of color are disproportionately affected by corporate attacks on the environment.But he’s also come to realize that many of the protests that once brought attention to causes seem to be less and less effective. When Cromwell and a group of protesters were arrested after blocking the entrance to a natural gas-fired power plant near his home on Dec. 18, 2015, it barely caused a blip on the media’s radar, and he took note.“Much to my chagrin, nothing changed. We were arrested, we weren’t tried for two years, the media hardly responded,” he said. “I became aware that all the nice feelings and all the pickets and all the petitions and all the trips to Albany, the protests ... nothing penetrates.”So, he added, “I said to everybody, we gotta do something bigger.”Finally, they did, when Cromwell and two friends and fellow protestors, Pramilla Malick and Madeline Shaw, refused to pay a $375 fine after the trial over their sit-in, which meant that an Oscar-nominated actor would be sentenced to a week in Orange County jail.“Suddenly, we’re news,” he said. While no one was interested in Cromwell getting arrested yet again, a jail sentence was different, and countless media outlets covered it. Cromwell trended nationally, bringing attention to what had previously been considered a small local issue northwest of the island of Manhattan.This works, he thought to himself. Now, he is trying to convince other activists that some political protests must have consequences to break through in 2017. “In the civil rights movement, in the anti-Vietnam [movement], in the black liberation movement, everyone knew there [were] consequences,” he said. “As long as people understand that and say, ‘Yes, but what is the alternative?’ there will be no revolution.”Yes, by the way, Cromwell understands this is all easier for him to say. He knows he’s famous and wealthy and holds a deep respect for the many grassroots organizers doing more than he ever could every day. And he knows what he doesn’t know, too. He spoke to me at length about how he could never understand what it’s like to drive while black, or to walk by a cop as a person of color in the U.S. In jail, that was more than clear. While Cromwell was kept away from the general population, his activist friends Malick and Shaw had a harder time than him. Cromwell guesses this was because Gov. Cuomo wanted to avoid a headline along the lines of “CROMWELL ATTACKED IN PRISON.”“Because of my celebrity, they could not reduce me to a cypher, a number,” he said. “They always had to say, ‘Yeah, he’s a number, but he’s also the guy in ‘L.A. Confidential.’”Maybe that’s why, even at 77, James Cromwell is completely unwilling to settle down. He knows his celebrity is a weapon, and he’s not about to stop wielding it anytime soon. In fact, just a few days after he got out of jail, Cromwell jumped on a plane and headed to Seaworld in San Diego. There were some killer whales that needed saving, and he was going to go do whatever the hell he could to help get them out. "

Finally, the guards led him to his gray, seven-by-nine-foot cell, complete with two sets of underwear and the white jumpsuit doled out to uncategorized inmates. The foam that had once made up his mattress was long gone, leaving a bed made of metal and plywood, which felt hard on the 77-year-old’s back. On one of the walls, Cromwell spotted a series of inscribed words: “God is love. Love is pain. Get me out of here.” Cromwell could have avoided the Orange County jail had he just paid the $375 fine the state wanted. He had been arrested a few years back for his role in a sit-in on the site of a prospective natural gas-fired power plant near his home in Warwick, New York ― part of a larger movement to fight its completion. But he felt he had done nothing wrong, and viewed the idea of paying the fine akin to admitting his own guilt.So, from July 14 to July 17, 2017, there he lay. Ever since the election of Donald Trump last November, numerous Hollywood celebrities have positioned themselves as part of “the resistance,” denouncing the president and everything he represents on platforms ranging from Twitter to the Academy Awards. But Cromwell is something different: a rabble-rousing hell-raiser of a man.The actor has been removed from corporate events and escorted out of Democratic Party fundraisers. He has been arrested in Virginia, Wisconsin, New York and California. At 77 years old, it can’t be easy. These days, the actor ― who has played characters including George H.W. Bush and Prince Philip in major motion pictures ― walks with a clear hitch in his step, one made all the more apparent by his towering frame.But ask him if he’s ever considered slowing down, stopping all this political nonsense and enjoying something like retirement, and Cromwell replies with what could be best described as a scoff. That makes sense: Even at 77, Cromwell exudes energy.When I asked how he was upon meeting him in Manhattan, he launched into the details of whether the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation would or would not soon grant a particular permit related to the power plant. As he was leaving, he hurried back over to me and asked that I make sure to include information about one of his causes, which, he wants you to know, can be found at protectorangecounty.org.In between, he told me with pride about a 60-mile bike ride he took the day before. And all the while, he spoke in a voice that boomed with passion while discussing the world and its ills.Whatever you think about the individual merits of his various causes, it’s hard to argue with one thing: James Cromwell genuinely seems to give a fuck.It didn’t always seem like things would go this way for Cromwell. Born in 1940 in Los Angeles, he was a child of Hollywood stardom. His mother, Kay Johnson, racked up more than 20 acting credits to her name over the course of her career; his father, John Cromwell, more than 40 directorial credits, including 1934′s “Of Human Bondage.”The two divorced when Cromwell was just a boy, landing the then-6-year-old with his mother on the East Coast, where he later attended prep school. His father wrote him letters, which Cromwell refused to read, he said, “as a way of punishment.” Consequently, Cromwell did not understand until his late teens just how dramatically his father’s career had been affected after being blacklisted by Hollywood during the Joseph McCarthy era.After high school, Cromwell attended Middlebury College and Carnegie Mellon University. Eventually, the same interest in theater that consumed his parents overwhelmed him, too, leading Cromwell in 1964 on a trip through the deep South with the Free Southern Theater, a community theater group closely associated with the civil rights movement.Before the trip, the young man from the Northeast possessed only a superficial knowledge of what was happening in the southern United States in the mid-1960s. When he spotted a “Colors Only” sign the first night, he thought it was a relic from the Civil War. When he and John O’Neal, one of the founders of the Free Southern Theater, were told they weren’t welcome at a restaurant because O’Neal was black, Cromwell could barely control his indignation, while O’Neal calmly told the man he was violating their civil rights. As they played throughout states including Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, Cromwell learned about firebombed churches. A young black girl told him how she had been beaten, kicked and spat upon while trying to integrate a local lunch counter. “I not only couldn’t believe that I was there, [I couldn’t believe] that my people ― this,” he said as he pointed to his skin, “had done this to her. How could these black men possibly contain their fury?”“I began to understand what had happened, how slavery had been transformed into Jim Crow, and what Jim Crow meant ― the injustice of it,” he continued. “From then on, that becomes the prism through which [I saw].”When Cromwell returned to the Northeast, he was changed. He directed a piece of protest art in Connecticut while the Black Panthers’ Bobby Seale was on trial in Connecticut and housed members of the Black Panthers at his father’s apartment without his knowledge. In 1971, he was arrested on May Day in Washington, D.C., while protesting against the Vietnam War.He felt an anger boiling inside him as authorities shot unarmed college students at Kent State University, and the FBI’s counterintelligence program went after people deemed subversive. He eventually started to doubt the importance of acting. “I thought, I’m in the wrong profession, nothing I can do is going to address [all this].” And so, he left to travel the world ― and, by motorcycle, the U.S., too. During that time, he came upon stockyards in Texas that convinced him to become a vegetarian. In the mid-1970s, Cromwell eventually found his way back to Los Angeles. In need of a job, he asked the only person he knew in the city, a Middlebury alum named Michael Sevareid, for help. Sevareid introduced him to a casting director, who got him an audition on a show he’d never seen called “All in the Family.” He was the last person to read, he says, but he got the part of Stretch Cunningham anyway. It was a brief role for a few episodes. But for Cromwell, by then in his mid-30s, it was a big break; a real part on a hit CBS show. Over the next two decades, he would would appear in dozens of TV shows and movies. He would get parts in “M*A*S*H” and “Three’s Company” and “Little House on the Prairie,” in “Knight Rider” and “The Twilight Zone” and “Star Trek.”“All in the Family” gave him a way to make a living. But in retrospect, he can see it pulled something inside him out, as well. “It was sort of a period of incredible mindlessness,” he now says of that time. “I didn’t know that politics existed.”He started eating meat again, and as he entered his 40s, he found himself getting angry not at injustice, but at the the sight of a 20-year-old man in new jeans with a Rolex on his wrist. He blamed his disconnected feelings on his “love-hate relationship” with Hollywood, which he associated with his father. “I probably was regressed,” he admits now.Not until the mid-1990s did he come to, when he landed a role as a farmer named Arthur H. Hoggett in a film about a pig. Cromwell thought the film, “Babe,” sounded “silly” at first, but eventually came to find the story touching. Others did too, and the film netted more than $250 million at the box office, earning Cromwell a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 68th annual Academy Awards ― one of seven nods for the film.“Babe” would give Cromwell’s career a jolt, helping him to land blockbuster gigs in films including “The People vs. Larry Flynt,” “L.A. Confidential” and “Deep Impact.” But the film also gave Cromwell himself a much-needed jolt, too. He recommitted to vegetarianism and started working with the animal rights group PETA in what would become a decades-long partnership. He narrated videos for the group and began to attend its protests. In 2001, he was charged with trespassing at a Wendy’s in Tysons Corner, Virginia, during a demonstration. He appeared at non-PETA protests as well, marching with celebrities like Mike Farrell and Martin Sheen in opposition to the Iraq War in 2003.It wasn’t until the current decade, when Cromwell pushed past 70, however, that things really started to get rowdy. Since then, he has been arrested and kicked out of so many events, so many times, it’s getting hard to count. He’s been arrested at the University of Wisconsin for breaking into a Board of Regents meeting to protest “cruel and wasteful experiments” on cats. He’s been arrested in Watkins Glen, New York, for disorderly conduct while protesting a facility that would store methane, propane and butane below a nearby lake that provides local drinking water. He has protested against Air France’s treatment of monkeys at LAX and been booted out of fundraisers attended by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.Today, Cromwell views his age as an advantage, allowing him to see issues more clearly. “The difference is now I know a great deal more than I did,” he said. He’s never confused anymore. He knows how power works, and how Washington works, and how the police work. While attending protests at places like Standing Rock, he has come to realize how people of color are disproportionately affected by corporate attacks on the environment.But he’s also come to realize that many of the protests that once brought attention to causes seem to be less and less effective. When Cromwell and a group of protesters were arrested after blocking the entrance to a natural gas-fired power plant near his home on Dec. 18, 2015, it barely caused a blip on the media’s radar, and he took note.“Much to my chagrin, nothing changed. We were arrested, we weren’t tried for two years, the media hardly responded,” he said. “I became aware that all the nice feelings and all the pickets and all the petitions and all the trips to Albany, the protests ... nothing penetrates.”So, he added, “I said to everybody, we gotta do something bigger.”Finally, they did, when Cromwell and two friends and fellow protestors, Pramilla Malick and Madeline Shaw, refused to pay a $375 fine after the trial over their sit-in, which meant that an Oscar-nominated actor would be sentenced to a week in Orange County jail.“Suddenly, we’re news,” he said. While no one was interested in Cromwell getting arrested yet again, a jail sentence was different, and countless media outlets covered it. Cromwell trended nationally, bringing attention to what had previously been considered a small local issue northwest of the island of Manhattan.This works, he thought to himself. Now, he is trying to convince other activists that some political protests must have consequences to break through in 2017. “In the civil rights movement, in the anti-Vietnam [movement], in the black liberation movement, everyone knew there [were] consequences,” he said. “As long as people understand that and say, ‘Yes, but what is the alternative?’ there will be no revolution.”Yes, by the way, Cromwell understands this is all easier for him to say. He knows he’s famous and wealthy and holds a deep respect for the many grassroots organizers doing more than he ever could every day. And he knows what he doesn’t know, too. He spoke to me at length about how he could never understand what it’s like to drive while black, or to walk by a cop as a person of color in the U.S. In jail, that was more than clear. While Cromwell was kept away from the general population, his activist friends Malick and Shaw had a harder time than him. Cromwell guesses this was because Gov. Cuomo wanted to avoid a headline along the lines of “CROMWELL ATTACKED IN PRISON.”“Because of my celebrity, they could not reduce me to a cypher, a number,” he said. “They always had to say, ‘Yeah, he’s a number, but he’s also the guy in ‘L.A. Confidential.’”Maybe that’s why, even at 77, James Cromwell is completely unwilling to settle down. He knows his celebrity is a weapon, and he’s not about to stop wielding it anytime soon. In fact, just a few days after he got out of jail, Cromwell jumped on a plane and headed to Seaworld in San Diego. There were some killer whales that needed saving, and he was going to go do whatever the hell he could to help get them out. "

Standing there in the garage-like space that greets the newest inmates of Orange County jail, Cromwell couldn’t see any cameras, nor much of anything at all. He suspected the powers that be wanted it that way ― on the off chance a new inmate needed a little roughing up. After making his way through another set of doors, the darkness washed away, only to be replaced by the sterile world he’d call home for the next three days. “There is no humanity [in there],” he told me last week. “The desk is not human, the chairs are not human, the color of the floor, the ceiling ― nothing. There’s nothing to hold onto.”The guards first made Cromwell strip and lean over to spread his cheeks.

In 2016, a New York judge denied Kesha’s motion requesting to be released from her recording contract with Sony, though the judge also ruled she could work with another Sony producer. The loss for Kesha remains in appeals.Gottwald is no longer part of Kemosabe Records, the studio behind “Rainbow” and Kesha’s previous albums, though it’s unclear whether he will profit from its release. Despite a lack of legal resolution at the album’s release, “Rainbow” marks a personal win for Kesha, who had largely been unable to put out music while her lawsuit was ongoing.The singer’s third full-length album features empowering kiss-offs in the vein of its first single, the triumphant “Praying,” along with opening track “Bastards” ― a paean against letting the bastards get you down — and rallying cries for weirdos like “Let ’Em Talk” and “Hymn.” She also expands her sound to encompass twangy, country-infused pop on “Hunt You Down” and “Old Flames,” featuring none other than Dolly Parton.There are shades of the pop singer who gave fans 2010′s “Animal” and its 2012 follow-up “Warrior,” the raucous partier who loves Gold Trans Ams and brushing her teeth with whiskey. The same glitter-encrusted Kesha we knew and loved is present throughout “Rainbow,” but this time around, she’s self-assured, mature and rife with lessons to impart without coming off as a rote platitude dispenser.“I was in a dark place,” Kesha wrote on Refinery 29 of her album’s conception, detailing how the title track was written during a stay in rehab for an eating disorder. The staff would only allow an hour’s worth of piano time each day.“The whole album idea and tour and everything, came from me crying and singing and playing and dreaming until my hour was up and they took the keyboard away again,” she wrote.The “Rainbow,” Kesha explains, is what emerges after a storm. “Recently, I feel like I’ve gone through some things that have felt like a storm in my life,” she wrote. “This was my way of telling myself that I was going to make it through.”Listen to “Rainbow” on Spotify below."

Is it to the park?"" The man drawn next to her is holding a scroll that says ""marriage certificate.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598ca468140000401aed025b.jpeg?cache=dthp22ewGj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"RAW’A (not her real name) was found dead after hanging herself in February last year in her bathroom in a village in northwestern rural Idlib, Syria.Raw’a, who was 16 years old when her body was discovered, had been married eight months prior. “She was kind, lovely and shy. Her parents married her to a radical Muslim young man from her village, Haas. They learned later that he had joined the so-called Islamic State. They did not try to interfere in her marriage. They thought that everything was fine,” Raw’a’s aunt told us. According her aunt, one day Raw’a was fed up with her husband’s behavior: In addition to being very strict, he used to hit her and not allow her to leave the house. She finally ran back to her parents’ house and asked them to help her get divorced. They rejected the idea because of the severe stigma attached to divorced women in Syrian society, especially in rural areas.The parents blamed Raw’a for her situation, refused to help her with the divorce and returned her to her husband’s house. “She felt very lonely, and felt that no one cared for her or for her suffering, so she committed suicide,” her aunt said.Child marriages are widespread in rural Idlib and in many other rural areas. Before 2011, the source of legislation for marriage was Syrian family law, which cites Sharia law. Syrian family law sets the minimum legal age of marriage at 18 years for men, and 17 years for women. However, a religious judge has the right to authorize marriages for men as young as 15, and for girl as young as 13, as long as the underage party deliberately seeks marriage, and she or he appears mature.However, currently in opposition-controlled areas, especially those controlled by Islamic factions, Syrian law is not followed, and a court’s authorization is not required. Sharia committees are in charge of officiating marriages, and these committees do not set a minimum age of 17 for girls.The motivations driving marriages have changed due to the war in Syria, and girls have been marrying at younger ages. “Parents see child marriage as a way to protect their daughters – and their family’s honor – from possible sexual assault and other kinds of hardship,” according to a report by Save the Children. What’s more, the number of young men travelling to Idlib to join the fighting is a major factor behind the rise in the number of marriages.Marwa, 13, from Kafr Nabl in northwestern rural Idlib, is not a middle-school student, but a married woman living with a husband who is 10 years older. Marwa looks like a little girl. She is shy. Her answers were very limited, and she was in a hurry to get back to playing with her husband’s sisters in the kitchen.Marwa’s story began when a fighter in an Islamic faction asked for her hand for marriage. Due to poverty and lack of security, her father agreed. The marriage was officiated with a Sharia certificate, or what is known in Syria as an “out of sight contract,” meaning that it is not registered at any official registry. Marwa’s marriage was authorized and registered in the Sharia court of the Jaish al-Fatah Islamic faction that controls the area.According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), “child marriage is defined as a formal marriage or informal union before age 18, and is a reality for both boys and girls, although girls are disproportionately the most affected.”Additionally, “Evidence shows that girls who marry early often abandon formal education and become pregnant. Maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth are an important component of mortality for girls aged 15-19 worldwide.” Due to marriage, pregnancy and the many responsibilities that girls at a young age find hard to cope with, they suffer from depression, and, in some cases, lose the will to live.There are many reasons behind child marriages in Syria. The report’s authors were able to document 59 cases of female child marriages (under 17 years old) among the 70,000 people who inhabit the villages of Kafr Nabl, Jbala and Mu’arrat Hirma in rural Idlib. They also documented six cases of suicide by underage married girls.It is often difficult to document cases of suicide among young women. Lack of forensic reports due to the complete absence of state institutions such as medical centers and police departments further complicate efforts to connect suicides to underage marriage. However, it is interesting to note that the girls’ families were the ones to disclose the suicides, as such cases are usually covered up in Syria. Even when a case is documented and registered, families often attempt to suppress the cause of death due to the stigma of taking one’s own life in Syrian society, and the lack of proper funeral facilities for those who have done so.Sixteen-year-old Sabah (not her real name) from Kafr Nabl in rural Idlib was another victim of child marriage. Like so many in her position, she endured a very difficult marriage – her husband did not allow her to leave the house by herself, or contact her family. “She loved school, but we forced her to quit. She was young and beautiful, and we worried about her because of the complete lack of security in the streets. We convinced her to get married, when a rich man proposed,” her mother said. “Her father borrowed some money from her husband, and when he could not pay it back, they got in a fight, and the relationship between the two families deteriorated.” According to Sabah’s mother, she overdosed on painkillers because she could not cope with the issues that had driven a wedge between her husband and her family.Child marriage negatively affects girls because they find themselves facing responsibilities that they cannot handle. “Child marriage was present in Syria before the war, but it has remarkably increased over the last few years. Poverty, unemployment, lack of education, the harsh living circumstances, in addition to families’ fear for their girls’ safety outside of the house, all made marriage the easiest option,” said Faten Sweid, a psychological counselor.In addition to the increase in the number of divorce cases due to young girls struggling to cope with their new lives, many underage married girls suffer from psychological issues. According to Sweid, “25 young girls have committed suicide in rural Idlib, five of whom were in Kafr Nabl.”Regarding the reasons behind the rising number of suicides in Syria, Sweid cited “mental disorders, such as depression or nervous breakdowns in moments of crisis, the inability to deal with life’s pressures, conflicts, disasters, violence, isolation, discrimination, family history of suicides.”Although it is not easy to attempt to halt the suicide of young married girls, or even prove that child marriage is a contributing factor, the number of young girls who have committed suicide shortly after being married signals that it is a path fraught with peril. According to Sweid, a precautionary solution would be to eliminate child marriage by educating families on its dangers.For young girls, one of the most dangerous and traumatizing aspects of these marriages is being forced into an intimate relationship against their will. Rima, 17, married a young man who had significant facial and bodily disfigurements due to an accident he suffered as a small child; a situation Rima could not live with. She was forced into marriage due to her family’s desperate financial situation – her father had passed away, and her mother, who worked in a local dried-fig factory in her village in rural Idlib, was the family’s only provider. According to her family, Rima, who had left her husband and returned home, was found dead after overdosing on painkillers.For security reasons, all names used in this report have been changed.The Syrian Independent Media Group is comprised of six independent Arab media organizations working together to highlight untold stories from the war-torn country: AlJumhuria; Enab Baladi; Rozana Radio; Syria Deeply; Syrian Female Journalists Network; and Syria Untold.

Donald Trump’s alarming “fire and fury” statement on North Korea does not represent America’s tradition as a peace seeking nation. His latest rhetoric, which seems to threaten a nuclear attack, directly contradicts the words of past leaders such as President Dwight Eisenhower.Eisenhower, who made nuclear diplomacy a top priority, denounced the idea of nuclear war openly: “With such weapons, war has become, not just tragic, but preposterous.” And he was only one of many presidents to promote diplomacy over an arms race. Since the Cold War era of nuclear weapons began, the United States has continuously sought negotiations to control the threat.With good reason: as Ronald Reagan once warned, ""I can't believe that this world can go on...with this kind of weapon on both sides, poised at each other, without someday some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us."" Diplomacy is a matter of survival in the nuclear age. Today our best hope for stopping North Korea's nuclear weapons program lies with this tradition of diplomacy that averted nuclear disaster during the Cold War. It lies in talks with the North Korean regime in concert with China, South Korea, Japan and other allies. The thought of war today on the Korean peninsula is unthinkable: ""preposterous,"" as Eisenhower might say. But tragically, North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launches have escalated an already dangerous situation. With each Tweet or instance of careless bluster on the part of President Trump, we edge closer to the unthinkable. Rather than continue down this path, let's try some serious diplomacy.Getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program is not going to happen overnight, but through diplomacy, there is at least a chance at beginning disarmament and preventing an unnecessary war. As Derek Johnson, the director of Global Zero says, “The potential consequences of a military confrontation between the United States and North Korea can’t be overstated. Every diplomatic effort must be made to avoid any scenario that risks the use of nuclear weapons. The time for crisis talks is now.” The international community already has come together to put tough sanctions in place on North Korea for its nuclear threats. Ambassador Nikki Haley says, “This resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime. The price the North Korean leadership will pay for its continued nuclear and missile development will be the loss of one-third of its exports and hard currency.”But in addition to the recently approved UN sanctions we need a diplomatic breakthrough with negotiations and confidence building on both sides. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which bans all nuclear test explosions, can give us this chance for peace.We want North Korea to refrain from its menacing nuclear tests, which are conducted at the tragic expense of their starving citizens. Ambassador Haley says “the North Korean regime is literally starving its people and enslaving them in mines and factories in order to fund these illegal nuclear programs.” According to the UN World Food Program seventy percent of North Korea’s population lives in hunger. The money spent on their nukes should be going towards food for their hungry, malnourished children, rather than towards weapons that will rob them of their futures. This situation in North Korea is a uniquely horrific example of how nuclear spending robs from the poor. By ratifying the CTBT, North Korea could begin to change course, taking a step towards disarmament and away from needless human suffering.We also call upon the United States to ratify the CTBT, as our country has no need to test nukes. This would be a safe and rational move, allowing us to maintain our current arsenal while sending a signal to the world that we are committed to future disarmament.It would allow the U.S. to negotiate from a position of strength and security rather than from a position of hypocrisy. The U.S., China and North Korea all ratifying the CTBT simultaneously would be an even greater confidence-building measure towards negotiations, sending a signal of cooperation to frightened allies and laying the groundwork for future agreements.Nuclear tests only heighten international tensions and jumpstart expensive arms races. Despite some bluster from leaders, neither the U.S. or China wants to get involved in a nightmare of nuclear tests. Neither nation wants to go backward to the Cold War days of testing.The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is the safest and most rational diplomatic entry point towards disarming North Korea. Already ratified by hundreds of countries, including Russia, it can serve as powerful opening step toward more agreements that would end missile tests and lead to disarmament.We call on our country to pursue the diplomatic option of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty before it is too late, and Reagan’s warning becomes reality."

Human Rights Watch’s Jonathan Pedneault discusses the need to protect displaced people with disabilities.ONE LEGACY OF decades of conflict in South Sudan is the high number of people with physical disabilities – the result both of war injuries and sicknesses left untreated in the absence of a functioning health sector.South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long struggle, but a brutal civil war broke out two years later. Today, the country is the source of the largest refugee crisis in Africa and the fastest-growing refugee population in the world. Some 3.5 million South Sudanese have been displaced, including around 2 million internally displaced people (IDPs).Inside South Sudan, an estimated 250,000 people with disabilities are sheltering in U.N. bases designated “Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites” throughout the country. Some 1 million others may be living uncounted in more remote areas where attempts to report and track disabilities is all but futile. An unknown number have fled into neighboring countries such as Uganda.Human Rights Watch interviewed dozens of elderly people and people with disabilities in South Sudan earlier this year. They found that, a year after humanitarian agencies signed a charter to provide better access to aid for people with disabilities, the elderly and disabled face greater risks of hunger and atrocities in South Sudan. Refugees Deeply spoke to Jonathan Pedneault, Human Rights Watch’s South Sudan researcher and the author of the report, about its findings.Refugees Deeply: What are the biggest challenges facing people with disabilities who have been displaced inside South Sudan?Jonathan Pedneault: At the time of any attack, people with disabilities are more likely to be targeted because they are left behind or they’re less capable of moving quickly to escape the fighting or find shelter. There have been several cases where people with disabilities were left behind during attacks on displacement sites and were killed as a result. They were not killed because of their disability, but rather because they were not able to escape quickly enough and they are part of a body of civilians that are under attack, often because of their ethnicity.Displaced people with disabilities face a whole range of other challenges, from access to water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructures to food distribution. They have to get there, and then they have to come back with their rations. That can prove to be a difficult exercise for some people. They have to rely on neighbors and relatives to help them carry the food, soap or cooking oil, often for a small fee.The infrastructure that humanitarians provide at displacement sites [is] not always adapted to their needs: latrines without hand bars or showers that are too high or with floors made out of tarpaulin, which is extremely slippery.Refugees Deeply: How does the situation vary between PoC sites and other places where displaced people are sheltering in the country?Pedneault: As the PoC sites are located inside of U.N. bases, they’re much more accessible to U.N. agencies and other humanitarian actors and safer, generally speaking. In other locations the access to services is much lower. In some cases you’ll find very tiny displacement locations way out there in the bush or in the swamps that are difficult to access for anyone. That’s why those people are there in the first place – because it’s difficult for armed attackers to access – but that makes it also difficult for humanitarian agencies and others to reach them. Or they’re located in places where one of the parties is obstructing access to aid.I’ve met with a few elderly people and people with disabilities in remote parts of Unity State that were completely left to their own devices with no family members present or willing to help them. They are much more at risk of being food insecure, having difficulties finding food or of developing other health-related issues because it’s much more difficult for them to access health services.Refugees Deeply: How much information do humanitarian organizations have about people with disabilities in South Sudan?Pedneault: Humanitarian organizations categorize People with Special Needs (PSNs), and collect data on them, but that also includes older people and children without their parents. In certain settings, especially in POCs, the system is well-established, but in other IDP locations that are more difficult to access, there is very little available data.A lot of humanitarian actors rely on local community leaders to gather this data. Sometimes it’s accurate, sometimes it’s not. It’s very difficult to have a good sense of how many people with disabilities or older people are in each of those specific locations, let alone actually knowing where all of those specific locations actually are, because they can be very remote.Humanitarian actors in South Sudan also face a number of constraints and challenges, both in terms of funding, but also in terms of obstruction by government or opposition forces.Refugees Deeply: Have there been any improvements following the charter on inclusion of persons with disabilities in humanitarian action?Pedneault: There are still humongous gaps in terms of how humanitarian actors are responding to people with disabilities, and especially in the context of PoC sites, which are amongst the safest and easiest places for humanitarian actors to operate. It’s unfortunate that you still find a large number of latrines and showers that are not adapted for people with disabilities in the PoCs, or bridges that are not leveled or are destroyed, which means that people in wheelchairs are facing a lot of challenges just to get around the camp. Now that the PoC sites are becoming almost institutionalized – it’s been three and a half years that people have been living there – it’s high time that organizations put more thinking into how to make the sites accessible to everyone.One must understand that the camps, as much as they are protecting the population inside, are also prisons, because government forces are often present around the camps and they target civilians who venture outside, meaning that it’s extremely difficult for anyone to go out. Young men may be accused of being rebels, women face sexual and gender-based violence and obviously it would be extremely difficult for people with disabilities to leave. Because of that there is a sense of depression and gloom. There’s a state of hopelessness.Refugees Deeply: What practical solutions are you advocating for based on your research?Pedneault: We’re asking for more latrines and more showers to be built by humanitarian actors. We’re asking for disaggregated data for people to understand how many people with disabilities are present in the country.We’d like the U.N. mission also to include a section on people with disabilities and older people in their human rights reporting, and potentially appoint an adviser on the protection of those individuals.At the end of the day it boils down to the fact that humanitarian actors should ensure that people with disabilities have access to the same levels of humanitarian services as everyone else without accentuating their marginalization in the community. That can be done by fostering groups that represent people with disabilities inside of the PoC sites, for instance.Refugees Deeply: Are there local groups doing innovative work with displaced people with disabilities?Pedneault: The ICRC has been active with people with disabilities in South Sudan for a long time, providing assisting devices and prosthesis for people who have been amputated. In Juba, they’re organizing wheelchair basketball matches and other activities [to] ramp up the morale of people with disabilities. There are a number of local organizations, as well, but as with every other local organization in South Sudan, they’re under a lot of pressure from the government, but also because they lack funding and financial resources to do meaningful work, let alone conduct advocacy at this moment.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply, and you can find the original here.

59,ENTERTAINMENT,What If Tyrion Is Just Good At Talking?,"Gil Kidron, ContributorGot Academy, Co-Owner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-what-if-tyrion-is-just-good-at-talking_us_598c0725e4b08a4c247f2870,Everyone's favorite Game of Thrones character has been on a horrible losing streak.,2017-08-10,<p>Tyrion might lose more than his nose when it’s all said and done</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598c0a9a150000335d8b5f4d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Until recently, Tyrion Lannister was the smartest and sharpest character in Game of Thrones. He was cunning, determined and effective, but then something happened to him, and in seasons 6 and 7 he has been on a horrible losing streak.Fail after fail after fail.And this was supposed to be his time. He finally found a queen worthy of his considerable talents. It was supposed to be easy, instead of constant in-fighting in the court in King’s Landing, he now has the ear of the ruler, as well as her respect.So what happened? In seasons past he wiggled himself out of being thrown through the Moon Door, talked himself out of having his man parts thrown to the goats by the Vale’s Hill Tribes whom he actually managed to recruit to protect him, he persuaded his dad to appoint him Hand of the King, then went on to discard traitors and double agents in King’s Landing, was instrumental in winning the Battle of Blackwater Bay, and later fled a death sentence, killed his dad-nemesis and in Esso turned himself from a slave in chains to the Dragon Queen’s go-to man, with a huge army at his disposal.That’s a pretty impressive CV. But it’s been all downhill from there. Last season he cut a deal with the slavers in Mereen, and they played him for a fool until Daenerys came over with her dragons to save the day. This season he persuaded Daenerys to lay siege on King’s Landing, which resulted in the Dornish and Ironborn fleets destroyed, and later he fumbled his western campaign when he sent the Unsullied to Casterly Rock while his brother and sister took Highgarden from right under his scarred nose.So should we attribute the sudden change in fortunes to bad writing in the HBO show? Or maybe Tyrion’s true strength is not his mind but rather something else – his tongue.For more on Tyrion’s losing streak and what awaits him watch this Game of Thrones Academy’s video.Let’s pay attention to the signs. Jon told Daenerys that Tyrion likes to talk, to which Daenerys replied “everyone likes to do what they’re good at.” She’s basically saying that what Tyrion is good at is talking. That’s different from ruling and advising. Add to that what Olenna told Daenerys about him in the season’s premiere – he’s a clever man. Not a wise man, or a smart man – a clever man.What do they say about clever men? They’ll solve problems that wise men will avoid.Maybe he’s mostly good at getting himself out of trouble, with his back against the wall, as an underdog, and all thanks to his sharp tongue. You need an entirely different set of skills when you are the overwhelming favorite and when you need to advise a queen on what she needs to do with her huge army and her three dragons, when you need to take into account her own ambitions and goals, and her own temperament.One of the most apparent themes of this story is that each and every character and institution has paid or will pay their own ultimate price. Ned lost his honor by confessing to treason, Sansa had her dream of a beautiful and kind prince turn into a nightmare about a psychotic sadist, and Cersei lost her children and will pay some more by losing the throne by the end of the season.Tyrion has certainly paid, and then some, since the show started. But if his greatest strength is not his mind but his tongue – then he has not had to pay the ultimate price yet.If indeed his greatest skill is talking, because this is what has not only allowed him to survive but also thrive, then it is fitting that he will lose this very skill before the end. Remember Ilyn Payne, the tongue-less crown executioner? Maybe Tyrion will have to lose his tongue, literally, as a fitting conclusion to his tale.This fate could be a real bitter-sweet dramatic treat. Tyrion will be forced out of power, out of Westeros, and without his tongue he will sit down and write all that he has learned and put it in a book, Machiavelli-style, the 15th-16th century Italian who wrote one of the all-time most famous political essays. Instead of naming it The Prince, Tyrion’s book will be titled The Monarch.The sweet part of his ending will be that in the long run, like Machiavelli, his work and insight will stand the test of time. Tyrion’s sharp words written in a book? Well, I at least would love to read that.Check out Gil Kidron’s YouTube channel Game of Thrones Academy for a look at Game of Thrones through the lens of history.Follow Gil Kidron on Twitter: www.twitter.com/GoT_Academy"
60,POLITICS,Virginia Democrat Emphasizes Health Care In His First General Election Ad In Governor's Race,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ralph-northam-general-election-ad-health-care_us_598c687be4b0d793738d10e4,"Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, a physician, has a narrow lead in a new poll.",2017-08-10,"Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic candidate for governor, released his first general election television ad on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598c7741140000421aed01b1.jpeg?cache=aafVD2ryFV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrat Ralph Northam highlights his deep roots in Virginia and commitment to expanding access to affordable health care in the state in the first general election television advertisement for his gubernatorial campaign.The 30-second spot, “My Life,” features Virginians from different corners of the state mentioning some of Northam’s most flattering biographical details, including his work as a pediatric neurologist, his upbringing on the rural Eastern Shore, his graduation from the Virginia Military Institute and service as an Army doctor during the first Gulf War.But it is the final bit of information about Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, that spotlights a likely dominant theme in the November election: his support for expanding Medicaid in the state using funds from the Affordable Care Act.“I’m Ralph Northam, and we need to provide access to health care for all Virginians, not take it away,” he says at the end of the ad.The line suggests that Democrats view protecting and expanding heath care access as a winning political issue following the defeat of the Republican efforts in Congress to repeal the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare. Uproar from voters and Republican governors helped persuade three GOP senators to vote against the final repeal bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona.The Northam campaign has bought $100,000 worth of time for the ad to air in the Norfolk, Charlottesville, Richmond and Roanoke markets, according to the campaign.Democrats, who have failed to score a win in this year’s special congressional elections, are hoping victories in November’s two gubernatorial races ― the other is in New Jersey ― will break their dry spell. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy has big lead in polling over Republican Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor. Murphy, a former U.S. ambassador, appears to be benefiting from the high disapproval ratings for New Jersey’s outgoing GOP governor, Chris Christie.Virginia also would seem to be fertile ground for the Democrats. Hillary Clinton carried it by 5 percentage points over Donald Trump in last year’s presidential campaign. And a mere 36 percent of Virginia voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday.Still, the Quinnipiac poll showed Northam, 57, with a narrower lead over Republican Ed Gillespie, 56, than some observers expected. Northam was backed by 44 percent of Virginia’s registered voters, compared with 38 percent for Gillespie and 4 percent for Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra. Northam held an an 8-percentage-point over Gillespie in a Quinnipiac survey released in late June.The race “leans toward” Northam, “but not overly so,” said Peter A. Brown, the poll’s assistant director. The new survey has an error margin of plus-or-minus 3.8 percentage points.Northam is apparently betting that his emphasis on expanding health care access will help his cause. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat prevented by term limits from seeking re-election, has pushed for Medicaid expansion in the state. But Republican control of the Virginia legislature has prevented him from tapping into federal funds available under Obamacare funds to do so.Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, has said he opposes Medicaid expansion. But in Wednesday remarks to the ARC of Virginia, a disability rights organization, he described Medicaid as a “critically important program for protecting the most vulnerable.”The Gillespie campaign, asked Thursday whether he stands by his opposition to Medicaid expansion, did not immediately respond to HuffPost.Notably, Northam’s opening general election ad does not explicitly mention Trump, who he memorably dubbed a “narcissistic maniac” during the Democratic gubernatorial primary.But Northam tied Gillespie to Trump in a fundraising e-mail sent out for him by the Democratic National Committee. In it, he termed Gillespie “Trump’s ally in Virginia.”He also said Gillespie ”is crisscrossing the Commonwealth promising to be Donald Trump’s man in Richmond. And there’s a real chance they could win.” Northam can count on further help from his party. The Democratic National Committee announced in July that it would spend $1.7 million on his behalf. DNC chairman Tom Perez is going to Richmond on Thursday to speak to party organizers and kick off a phone bank operation to aid Northam and other Democrats on the November ballot in the state.Gillespie, who in a 2014 Senate run came close to upsetting Democratic incumbent Mark Warner, began his general election ad campaign in July with three spots. They included a one-minute ad titled “The American Dream is About Opportunity” that focused on his upbringing as the son of an Irish immigrant who achieved success in Republican politics.“Opposing Medicaid expansion does not mean opposing Medicaid, and as governor, Ed would make sure we maximize our Medicaid dollars in Virginia to help those most in need,” Gillespie campaign spokesman David Abrams told HuffPost in a statement. “Ed is running for governor and is laser focused on making health care more affordable and more accessible for all Virginians.”This article has been updated with comment from David Abrams.

While she quickly lost 30 after giving birth, the last 20 have proved more difficult to lose.Over time, Heigl has lost some of those pounds, but has learned not to obsess over them. Instead, she has chosen to appreciate her body, including her C-section scar that “stretches almost hip to hip” and that she considers a “beautiful reminder.”Heigl also offered advice for moms who are finding it difficult to reclaim their postpartum bodies. The actress values sleep and says a positive mantra out loud every morning. “Mine is, ‘I am easily, with good health, inspiration, grace and gratitude, losing weight faster than I can even imagine with harm to none,’” she wrote. She also says her “gratefuls.”“Thanking my body for its perfect health, strength, limberness, vibrancy, youthfulness and beauty,” she wrote. “Whether I always believe these things about myself and my body or not, I say them.”Keeping her three kids in mind, Heigl hopes to pass on her positive body image. In her essay, she wrote that she had struggled with body shaming herself for “so long,” but now has taken on a sense of pride in her body and all it has done for her. “It was the most natural and healthy thing in the world to put on weight during my pregnancy and allowing my body to shed it slowly, gracefully and healthfully feels…good,” she wrote.Read Heigl’s essay in full on her blog."

The former Breitbart news editor and internet troll released a self-published memoir, Dangerous, last month to mostly negative reviews. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the ACLU argued that the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority violated Yiannopoulos’ right to free speech when it refused to let him promote the book ― which has been described as “desperate” and “largely boring” ― on the Washington, D.C., metro. (As it turns out, the New York subway didn’t have similar qualms.) The British-born Yiannopoulos is among several clients ― including abortion and birth control provider Carafem and the animal advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ― named in the ACLU’s lawsuit, according to the Los Angeles Times. The suit stems from WMATA guidelines that forbid advertisements “intended to influence members of the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions,” which the ACLU believes is too vague. Given Yiannopoulos’ history of mocking Muslims, feminists, the LGBTQ community and the Black Lives Matter movement, however, the conservative author’s inclusion in the suit sparked instant controversy. Acknowledging that 32-year-old Yiannopoulos “trades on outrage,” ACLU officials nonetheless explained their choice to defend him in a Wednesday blog post on the group’s official website. “The ACLU condemns many of the values he espouses (and he, of course, condemns many of the values the ACLU espouses),” they wrote.Though WMATA initially accepted the Dangerous ads and “displayed them in Metro stations and subway cars,” they were removed 10 days later after passengers complained, the ACLU alleges. “To anyone who’d be outraged to see Mr. Yiannopoulos’ advertisement — please recognize that if he comes down, so do we all,” ACLU officials wrote. “The First Amendment doesn’t, and shouldn’t, tolerate that kind of impoverishment of our public conversation. Not even in the subway.” James Esseks, who is the director of the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project, defended his organization’s decision to represent Yiannopoulos in a second blog, also published Wednesday. “Some people may say that Mr. Yiannopoulos’ offensive speech sets him apart and doesn’t deserve to be defended. But the sad reality is that many people think that speech about sexuality, gender identity, or abortion is over the line as well,” he wrote. “If First Amendment protections are eroded at any level, it’s not hard to imagine the government successfully pushing one or more of those arguments in court.” Though the ACLU has a liberal reputation, the organization has previously represented people and groups whose values lie at the opposite end of the political spectrum, including the Ku Klux Klan, the Westboro Baptist Church and conservative talk radio personality Rush Limbaugh. Still, support for their defense of Yiannopoulos was not unanimous across staff members. Chase Strangio, an ACLU staff attorney best known for defending U.S. military whistleblower and transgender activist Chelsea Manning, blasted the decision in a lengthy note posted to Twitter on Wednesday.Calling Yiannopoulos “vile” and “a reprehensible person,” Strangio wrote, “I don’t believe in protecting principle for the sake of principle in all cases. His actions have consequences for people that I care about and for me.” Meanwhile, Yiannopoulos told the Los Angeles Times that he was “glad that the ACLU has decided to tackle a real civil rights issue,” adding, “Free speech isn’t about only support[ing] speech you agree with, it is about supporting all speech — especially the words of your enemies.

The comedian gave a 13-minute speech that soon spread online.On Thursday, Kimmel provided The Hollywood Reporter with an update on Billy’s health, noting that his son has two more open heart surgeries in his future.“We would like to get them over with and not have to think about it all the time, but it could definitely be worse,” Kimmel said.He also opened up about the decision to share such personal news with the nation.“I had a lot of time to think at the hospital, and it just so happened that our government was deciding whether or not millions of people should have health care at that time,” Kimmel said. “I think it made a big impact on American citizens.”The story of Kimmel’s son touched a nerve with viewers, as it came during a year when the Affordable Health Care Act has been aggressively challenged by lawmakers. “Repeal and replace” measures, which could potentially strip protection for individuals with pre-existing conditions — like Billy — have come dangerously close to becoming law. Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton sent letters to Kimmel after his on-air speech, as well as several members of Congress.“My goal always is to not make this a red or blue issue, because I don’t think it is,” Kimmel said. “If the opinion polls are to be believed, more than 80 percent of Americans support some kind of health insurance plan that works. It’s clear that these politicians aren’t listening to the people.”Kimmel reiterated his gratitude for the staff at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and urged readers to “remember places like [it]” when considering causes to donate to.In July, Kimmel shared an adorable photo of a smiling Billy, telling followers his son was “doing great.” Now? Billy is still doing well.“He smiles,” Kimmel told THR. “That’s pretty much it. He is very interested in ceiling fans. He likes those a lot.”We’re pretty sure those aren’t the only fans Billy has. "
64,ENTERTAINMENT,"With 'The Glass Castle,' Jeannette Walls Goes From Memoirist To Movie Character",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeannette-walls-the-glass-castle_us_598b2f86e4b0a66b8bb07a38,"As the big-screen adaptation opens, Walls is finally comfortable revealing her past.",2017-08-10,"Jeannette Walls and director Destin Daniel Cretton talk on the set of ""The Glass Castle.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598b67a3140000401aecffc3.jpeg?cache=lje3f8NQ7A&ops=crop_47_364_4103_2537%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Glass Castle spent seven years on the best-seller list, but Jeannette Walls talks about its movie adaptation almost as if it’s about someone else. Maybe that’s what happens when a memoirist sells her story to Hollywood. Suddenly your life is projected onto big screens, and you’ve become an observer like everyone else. Thankfully for Walls, who was warm and engaged during our conversation in New York earlier this week, director Destin Daniel Cretton wanted to ensure the celluloid “Glass Castle” honored the spirit of Walls’ beloved book, which was published to immediate success in 2005. After previous scripts were thrown out, Cretton and co-writer Andrew Lanham sought the author’s input.Walls walked away awestruck ― by the performances (including Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts), by the art of screenwriting (she gravitates toward nonfiction), and by the protracted reception to her humble story about growing up in a transient family with an alcoholic father and limited finances. For someone once afraid that people would judge her origins, Walls, now 57, has become admirably candid. “Ask me anything,” she commanded by way of introduction. And she meant it. Leaving home for New York is a pivotal part of your story. And now you’ve left New York for country life. What’s it like to be back?It’s funny, I fell head over heels in love with New York City in 1977. I never in my life felt like I belonged somewhere until I came here. There’s such energy and such weirdos, and wow, I can just fit in and not be a freak here. I stayed 30 years. 30 years! It was 1977 to 2006, almost 30 years. My husband wanted to leave. I said, “How do you want to leave this greatest city in the world?” I was still renting — I could never get into the real-estate market. I was paying $3,000 a month to have takeout burritos at my coffee table. His family was in Virginia — his dad was a diplomat — so he wanted to go down there. I was like, “I’ll go, but I won’t like it.” I loved it. I loved it! I’ve got four seasons and chickens. I’m basically a hick. I just sort of took to it. I told my agent and she was like, “You know, you always wore those little fitted suits, but they never quite fit you.” I was a little bit hurt, but a little bit flattered at the same time. I thought I’d passed!People’s roots never never totally dissolve.Completely. I see it all the time — I go to the Midwest, and people are like, “I couldn’t wait to get out of the Midwest, and then here I came back.” I think a lot of us have an internal landscape. I did fall in love with New York, and being back here, it’s so gorgeous. There’s such energy. This will sound so shallow, but I’m nutty in love with the architecture. You just look out the window and there’s the caryatids, the statues of women with pillars on their heads. I love the crazy people all looking different. But I feel like it’s an old boyfriend that I split with amicably.How “Sex and the City” of you.[Laughs] I will always love it. My New York City life was so glitzy. I loved my job at New York magazine — perhaps less so at MSNBC. I grew up without television, so I didn’t care about celebrities. There will always be a big place in my heart for it, but boy, am I glad I moved on. It’s just not for me anymore. [...] When I moved here in 1967, it was a dump. It was filthy and falling apart. It’s definitely changed, and a lot of it makes it more inaccessible. I couldn’t afford to live here! But everything changes. You accept that. You have to embrace it. Time doesn’t move straight forward; it moves in a coil — it goes up and down. That’s the great thing about being my ripe old age. You see these things come and go. Sometimes I’ll say, “I could probably afford a decent apartment now,” but it’s just not my lifestyle anymore. My dogs are so important to me, and my stupid chickens, believe it or not, are a lot of fun to feed. You give one of them a piece of bread, and it’s like football — one of them grabs it out of its mouth, and then another one grabs it. That’s more enjoyable for me now than going to an art show. I just love life so much.What do you think your dad would say about that?I don’t know. That’s a very interesting and perceptive question. I think Dad would love it. So many of his old letters that I’ve been reading — he really loved the country; he loved New York, but he loved the country. He loved nature and was a real environmentalist from early on. I think he’d love it. This is the reason I’m more drawn to nonfiction than fiction: I can’t second-guess people. I could never make up the things my mom says, and I could never make up the things my dad did. They’re so wacky. I don’t think that truth is stranger than fiction — I think it’s more nuanced and more contradictory. But the internal contradictions always make sense. I do think about Dad often and what he would think. I think he’d be thrilled.There are only so many “Glass Castles” in the world. In almost any conversation, at least one person has read it ― it’s that popular. How did the movie come about?That’s very flattering. It was optioned pretty much as soon as it came out, and people just didn’t know what to do with it. They just didn’t know how to make it into a movie. What do you focus on? People asked me if I wanted to do the screenplay, and I didn’t. You didn’t even consider it?Well, it’s not my medium. I don’t know what I would have focused on. I don’t know how to do it, and I spent so long on the damn book. What scenes do you cut? What do you emphasize? In telling a story like this, there’s such a balance. My parents, in some ways, were so horrible, and in other ways, so magnificent. It was such a fine line to walk. I could have made them seem a lot worse than they were, and I could have made them seem a lot better. Even though something it’s accurate, it’s not necessarily truth. As a journalist, you know this — you could make me look like a complete nincompoop without twisting any of my quotes or anything. It’s like, how do we tell our story? What the heck is my story? I kind of thought it was going to be an homage to Dad. I really didn’t know what it was going to be. The first time I read it back, I was shocked by my own story. My agent was shocked, too — she had no idea, and she said, “You wrote this as if it happened to somebody else. You have to describe what really happened, how it really felt and how it affected you.” I was like, “It didn’t affect me at all, I’m perfectly normal, I feel nothing.” Do you think you really felt that way?I definitely had cut myself off. “This is just something that happened to me.”At a certain point, do you have to stop internalizing it? Yeah, you do. I tried to write it many times when I was younger, and it just didn’t work. I threw it away and tried again. My second husband, Billy, pulled it out of me. He was like, “Jeannette, if your parents weren’t buying food, how did you survive?” I would say, “I got by.” He’d say, “What do you mean?” “You know, I got by.” He’d say, “No, I don’t. You have to spell it out.” It was such an interesting process because, with stuff like eating food out of the garbage, I never told anybody. I was crying and was a mess. And afterwards, it doesn’t bother me as much. A very wise man once told me, “Secrets are a little bit like vampires. They suck the life out of you, but they can exist only in the darkness. Once they’re exposed to light, there’s a moment of horror, then poof, they lose their power over you.” I found that to be true. These things haunted me. And it’s so stupid, I realized. What was I afraid of? I was just afraid of being condemned by other people and having people pass judgment, and people were much better and kinder than I thought they’d be. And if they’re not, cut them out of your life. What the hell, you don’t need them. But to get back to your question, it was optioned pretty much immediately after the book came out, and a number of people gave it a shot. It was really funny what people chose to focus on.Did you read those early drafts as they came through?Uh-huh, and I didn’t nix any of them — it’s just that they didn’t get made. People would focus on their own issues. One woman focused on the mother-daughter relationship because she had mother issues. Another person focused on the racial, small-town issues because she was from West Virginia. People brought their own issues. And [director Destin Daniel Cretton] was so smart about it being the father-daughter relationship. I just said, “I trust this man.”Is that how you would encapsulate it, too? With your father as the central figure?Yeah. To me, it is. But then you’ve got to lose a lot of other things. Some people say, “Where’s the rock fight? Where’s this, where’s that?” You can’t do it all. Destin underlined all these scenes, like, “Oh, this has to be in the movie.” He finished it and realized it would be a seven-hour movie. In fact, in a couple of places in the margins he wrote, “This is the movie.” He’s the sweetest guy. He’s this cool Hawaiian dude. He’s so smart, so perceptive, so non-judgmental. He wrote what I now call the second-best movie ever made, “Short Term 12.” What a beautiful movie — it’s so compassionate. Everybody’s dinged up, but they’ve got so much beauty and love. If he can do that with my story, then he’s a better man than I am. And he did. I think I had veto power, but I don’t know — I never needed to exercise it.If the studio had opted to make one of the previous drafts, would you have stepped in?I thought I wouldn’t when it all started, but I think when push came to shove, yeah. I thought, “I don’t care, just make the movie!” But then I saw them, and I thought, “I know my parents’ story has a lot of humor in it, but I don’t want my parents to be punchlines.” At least not anybody else’s punchlines. I think I would have just said I can’t live with this. You sell your rights, unless you’re J.K. Rowling or someone like that. They could have made me a hoochie dancer if they wanted to. Destin and Gil Netter, the producer, wanted to keep me happy. So they consulted me.What’s the point of adapting a memoir if it’s not aligned with the way the author would tell her own story?That’s what they felt. It’s for authenticity’s sake. If you’re going to make a movie, do it right. Every step of the way, they were really conscientious about, “We’re thinking of doing this — does this make sense to you?” Destin went to West Virginia, and I was like, “I’ll go with you. I’ll show you around. I can handle this.” He’s like, “No, I’ll go on my own,” and I think he made more friends there in a couple of days than I did in all the years I lived there. He’s walking down the street and he sees the Welch Daily News, and he says, “Whoa, there’s a scene there.” He just knocks on the door, introduces himself and ends up shooting a scene there at this incredible old printing press. So now — this is what a cool guy he is — there’s an aspiring filmmaker there who’s getting invited to the premiere tomorrow, him and his mom. They’ve stayed in touch over email. He’s just a decent, kind human being. I just trusted him with my story in a way that I didn’t really trust myself.In thinking about cutting bits from the book, was there one moment you thought was most important to show?After watching the movie, I think maybe the pivotal moment — God, there are so many great moments — is when the kids all gang up on Irma and punch her out because she was doing something inappropriate with my brother. Destin so wisely zeroed in on my father’s damage, which I think is so smart and compassionate. That’s the way your father gets humanized.Exactly. For all of his talk of demons, he couldn’t chase the demons. And confronted with his personification of his real-life demon, he couldn’t deal with it, but his kids could. For everything he did wrong, he gave his kids the tools to fight the demons, to say, “You cannot do that to us — we will stand up and fight.” It was a pivotal moment in which the kids were stronger than the dad. They didn’t realize it, and he didn’t realize it, so I think that is probably the turning point. I think I kind of knew that when I wrote it, but seeing it, when you sculpt away all that other stuff, it was just this bare, heartbreaking story about this damaged man. At what point did you find out about your father being sexually assaulted as a child?I suspected something when all that was going on, after Irma did something. We were only there for a short time, and she pulled that. And Uncle Stanley was weird. I asked Mom pretty soon afterwards.Somebody told me once that we become adults not when we come of voting age or even have children — it’s when we realize that our parents are human beings, too. It was a little younger than I might have chosen, but that’s all fine, too. It’s funny, I talked to Destin about a lot of the scenes that are cut. This is why I never could have done it. The movie, before they edited it down, was three hours. There was this great scene — the guy who played Uncle Stanley was sitting there, and all of a sudden this dark, disturbed, troubled face turns and says, “I can’t believe you hit her.” Finally, somebody stood up and fought back. “Destin, how could you not include that?” He said, “I know, that hurt, having to cut it. But it took you out of the moment.” I feel I learned so much about storytelling form him. I didn’t stay up while they were shooting the movie the entire time, but the time I spent on the set, I was in awe. Woody and Brie were rehearsing this scene, and it was where Brie — that would be me — is telling Woody Harrelson that she’s leaving and he tries to convince her to stay home. The first time, they did it all scripted, and then they went off-script. It was stunning to me. They were arguing and he started crying. It was very powerful. They just fully inhabited these characters. As a writerly type, I like to think of myself as observant, but it’s from the outside in, and these people work from the inside out. It was really humbling. I was thinking, if I were in my early 20s, I think I might consider moviemaking. But probably not. So this doesn’t give you the screenwriting bug?Oh gosh. I’m 57. It’s like working five-level chess games. There’s so much going on. And to be a good director, you’ve got to not only understand the script, but understand the actors and the lighting and everything. I was just watching Destin, and he was this source of calm. Everybody commented on how that was a more loving and calm movie set than they’d ever been on. He was keeping everything going like it was the center of a Ferris wheel. Was it thrilling to learn which actors would portray your relatives?It was odd because the first thing you think of is physicality. There are actors who look more like my dad than Woody Harrelson that they talked to, but I do not think anybody could have captured it as well. And Naomi Watts, I was nuts for her portrayal. She had a tougher job than Woody did because my mother is such a contradiction. Honestly, I think she understands my mother better than my mom does. Brie, I’d seen in “Short Term 12” before they cast her — I didn’t even know who she was then, and I thought, “Who is that woman? Is there any way on Earth that she could star in ‘The Glass Castle’?” I’d never identified with anyone the way I did with her onscreen. She had a couple of lines of dialogue that took my breath away, like when she was asking her boyfriend, “Why are you so nice to me?” I had almost that exact exchange with my husband. I couldn’t understand why somebody would like somebody like me. I never articulated that to anybody. Brie has some great ’80s and ’90s outfits. Those shoulder pads! Is that what you wore to work?She was wearing some of my clothes! They came and asked, “Can you describe your ’80s and ’90s clothes?” I was like, “Not only can I describe them — I’ve got them upstairs.” I dusted off the shelves. They took out some of the shoulder pads! That’s how I dressed, tragically. It seemed appropriate at the time. Wait till you look back at the clothes you’re wearing today.“The Glass Castle” opens in theaters Aug. 11. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length."

He’s walking down the street and he sees the Welch Daily News, and he says, “Whoa, there’s a scene there.” He just knocks on the door, introduces himself and ends up shooting a scene there at this incredible old printing press. So now — this is what a cool guy he is — there’s an aspiring filmmaker there who’s getting invited to the premiere tomorrow, him and his mom. They’ve stayed in touch over email. He’s just a decent, kind human being. I just trusted him with my story in a way that I didn’t really trust myself.In thinking about cutting bits from the book, was there one moment you thought was most important to show?After watching the movie, I think maybe the pivotal moment — God, there are so many great moments — is when the kids all gang up on Irma and punch her out because she was doing something inappropriate with my brother. Destin so wisely zeroed in on my father’s damage, which I think is so smart and compassionate. That’s the way your father gets humanized.Exactly. For all of his talk of demons, he couldn’t chase the demons. And confronted with his personification of his real-life demon, he couldn’t deal with it, but his kids could. For everything he did wrong, he gave his kids the tools to fight the demons, to say, “You cannot do that to us — we will stand up and fight.” It was a pivotal moment in which the kids were stronger than the dad. They didn’t realize it, and he didn’t realize it, so I think that is probably the turning point. I think I kind of knew that when I wrote it, but seeing it, when you sculpt away all that other stuff, it was just this bare, heartbreaking story about this damaged man. At what point did you find out about your father being sexually assaulted as a child?I suspected something when all that was going on, after Irma did something. We were only there for a short time, and she pulled that. And Uncle Stanley was weird. I asked Mom pretty soon afterwards.Somebody told me once that we become adults not when we come of voting age or even have children — it’s when we realize that our parents are human beings, too. It was a little younger than I might have chosen, but that’s all fine, too. It’s funny, I talked to Destin about a lot of the scenes that are cut. This is why I never could have done it. The movie, before they edited it down, was three hours. There was this great scene — the guy who played Uncle Stanley was sitting there, and all of a sudden this dark, disturbed, troubled face turns and says, “I can’t believe you hit her.” Finally, somebody stood up and fought back. “Destin, how could you not include that?” He said, “I know, that hurt, having to cut it. But it took you out of the moment.” I feel I learned so much about storytelling form him. I didn’t stay up while they were shooting the movie the entire time, but the time I spent on the set, I was in awe. Woody and Brie were rehearsing this scene, and it was where Brie — that would be me — is telling Woody Harrelson that she’s leaving and he tries to convince her to stay home. The first time, they did it all scripted, and then they went off-script. It was stunning to me. They were arguing and he started crying. It was very powerful. They just fully inhabited these characters. As a writerly type, I like to think of myself as observant, but it’s from the outside in, and these people work from the inside out. It was really humbling. I was thinking, if I were in my early 20s, I think I might consider moviemaking. But probably not. So this doesn’t give you the screenwriting bug?Oh gosh. I’m 57. It’s like working five-level chess games. There’s so much going on. And to be a good director, you’ve got to not only understand the script, but understand the actors and the lighting and everything. I was just watching Destin, and he was this source of calm. Everybody commented on how that was a more loving and calm movie set than they’d ever been on. He was keeping everything going like it was the center of a Ferris wheel. Was it thrilling to learn which actors would portray your relatives?It was odd because the first thing you think of is physicality. There are actors who look more like my dad than Woody Harrelson that they talked to, but I do not think anybody could have captured it as well. And Naomi Watts, I was nuts for her portrayal. She had a tougher job than Woody did because my mother is such a contradiction. Honestly, I think she understands my mother better than my mom does. Brie, I’d seen in “Short Term 12” before they cast her — I didn’t even know who she was then, and I thought, “Who is that woman? Is there any way on Earth that she could star in ‘The Glass Castle’?” I’d never identified with anyone the way I did with her onscreen. She had a couple of lines of dialogue that took my breath away, like when she was asking her boyfriend, “Why are you so nice to me?” I had almost that exact exchange with my husband. I couldn’t understand why somebody would like somebody like me. I never articulated that to anybody. Brie has some great ’80s and ’90s outfits. Those shoulder pads! Is that what you wore to work?She was wearing some of my clothes! They came and asked, “Can you describe your ’80s and ’90s clothes?” I was like, “Not only can I describe them — I’ve got them upstairs.” I dusted off the shelves. They took out some of the shoulder pads! That’s how I dressed, tragically. It seemed appropriate at the time. Wait till you look back at the clothes you’re wearing today.“The Glass Castle” opens in theaters Aug. 11. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length."

Democrats controlled the House, Senate and White House. And the country had evolved a great deal on gay rights, to the point where marriage ― not just openly gay service members ― had become a conceivable reality. But in the fall of 2010, that window appeared dangerously close to closing. Republicans had won control of the House of Representatives and they would take power in a matter of weeks.“I get very nervous,” Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) recalls. “And in October, I started telling everybody, the president, Harry Reid, Nancy [Pelosi], everyone I could talk to, ‘We now better get this done this year. ... We’ve got to be willing to do this in the lame duck.’”In the latest episode of the “Candidate Confessional” podcast, Frank remembers those frantic days in which congressional leaders raced against the clock to finally overturn the policy. And he recounts the immense sacrifice that came with that achievement.It wasn’t initially clear whether Democrats could move a bill during that lame-duck period. An overturn of “don’t ask, don’t tell” had been attached to a defense authorization bill, and the Senate was threatening to separate the two. Frank understood that doing so would ensure the defense money got passed while the overturn of DADT would be shot down. He pleaded with Pelosi to not follow the Senate’s lead.They had one week to go. Frank and Pelosi decided to allow the House to pass the bill overturning “don’t ask, don’t tell” and send it to the Senate while holding back on a defense authorization until the upper chamber acted.“We are going to hold the defense authorization bill hostage,” is how Frank puts it.It was unclear whether the votes even existed in the Senate. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) threatened to scuttle a nuclear non-proliferation treaty in response. But when Senate Majority Leader Reid brought the repeal bill to the floor, enough Republicans were supportive to put them comfortably over the 60 votes needed. Frank and other liberals returned the favor by voting the defense authorization bill out of the House.“I held my nose and held up my thumb,” he said.It was a remarkably swift end to a legislative battle that had persisted for over a decade. And the lack of blowback was notable. The military quickly adjusted to the new reality of openly gay service members. Those politicians who had warned of grave consequences quickly moved on to other issues when none materialized.But the win came at a cost. In that same lame-duck session, Congress had also been contemplating passage of a bill that would have granted conditional U.S. residency to young undocumented immigrants who had gone to school or served in the military. The Dream Act was a major policy objective of immigrant-rights groups. And it failed to pass, Frank says, in large part because lawmakers took the “don’t ask, don’t tell” vote.“There were some Republicans who would vote for one but not the other. You can only go off so many times. You have this count. I can only piss off my voters so many times on so many issues,” Frank says.Listen to the full episode above.“Candidate Confessional” is produced by Zach Young.

That once we conquer one area of our lives, we need to put our energy toward fixing another.Maybe you're not working on the book because you really don't want to write, even though you like the idea of being a writer. Maybe you aren't getting in better shape because you've been conditioned to think there's something wrong with your body in the first place. Maybe you're not working toward running your own business because you only think you want to.Sometimes, the thing that we can't seem to fix isn't meant to be fixed, and what's distressing to us is that we are having a hard time accepting that it is the way it is.But successful people don't do this. They don't waste their energy on things that don't matter, or that they don't care about. Here, how to know if you're one of them.1. When you aren't genuinely inspired by something, you become paralyzed. You have a very hard time forcing yourself to do anything you don't really want to.2. You frequently give yourself a hard time for not doing ""more."" In a world that conditions you to believe you need to be more, more, more, sometimes you fail to recognize everything you have done in the face of everything that you're still struggling to juggle.3. You're not afraid to give up on what's not working. A lot of people stay in the wrong jobs, commit themselves to projects they know aren't right, or stay with partners they don't actually get along with because they are afraid to disturb the status quo. Sometimes ""giving up"" is the most liberating and important thing you can do, and you would rather people judge you for changing than not do what you know is right in your heart.4. When it comes to anything from reading books to attending classes in school, you excel when you're genuinely interested, and just get by when you're not. It's not that you're inherently less smart than other students, it's that you can't feign interest in things that don't apply or resonate with you.5. You believe you have a big purpose in life, one that's far more than just going to work, paying the bills, and waiting around to die.6. You don't want to spend all of your energy each day working on creating other people's dreams. You're motivated by knowing you're creating something for yourself.7. You'd rather be fulfilled than comfortable. Being selectively motivated doesn't mean you're quick to give up or choose the easier path, it just means you're only willing to suffer for what's really worth it.8. What you care about is what motivates you. What you're good at is what motivates you. Those two things, when done in tandem, create your purpose. You realize that the things you like are not random, they are fundamentally a part of what you are supposed to do here.9. You feel disproportionately motivated when it comes to ""getting your life together."" You will happily spend 11 hours of your day working on your creative projects, but can't get yourself to care about decorating your apartment better, or having more stylish clothing. A lot of things that other people seem to care about a lot don't always register as important to you.10. You're willing to sacrifice some parts of your life to put your energy toward others. Maybe you wear a ""personal uniform"" each day so your first energy in the morning goes toward something other than how you appear. Maybe you're choosing to stay single for a period of time because your focus needs to be primarily on yourself. Maybe you've moved to a cheaper city so you're able to pursue more freelance dreams. The point is: you're willing to do anything for what you care about, and you're not afraid to discard what you know won't matter in the end.Get your copy of Brianna Wiest’s book, 101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think, here."
68,TASTE,Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Lattes Are Coming To Grocery Stores,Carly Ledbetter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pumpkin-spice-lattes-are-back-this-month-but-theres-a-catch_us_598c86dde4b0d793738d39c2,Are you ready?,2017-08-10,Can you handle MORE pumpkin spice latte products?! ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598c920a2200002d001a55db.png?ops=crop_0_0_241_727%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As if back-to-school advertisements weren’t enough to convince you summer is almost over, Starbucks announced Thursday that Pumpkin Spice Lattes will arrive later this month. But there’s one little catch. According to a press release, ready-to-drink Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Pumpkin Spice-flavored ground coffee will be available at supermarkets. Not Starbucks locations.The bottled lattes, which the coffee franchise says are made with arabica coffee, creamy milk and feature “notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove spices” are priced at $2.79 each. The Starbucks’ Pumpkin Spice-flavored ground coffee will retail for $9.99 for an 11-ounce bag. Though the news is probably exciting for truly dedicated PSL fans, our bet is that most Starbucks customers are counting down the days (hours, really) until the real Pumpkin Spice Latte shows up in stores."
69,POLITICS,Avoiding War With North Korea Is Easy,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-war-trump_us_598c6fb9e4b0449ed5085839,Just don’t bomb them. Getting them to give up their nukes will be a lot harder.,2017-08-10,South Korea President Moon Jae-In met with President Donald Trump in June amid tensions with North Korea.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598c7099140000401aed019d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s threat on Tuesday to rain “fire and fury” down upon North Korea if the nuclear-powered hereditary dictatorship made any more threats against the United States immediately increased fears of a nuclear war that could kill millions. It took less than 24 hours for North Korea to cross Trump’s red line and threaten to shoot missiles near the U.S. island territory of Guam. In those same 24 hours, U.S. officials walked back the erratic president’s off-the-cuff and already-crossed red line.Tensions between North Korea and the U.S. are undoubtedly at their highest levels in years. North Korea has been a nuclear power for more than a decade and now may possess long-range missiles with the capability to carry nuclear warheads to the U.S. mainland. Trump warned in the spring that there could be a “major, major conflict” between the U.S. and the North. And the United Nations security council just imposed its toughest-ever round of sanctions on North Korea.But experts on Korea and nonproliferation agree that there is one incredibly easy way to avoid war: The U.S. should simply not pre-emptively bomb or attack North Korea.“We can’t attack them,” said Robert Kelly, a professor of diplomacy at Pusan University in South Korea. “We’re talking about a million people who are going to get killed. So let’s not do that.”“Kim Jong Un and the ruling regime of North Korea are not suicidal. They are not seeking martyrdom,” former Secretary of Defense William Perry wrote in HuffPost in March. “They want to stay in power, and they understand that if they launch a nuclear attack, their country will be destroyed, and they themselves will be killed — it would end the Kim dynasty.”As every U.S. president has made clear since the Korean War armistice in 1953, any attempt by the North to move on South Korea or other U.S. allies like Japan would result in the end of North Korea as a nation and of the Kim dynasty.The flip side of that coin is that any attempt by the U.S. to attack North Korea would be met with all-out force from the North. For decades, the 10 million people living in Seoul have lived with the possibility that the North could incinerate the city with conventional weapons at any moment. Now armed with nukes, the North could destroy more than one city on its way to the dustheap of history. The North would lose the war, but millions could die.Neither North Korea nor the U.S. has initiated this mass blood-letting. It’s clear that none of the countries involved want that ― especially not South Korea. President Moon Jae-In made that clear in a phone call with Trump this week. Moon “emphasized that South Korea can never accept a war erupting again on the Korean Peninsula,” according to a statement from his office.At this point, that leaves either punitive sanctions (which the North is already under) or negotiations as the options to get the North to pause its nuclear and missile tests and possibly reach the United States’ stated goal of having a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.Negotiating, however, is far more difficult than the easy step of just not bombing North Korea.A number of Democratic Party senators have begun to call on Trump to immediately enter into talks with North Korea without any preconditions. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has said the U.S. is not seeking regime change in North Korea, is currently the only high-level Trump administration official calling for talks, but he has said those talks cannot begin until the North halts its missile tests for an unspecified period of time.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is the most prominent Democrat, but not the only one, calling for the U.S. to immediately begin talks with the North Koreans.“Reports that North Korea is capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead to deliver on an ICBM shows they’re closer than originally believed to building a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States,” Feinstein told HuffPost in a statement. “This accelerated timeline has created an urgent need to restart diplomatic discussions. Calls for preconditions on direct talks delay that effort. A diplomatic solution is only possible if we get North Korea to the negotiating table — time is not on our side.”Those talks would likely begin in secret without any preconditions. The parties involved ― which, beyond the U.S. and North Korea would likely include South Korea, China and Japan and possibly Russia ― would be able to set any conditions for public diplomatic talks, including temporary moratoriums on missile tests and nuclear tests by the North. The North, of course, would need some assurances from the U.S. and its allies. Those nations would need to listen to North Korea seriously to decide what assurances to provide.“The North Koreans say this over and over again,” said Joel Wit. Wit is a senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and the former coordinator of the U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework. “They are willing to put their [nuclear] program on the table if the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward North Korea. Well what does that mean, hostile policy?”Wit, who has also spoken to the North Koreans as part of unofficial negotiations, explains that “hostility” means the general posture of the U.S. to North Korea in every regard from the political, security and economic.One place to start is with North Korea’s ongoing complaints about the routine military exercises conducted by the U.S. and South Korea. After the North tested a medium-range missile in February, the U.S. sent nuclear capable B-52 bombers to fly over the Korean peninsula during these military exercises. Earlier this year, North Korea offered to halt nuclear testing in exchange for the U.S. and South Korea halting all military exercises.Leon Sigal, a longtime Korea nuclear negotiations expert who has engaged in unofficial negotiations with the North Koreans for years, told HuffPost the North Korean proposal to stop all military exercises is “a nonstarter and they know it.”But there is room for the U.S. to give North Korea something on military exercises. In past efforts to open talks with North Korea, the U.S. has varied the number of troops involved, the types of exercises undertaken and the types of bombers flown. For one year, under President George H.W. Bush, the U.S. and South Korea suspended the exercises.“Sometimes [the North Koreans] say cancel the exercises,” Wit said. “But they just don’t want us to hold big exercises.”He says the U.S. should make public changes to the military exercises as part of talks to get the North Koreans to agree to a moratorium on their nuclear and missile tests.Initial talks are not going to result in the North giving up its nuclear program immediately, although the program should be on the table during formal talks. The program gives North Korea intense leverage in talks with the U.S. and provides a level of security not had by dead dictators Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, who once sought nuclear weapons and met grisly deaths after U.S.-backed wars leveled their regimes. Obtaining a moratorium on tests would be a big step, but almost everyone agrees the final goal of the U.S. is and should continue to be the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.“It would be a really serious mistake to drop the objective, the long-term objective, of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,” Wit said. “I think the North Koreans would eventually agree to that.”Getting to a nuclear-free peninsula, however, would require big steps that are not normally discussed in U.S. politics. That would including providing North Korea with a more permanent security guarantee by agreeing to negotiate a peace treaty to replace the Korean War armistice.“I think people ought to start thinking about [a peace treaty] because the reason why 1994 and 2005 [deals] fell apart is we didn’t do anything about the larger steps of ending enmity,” Sigal said.Ending enmity and hostility may be the only way to stop North Korea from being a permanent nuclear power. But that may be all pie in the sky, particularly with the disorganized, understaffed, inexperienced and undiplomatic Trump administration running the show. Not to mention the North’s insularity, intransigence and history of breaking deals.Not everyone thinks that negotiations will work, of course. Kelly argues the U.S. should maintain President Barack Obama’s policy of “strategic patience.” He says the U.S. should tighten sanctions, go after North Korean money in Chinese banks and increase funding for missile defense. He also supports talking to the North Koreans, even if they’ve cheated on deals in the past. But he adds, “The best possible outcome is that the North Koreans come to the table and they negotiate away their nuclear missile program for something reasonable. That’s just not going to happen. They’ll ask for outrageous concessions that we’re not going to give them.”Sigal believes that it’s just too late in the process to wait on sanctions before starting negotiations. “I think the fundamental question that has to be asked to the people who are talking about sanctions is how long it will take and how many ICBMs, nuclear weapons and better nuke weapons will the North have in the meantime. I think that’s fundamental here. We don’t have a lot of time.”Jessica Schulberg contributed reporting."

The program gives North Korea intense leverage in talks with the U.S. and provides a level of security not had by dead dictators Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, who once sought nuclear weapons and met grisly deaths after U.S.-backed wars leveled their regimes. Obtaining a moratorium on tests would be a big step, but almost everyone agrees the final goal of the U.S. is and should continue to be the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.“It would be a really serious mistake to drop the objective, the long-term objective, of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,” Wit said. “I think the North Koreans would eventually agree to that.”Getting to a nuclear-free peninsula, however, would require big steps that are not normally discussed in U.S. politics. That would including providing North Korea with a more permanent security guarantee by agreeing to negotiate a peace treaty to replace the Korean War armistice.“I think people ought to start thinking about [a peace treaty] because the reason why 1994 and 2005 [deals] fell apart is we didn’t do anything about the larger steps of ending enmity,” Sigal said.Ending enmity and hostility may be the only way to stop North Korea from being a permanent nuclear power. But that may be all pie in the sky, particularly with the disorganized, understaffed, inexperienced and undiplomatic Trump administration running the show. Not to mention the North’s insularity, intransigence and history of breaking deals.Not everyone thinks that negotiations will work, of course. Kelly argues the U.S. should maintain President Barack Obama’s policy of “strategic patience.” He says the U.S. should tighten sanctions, go after North Korean money in Chinese banks and increase funding for missile defense. He also supports talking to the North Koreans, even if they’ve cheated on deals in the past. But he adds, “The best possible outcome is that the North Koreans come to the table and they negotiate away their nuclear missile program for something reasonable. That’s just not going to happen. They’ll ask for outrageous concessions that we’re not going to give them.”Sigal believes that it’s just too late in the process to wait on sanctions before starting negotiations. “I think the fundamental question that has to be asked to the people who are talking about sanctions is how long it will take and how many ICBMs, nuclear weapons and better nuke weapons will the North have in the meantime. I think that’s fundamental here. We don’t have a lot of time.”Jessica Schulberg contributed reporting."

It’s a national emergency,” he told reporters Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, following a lunch with Vice President Mike Pence.“We’re going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis,” he continued, adding that he was “drawing documents now” to make the official declaration.According to Price, Trump did not think the situation required an official emergency declaration, an action which would allow him to allocate additional government resources to fighting the epidemic.“We believe that at this point that the resources that we need or the focus that we need to bring to bear to the opioid crisis at this point can be addressed without the declaration of an emergency,” Price said Tuesday, following the meeting.Experts have said it is unclear how a national emergency designation would work in this case, since it is a long-term public health issue. The act of declaring a national emergency is typically applied to short-term epidemics and natural disasters."

This “nasty” creature ― the croc, not Lemmy ― lurked in shallow waters, where it “would have been one of the biggest coastal predators of its time,” University of Edinburgh paleontologist Michela Johnson was quoted as saying. While many of its telosaur relatives developed long snouts and thin teeth for catching and eating fish, Lemmysuchus went in its own direction. The creature’s 3-foot-long skull evolved to have a broad snout and large teeth to crush the shells of turtles and other prey, the museum said.Lemmy may not have crushed turtle shells, but he was certainly known for his bone-shaking bass lines. Although the croc specimen was found a century ago, it was incorrectly cataloged at the time. A more recent look at the fossils revealed a previously unknown creature, and that meant it needed a new name. “As a long-standing Motorhead fan, I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to immortalize the rock star in this way,” Steel told the BBC."

She called Southwest.“I had a lot of items in the suitcase that I needed and wanted for chemotherapy,” Hurt told CBS Pittsburgh. “One of them was medication. But many of them were personal items to me. I just started getting very emotional, and I started to cry.”Hurt was on the line with Sarah Rowan, a Southwest customer service agent who’s been with the airline for just six months.

Kick that cancer’s BUTT!”Turns out the bag had arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport around 2 a.m., when airport couriers were already off for the night, according to ABC News. Knowing that Hurt’s bag had no other chance of reaching her before the chemo appointment, Rowan looked up Hurt’s address and drove it to Hurt’s home when she ended her shift. “I looked up her address, and it was about 25 minutes from where I live,” Rowan told HuffPost. “Me getting the bag to her was more important than getting into bed half an hour earlier.”Hurt wrote on Facebook that she cried when she read Rowan’s note. “My father passed away from effects of chemo, so I know in that situation things aren’t easy,” Rowan said. “I know how much little things mean to people when things are already going so rough.”Southwest applauded Rowan’s efforts.“We are very proud of Sarah’s kind, compassionate actions that represent the best of Southwest Hospitality and the legendary customer service that our wonderful employees aim to deliver every day,” a company spokesman told HuffPost in a statement.Both of these women are just plane incredible."

(Read more here on how CRISPR works and its potential for humans.)Those virus-free cells were then used to fertilize several pig embryos, which were implanted in sows who have since given birth to virus-free pigs.It’s a huge step, as those viruses (more specifically known as porcine endogenous retroviruses, or PERVs) pose a not-yet-fully-understood ― but potentially significant ― health threat to humans.In a clinical trial in Europe, for example, researchers genetically modified a similar retrovirus from mice to help treat severe immunodeficiency in children. Most of the children benefited from the treatment, notes the Food and Drug Administration, but some developed leukemia.In other words, we don’t need to know the exact effects of the viruses to know we don’t want them around.Creating PERV-free pigs is the first step in a four-step process to ultimately create pig organs suitable for human transplant or “xenotransplantation,” Dr. Luhan Yang, a co-founder of eGenesis and the company’s chief science officer, explained to HuffPost.(Doctors have long used pig and cow valves to replace their leaky equivalents in the human heart, but kidneys and more complex organs represent a much bigger achievement.)Next, the company needs to make sure it can consistently replicate virus-free pigs, which it’s already well on its way to doing.After that, Yang explained, it will need to test how the human immune system responds to the organs and modify them so they aren’t rejected, creating what she referred to as “pig 2.0,” featuring “advanced immune compatibility.”Step four will be developing the infrastructure to produce and deliver lifesaving organs worldwide.Yang didn’t want to speculate on a precise timeline for when xenotransplantation might be a common procedure, but the company is making very real, tangible progress toward that goal.Other promising technologies in development include 3D-printing organs and growing them in a petri dish.In the United States alone, almost 117,000 people are currently awaiting a lifesaving organ transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. About 60 percent of transplant operations since 1988 have been for a kidney (which has an average wait time of five years), 22 percent a liver (wait time: 11 months), 10 percent a heart (four months), and 5 percent a lung (four months).

With many still unaccounted for, the IOM believes up to 50 may have died. “The survivors told our colleagues on the beach that the smuggler pushed them to the sea, when he saw some ‘authority types’ near the coast,” Laurent de Boeck, the IOM Yemen chief of mission, said in a statement from the U.N.Many of those thrown overboard were children, with the average age of passengers being 16. “This is shocking and inhumane,” de Boeck continued. “The suffering of migrants on this migration route is enormous. Too many young people pay smugglers with the false hope of a better future.” Survivors told de Boeck and other U.N. staffers that the smuggler returned to Somalia to pick up more migrants, Those on board were escaping strife in Ethiopia and Somalia with the hope of reaching countries in the Gulf region through Yemen, a nation suffering through its own brutal conflict.
