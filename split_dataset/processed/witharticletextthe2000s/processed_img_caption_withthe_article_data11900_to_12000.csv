Honeycutt, ContributorMoms Across America Executive Director",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-the-ground-of-standing-rock_us_583b2429e4b0a79f7433b78a,"The day after Thanksgiving, the Army Corps of Engineers gave an eviction notice, December 5, 2016, to the largest gathering",2016-11-27,<p>Thanksgiving Day prayer at Turtle Rock ancestral burial grounds.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583b2b601700001b00e7c735.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The day after Thanksgiving, the Army Corps of Engineers gave an eviction notice, December 5, 2016, to the largest gathering of Native Americans and supporters in recorded history. Concerns for escalated violence are high.On Sunday, November 20, 2016, I experienced first hand the intense pain of tear gas as I supported an event at a barricade on the bridge by Oceti Sakowin Camp. I saw hundreds of people being doused with water by a water cannon on top of a military vehicle and dozens more doused with fire hoses in below-freezing temperatures as they protected their campfire which was built to prevent them from getting hypothermia. All around me and before me, dozens were shot with rubber bullets, compression grenades, and countless more were sprayed with mace by the Morton County Police. Throughout the twelve hour, overnight confrontation, I also witnessed extraordinary acts of restraint and commitment. An elder chanted and stepped side to side in prayer for hours despite being repeatedly sprayed with freezing water. Native American men rushed through tall grasses on the riverside to put out fires started by the tear gas grenades with their own bodies. Water protectors chanted ""Mni Wiconi, Water is Life!"" repeatedly, despite having their sisters shot in the head and their men shot in the groin with rubber bullets beside them. My heart broke, however, when I saw the young adults who formed a human wall for hours to protect their campfire, fall to the ground when the police shot them with rubber bullets. Later, I learned a young woman had her arm amputated after the damage done by a compression grenade. Another young woman has lost the use of her eye. 40 people were arrested the day after Thanksgiving at a peaceful prayer event, the total count is well over 400, for exercising their right of free speech. The police brutality at Standing Rock has shocked the world and yet the greed of the corporations, who will stop at nothing to increase their profits, surprises no one. Americans are realizing that the new patriotism is not to blindly chant how great America is, but to speak up, show up, and stand up to the horrific tragedies our government is willfully causing.Today, ten thousand strong people are at the main camp, Oceti Sakowin in Standing Rock, North Dakota. Never before has there been such a gathering to stop a pipeline, not only in the terms of sheer numbers of people but the significance of people as well. Groups from all over the world, including Japan, New Zealand, Hawaii, and over 300 indigenous tribes, many of them sworn enemies, have come together peacefully to pray and stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. Pipelines are nothing new. 72,000 miles of crude oil pipelines cross rivers and residential areas across the USA. This pipeline, however, gained national interest when LaDonnah Brave Bull Allard and seven Sioux Nation Native Americans noticed that the pipeline was re-routed from a white neighborhood above Bismark to their treaty land. The pipeline would go beneath the Missouri River and near seven different points of water, above their reservation, and through ancestral burial grounds. The pipeline has never gone through the proper environmental or cultural assessments and was never given permission to go through the Sioux nation 1851 Fort Laramie treaty land, which is being cared for by the Army Corps of Engineers. When LaDonnah made the request for support to help stop the pipeline she ""thought maybe forty people would show up."" Instead, thousands are flocking to the site, raising awareness with international media. Non-native and native alike are selling their homes to move to Standing Rock in solidarity. Florence, Cheyenne Sioux River mother of Kalen, a 17-year-old young man who was one of the original seven campers at Sacred Stone Camp in Standing Rock said, ""We should listen to our young people more. My son and six others began this with silent prayer and signs. That's it. They always intended this to be prayerful, not violent."" The reports of demonstrations escalating to violence have not deterred supporters, however, arrivals with women and children are only increasing.Their fervor is warranted. The Missouri River is upstream from 20 million people who stand to have their main water source polluted beyond repair. Dallas Goldtooth stated, ""It is not a matter of if, but when the pipeline will break."" The website DAPLLies.com clearly shows the devastating impact that oil spills have on the health of the people downstream: tumors, leukemia, miscarriages and more. Over 300 pipeline breaks are recorded each year, spilling over 300 million gallons of oil into water and land, causing billions of dollars of clean up and years of toxic pollution. John Bolenbaugh, producer of DAPLLies stated Wednesday night at Standing Rock, ""The same companies who create the pipelines are also the same companies hired to clean up the spills, with federal funding, so they often ignore the reports of cracks in pipelines for years and wait for them to break. Then they cut corners, instead of cleaning up the oil. They cover the spills with mesh and grass seeds.""The majority of the people flocking to Standing Rock or donating ten, twenty or a hundred dollars are not driven only by the above atrocities. There is a deeper drive of injustice. Millions of Americans have realized over the past few years, that corporations are bullying and bribing our government to put the profits of corporations before the wellbeing of our children and citizens. We live in a nation that puts wealth before health. The result is a country full of sick children, ailing loved ones and angry citizens. Pennsylvania mother Zoe Swartz said of GMOs and pesticides on our food, sprayed with chemical cocktails which contain petroleum, ""A chemical company's right to make a profit in no way surpasses a mother's right to protect her child."" Apparently, Obama and the Governor of North Dakota do not agree, however. With one phone call, either of them could stop the pipeline and police brutality, which is happening at Standing Rock.To find out more about Standing Rock or to donate go to www.ocetisakowincamp.org.

1,POLITICS,Afghanistan Is All Ready To Be Donald Trump's First Foreign Policy Disaster,David Wood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistan-war-taliban_us_581cb5aee4b0d9ce6fbb71ff,The next president has tough choices to make as Taliban forces push forward.,2016-11-27,"U.S. military advisers link up with Afghan security forces near Tarin Kowt, where there has been sustained fighting with Taliban insurgents.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581cc557150000d804531c0f.jpeg?cache=nde9fDawkU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Afghanistan is failing. Fifteen years after the United States first scattered the Taliban with high-altitude bombing, the battlefield gains achieved by tens of thousands of U.S. troops are in jeopardy from a resurgent Taliban. The United States has spent $115 billion on this longest war in its history. The conflict has taken the lives of 1,865 Americans and wounded 20,224 (as of Nov. 16), many with life-shattering injuries. Yet the main goals set forth by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama haven’t been achieved: Afghanistan does not have a stable, working democracy and terrorists still find a safe haven there.Even stalwart defenders of the U.S. intervention, such as Vice President Joe Biden, now seem deeply concerned.But few people in the U.S. are paying attention.The 15th anniversary of the start of the war passed last month almost without notice. The stark choices facing President-elect Donald Trump ― more troops? more money? withdrawal? ― received no attention in the presidential campaign, an ill omen for the months ahead when careful and considered action will be needed.And time is short.Major cities across Afghanistan are under siege by the Taliban and other Islamic extremist militias, which are steadily taking more territory.In their path, the U.S. has some 7,000 U.S. troops training and advising Afghan forces, and another 6,000 mostly special forces members engaged in counter-terrorism operations.  Last week, two soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division ― Sgt. John W. Perry, 30, of Stockton, California, and Pfc. Tyler Iubelt, 20, of Tamaroa, Illinois ― were killed by a suicide bomber at Bagram, the main U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Two American contractors, not identified by the Defense Department, died as well, and 17 people were wounded. Also at risk are tens of thousands of Afghans, especially women and children, who have relied on the U.S. commitment to help safeguard what progress they have made in self-government, human rights and education. In growing violence, 30 people were killed Monday and more than 70 injured in a bomb blast at a Kabul mosque. The Islamic State claimed responsibility.Little is known about Trump’s views on Afghanistan, although he has suggested that building schools there is a waste of money. In his most detailed comments, he declared in 2012 that the U.S. intervention is “a total and complete disaster.”It likely will be months before the Trump White House can shift from such criticism toward a coherent strategy for Afghanistan.The Afghan military and police have been unable to reverse the insurgents’ gains, despite the $68 billion spent by the U.S. trying to build up the country’s security forces. The Afghan army loses a third of its soldiers every year between battle casualties, desertions and those who decline to re-enlist. Officials reportedly pocket the pay of legions of non-existent “ghost soldiers.”The Taliban “continue to expand their influence,” the Pentagon acknowledged this fall. U.S. Army Gen. John Nicholson, the senior commander in Afghanistan, told reporters in July that the overstretched Afghan army has basically conceded parts of the country to the Taliban.The most recent data provided by the Pentagon to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction show that among the country’s 407 districts, the number controlled by the government slipped from 267 in May to 258 in August. The Taliban controls only eight districts and influences another 25, according to the Pentagon data. But a new independent analysis found worse news: The Taliban actually controls or influences 97 districts, up from 70 a year ago.It is from these districts that insurgents have been able to launch serious and continuing assaults on five provincial capitals: Kunduz in the north, Maimana in the northwest, Tarin Kowt in the southeast, Farah city in the west and Lashkar Gah in the south.The northeast city of Gormach, a vital post on the strategic Ring Road that links a number of major cities, was overrun this fall. Kunduz, where U.S. and allied troops spent years training security forces and helping stabilize the local economy and government, has been overrun twice. This fall, hasty reinforcements of Afghan special forces in Kunduz and Lashkar Gah, aided by U.S. airstrikes and U.S. special forces, narrowly beat back determined Taliban attacks. Rebel forces remain on the outskirts of those cities and sporadic fighting continues.And in the western city of Mazar e-Sharif, site of a major German and U.S. military base, the German consulate was hurriedly evacuated last week after Taliban fighters attacked with a massive truck bomb, killing four Afghans and wounding 128. Local corruption, ethnic squabbling and inept officials have eroded the population’s faith in their government and effectively provided the Taliban with safe bases from which to continue their attacks, according to an analysis by two U.S. Army officers who served in Kunduz.The latest Taliban gains, even if temporary, have further shaken the people’s trust. Forty-two percent of Afghans say security is worse than it was under Taliban rule in the 1990s, according to the latest United Nations report. The number of refugees fleeing to Europe has increased 83 percent this year.As the war grinds on, violence has intensified to horrifying levels and civilians are increasingly the victims. The new Afghan air force alone is responsible for a 72 percent increase in civilian casualties since 2015, the U.N. said. Suicide bomb blasts in July, also the work of Islamic State terrorists, killed 85 peaceful demonstrators and injured 413, in what the U.N. called the single most deadly incident in the country since 2001. And the number of dead and injured children has risen 15 percent this year, as the Taliban has attacked schools and health clinics.“For God sake, don’t kill innocent Afghans,” an elderly widow from Kunduz, Bibi Gul, told the Pajhwok Afghan News. She had lost her 35-year-old son in the fighting. Stop the war, she begged, “or kill us all together to end our plight forever.”People are scared, said Patricia Gossman, senior Afghanistan analyst for Human Rights Watch. “There are gains [by the Taliban], and now the attitude is, ‘We have to push them back regardless of the cost.’”“It’s pretty grim,” she added. Gossman has been visiting and studying Afghanistan since the early 1990s.Against these daunting problems, the national government’s awkward political power-sharing arrangement, brokered by the U.S. in 2014, has devolved into squabbling. In August, one chief executive declared the other “unfit” to lead the country. Systemic corruption continues to undermine attempts at reform, and opium production is skyrocketing.“I regret there’s still real problems in Afghanistan,” Biden told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Oct. 16. But with U.S. forces currently engaged in Iraq and Syria, he added, “there has to be a sense of humility about what is able to be done at the time.”Yet some military and foreign policy experts argue that the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, with its goal of a stable nation free of extremists, is not a lost cause yet. A “surge” of U.S. troop reinforcements would certainly help, some argue, and even at current levels, U.S. military advisers in Afghanistan could be given more leeway to engage directly in combat. For many who have served there, the bottom line is this: The United States cannot abandon those Afghans who were promised that the U.S. would stand by them.Retired Marine Gen. John Allen, who commanded U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013, is one who argues that Afghanistan is not “ready to go over the edge,” even though it might appear so from a distance. “I know from personal experience that Afghanistan always looks better close up,” he told The Huffington Post.Allen cited the increase in life expectancy for Afghans, from 53 years in 1996 to 60.5 years today, as one hopeful sign that foreign investment in Afghanistan’s schools and health clinics is having an effect.The retired general said the Obama administration’s decision to reduce U.S. forces in Afghanistan ― and to announce the timetable for the withdrawals ― damaged the American effort there. “That’s been hard to overcome,” he said. “Our words say we are committed; our actions do not.” “But that’s water under the bridge,” Allen added.Can Afghanistan’s slide toward failure be arrested?John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, is in essence a congressionally mandated gumshoe looking over U.S. efforts. In an October report to lawmakers, he wrote that “systemic corruption, aggravated by floods of aid money, undermined the U.S. mission in Afghanistan from the outset and, unless effectively checked, will continue to undermine progress and could ultimately result in mission failure.”“I’m cautiously optimistic,” he told HuffPost from Afghanistan, adding that he is “impressed at the hard work being done by Afghans in civil society, media and top leadership.”“But much more remains to be done,” Sopko said.The new administration should give the nation’s top Afghanistan experts 90 days, Allen suggested, to come up with a plan to bolster that nation’s security, economy and government performance. (He talked to The Huffington Post several days before the election and was not speaking specifically of Trump.)Perhaps the one clearly wrong decision would be for Trump to put Afghanistan on the backburner. “Our hard-won successes are in the balance,” Sopko said.And the Taliban advance.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

3,WEIRD NEWS,Homeless Man Rents Out Beds In 'Paradise' Home Under L.A.

(The toilets, he says, rely on plastic bags to collect the waste.)There’s also a canopy bed, living room set, zebra-print blankets and sheets and a tent lined with pillows and blankets that has a “FOR RENT” sign attached. Waddell said he rents out his spare beds for about $25 a week or $10 a night.A later video shot by Fox 11 News shows that the space has a small shower as well.It’s not clear who shot the video. The woman who shared it on Facebook on Nov. 3 could not immediately be reached.According to the Los Angeles Times, fans of Waddell’s handiwork have since gathered to take selfies before his compound. Waddell told the paper that he’s enjoyed “the hype” over his decorating skills but otherwise doesn’t understand the public’s fascination with his outdoor residence.“I refuse to let the city beat me down to what they think a homeless person’s profile is, living on cardboard,” he told the newspaper.According to the Times, Waddell has lived beneath the freeway for the last six months. During that time, the city’s sanitation crews have dismantled his compound several times, he said.During one recent instance, after the video was posted on social media, crews removed a refrigerator they described as packed with an “abundance of rotting food.” They also removed “explosive materials,” a sanitation spokeswoman told the paper.It’s not clear how much of the camp remains beneath the freeway today. The city’s homeless services authority could not immediately be reached for comment.Bureau of Sanitation spokeswoman Elena Stern told The Times that the city has offered Waddell homeless services, including temporary housing, but he’s refused.Waddell, however, told the paper that he indeed wants housing. He further acknowledged the dangers of living beneath an overpass and shared that he was once robbed at gunpoint in his bed.Los Angeles has the second-highest population of homeless individuals of U.S. cities, with about 43,800 people reported homeless, according to a report released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development this month.The city’s Homeless Services Authority offers a number of resources to homeless individuals and families, including emergency services and transportation, shelter referrals and outreach services, according to its website."
4,SPORTS,English Soccer's Governing Body Launches Child Sexual Abuse Inquiry,"Steve Tongue, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/england-soccer-child-sex-abuse_us_583adb8fe4b09b605600cf27,It will examine allegations of children being sexually abused at professional soccer clubs.,2016-11-27,"Former Crewe Alexandra player Andy Woodward claims he was molested as a boy by talent spotter and convicted pedophile Barry Bennell, pictured.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583adc7b1700002600e7c6d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON (Reuters) - The English Football Association (FA) has launched an internal review to examine allegations of children being sexually abused at professional soccer clubs.English soccer’s governing body said on Sunday that it had appointed Kate Gallafent QC as leading independent counsel to oversee its investigation after former soccer players told British media on Friday that they were sexually abused as children at English clubs.British police are already investigating mounting accusations of pedophile activity in youth teams, which victims say has gone unreported for decades.After accusations this month from former Crewe Alexandra player Andy Woodward, saying he was molested as a boy by talent spotter and convicted pedophile Barry Bennell, other former youth players have gone public with allegations.Fourth-tier Crewe are looking into the allegations, while Premier League Manchester City are investigating whether Bennell had any association with the club. Bennell has made no public comment on the allegations.The FA’s internal review will look into what information the association and clubs were aware of at the time of the alleged offenses and what action was or should have been taken.Former Manchester City youth team player Jason Dunford was one of four former players who waived their anonymity to appear in a BBC television program on Friday to say they were abused by Bennell.A statement from Manchester City on Thursday said: “The club is aware of allegations that Barry Bennell had an association with Manchester City Football Club in the 1980s. As a result, the club is currently undertaking a thorough investigation of any past links he might have had with the organization.”Crewe issued a statement on Tuesday after Woodward’s allegations. “When things come out of the blue like this, you first want to make inquiries and reflect from within. That is the process we started last week,” the club said.SAFETY PROCEDURESThe FA said last week that criminal record checks were required for all individuals working with children and more than 35,000 people went through an awareness workshop or tailored training every season.On Sunday the FA said that the Child Protection in Sport Unit, which has assisted the association with its safeguarding procedures since 2000, will also carry out an independent audit of the FA’s current practices.A statement from Cheshire police in northwest England said that allegations had been made against “more than one individual” in relation to past abuse of young footballers. London’s Metropolitan Police said on Friday that it had received information relating to “non-recent sexual abuse in soccer clubs in London”. Police in Hampshire also said they were investigating a case of child sex abuse within soccer.Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA), said on Friday that the sport had to respond to the allegations. “The police need to be at the vanguard of investigations, because these are criminal acts, but soccer has a duty of care and must also grasp the nettle and take responsibility,” he said in a telephone interview with Reuters.“What we don’t want is people thinking they couldn’t let their youngster go into soccer, when the positives can outweigh the negatives by so much.”Bennell served three years in a U.S. prison for the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old British boy while on a soccer tour of Florida in 1994 and was jailed for nine years in Britain in 1998 after pleading guilty to 23 specimen charges of abuse.In 2015 the same British court found Bennell guilty of four counts relating to the sexual abuse of boys.The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said it received 50 calls within two hours of setting up a hotline on Thursday.(Additional reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Robin Pomeroy, Ken Ferris and David Goodman)"

Like Nixon, Trump is vulgar, thin-skinned, programmed to attack his detractors, and a smooth liar when it serves his interest. Both men felt the sting of an establishment that rejected them.Trump acknowledged his link with Nixon when he began his campaign in 2015 by calling for the “Silent Majority” to rise again, a reference to a famous 1969 speech by President Nixon. And, clearly Trump took a page from Nixon’s campaign strategy by appealing to prejudices and fears to energize voters who felt they were losing their privileged place in the American hierarchy. These similarities in their psychological makeup pose a real danger for Mr. Trump and the nation. Nixon won reelection in a landslide in 1972, yet two years later he was forced to resign in disgrace, mostly due to flaws in his personality.So, here are some cautions for our next president taken from the hard-fought wars of Watergate:1. Don’t Lie To The American People. This was the core lesson of Watergate. Facts and words will mean something to the country and the Congress after Trump takes the oath on Inauguration Day. What he says will no longer be a matter of campaign rhetoric where truth was stretched or ignored.Had he not lied instead of stonewalling and covering-up, Nixon could have saved his presidency after the Watergate break-in.Mr. Trump must be unfailingly honest to avoid falling into the trap that brought down Nixon.2. Be On Guard Against Isolation. The presidency is the world’s loneliest job. At the very top of a huge governmental bureaucracy, a president ironically sits in an office that fosters extreme remoteness and fosters an echo chamber where he hears only an echo of his own views and words that flatter him.Nixon’s inner-circle tightly controlled access to him. Worse, during the Watergate crisis, they limited the information he got and withheld critical facts, including, for example, that Ehrlichman had approved the break-in of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’s office.Unquestionably intelligent men, their inexperience in government and acceptance of Nixon’s philosophy that the ends justified the means doomed the Nixon presidency. Trump needs to find ways to listen to voices outside his family and closest advisors.3. Don’t Seek Revenge for Every Perceived Slight. The drive for revenge was probably Richard Nixon’s greatest flaw. He had an enemies list and his tapes reveal a man whose actions were often motivated by an overpowering need for personal vengeance.Nixon regularly banned reporters who worked for major news outlets from the White House if he read what he considered to be a disparaging story in his morning press briefings.As a private citizen, Mr. Trump has made extensive use of the courts and Twitter to get back at people he believed crossed him. Reports are that, had he lost, he planned to spend $20 million in a “Revenge Super PAC” to get even with Republican rivals.Mr. Trump will need to battle against this Nixonian bent to seek retribution.4. Hire A Strong White House Counsel. Mr. Trump needs a White House Counsel who is experienced and willing to risk his or her position by telling the unvarnished truth.Further, it is imperative that there be attorneys in this office who are experts in the criminal law, ethics and conflicts of interest.As a non-lawyer, Mr. Trump needs to understand that White House Counsel represents the Office of the President, not the individual in the office. Ethically, White House Counsel must protect the Office, sometimes from the very person running it.John W. Dean, Nixon’s White House Counsel, admitted that one of the reasons Watergate bloomed into scandal was his own youth and unfamiliarity with federal criminal laws, like obstruction of justice. To his credit, Dean finally came to see the problem and warned Nixon of a cancer growing on his presidency, but by then it was too late.It remains to be seen if Don McGahn, an election law specialist who advised Trump during the campaign, seemingly missing many conflicts of interest and foundation self-dealing violations, fits the bill.5. Have A Presidential Historian on Staff. Mr. Trump, who seems to have spent little time studying American history and the presidency, would benefit from adding a presidential historian to his White House staff.Such an advisor can remind him of how other presidents have successfully dealt with crises, and where they have failed and why.History does not need to truly repeat itself, but personalities and biases do. Mr. Trump can avoid the blunders that resulted in President Nixon’s resignation, but only if he recognizes and guards against his Nixonian predisposition.Jill Wine-Banks (formerly Wine Volner) was a Watergate prosecutor, known for her cross-examination of President Nixon’s secretary Rose Mary Woods.

You're appointment was 45 minutes ago Angeline!"" Startled out of my relaxation, I look up from my pedicure to see a male tech rushing with excitement and a waving index finger to greet my friend and her Mother, 2 women who I thought I would be having dinner with later this evening. As Angeline, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, and her Mother greet him with air kisses, I am struck by what a beauty her Mother is and how she looks more like her sister than old enough to be Angeline's Mother. I wave her over to me. Thinking I still had time before our chat, and remembering I had texted her where I was going, Angeline reminds me that her time is limited and every second in her day counts so they decided to come meet me.Let me preface this by saying that people in my life find what I do fascinating. As a writer, I find very few that do not want their story told and more often than not, would like me to have theirs heard. My Grandmother used to say, ""Cada mente es un mundo"". Translation, ""Every mind is its own world"" meaning, everyone has their own version of the world they live in as everyone's lives are different.This is Angeline and she manages her Mothers Companion Business while she is a fulltime Medical Student. ""My Mother and I came from Spain when I was 5 years old and she was 22. Neither of us spoke English, but my Mother was determined for us to live the American dream, one way or another. I started school, and as I learned the English language, so would she. I would come home and teach my Mother what I had learned in school that day. She was my Mother and I was her teacher.""Angeline says that her Mother worked as seamstress at a local cleaners making minimum wage. ""Most nights she would bring clothes to work on at home"" says Angeline noting that her Mother's employer imposed this work on her to keep up with the supply and demand of the skill only she could provide. Work ""detailed enough to pass for stitching found on couture garments"" their high end clientele would say. Masterly refined work her Mother was providing on a minimum wage paycheck.Angeline says that her Mother was first approached to be a companion by a 60 year old man who was taken with the Spanish beauty when she was 25 years old. ""My Mother was embarrassed that this man wanted to pay for her time, remembering her Mother telling her ""Vas a crecer y vas a encontrar hombres como el, tienes que tener cuidado Angeline. Tu cuerpo no esta de venta."" Translation, ""When you grow up, you have to be careful of men like this man. Your body is not for sale."" And stressing that the American Dream was more fruitful with an education.So when her Mother decided to embark on her new journey as a Business Companion, she kept Angeline in the dark about her new career.Her Mother, says Angeline, ""Was afraid I would have thought less of her for the choices she made, but to the contrary, I'm proud to be her daughter."" Angeline says that her Mother has been in 3 porn movies and ""half the money was a down payment on the home we've lived in for 20 years and the other half was put away for my education"" stressing that what her Mother charged as a companion was not only with the intent on providing a better life, but also to provide a better future for the 2 of them. She goes on to say that her Mother ""Never traded sex for a roof over their head, she traded ""services"" for MONEY to provide more than just a home and food"" as Angeline never wanted or needed for anything.  She says her Mother has cornered the market on services provided to men 55 years old and older. Older men who have no interest in having children at their age but still want a companion young enough to flaunt and have money to do so with. And at 42 year old, Angeline's Mother is a richly experienced companion who has traveled a not so long road to know her worth and now holds private seminars teaching women over 30 years old to be Business Companions, for a fee, to the older generation of Sugar Daddies. And in what little free time Angeline has, she manages her Mother's business. ""This is about survival Lisi, not taking advantage of men. Some girls who are in their twenties are discarded after they turn a certain age because they're not considered ""fresh"" anymore by their lovers."" Angeline says that they have found that women over the age of 30 are sometimes seen as not ""as sexy"" as someone in their twenties is. So why not cater to men of a certain age who would appreciate what an experienced woman brings to the table, offering a place of appreciation for everyone. Hmmmm I think to myself.Still wondering about the profound advice Angeline's Mother imparted upon her about her body not being for sale, did Angeline ever think about traveling the same path? Did her friends, when she was growing up, know WHAT her Mother did for a living, was she embarrassed by her Mother? Ah, so many questions, so little time! ""My Mother always fed me first, she would let me eat until I was full, ONLY THEN would she eat what was left. I remember going from our fridge with just enough food to being driven around with a Real Estate agent looking at homes for sale in gated communities. No, it has never crossed my mind as THAT has NEVER been an option for me. She has done what she felt she had to do to give me a better life because she wanted to. Why would I be embarrassed by that? No. Yes, my 3 closest friends know what she did for a living and it wasn't a big deal."" Angeline says that her Mother never missed any of her basketball or soccer games as she was an involved Mother in everything from A to Z where Angeline was concerned.As Angeline steps away to take a quick phone call, her Mother comes and sits next to me and asks if she can have a word with me. ""Of course"" I say. ""You know, I have no regrets but one, about anything I have done in my life because it has provided a better one for Angeline. The one regret is that I don't have an education past the 9th grade so that put me in a position to HAVE to do WHAT I HAD to do for myself and my child. I wanted her to tell YOU Lisi our story because I'm not the ONLY Mother out there doing what needs to be done for their children, and I want people to know that ""This apple"" she says pointing to Angeline, ""fell far away from the tree."" Her Mother continues, ""Because I do what I do doesn't mean Angeline will follow in my footsteps. I never wanted her to be under ANYONE'S thumb like I was when I was young and left my country. Her education is what will keep that from happening."" Later at dinner, in between laughter and tears that were shared by the 3 of us, I find that Angeline's Mother and I have so much in common. Yes she has been in porn, but that doesn't take away from her being the best Mother she could be and if doing something she advised her daughter against doing is what has built a foundation to a better future for them both? Who am I to judge! Our values and our only the best of wishes for our children is what has connected us and I feel like they have welcomed me into their small but mighty family. I would like Angeline's Mother to know that she is not defined by WHAT she has done for a living, but rather defined by WHO she has been to her daughter. A Mother who would do what she had to do so her daughter could live the American dream. And after having spent these few but memorable hours with the 2 of them I would say I now know Angeline didn't fall far from the tree. Having known her for 5 years, I was always impressed with how level headed she was. She's pretty terrific and now I know why. "
14,BUSINESS,3 Facts About Email Marketing That Make or Break Campaigns,"George Beall, ContributorStartup founder, investor, and advisor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-facts-about-email-marke_b_13270564.html,,2016-11-27,2016-11-27-1480271849-4302605-modelosdeemailmarketing4.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-27-1480271849-4302605-modelosdeemailmarketing4-thumb.jpg,"Does your brand obsess over marketing? Good. Does your marketing team constantly try to stay up to date and fresh with their marketing? Great. Do they tend to abandon older technologies, and assume that they're obsolete? Hold up. American adults spend, on average, around 11 hours looking at screens a day. Over 20% of those people admit going online ""almost constantly,"" according to Pew Research - and it's no surprise that the younger the person, the more time they spend online, with 36% of 18-29 year spending more than double the time of those 65 and older. So what are those people doing, and how can your brand reach them? The answer is email. Overall, 58% of online consumers check email as their first online activity of the day, followed by a search engine or portal site (20%), and Facebook (11%). Over 215 billion emails are sent every day. There's a reason why email marketing has a 3800% ROI, resulting in about $38 for every $1 invested. So how can you master your brand's email marketing campaign? We asked the team at VerticalResponse, the leading email marketing platform, whose users sent around 100 million emails in 2016 - here are the top three guiding trends to keep in mind when developing an email marketing plan: Brace for Q4: Email Density and Intensity Peak  The fourth quarter always dwarfs the others in number of emails sent, and often approaches double the amount of emails sent in the third quarter. While it's not hard to guess that these are due to all of the holiday shopping emails, there's a piece of good news that many overlook: open rates in the fourth quarter are 6 percent, which is the second highest rate of the year. Your consumers are actually looking at those emails!Days of the Week and Holidays Play a Role in Success  If you examine your own behavior, it's no secret that the day of the week determines our activities, and habits can be completely disrupted by a holiday. As an example, the number of emails in October peaks on Thursday and Friday. However, in November, the highest-trafficked day is almost always Monday, as usage skyrockets on Cyber Monday. While the average is somewhat distorted, because of the activity that day, the statistic stands. In December, Tuesdays and Thursdays see the busiest email traffic, with, unsurprisingly, the two weeks before Christmas showing the highest numbers as last minute sales are pushed out. Throughout the entire fourth quarter, VerticalResponse customers send the fewest emails on Saturday and Sunday - they're out shopping and partying, and they know their customer are too. However, if you're feeling brave, consider sending that promotional email on Saturday or Sunday, Harland Clarke found that users viewed 34.5% of emails sent on these days! Time of Day Matters  While the most popular days of the week vary based on holidays and seasons in any given month, traffic according to time of day is more consistent regardless of the month. The most popular time for VerticalResponse users to send email is between 11am and 3pm EST. The next most popular window is between 7am and 11am. EST. These findings lead us to reasonably conclude that email marketing is the most popular in the morning - however, don't write off 1pm to 5pm EST, which is the third most popular time during the holiday months. Needless to say, sending emails during the night isn't the most popular business practice. Email numbers drop to their lowest between 11pm and 7am EST -- but it might be a good idea to experiment with this time period. Night owls actually tend to be more likely to look at your email, with an average open rate of 21.7% from 8pm to midnight, and 17.6% between midnight and 4am. Blame it on our round-the-clock work schedule with blurring work-vs-play boundaries, but the advice ""don't send email late at night"" is no longer relevant. Whether or not you're ramping up to create an annual email marketing plan, or if you're just looking for some quick hints to boost your sales this holiday season, don't overlook email marketing - even though it's the oldest form of online communication, it's still the best."

17,ENTERTAINMENT,Farewell to Florence Henderson,"Bernie Shine, ContributorAttorney, Correspondent, Provocateur",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/farewell-to-florence-hend_b_13267112.html,,2016-11-27,2016-11-27-1480268001-9987996-BernieFlorence_6579Rc.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-27-1480268001-9987996-BernieFlorence_6579Rc-thumb.jpg,"Actress and entertainer Florence Henderson suffered a heart attack and died Thursday at age 82. She had a full life and resume, and is likely best known for her portrayal of Carol Brady on the sitcom The Brady Bunch from 1969 to 1974, which was only a part of her long and impressive career. I first met Florence in the late 1970s when she was married to a wonderful gentleman, theatrical producer Ira Bernstein. Ira collected vintage toy vehicles, and would often set up a sales/trade booth with Florence at an antique toy show in Long Beach, California. We were fellow toy collectors with different specializations and a common passion. Their home décor included beautiful display cases lined with Ira's remarkable collection. Florence and Ira had four children together. They divorced in 1985, but remained lifelong friends. Ira now lives out of state, but we had I had a heartfelt and bittersweet telephone conversation yesterday. Florence and I became reacquainted when some friends at the CBS studio in Los Angeles invited me to accompany them at a broadcast of Dancing with the Stars in May of 2013. Florence had been a previous contestant, but that night was also attending as a guest of the show, something she frequently enjoyed doing. In fact, she was at the season finale on Monday, just days before she died. DWTS was the perfect blend of show business, style, and grace-- as was Florence. We shared quite a number of mutual friends, including Laurie and Peter Marshall, Ruta Lee and Webb Lowe, Mary and Fred Willard, and many others. We developed a very nice social friendship. In September of 2015, we both attended a party hosted by our friends Sherry Hackett-Loftus and David Loftus at their home in Beverly Hills. The soiree included several psychics, and Florence asked me to join her in the clairvoyant readings. We had a wonderful time and she was a bit surprised by some of the spooky revelations she heard from the soothsayers. I was more of a cynic, emailing when I got home, ""Fun evening. Let me know if any ghosts stop by your place tonight.""  Bernie Shine and Florence Henderson in Beverly Hills last year. (Photo by Timothy Fielding)Florence was always working, traveling, and fully engaging in life, oftentimes emailing me positive messages from Orlando, St. Louis, or some other location on the road, where she was either working or visiting children and grandchildren. She had a positive and uplifting energy, constantly validating others. In August of last year I had written an article for the Huffington Post about comic Joe Wong, which including some videos of his standup routines. Florence emailed me ""I read your article on Joe Wong and listened to his routine. He is adorable and brilliant!!!""In March of this year she attended Carol Channing's 95th birthday at the McCallum Theater in Palm Desert, where she met my friend Thomas Lauderdale, founder and creative director of the musical group Pink Martini. She emailed me that ""Thomas Lauderdale is delightful and very talented!"" In July she emailed me another joyful note, ""I'm on a ship entertaining!! Such fun!!!"" She had previously read my Huffington Post remembrances about my friends Phyllis Diller and Doris Roberts, and shared kind words with me about both tributes. On Friday a mutual friend emailed me about Florence's passing, poignantly and powerfully concluding that ""everyone gets a turn."" So it is. And now it is Florence's time to be remembered.Florence passing was like a falling star in the night sky-- sudden, unexpected, and radiant. Thanks for brightening so many of our lives while you were here."
18,FIFTY,5 Things We Did As Children In The 1970s That Kids Today Don't Do,"James Baxley, ContributorFreelance Writer, Shelter Animal Advocate, Homeless Advocate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/growing-up-in-the-1970s_b_13059224.html,II grew up in the 70s and it was great. I had more freedom as a kid then than most kids have today.,2016-11-27,2016-11-17-1479425353-4985901-riding_back_truck.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-17-1479425353-4985901-riding_back_truck-thumb.png,"I grew up in the 70s and it was great. I had more freedom as a kid then than most kids have today. Life was simpler than it is now. My father worked and had weekends off; my mother stayed home and did the shopping, did the cooking, and raised the kids. My mother raised us but used our father to do her dirty work such as give out the spankings. But this is the way it was then, unlike today.Growing up in the 70s we played tee-ball and little league baseball. We mowed the lawn on weekends, washed the car, and washed the dog. If we got hurt we didn't get coddled and we didn't have any safe spaces, we were told to quit being a baby and walk it off. Not today. So, I thought I would write about the differences between growing up in the 70s verses growing up today.1. No helmets when riding our bicycles. In today's world, kids are over protected by overzealous parents in a world of hand sanitizer and bicycle helmets. It would be an odd thing to see today a child (or an adult for that matter) on a bicycle with no helmet. The parents would be deemed child abusers just based on no helmets alone.Nobody wore a helmet in the 70s. You would be bullied and made fun of for the rest of your childhood if you were seen wearing one.2. Riding in the back of our pickup truck.I loved riding in the back of our truck growing up. Doing 55 mph down the highway with our dog and the wind blowing in our hair. Great times.Today, that is a BIG no-no. I was in Mississippi driving my pickup with a few friends in the back and I was stopped. I was only given a warning for having passengers in the back of my truck. This was in Mississippi of all places.  3. No seat belts.   The cars in the 70s came with seat belts . . . if you want to call them seat belts; they were the lap belt variety. But nobody (at least the people I knew) wore them.Try that today. There are laws based just on seat belts alone. You can get ticketed and fined for not wearing them. Most city's even post a sign as you are entering the town showing how good (or bad) the drivers are respecting that law.4. No car seats. Speaking of seat belts, what about car seats for children? They were around but not used very often. Our mother as well as other mothers would just hold the child or sit between her and our father (while not wearing seat belts I might add).But just like seat belt laws, there are laws which make it illegal not to have a child seat if there was a child riding in the car.Just like seat belts, we see today the dangers of not using seat belts or child seats.5. Being able to trick or treat unattended at night. The biggest night of the year for children outside of Christmas was Halloween. We ran unattended all over the neighborhood knocking on strangers doors asking for free candy. Sounds like an invitation for disaster doesn't it?It doesn't sound safe either does it? Maybe not but safety was the last thing we were thinking about that night . . . just the free candy and who had the coolest costume. But this was the life of a child and safety wasn't part of it.Can't do that today. Children have to be escorted by parents and trick or treat during daylight hours. Not so fun. And some parents take their kids to the mall to do their trick or treating. Where's the fun in that?Life was much simpler then. Good times.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
19,POLITICS,Feds Plan To Shut Down Dakota Access Pipeline Protest Camp,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-camp_us_5838d7a0e4b09b605600891b,Hundreds of protesters have until Dec. 5 to get out or face prosecution.,2016-11-26,"Dakota Access Pipeline protesters are seen in this aerial shot of the Oceti Sakowin campground near the town of Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on Nov. 19.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5838d820180000521230ffbc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The federal government on Friday revealed plans to shut the largest camp in North Dakota where protesters have gathered for months in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said in a letter to a Native American tribe leading the opposition against the pipeline that it will close the area on Dec. 5, after a series of clashes between law enforcement and protesters.“This decision is necessary to protect the general public from the violent confrontations between protestors and law enforcement officials that have occurred in this area, and to prevent death, illness, or serious injury to inhabitants of encampments due to the harsh North Dakota winter conditions,” Col. John Henderson said in a letter to tribal chairman Dave Archambault. “The necessary emergency, medical, and fire response services, law enforcement, or sustainable facilities to protect people from these conditions on this property cannot be provided.”The protesters’ presence also interferes with the commercial activities of private individuals who have grazing and haying rights on the land, Henderson wrote. Anyone staying in the area after the deadline may be subject to prosecution, Henderson warned in the letter. He added that an alternate “free speech zone” for protesters is in place on the other side of the Cannonball River. Police, firefighters and medical professionals can more easily access that area.The Morton County Sheriff’s Department has arrested more than 500 protesters and alleged that its officers were endangered by activists throwing debris and starting fires. Protesters, meanwhile, claim they’ve been injured by tear gas, rubber bullets, water hoses and other so-called non-lethal weapons used by police. One woman may have an arm amputated after witnesses said she was hit with an explosive device thrown by police during protests Sunday night. Police deny using such a weapon and suggested that other protesters wounded the woman with homemade explosives. An encampment of Standing Rock Sioux and their allies, sometimes numbering in the thousands, has occupied the area north of the Cannonball River for months. The Sioux fear the 1,172-mile pipeline could contaminate the drinking water for their nearby reservation and argue that granting a permit to developer Energy Transfer Partners to build beneath Lake Oahe would violate an 1851 treaty.Archambault expressed disappointment at the Army Corps’ announcement, but didn’t say whether he would obey orders to vacate the land. “Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States, but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever. The best way to protect people during the winter, and reduce the risk of conflict between water protectors and militarized police is to deny the easement for the Oahe crossing, and deny it now,” Archambault said in a statement.The Obama administration said in September that it will withhold the permit for building the pipeline under Lake Oahe while it reviews the tribe’s concerns."

While the international",2016-11-26,<p>Fidel Castro cut a divisive figure during his lifetime. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fidel Castro, the controversial revolutionary leader and former head of state of Cuba, has died at the age of 90, Cuban state television announced.One of the world’s longest-serving political leaders, Castro ruled Cuba for 49 years after playing a central role in the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s. He cut a divisive figure during his lifetime, transforming Cuba into the Western Hemisphere’s first communist country and becoming a thorn in the side of the United States during the Cold War.Hailed by supporters as a hero who fought for socialist ideals by standing up to the U.S. and the world’s other political giants, Castro was seen by critics as a ruthless dictator guilty of subjecting his people to countless human rights abuses, devastating Cuba’s economy and forcing more than a million Cubans to flee the island.The illegitimate son of a successful sugar cane farmer, Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born Aug. 13, 1926, on his father’s farm, near Birán, Cuba. Educated in private Jesuit boarding schools, Castro was a clever and athletic but rambunctious child. In high school, his reckless behavior reportedly earned him the nickname “El Loco,” the crazy one. This reputation followed him to the University of Havana, where he began studying law in 1945.The university was a hotbed of political activity at the time, and Castro became interested in politics and activism. Influenced by the ideology of Cuban nationalism, he became a vocal student activist. He frequently organized strikes and demonstrations and spoke out against then-President Ramón Grau and his government.“Fidel’s generation had a terrible sense of frustration,” veteran American journalist Georgie Anna Geyer said in a 2005 PBS documentary on Castro. “Cuba was supposed to be one of the three wealthiest countries in the hemisphere, with the United States and Argentina, and yet they couldn’t put themselves together politically. ... They saw leader after leader either be corrupt, killed, replaced by the United States ― fail, fail, fail.”Castro showed signs of brilliance as a college student, but he was also rumored to have been involved in acts of violence. His reputation at the time was such that when a young woman named Mirta Díaz Balart (whom Castro would marry in 1948) fell in love with him, her brother gave her the following warning: “You know he’s crazy, he’s paranoid and a psychopath who’d just as soon throw you off the 10th floor as buy you a mink coat.”Castro graduated from the University of Havana in 1950 with a doctorate in law, and he started a small law practice. Politics, however, remained his primary passion, and he began campaigning with the Ortodoxo party for a place in congress.But in March 1952, Castro’s political ambitions ― and Cuba’s democracy ― were derailed when General Fulgencio Batista led a coup d’etat, ousting the sitting president. As a dictator, Batista became increasingly ruthless, and his government grew ever more corrupt.Castro, together with his brother Raúl and more than 100 other rebels, organized an attack against the Batista regime. Their target: the Moncada Barracks, one of the largest military garrisons in the country. Usually regarded as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution, the July 26, 1953, offensive was a total disaster. Dozens of rebels either were killed or were captured, tortured and later executed. Castro and his brother were caught and sentenced to 15 years behind bars.“Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me,” Castro, who argued in his own defense, famously said during his trial.Though the Moncada Barracks attack was, from a military perspective, a failure for the rebels, it had tremendous symbolic value. Castro became an icon, a symbol of the anti-Batista movement. In 1955, he and Raúl were released from prison as part of an amnesty deal with the Batista government. The brothers then traveled to Mexico, where they prepared to re-launch their revolutionary campaign. It was there that they met Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, who played an instrumental role in the revolution and the early years of Cuba’s new regime.On Dec. 2, 1956, a group of 82 men, including Castro, his brother and Guevara, landed in Cuba on an overloaded yacht named the Granma. Like Moncada, the attack was a disaster, and most of the men were killed. A small group of survivors managed to flee into the mountains, where they recruited new fighters. The revolutionaries went on to engage in a fierce and successful guerrilla war against government troops.On New Year’s Day 1959, following years of clashes with the rebels, Batista fled Cuba.Considered by many to be a national hero, Castro in February 1959 was sworn in as prime minister of Cuba.While the international community criticized Castro’s government for its brutal campaign of retribution against Batista supporters, the Cuban people were firmly on Castro’s side. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans would gather and cheer as he delivered long, rousing speeches ― some of them lasting hours ― about the revolution.The Cuban people “turned their good will, their faith and their judgment over to Fidel Castro,” Marifeli Pérez-Stable, a Cuban-born scholar and professor who now lives in the United States, told PBS in 2005, “and that was huge political capital, political capital that allowed him to centralize power.”José Orlando Padrón, the Cuban émigré who founded Padrón Cigars, put it another way, saying in the 2012 documentary “Cubamerican,” “We followed him, and we were all fooled.”In the decades that followed, Castro would rule Cuba with an iron fist, becoming a force to be reckoned with on the international stage.During the Cold War, Castro’s Cuba proved especially influential in the politics of the day. He revealed his belief in socialism and declared his allegiance to the USSR early on in his rule. Castro also never minced words about his animosity toward the United States and all capitalistic and imperialistic enterprises.In 1960, at the beginning of what would become a decades-long enmity between the two neighbors, Castro expropriated American-owned property and nationalized U.S.-owned assets and companies in Cuba. Annoyed and alarmed by Castro’s behavior and his close ties to the Soviets, the U.S. retaliated, first by initiating an economic embargo that would cripple Cuba’s economy and then by plotting his overthrow with the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, a CIA-orchestrated attack on Cuba that proved disastrous for the Americans.A year after the invasion, Castro became a central figure in the most harrowing close call of the Cold War: the Cuban Missile Crisis.Castro had consented to let the Soviets deploy ballistic missiles to Cuba, reportedly telling then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in a letter that a nuclear strike should be launched against the United States and that the Cuban people were “prepared to sacrifice themselves for the cause of the destruction of imperialism and the victory of world revolution.”After the missiles were spotted by an American spy plane in October 1962, the destruction Castro spoke of was almost realized. Over the next two weeks, as the Soviets and the Americans engaged in tense negotiations, the world spun closer to nuclear war than at any other time before or since. Fortunately, however, the USSR ― to Castro’s fury ― finally agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba, and the crisis was averted.Raúl Castro charted a new course for the country, outwardly maintaining his brother’s ideological commitment to communism while slowly liberalizing the economy. Under a series of reforms implemented in 2011, the government eliminated some 500,000 state jobs and allowed more Cubans to run independent businesses and to buy and sell homes.The reforms walked back some of the basic tenets of the revolution, but by then it appeared that even Fidel Castro was ready for at least a modest change. In an unusual 2010 interview with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, Castro said “the Cuban model doesn’t even work for us anymore.”Perhaps most importantly, Raúl Castro worked with the Obama administration to set aside five decades of hostility between the two countries by resuming formal diplomatic relations. The deal, brokered secretly by Pope Francis in 2014, stopped short of ending the embargo, which requires approval from Congress. But President Barack Obama continued to chip away at the trade restrictions and took the unprecedented step of visiting the island in March.Despite the diplomatic opening, Fidel Castro continued to lambast the United States and at times criticized Obama in periodic “Reflections” published in the state press. “One imagines that every one of us was at risk of a heart attack while listening to those words of the president of the United States,” Castro wrote of Obama’s speech at the Gran Teatro in Havana.Fidel Castro’s criticism notwithstanding, the flurry of changes to U.S. policy have dovetailed with Raúl Castro’s steps toward economic liberalization. For the Cubans who’ve embraced the opportunity to run independent restaurants, drive taxis or rent rooms through Airbnb, catering to foreign tourists offers earning potential that can easily triple the average state salary of around $20 per month in a single day.Over the course of his rule, Castro was credited with instituting some positive social reforms, such as universal health care and education. In 2011, the literacy rate in Cuba was estimated to be 99.8 percentIn 2006, the left-wing British politician Ken Livingstone, who was then mayor of London, praised Castro’s social reforms. “What’s amazing here is you’ve got a country that’s suffered an illegal economic blockade by the United States for almost half a century and yet it’s been able to give its people the best standard of health care, brilliant education,” Livingstone’s been quoted as saying. “To do this in the teeth of an almost economic war is a tribute to Fidel Castro.”However, in his years in power, Castro is also said to have demanded absolute subservience from the Cuban people and was known for quashing freedom of press and imprisoning people he deemed “anti-social,” including dissidents, artists and members of the LGBT community.“For almost five decades, Cuban citizens have been systematically deprived of their fundamental rights to free expression, privacy, association, assembly, movement, and due process of law,” Human Rights Watch said in 2008. “Tactics for enforcing political conformity have included police warnings, surveillance, short-term detentions, house arrests, travel restrictions, criminal prosecutions, and politically motivated dismissals from employment.”Castro is believed to have imprisoned thousands of political prisoners. More than one million Cubans fled the country during the years he held power.Members of Castro’s own family have denounced him and his actions. His sister Juanita Castro, who fled Cuba in the 1960s, famously said shortly after her defection: “I cannot any longer remain indifferent to what is happening in my country. My brothers Fidel and Raúl have made it an enormous prison surrounded by water. The people are nailed to a cross of torment imposed by international communism.”Alina Fernández, one of Castro’s daughters (he fathered at least eight children), has also been extremely critical of his regime. Fernández, who fled Cuba in 1993, was once quoted as saying that her father’s legacy would be a “country ruined ... with part of its people in exile, an experience very hard and very difficult to cure.”On the international stage, Castro was beloved and despised in equal measure. He claimed to have survived more than 630 assassination attempts, most of them allegedly orchestrated by the CIA. But for all his enemies, he never had a shortage of avid supporters.Twice elected the leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, an intergovernmental organization dedicated to representing the interests of developing countries, Castro has also been praised by several influential figures ― among them, former South African leader Nelson Mandela and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson ― for his bravery and revolutionary zeal. Castro is “the most honest, courageous politician I have ever met,” Jackson has been quoted as saying.Under Castro, Cuba was seen by many in the developing world as a revolutionary center, and Castro played an influential role in the anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism that was sweeping across the world in the latter half of the 20th century. In 2001, Castro was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of developing nations.The Cuban leader also spoke up against global warming and other environmental issues and was lauded by some for his environmentalism and green policies.Ultimately, the world has remained divided over his legacy.In 2003, near the end of Castro’s tenure as president of Cuba, author Anthony Daniels wrote of him: “Nearly half a century after he first took power, he fascinates in a way that the younger gray functionaries who now control the world do not, and he still provokes the strongest passions. No one is neutral about him.”Roque Planas contributed reporting."

He cut a divisive figure during his lifetime, transforming Cuba into the Western Hemisphere’s first communist country and becoming a thorn in the side of the United States during the Cold War.Hailed by supporters as a hero who fought for socialist ideals by standing up to the U.S. and the world’s other political giants, Castro was seen by critics as a ruthless dictator guilty of subjecting his people to countless human rights abuses, devastating Cuba’s economy and forcing more than a million Cubans to flee the island.The illegitimate son of a successful sugar cane farmer, Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born Aug. 13, 1926, on his father’s farm, near Birán, Cuba. Educated in private Jesuit boarding schools, Castro was a clever and athletic but rambunctious child. In high school, his reckless behavior reportedly earned him the nickname “El Loco,” the crazy one. This reputation followed him to the University of Havana, where he began studying law in 1945.The university was a hotbed of political activity at the time, and Castro became interested in politics and activism. Influenced by the ideology of Cuban nationalism, he became a vocal student activist. He frequently organized strikes and demonstrations and spoke out against then-President Ramón Grau and his government.“Fidel’s generation had a terrible sense of frustration,” veteran American journalist Georgie Anna Geyer said in a 2005 PBS documentary on Castro. “Cuba was supposed to be one of the three wealthiest countries in the hemisphere, with the United States and Argentina, and yet they couldn’t put themselves together politically. ... They saw leader after leader either be corrupt, killed, replaced by the United States ― fail, fail, fail.”Castro showed signs of brilliance as a college student, but he was also rumored to have been involved in acts of violence. His reputation at the time was such that when a young woman named Mirta Díaz Balart (whom Castro would marry in 1948) fell in love with him, her brother gave her the following warning: “You know he’s crazy, he’s paranoid and a psychopath who’d just as soon throw you off the 10th floor as buy you a mink coat.”Castro graduated from the University of Havana in 1950 with a doctorate in law, and he started a small law practice. Politics, however, remained his primary passion, and he began campaigning with the Ortodoxo party for a place in congress.But in March 1952, Castro’s political ambitions ― and Cuba’s democracy ― were derailed when General Fulgencio Batista led a coup d’etat, ousting the sitting president. As a dictator, Batista became increasingly ruthless, and his government grew ever more corrupt.Castro, together with his brother Raúl and more than 100 other rebels, organized an attack against the Batista regime. Their target: the Moncada Barracks, one of the largest military garrisons in the country. Usually regarded as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution, the July 26, 1953, offensive was a total disaster. Dozens of rebels either were killed or were captured, tortured and later executed. Castro and his brother were caught and sentenced to 15 years behind bars.“Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me,” Castro, who argued in his own defense, famously said during his trial.Though the Moncada Barracks attack was, from a military perspective, a failure for the rebels, it had tremendous symbolic value. Castro became an icon, a symbol of the anti-Batista movement. In 1955, he and Raúl were released from prison as part of an amnesty deal with the Batista government. The brothers then traveled to Mexico, where they prepared to re-launch their revolutionary campaign. It was there that they met Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, who played an instrumental role in the revolution and the early years of Cuba’s new regime.On Dec. 2, 1956, a group of 82 men, including Castro, his brother and Guevara, landed in Cuba on an overloaded yacht named the Granma.

24,ENTERTAINMENT,The 'Gilmore Girls' Revival Is Best When It Talks About Grief,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gilmore-girls-revival_us_58386a2ae4b01ba68ac47937,"Winter, spring, summer or fall, all you have to do is bawl.",2016-11-26,"Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in ""Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5838fd821a00002500cc9cda.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s a moment in the opening chapter of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” after the first “la las” and Gwyneth Paltrow dig, when the long-awaited Netflix revival finally takes a second to breathe. Fueled by a late-night batch of coffee, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) convene in their rarely used kitchen to do the thing they do better than anyone else on television: talk.“I’m just stressed out and kind of feeling my mortality lately,” Lorelai says after confessing that she willingly flipped through a brochure for an all-expenses-paid cruise, much to their shared horror.The line is especially significant given that the series, much like its caffeine-infused hero, is also contending with its mortality. Nine years after it was cancelled by the CW on the heels of a rudderless final season, “Gilmore Girls” has become the latest in a long line of early 2000s series to get the revival treatment. But instead of abandoning what made the show so beloved, “A Year in the Life,” at its best, honors the essential themes of the series (family, fighting and Al’s Pancake World, duh) by taking the Gilmore women on a yearlong journey of grief and self-discovery. Besides the steady stream of “Tuck Everlasting” water under Stars Hollow that’s apparently keeping everybody ageless, the undercurrent of the revival series is the death of actor Edward Hermann, who embodied Gilmore family patriarch Richard. His absence strikes Lorelai, Rory and his wife of 50 years, Emily (Kelly Bishop), who also shared a deep bond with Hermann off-set, in both devastating and humorous ways.Each woman is facing a crossroads in life. Lorelai, now in a full-fledged relationship with Luke (Scott Patterson), is questioning her happily ever after. A sizable inheritance for an expansion of Luke’s Diner is revealed to be Richard’s parting gift to his daughter’s presumed husband, although Emily is happy to remind everybody that they haven’t gotten married yet. Emily is unleashed as a widow in mourning, wearing jeans, Marie Kondo-ing her Connecticut mansion and trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy without her other half. She’s made vulnerable by blow of losing a lifelong partner, but still retains the ability to verbally decimate anyone who dares cross her.“You never do anything unless it’s what you want to do,” Emily seethes at Lorelai in a bitter showdown after she bungles a eulogy at Richard’s wake. “You never have. You blow through life like a natural disaster, knocking down everything and everyone in your path.”Rory, too, has been affected, but we feel her mourning most acutely in the challenges in her career. See, the great Rory Gilmore is having trouble living up to her potential, bouncing from one freelance journalism gig to another before eventually moving home. We can only imagine that one of the driving forces behind her soul searching is her grandfather’s well-documented expectations of her success. In fact, it’s in his study where she finally discovers her true calling, writing a novel about her family titled Gilmore Girls.Midway through the first installment we learn that Richard died suddenly due to a massive heart attack. His last words were, “Get the hell away from me,” Lorelai recounts in a therapy session (yes, we get Lorelai and Emily therapy, everybody), leaving his family with little closure and a lot of unresolved anger.For all the talk of the perpetually chippy “Gilmore” universe, the revival isn’t afraid to go to the dark side, refusing to shy away from the the division and ugliness that can arise after a loved one dies. We witness each of the Gilmore women in a moment of desperation ― Emily’s is wearing jeans, obviously ― but as winter, spring, summer and fall pass, each finds a moment of clarity amid her grief, making them that much more human in the process. Graham and Bishop have always done the series’ heavy lifting, but their scenes together in “A Year in the Life” should make dual nominations for the actresses a given come awards season. Without the buffer that’s kept them from tackling a stable of mother-daughter issues, their relationship becomes the prism through which the series most successfully tackles the grieving process. In the closing chapter, “Fall,” an empowered Lorelai is finally able to deliver the eulogy she meant to at the start of the series after coming to a revelation on a “Wild”-inspired adventure.Her monologue about the “best birthday ever” with her father is too long and heartbreaking to include here, but let’s just say it involves Richard Gilmore, a mall pretzel and the movie “Grease.” In perhaps the most rewarding moment of the four chapters, Graham successfully communicates the complicated but fierce love she had for him while on the phone with a mother that was never truly able to understand her. “I got up enough courage to look up at him,” Lorelai tells Emily with tears streaming down her face. “And he was standing there with a pretzel. A giant pretzel, covered with mustard. And he handed it to me and he said, ‘Let’s go.’ And he took me to the movies.”Big deaths on television are commonplace these days, as the stakes have been considerably raised since “Gilmore Girls” went off the air. What distinguished the series, even back when it was airing before “One Tree Hill,” however, is that it has never been particularly plot-heavy. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino doled out big life moments with a glorious stinginess in the original run, making sure the audience recognized the importance of each one.We sobbed along at Rory’s Chilton graduation because the series had earned our tears and now we mourn Richard and Hermann’s death because the revival treats it with the gravity it deserves. Instead of limiting grief to some easily digestible three-episode arc, “Gilmore Girls” prefers to look death straight in the eye, much like the series “Six Feet Under” (shoutout to newly minted park ranger Peter Krause), by authentically exploring what these women have lost over the course of a year and how it has shaped them.And as for those final four words, with death comes life. So as Lorelai Gilmore would say: “Full freakin’ circle.” "

History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.”“Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro’s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future,” he added. “As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.”Obama restored the United States’ full diplomatic relations with Cuba in July 2015 after years of negotiation with the government of Raul Castro, Fidel Castro’s brother and successor. Their efforts ended a decades-long period of estrangement that began shortly after the elder Castro seized power in 1959. In March, Obama became the first American president to visit Cuba in 88 years.Obama alluded to the diplomatic breakthrough over which he presided in his remarks on Castro’s death.“For nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements,” Obama said.“During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends - bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity,” he added. “This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.”By contrast, President-elect Donald Trump, who will inherit Obama’s policy of reconciliation with Cuba, initially offered a much briefer reaction on Twitter."

I don’t matter.” This young, middle school aged boy knew the personal significance of the election, and was devastated by the results.Much like the rest of American history, the plight of African Americans has been sanitized, reworked and retold. There is no reason, many white Americans think, that black people shouldn’t be able to just get over slavery and move on. Some people believe there is no reason they shouldn’t operate like white America if they would just try harder.The truth is that the system has been stacked against African Americans since they were first brought to America as slaves. When they were emancipated in 1863, they initially gained citizenship and the right to vote with the 14th and 15th amendments. It didn’t take long, however, until angry former slave holders and the frightened South overthrew any progress made, determined to stop social change. Manisha Sinha, Professor of Afro-American Studies and History at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said, “African American ideas about emancipation were deferred until the Civil Rights Movement led to the passage of new laws to implement black citizenship.”“Vagrancy,” or the inability to prove ones employment, was a criminal offense. Author Douglas Blackmon, in his book, Slavery by Any Other Name, said:“Vagrancy…was a new and flimsy concoction dredged up from legal obscurity at the end of the nineteenth century by the state legislatures of Alabama and other southern states. It was capriciously enforced by local sheriffs and constables, adjudicated by mayors and notaries public, recorded haphazardly or not at all in court records, and, most tellingly in a time of massive unemployment among all southern men, was reserved almost exclusively for black men.”Once incarcerated, these men were put to work on farms and used as other free labor sources for local businesses. Blackmon discovered one encampment that “supplied tens of thousands of men over five decades to a succession of prison mines ultimately purchased by U.S. Steel in 1907.”He said these men were “‘leased’ by state and county governments to U.S. Steel or the companies it had acquired.”In 2016, it was discovered that Nixon aide, John Ehrlichman, made a shocking confession to Harper Magazine 22 years earlier, saying:“We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”In 1982, Ronald Reagan upped the rhetoric on drugs, declaring a war and a problem that didn’t exist. In fact, according to Ibram X. Kendi, author of Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, “It was an astonishing move. Drug crime was declining. Only 2 percent of Americans viewed drugs as the nation’s most pressing problem. Drug treatment therapists were shocked by Reagan’s unfounded claim that America could ‘put drug abuse on the run through stronger law enforcement.’”The “war on drugs” has disproportionately impacted black and brown lives, though drug use is more often, or equally, prevalent among whites. One survey showed that 17.1% of whites surveyed used cocaine compared to 9.9% of blacks. When it comes to crack cocaine, the survey showed 3.4% of whites had used crack cocaine compared to 5% of blacks. 17.2% of whites used hallucinogens compared to only 6.7% of blacks. Both races, 1.8%, admit to using heroin equally.While African Americans represent only 12% of the drug use population, 38% of those are arrested for drugs and 59% are in state prison for drug use, says the NAACP. The Bureau of Justice Statistics showed that, in 2011, of the 225,242 people serving time in state prisons for drug offenses, African Americans made up 45 percent, while whites made up just 30 percent. Not so coincidentally, private prisons have been a $70 billion industry, using prisoners to make a fortune.African Americans have historically been targeted by police, relegated to subpar housing, and denied decent education. White Americans, on the other hand, have been lied to about “the good old days” when America was “great.” As Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow, says:“Jim Crow laws were wiped off the books decades ago, but today an extraordinary percentage of the African American community is warehoused in prisons or trapped in a parallel social universe, denied basic civil and human rights—including the right to vote; the right to serve on juries; and the right to be free of legal discrimination in employment, housing, access to education and public benefits.”The new, or at least rehashed, political regime is represented by fear and ignorance. When there is fear, social progress ceases to exist. And the little boy sitting on the side of the playground is rightfully afraid. We, as a nation, have the obligation to prove to him that indeed black lives matter. His life matters."

The authors of the analytical article clearly indicated that America was slowly preparing for a possible future nuclear war, especially given the rise of Russian and Chinese influence in the global arena.“With Russia on the warpath, China pressing its own territorial claims and Pakistan expanding its arsenal, the overall chances for Mr. Obama’s legacy of disarmament look increasingly dim,” the Times article proclaimed.Expected to spend at least $355 billion in the first ten years according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the plan focused on developing and deploying nukes that are more powerful and reliable but smaller than the current warheads. While this was meant to far serve Obama administration’s public rhetoric of reducing nuclear tonnage in US stockpiles, the system would yield more destructive warheads in terms of targeting capabilities and delivery systems.But President Obama is not alone in this club of leaders who clung to the Alfred Nobel medal with bloody hands.Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States and the first head of state to be awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize, triggered a lot controversy with the Norwegian Left branding him a “military madman” and imperialist who furthered the bloody American conquest of Philippines.The awarding of US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who have advocated and led a bloody military campaign against Vietnam, in 1973 led to the resignation of two Nobel Committee members in protest.But the fact that these individual’s names still remain engraved among the list of other “angels of peace” like Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Junior is enough to make Obama rest easy in retirement, assured that regardless of the number of countries he bombed as the Commander-in-Chief his legacy as a peace maker is already cast in gold."
32,POLITICS,Why It's Fair -- And Patriotic -- To Boo Mike Pence And Donald Trump In Public Places,"Mario Almonte, ContributorPR Strategist, Commentator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-its-fair-and-patrioti_b_13133884.html,"Yeah, it's okay for us to continue to treat Trump and Pence with disrespect.

Donald Trump demanded an apology from the cast, calling them ""very rude"" and saying ""our wonderful future V.P. was harassed"" by them. Judge Jeanine Pirro said on Fox it was ""reverse racism..(he) has done nothing to deserve this inappropriate and disgusting behavior."" Reverse Philosophy Even those among us who vehemently and bitterly opposed the racist and divisive rhetoric that Trump and Pence (who is guilty by association) espoused on the campaign trail are forced to pause and consider whether Trump supporters, this time, have a case. We appear to be very bad losers. No doubt, if the situation had been reversed and Hillary Clinton had been booed, we would have called the audience disrespectful and boorish. And, ironically, while we feared that Trump's supporters would resort to violence if he should lose, it is we who appear to be doing so, launching sometimes hostile protests across the country and even calling on the Electoral College to disregards the election results and choose Hillary Clinton instead.But there's a very legitimate argument for continuing to express our dissatisfaction - and even being boorish - with the newly elected President and Vice President and refusing, for now, to be gracious about their election win: The fact is, Trump and Pence did many things on the campaign trail to deserve ""this inappropriate and disgusting behavior"" from people today. Trump was constantly lying, riling up supporters, openly endorsing violence against his critics, embracing racism, xenophobia, and white supremacy philosophies. He relentlessly and viciously attacked anyone who disagreed with him, sometimes promoting flagrant lies and highly damaging conspiracy theories against them. His many stadium rallies were characterized by audiences calling for the jailing of Hillary Clinton and Trump himself throwing out anyone who disagreed with him.A Dirty Shame In simple terms, Trump won the election by fighting dirty. His behavior throughout the campaign was the very zenith of ""inappropriate and disgusting behavior."" It would of course be naïve to say that all other politicians - including Hillary Clinton - have always fought clean. But his mean-spirited, openly unethical and ugly behavior violated every tenet of decorum and fair play that our American democratic values demands of its political leaders - and we, as good people, hold so dear in our daily lives. Of course, it was the right thing for Barack Obama to call upon people to ""give this new president-elect a chance."" As President, it is incumbent upon him to express noble ideas that unite and preserve our democracy, which is especially fragile during the transition of power. And it would be great if we were really sore losers because we don't like Trump's philosophy, but that's like saying we resented Hitler because we disagreed with his point of view. It should worry us that Trump continues to petulantly pick petty fights on Twitter with common citizens whom he feels have personally insulted his ego, as he does with the Hamilton cast, and with Alec Baldwin over his Saturday Night Live skits; and yet, on the more serious matters like the white nationalists' march where demonstrators gave ""Heil victory"" salutes, and the Ku Klux Klan members who celebrated his victory - he is, if not silent, disingenuous in disavowing their support. Pressed for a comment after months of silence on these types of demonstrations, he acted puzzled recently that anyone would make the connection to him and said that, if he ""energies"" these groups, he wants ""to look into it and find out why."" It's the typically dubious, tepid and noncommittal answer from Trump on racist issues that should signal to all intelligent Americans that his political agenda presents a clear and present danger to our democracy. The signal should be even more strongly recognized in his silence when a prominent supporter suggested internment camps for Muslims and he defends his appointment of Breitbart News' Stephen Bannon, viewed by many as an alt-right advocate, as his chief strategist and senior counsel, It is therefore our patriotic duty to continue to vigorously renounce his political program. If the only opportunity ordinary citizens like us have to show our distaste is by booing him and Mike Pence when they mix among us in our humble everyday lives, then, by all means, let's do so. So, yeah, it's okay for us to continue to treat Trump and Pence with disrespect. We're just following the example of its most zealous practitioner."

Before I know it, I'm thinking about those well-lit aisles and big red carts and white, gleaming floors.I need to be there.I feel it in my soul.And tonight, I have a 40-minute kid-free holiday (courtesy of my husband taking the three littles to the gym), and so, it is time. For Target Nirvana.(And really, we need diapers and so I'm actually just being practical and doing something for my family. Really, I'm just here to serve the greater good.)First, I will float through your beautiful red automatic doors and immediately smell buttered popcorn. And that will make my heart happy, as come into the place that makes me whole.I will veer to the left to marinade my happiness in the Dollar Spot, where everyone knows dreams come true. They might be dreams you never knew you had, like the dream of having matching napkin rings at Thanksgiving dinner or the dream of buying Elmo party favors for the baby's birthday next year, but they are dreams just the same.After collecting the items I never knew I needed but now I can't live without, I glance longingly at the wide aisle in front of me. The aisle that leads to boots and jeans and fake leather jackets and lots of awesome things that I'll never wear. But I only came here for one thing, and so, I must stay the course.After all, I do have self-control. And only 38 minutes.And so, I turn left.All of a sudden, the accessories department sings to me a song more beautiful than the white static noise I blast in my sons' room at bedtime. My eyes fall longingly over rose gold watches and aqua statement necklaces that I want to make love to. And so I go over and touch them and look at them, and I start to realize I really need them and they really will make my life beautiful. And, after all, I was up at 4:25am with the baby today, and well... everyone needs a little something that makes them happy.I keep walking, and my gaze drifts to the little girls' department to my right. And, even though I have no daughters, I'm overcome with a strong urge to buy the sweet shirts with the witty sayings on them and that adorable furry sweater vest and skirt set that someone I know must need, and unless I buy it for them right now, they will never see this outfit that the world needs to see. Lucky for me, my best friend's daughter's birthday is next month, so that problem is solved.Diapers really are the only reason I came here, and so I must stay the course and turn right. I pass the card section on my left, and soon enough, plush gray bath towels and beautiful Chevron bath mats come into view, and come to think of it, we really do need to replace all of the towels we've been using to mop up stray urine in the guest bathroom through the potty-training years. And these towels and linens are so thick and soft, and we just need comfort around here. Plus, it's the guest bathroom. I mean, it's only right.The baby section comes into view, and well, everyone knows that little itty bitty things are just so sweet and special and precious and we need to touch all of them. And while I don't have anyone specific in mind, I do always have a friend getting pregnant these days, so it makes sense to be proactive and grab this set of onesies from the end cap, just to have on-hand. Come to think of it, a few more outfits wouldn't hurt either. They are so small and sweet, after all, and they need to be in my cart.This brings me to my next point, and I'm not going to put it lightly. The diapers at Target are simply the best. And, being that I'm here today and I might not return for at least 72 hours, I must buy three large boxes of Up & Up. Because that new anchor design makes me feel like I'm buying Honest diapers, but I know they're half the price, and therefore, I'm winning at life.I hastily traverse the back of the store to get to the grocery section because Target always has the flavor of LaCroix that I need to make my life happy, and also because I'm used to being here with kids and storming past the toys section is always the only way. But back to the LaCroix and the coconut and grapefruit and even those fancy new mixed flavors in the tall cans. The answer to my carbonated water fantasies is in this aisle, and I need all of it. Now. (And we also know vodka pairs extremely well with LaCroix, especially during the witching hour when everyone's crying and the husband just texted to say he'll be home late. Because, #survival.)While we're in the grocery section, I might as well be productive, and milk and bananas are always on the list, so I will scoop those up, along with paper towels because you can never have enough and I think we're out. (Spoiler alert: I have two large packages in the garage that I've forgotten about.)As I make my way back to the front of the store, the new, revamped home goods section on the left screams at me like my toddler when he sees me getting the ice cream out of the freezer. I need that now! Like matching coffee cups with the cute sayings, and I want to be that person with funny coffee cups that match. Whimsical lamps that I can put nowhere in my house, but they are cool and I'd like to feel fancy. Signs that I could post in my house and make my friends thing I'm silly and fun. All of these things are things that I need right now to be the person I want to be.After one last swing to the right into the household cleaners department to pick up Tide (because one can obviously never have enough laundry detergent), I exhale and pull up to the cashier line, place my plunder onto the belt and proudly survey my success. Yep, I did it. I totally need all of this and may never see again if I don't buy it right now.""That's $516.83."" the cashier says.""But I only came here for diapers!""""Yes, but you got a lot of really good stuff,"" she said with a smile.Yes.

34,POLITICS,Disturbed By Current Politics? Here's How To Get Involved,"Tim Rymel, ContributorAuthor | Educator | Dad",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disturbed-by-current-poli_b_13209790.html,"A lot of us are looking for ways to get involved; we just don't know what to do. The important thing to know is that we are not helpless. However, we must work together to make change.",2016-11-26,2016-11-24-1480020204-7932652-DisturbedByPolitics.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-24-1480020204-7932652-DisturbedByPolitics-thumb.jpg,"I don't think I realized how little I knew about how politics worked, until I decided to do more than just write about social justice issues. Then again, with recent political events, a lot of us are looking for ways to get involved; we just don't know what to do. The important thing to know is that we are not helpless. However, we must work together to make change.  How government works As most of us know, there are three branches: the executive branch, or the president, legislative, or congress, and judicial, our judges. We work on a system of checks and balances so no single branch of government gets too powerful. We vote for a president and for our representatives for congress. The judicial branch is supposed to operate independently, upholding the laws of congress and the constitution. So if you vote for a Democratic president, but a Republican congress, there is most likely going to be conflict and gridlock - especially in our divided political climate - because this is all part of the checks and balances system. So what do we, as citizens, have the power to do?1. Vote! The United States has one of the lowest voter turnouts of developed nations, with only around 60% of eligible voters turning out for presidential elections, and roughly 40% of voters turning out for mid-term elections. We've grown complacent, allowing special interests and corruption to run loose without anyone to watch. Disturbingly, a Pew Research poll showed 70% of non-voters were younger than 50, while 43% were more racially and ethnically diverse, 46% are lower income and 54% are less educated than those who vote. In other words, those who need congress to stand up for them the most are not making their voices heard. 2. Actively get informed! Turn off your TV and do your own research. Media was invented to sell you stuff. It is not a reliable source of information when it comes to your best interests. As I've written, 26% of what CNN says is Mostly false, false, or outright lying, according to Politifact. The same can be said for FOX News at 59%, 35% for ABC, 45% for CBS, and 41% for NBC. News sources with exorbitant advertising income have a single agenda: get viewers coming back again and again. If they can get you emotionally vested in their content, regardless of accuracy, they have achieved their financial goal. High ratings are how they attract advertisers and the networks will stop at nothing to get you to tune in. Do your own research on sites you don't normally visit and ask questions of people you may not normally talk to so you can get a different perspective. The main point here is to ask questions and challenge your own beliefs about issues. Look up historical FACTS and get statistics whenever you see a meme. Critically think about whether or not what you're reading or what you hear even makes common sense. 3. Find out who represents you in congress.  After clicking on that link, click on the links of the representatives and sign up for their newsletters. Talk to them through email and phone calls. This is what they are paid to do. You are not bothering them. They are not celebrities. They are your employees. 4. Find your personal representative for your district. Call them. Email them and stay in touch. 5. Contact your state governor. Make sure your governor knows who you are, what your values are and what is expected of him or her. Get on the newsletter mailing list. 6. Contact your state legislature. From this site you, after choosing your state, you can learn what bills are coming up, being discussed and give input. 7. Get involved in community programs.  Organizations, such as VolunteerMatch.org connect you with organizations and people that share your interests. Socialbrite also helps you find companies and non-profits you can support financially, or through local volunteer opportunities. Meetup.com connects you with people who share your interests, which may or may not be politically active, but you will find like-minded, passionate people for connection and shared concerns. As alarming as the current state of affairs is, ""we the people"" are still in charge of the destiny of our country. We can require our congress to act on our behalf if the president or his officials are not serving our best interests. Your phone calls and emails count. Your voice counts. Make it heard.Photo - Flickr/ Petras Gagilas"
35,WORLDPOST,Donald Trump Should Announce U.S. Will Stay Out of Syria,"Doug Bandow, ContributorContributing writer, policy analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-should-annou_b_13253840.html,"The U.S. presidential election mercifully has ended. But global conflict continues. And politicians are still attempting to drag America into another tragic, bloody Middle Eastern conflict.",2016-11-26,"Serbian Air Force MiG-29 departing with two AA-8 Aphid missiles, Graf Ignatievo Air Base, Bulgaria.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc0e3bb240000030a50f5e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. presidential election mercifully has ended. But global conflict continues. And politicians are still attempting to drag America into another tragic, bloody Middle Eastern conflict.To do so would be madness. President-elect Donald Trump appears to recognize that Syria is not America's responsibility. Unfortunately, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, as well as some of those mentioned for top administration positions, take a more militaristic perspective. Trump should announce that his administration will not get involved in Syria's civil war in any way.President Barack Obama spent five years resisting pressure for direct military intervention. But he appointed war supporters John Kerry, Samantha Power, Susan Rice, and Hillary Clinton to manage his foreign policy. Kerry acknowledged to a group of Syrian refugees in Beirut that he and other officials had advocated use of force but ""lost the argument."" However, rather than clearly set a policy of non-involvement, President Obama attempted intervention-lite. The administration failed in both its major objectives: oust Bashar al-Assad as president and empower ""moderate"" opponents. However, administration officials still have not given up. Even as the American people were voting on his successor his appointees were pushing ""kinetic actions against the regime,"" reported anonymous sources. The president remains at odds with his own appointees.Republican warrior wannabes claim that Washington could have provided just the right form of aid to just the right groups at just the right time and thereby created a liberal, democratic, united Syria allied with America. Even today Thanassis Cambanis of the Century Foundation argues the U.S. should ""use its resources to manage conflicts like Syria's."" That sounds good, but when was the last time Washington ""managed"" anything well in the Middle East? Even with a quick military victory Washington got Iraq disastrously wrong, empowering Iran while triggering the very sectarian conflict which spawned the Islamic State. U.S. intervention in Libya left chaos and conflict in its wake. American policymakers demonstrate no facility for global social engineering.In Syria the Obama administration has pursued incompatible objectives and combatants. Washington remains committed to ousting the Assad regime, which remains the most important barrier to a triumph by the Islamic State. NATO ally Turkey spent the civil war's early years accommodating so-called Daesh, and now is battling Kurdish fighters, who have been America's staunchest allies against ISIS. The U.S. has trained and armed so-called moderate insurgents, who have had only limited combat success, often surrendering, along with their U.S.-supplied equipment, to radical forces. One half billion dollar training program generated barely three score insurgents, most of whom were promptly killed or captured. Former Obama official Derek Chollet said the administration hoped its aid to insurgents would give Washington ""leverage"" in dealing with its Sunni ""allies."" Yet the latter have manipulated America to serve their interests, pressing Washington to oust the Assad regime while supporting radical insurgent groups opposed by the U.S. After providing symbolic aid in the early days, America's Gulf allies led by Saudi Arabia abandoned the campaign against the Islamic State in favor of a brutal attack on Yemen, dragging the U.S. into a dangerous proxy war with Iran. Extremist forces have threatened U.S. military personnel embedded with Syrian fighters. Arab and Kurdish insurgents trained and armed by Washington recently battled each other. Shia militias fighting with the Baghdad government against ISIS in Iraq are opposing U.S.-backed Sunni insurgents in Syria. Baghdad and Ankara neared war over Turkey's intervention in northern Iraq. Any attacks on Assad's forces threaten Russian military personnel and hardware.Only a dreamer could imagine the incoming administration could do better to bring order to this bloody imbroglio.Washington must set priorities. Washington Post columnist Jackson Diehl argued that Russia ""has proved that ... a limited use of force could change the political outcome, without large costs."" However, that's because Moscow has one objective: keep Assad in power. Washington has a half dozen or more conflicting goals, none of are important enough to warrant the use of force.Syria's civil war does not implicate any of Washington's traditional Middle Eastern interests, most importantly Israel and oil. America's chief concern should be the Islamic State, not Assad regime. Candidate Trump correctly opined: ""our far greater problem is not Assad, it's ISIS.""Advocates of regime change claim that only through Assad's ouster can Daesh be defeated. However, the existing government remains the biggest military barrier to the radicals. Moreover, the group grew out of Iraq's sectarian war and would continue to promote its ""caliphate"" in a post-Assad Syria. Alas, history is full of examples--Soviet Union, Nicaragua, and Iran, among others--in which brutal radicals defeat decent liberals after they together depose a hated dictator. Unless the U.S. is willing to occupy the country, impose a new government, and remain until the state is rebuilt, the worst Syrians are likely to control a post-Assad future. And the results could be ugly even if Washington stuck around, as in Afghanistan and Iraq. Retired Gen. John Allen and author Charles R. Lister argued that ""the credibility of the United States as the leader and defender of the free world must be salvaged."" But the Syrian tragedy has little to do with ""the free world"": brutal civil wars have occurred since the dawn of mankind. And Washington's chief duty is to defend America, not referee other nations' conflicts. Yet ivory tower warriors continue to urge greater U.S. military involvement. Some propose targeting Russia with additional sanctions, which would not likely dissuade Moscow from acting on behalf of what it perceives as its important interests. However, further penalties would discourage cooperation even where the two nations' interests coincided.Another option is more training and better weapons for so-called moderates. Yet even President Obama admitted that there were few past cases when support for insurgents ""actually worked out well."" In a recent interview President-Elect Trump contended that ""we have no idea who these people are"" and as a candidate complained that ""they end up being worse"" than the regime. The reality is more nuanced--Syria's insurgents span the spectrum--but the administration's experience has been a cruel disappointment. An anonymous American official admitted to the Washington Post: U.S.-backed forces are ""not doing any better on the battlefield, they're up against a more formidable adversary, and they're increasingly dominated by extremists."" There's no reason to expect better under the new administration.Indeed, noted the BBC, ""many of the more moderate rebel groups that the U.S. backs have formed a strategic alliance with Jabhat Fatah al-Sham [formerly al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra] and now fight alongside it."" Weapons previously provided to the moderates often ended up in the hands of more radical forces. Greater aid might prolong the fighting but would be unlikely to give the ""good guys"" victory. Providing anti-aircraft missiles would threaten Russian as well as Syrian aircraft, risking a significant escalation if Moscow responded with greater force. And any leakage to radical jihadists could result in attacks on Western airliners.Establishing a ""no-fly"" and/or ""safe"" zone has become a panacea for many U.S. policymakers, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It is an obvious way to appear to do something. However, protecting civilians in this way would simultaneously immunize combatants--attracting insurgents who would use such areas as a sanctuary, encouraging further regime and Russian attacks. Moreover, Washington would have to do more than simply declare such a zone to exist. Enforcing it would be an act of war requiring continuous military action. U.S. officials have estimated that the effort would take hundreds of aircraft, thousands of personnel, and hundreds of millions of dollars or more a month. Washington would have to destroy the Syrian anti-air defense system, no simple task. Indeed, in one of her conversations revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton acknowledged that imposing a no fly zone would ""kill a lot of Syrians"" and ""a lot of civilians.""Moreover, a true ""no-fly"" zone would require preventing Russian air operations as well. Trump complained to the Wall Street Journal that by attacking Assad ""we end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria."" Moscow officials have warned against strikes that would threaten Russian military personnel; Moscow already has introduced its advanced S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. Nevertheless, several GOP presidential candidates advocated downing Russian aircraft, if necessary. Yet it would be mad to commit an unprovoked act of war against a nuclear-armed power over a third nation's conflict in which the U.S. has no substantial interest. Moscow would not likely yield peacefully. Why let this declining power ""push around the United States, which has the world's biggest economy"" and ""greatest military,"" asked Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen? Because Moscow has far more at stake and as a result is willing to accept greater costs and take greater risks than is America. Worse, Moscow would feel pressure to maintain its credibility and preserve its international status against an overbearing United States. The result could be the very conflict America and the Soviet Union avoided during the entire Cold War. One anonymous U.S. official told the Washington Post: ""You can't pretend you can go to war against Assad and not go to war against Russia."" During the campaign Trump warned: ""you're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton,"" since fighting Syria would mean ""fighting Syria, Russia and Iran."" Direct military intervention also would be possible, but would raise the stakes dramatically. Special operations forces, drones, airstrikes, and even an Iraq-style invasion all are possible. But none would enjoy sustained public or allied support or end the ongoing murder and mayhem. Victory, whatever that meant, would simply trigger a new round of fighting for dominance in a post-Assad Syria, as occurred in Iraq. And conflict with Moscow could not easily be avoided.How would any of this serve U.S. interests? The American people have no meaningful stake in the outcome. The Assad regime's fate is largely irrelevant to Washington. For nearly a half century under both Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez, who ruled previously, Damascus was hostile to the U.S. But Syria lost more than it won and never posed a threat to America or impeded Washington's dominance in the Middle East. Once the country dissolved into civil war the Assad regime's ability to harm others essentially disappeared. Even if the government survives, its influence will be much diminished for years.Washington worries about instability, but the U.S. has created greater chaos through its foolish war-making in the Mideast. Obviously, ending the Syrian civil war would be best for everyone, but a jihadist victory, likely if Assad is defeated, would threaten American interests more than continuing instability. Sen. John McCain, among others, claims that Assad's survival guarantees continuation of the war, but Washington cannot halt the conflict and is best served by staying out of the bloody imbroglio.""Moderate"" insurgents would be angered by Washington's withdrawal, but they are unlikely ever to gain power. America might lose its supposed ""leverage"" over such nominal allies as Riyadh and Ankara, but there is little evidence that Washington has gained anything from its supposed influence. Indeed, Saudi Arabia has essentially abandoned the fight against the Islamic State and Turkey is more often attacking Kurds than Daesh.Even if Assad fell, Washington would have no control over what followed. Without ongoing American support, the so-called ""moderates"" would do no better against the radical forces than they have done against the Syrian army. The hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who died after the Bush administration blew up the country demonstrate that good intentions are an insufficient basis for U.S. policy.Clinton criticized ""the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia"" in Syria. But Moscow's ambitions there do not threaten America. Russia's alliance with Syria goes back decades. Washington should do what is in America's interest, not what is against Russia's interest. Of course, Syria is a humanitarian horror. But the civil war is not as bad as other conflicts largely ignored by the U.S., such as the mass slaughter in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Moreover, Syria is not genocide, ala Rwanda or Cambodia, but a civil war, in which a most of the dead are combatants, and from all sides. The bombing of civilian areas is horrific, but hardly a new military tactic, and one which Washington has only recently come to reject.Nor could the conflict be settled without using extraordinary force. Merely fudging the balance of military power won't end the killing. If jihadist groups took control after Assad's collapse and his allies' withdrawal, Washington would face pressure to ""do something"" to protect Alawites, Christians, and perhaps even ""moderate"" insurgents and their supporters. The U.S. has neither the responsibility nor the resources to police the globe. Finally, the administration has unfinished business involving anti-American radicals, the Islamic State and al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra/al-Sham. But Assad's ouster would empower both groups. They remain primarily insurgents which can be dealt with on the ground by the surrounding nations which they most threaten.Donald Trump had only just been declared president-elect when those who dominate U.S. foreign policy thinking began urging him to conform to their disastrous designs in the Middle East. However, Trump appears to have learned from the past. He told the Wall Street Journal: ""I've had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria.""The incoming administration should announce that the U.S. is staying out. Syria is a tragedy beyond America's control. Only the battling local factions and regional parties can reach a stable settlement. Washington should seek to make the best of a bad situation and encourage negotiations on an agreement which ends the killing and limits the activities of Islamic radicals.This article first appeared in Forbes online."

As such, tensions between China and the United States in the South China Sea would likely grow in lock-step with China’s military growth, he added.China claims most of the energy-rich waters through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.Recent U.S. efforts to counter what it sees as China limiting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea have drawn Beijing’s ire and stoked fears of military conflict. A patrol by U.S. warships in October was dubbed “illegal” and “provocative” by the Chinese Defence Ministry.“From the U.S. perspective, China’s large-scale construction activities in the South China Sea confirmed U.S. suspicion that China intended to implement an anti-access/area-denial strategy,” the report said.There would be “more continuity than change” in Trump’s military policy in the Asia-Pacific, said Zhu Feng, director of the South China Sea Center at Nanjing University, at the report launch.Trump may not use the term “rebalancing” to the region, but he would likely retain most of policies, he added.Both academics agreed that there was a high possibility of increased U.S. military spending in the Asia-Pacific under Trump.A Trump administration would “not be an exception” to other Republican-led governments that increase military spending when they take office, said Zhu Feng.The build-up of military might in the region has led to worries of a rising risk of accidental collisions that could spark conflict.Zhu said that the decision to release a public report now was not China “preparing for war” but rather to avoid an “arms race” between China and the United States.(Reporting by Christian Shepherd; Editing by Nick Macfie)"

An investigation into the cause of the crash in the northern province of Semnan was continuing.Semnan provincial governor Mohammad Reza Khabbaz told Iranian television it appeared that atrain entering the Haft-Khan station on the outskirts of Shahroud plowed into another that had broken down there.“The initial investigation suggests that a mechanical failure, possibly caused by cold weather, forced the express train, operating between the cities of Tabriz and Mashhad, to stop (at Haft-Khan),” Khabbaz said.Tabriz state governor Rahim Shohratifar told Tasnim that the moving train had 400 passengers. It was not clear how many passengers were on the stationary train. Fars earlier reported that 100 passengers had been rescued.Semi-official Mehr news agency said four of the dead were railway employees aboard the trains.Iran’s rail network aged badly under economic sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear program, making it difficult to modernize rolling stock, and safety standards suffered.The sanctions were lifted in January after Iran reached a deal with world powers to limit its nuclear activity."

On Nov. 8, Election Day, Betras’ warning proved prescient - she lost Ohio and Pennsylvania and, on Wednesday, Michigan, too, based on the latest unofficial ballot counts.The surprising upset by Trump, a wealthy businessman who made his promises to renegotiate trade deals and restore jobs a centerpiece of his agenda, was fueled in part by support from white working-class voters in those vital Rust Belt states and elsewhere.After the disastrous election losses at the state and national level, Betras and other Rust Belt Democrats who have found success in blue-collar districts have some advice for their anxious party: the key to recapturing those voters is not a broad change in policy, but a new commitment to listen and act on their economic concerns, and to show Democrats care.“You can have all the great ideas on Earth, but if they don’t think you are on their side they aren’t going to listen to you,” said U.S. Representative Dan Kildee, of Flint, Michigan, one of a small cadre of Democrats in Congress who have learned how to win in working-class districts by emphasizing economic solutions.Democratic U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright, whose district around Scranton, Pennsylvania, was one of the presidential campaign’s prime battlegrounds, also won re-election to a third term with about 54 percent of the vote. About 40,000 Trump voters crossed over to back him, he said in an interview.“Why would they pick me and not also Hillary Clinton? It comes down to credibility,” he said. “I know the pain out there. When I talk to voters, jobs is always my No. 1 message, and I tell them exactly what I’m doing to get more jobs back to the district.”Recalling the 1992 presidential campaign theme of Clinton’s husband, Bill Clinton, Cartwright added: “It’s the economy, stupid. These folks are working harder and harder to try and stay in the same place.”The party’s efforts to regain lost ground with blue-collar voters could be a factor in next week’s election for Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Tim Ryan, whose northeast Ohio district encompasses blue-collar Youngstown, is challenging veteran leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.Ryan has emphasized his ability to talk to working class voters and said in announcing his leadership run that people “need to know we understand that they elected us to fight for economic opportunity for all.”Kildee, who was re-elected to a third term with 61 percent of the vote, said Democrats seeking lessons in the election rubble should not overreact and begin moderating their positions on social issues or shifting their stances to target elements of the party’s base of support.From decimated industrial towns to inner cities or the rural plains, voters share a similar anxiety about an economic system that seems to have left them behind, he said.“Everybody is talking about the same thing, and it’s economic uncertainty - it’s the fear of not having a job, or their kids not getting a job, or not having a retirement,” Kildee said. “If we aren’t talking about jobs and the economy first, no one is listening when you talk about other issues.”‘GOLD-PLATED TOILETS’By tapping into those economic worries, Trump captured about two-thirds of whites with no college degree, exit polls showed. That helped him gain the razor-thin margin of victory he needed in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan - all picked up by President Barack Obama in 2012 - to win the Electoral College, despite losing the popular vote.In contrast to Trump, whose rallies were a call to arms against an economic system rigged against everyday Americans, Clinton mentioned but rarely highlighted the many aspects of her economic agenda during the final weeks of the campaign.“We were so off message that a billionaire with gold-plated toilets was the guy who was breaking through and talking to blue-collar families,” said Betras, party chairman in Ohio’s heavily Democratic Mahoning County, where Trump captured 47 percent of the vote, 12 percentage points better than Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.Betras said many blue-collar workers increasingly felt forgotten by the national party, which at times seemed more focused on social and cultural issues than on bread-and-butter economic concerns.The Democratic National Committee did not respond to questions about the party’s efforts to win working-class voters.Betras had urged Clinton in his memo to spend more time talking about ways to entice companies to repatriate manufacturing jobs, or her plans to create jobs through boosting infrastructure programs - both key elements of Trump’s stump speech.Both candidates made frequent visits to Pennsylvania and Ohio. But after the party conventions in July Clinton only traveled to Michigan four times, twice in the last week of the campaign, and never visited Wisconsin. Trump hit both a half-dozen times.David Murray, a registered independent who lives just outside Flint, Michigan, said he voted to re-elect Kildee and backed Obama in 2008 and 2012, but cast his presidential ballot for Trump this time.“I didn’t feel like Clinton really cared about us,” said Murray, a personal service industry worker. “We are still hurting here. I feel as if we haven’t recovered from the economic free fall. Clinton seemed like just another four years of what Obama has done for my area, which is four years of nothing.”Obama appeared to echo the concerns of Betras and the two lawmakers in recent comments on the Democratic post-election hand-wringing.“The key for us — when I say ‘us,’ I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives — is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real, here’s how we fix them,” Obama said.Trump consistently outperformed Romney’s 2012 totals in areas with heavy concentrations of working-class whites. In Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, partially in Cartwright’s district, Trump won 58 percent of the vote compared to Romney’s 47 percent. In neighboring Lackawana County, Trump won 47 percent of the vote compared to Romney’s 36 percent.Sharon Taboada, a juvenile probation officer in Houghton Lake, Michigan, with two sons in college, said she voted for Trump in part because of his economic message.“Clinton talked very little about our economy and I feel she was way out of touch with the working force,” she said.(Reporting by John Whitesides, editing by Jason Szep and Ross Colvin)"

Outgoing President Barack Obama says he tried to convey the seriousness of his position to his successor during their Oval Office meeting on Nov. 10.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58371af41a00002500cc9acb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – What happens when a 70-year-old man whose bluster has rarely carried much consequence wins a job where his every syllable is dissected for meaning?America and the world are about to find out.In the past year, Donald Trump has mocked a journalist’s disability, bragged about the size of his genitalia on national television and suggested a political rival’s father assassinated former President John F. Kennedy. Just eight weeks ago, he told his millions of Twitter followers to “check out [the] sex tape” of a Miss Universe winner who said that Trump had bullied her when he owned the pageant.In less than 60 days, he is set to become president of the United States and commander-in-chief of the world’s most powerful armed forces ― where his every utterance will be scrutinized for its meaning and duly recorded for posterity.“He feels he could say something one minute and say the opposite the next,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “He’s going to do it around the world… There may be countries that call our bluff on that. In a nuclear world, that’s frightening.”One Republican National Committee member acknowledged that Trump’s unvarnished  tweets and off-the-cuff comments pose real risks. “Always potentially explosive and possibly very dangerous,” he said on condition of anonymity.That potential danger is something the outgoing President Barack Obama has said he has tried to impress upon Trump. “There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well, unless he recognizes them and corrects them,” Obama said in a Nov.14 news conference, four days after a 90-minute meeting with his successor at the White House.“Because when you’re a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial it has less impact than it does when you’re president of the United States,” Obama said. “Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move.” Trump’s often  inflammatory language during his 17-month campaign, of course, was preceded by decades of controversial remarks ― including several years of false claims that Obama may not have been born in the United States ― and repeated instances in which he reneged on his promises in business deals, leading to hundreds of lawsuits.His casual relationship with words is also something the RNC and his campaign advisers have been wrestling with for months. A major component of the strategy that let him win the presidency over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was to eliminate unscripted moments pretty much entirely. He has not held a news conference since July ― in which he yet again suggested that the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was somehow involved in the Kennedy assassination ― and only two brief press “gaggles” since then.Trump’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week was prefaced with the president-elect’s staff warning a top Abe aide that they should not take his statements during the campaign literally.And Trump’s extended interview with New York Times reporters and editors this week was reportedly opposed by his incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, because he believed the real estate businessman would be unprepared to answer some questions.As it happened, Trump indeed gave answers that strayed significantly from his previous positions. On climate change, he moved away from his earlier statement that it was all a Chinese hoax to allow that some portion of it was, in fact, related to human activity. On torturing captured terrorists, Trump said retired Gen. James Mattis, a Defense secretary candidate, talked him out of the policy because he advised that it was ineffective.And while effusively praising the Times as a “jewel,” Trump nevertheless returned to score-settling form by insulting Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who said she would not vote for him during her unsuccessful bid for re-election.Such unscripted talk comes on top of Trump’s return to controlling his Twitter feed, which he had either surrendered entirely or managed to use with discipline in the final days of his campaign. Just hours before his meeting with the Times, he attacked the paper as “failing” and accused it of covering him “inaccurately and with a nasty tone” under the erroneous belief that it had tried to change the ground rules of the interview on him. This was following days of attacks on the cast of the Broadway show “Hamilton,” after an actor spoke out to Vice President-elect Mike Pence about Trump’s commitment to protecting minorities.Historian Brinkley, for one, does not believe that Trump’s statements at The New York Times’ offices signal anything beyond a desire to win the approval of his audience at that particular moment. “The words of this guy just don’t matter,” he said. “I think we’re going to have to wait and see what his actions are and judge him by his record.”In any case, anyone in the United States or abroad who believes Trump is going to moderate his tone or message now that he’s won the White House is probably going to be disappointed, said one GOP consultant close to the campaign who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about the incoming president.“I think he doesn’t believe the rules apply to him, that he can craft a different kind of presidency,” the consultant said. “He comes by it honestly. He broke every rule and still won the election.”"
44,THE WORLDPOST,Philippines' Duterte Seeks Peace,"Marjorie Cohn, ContributorProfessor Emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philippines-duterte-seeks-peace_us_58385bcde4b050dfe6187b67,"“Duterte is not a saint, but he stands for an independent foreign policy.""",2016-11-25,"<p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte speaks upon his arrival at Davao International Airport in Davao city, Philippines, after returning from a leaders' summit in Peru of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), November 23, 2016.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58388c1f1a00000b03cc9c7b.jpeg?cache=w3ggARmxR7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In April 2016, Rodrigo Duterte won the Philippine presidential election by a landslide, with more than 6 million votes. He openly declared that he was the nation’s first Left president, calling himself a socialist but not a communist. So far, his regime has been controversial, to put it mildly.The U.S. press has focused on Duterte’s vicious war on drugs that claimed upwards of 2,000 lives and led to the incarceration of tens of thousands of people. His decision to allow former Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos’s burial in the National Cemetery of the Heroes also has drawn the ire of those who recall Marcos’s brutal two-decade regime that killed more than 3,000, tortured tens of thousands, and stole $10 billion from the Philippines.But, significantly, Duterte is engaging with revolutionary forces in the peace process that aims to end 47 years of armed struggle against the repressive Filipino government. And Duterte has taken actions that, for the first time, challenge the longstanding military and economic power of the United States in the Philippines.Peace Process With OppositionSince 1969, a civil war has been raging in the Philippines. The roots of the armed conflict can be traced to the colonial and neocolonial domination of the Philippines by the Spanish, then U.S. imperialism, feudal exploitation by big landlords and capitalist interests, as well as widespread bureaucratic corruption. After Duterte’s election, he cited peace as a top priority of his administration, vowing to engage in peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).According to JustPeacePH, an international platform that supports the Philippine peace process and takes its name from its Internet site, “justpeace.ph,” “The daily, systematic and systemic injustice experienced by the people drive them to desire and seek fundamental changes in society through various means. But because the forces against fundamental social change use all means including the instruments and violence of the state to defend the status quo, many Filipinos over many generations have embraced armed struggle to overthrow the ruling system.”The NDFP “is the alliance of progressive forces seeking to bring about fundamental change in the existing social system in the Philippines through armed revolution,” JustPeacePH states in its Primer on Just and Lasting Peace in the Philippines. The NDFP alliance includes trade unions, peasants, youth, women, national minorities, teachers, health workers, religious clergy, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and the New People’s Army.Duterte’s Peace InitiativeTwo rounds of peace negotiations have already occurred since Duterte took office, with a third scheduled for January 2017 in Oslo, Norway.In May, Duterte declared he would release all political prisoners, which number more than 400, through a presidential declaration of amnesty, provided both houses of congress approve. Nineteen NDFP consultants, who have been involved in the revolutionary movement for years, have already been released.Duterte offered four cabinet positions to the CPP, but they declined, stating there must first be a comprehensive peace agreement. The CPP, however, recommended a veteran peasant leader who was appointed Secretary of Agrarian Reform and a veteran academic activist leader who was named secretary of social welfare and development.“These are major appointments,” Luis Jalandoni, NDFP’s Senior Adviser on the Peace Negotiating Panel, told me at a recent conference of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Lisbon, Portugal.NDFP has a people’s army and organs of political power with mass organizations in 71 out of the 81 provinces in the country, Jalandoni said. He noted that landlessness and poverty afflict the 100 million people in the Philippines.“The NDFP insists on addressing the roots of the armed conflict in order to achieve a just and lasting peace,” Jalandoni said.The demands in the peace talks are: Release of all political prisoners; Land reform for the peasantry (70% of the population); National industrialization to develop the economy using available human and natural resources; Protect the environment and ancestral lands of the indigenous peoples; and Philippine national sovereignty and abrogation of all unequal treaties with the United States.Challenging U.S. PowerU.S. domination and interference in the Philippines date back to 1898, when the United States annexed the Philippines. The U.S. continued to exercise colonial rule over the country until 1946, when the Philippines gained its independence although the United States retained many military installations there and the Filipino economy maintained its dependence on the U.S.With U.S. assistance, Marcos ruled the Philippines with an iron fist from 1965 through 1986, under martial law from 1972 to 1981. In 2002, the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo government developed Oplan Bantay Laya, a counterinsurgency program modeled on U.S. strategies. After 9/11, the Bush administration gave Arroyo $100 million to fund that campaign in the Philippines. The government of Benigno Aquino III continued the program in 2011 under the name Oplan Bayanihan.Oplan Bayanihan led to large numbers of extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture and cruel treatment. Many civilians, including children, have been killed. Philippine military and paramilitary death squads murdered hundreds of members of progressive organizations. Communities and leaders opposed to large-scale and invasive mining have been targeted. Even ordinary people with no political affiliation have not escaped the government’s reign of terror.From 2001 to 2010, the U.S. government provided more than $507 in military assistance to the Philippine government, facilitating tremendous repression.Between 2010 and 2015, the Philippine police, military and paramilitary forces perpetrated extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, illegal arrests and forced evacuation, many to enable extraction by mining companies.The 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which President Barack Obama negotiated with Duterte’s predecessor, gave U.S. troops the right to prolonged deployment in the Philippines. The agreement is widely seen in the Philippines as a threat to the country’s sovereignty.In September 2016, Duterte declared, “I am not a fan of the Americans … Filipinos should be first before everybody else.” He added, “In our relations to the world, the Philippines will pursue an independent foreign policy. I repeat: The Philippines will pursue an independent foreign policy.”The United States has not apologized for all the atrocities it committed against the Filipino people, Duterte said. Responding to U.S. criticism of the Philippines for its human rights violations, he stated, “Why are you Americans killing the black people there, shooting them down when they are already on the ground.”Duterte promised to end joint military maneuvers with U.S. forces and expel the hundreds of U.S. troops currently stationed in the Philippines. He also expressed his intention to end bilateral agreements concluded by his predecessor with the United States and reverse permission for the United States’ use of five Philippine military bases.“I will break up with America,” Duterte said. “I would rather go to Russia and to China.” He vowed to rescind joint patrols with U.S. and Filipino forces against Chinese expansion in the disputed South China Sea. Indeed, Duterte recently traveled to China and secured valuable fishing rights for Filipinos in the South China Sea.Hope for Peace ProspectsIn an unprecedented development, both the government and the opposition declared unilateral ceasefires in August. But there are still problems with the government’s ceasefire, says Jalandoni, as Duterte doesn’t have full control of the military. The military and paramilitary forces, which are protected by the military, have engaged in several violations that imperil the ceasefire, he said.“There is high optimism that the peace talks will prosper under the presidency of Duterte,” according to JustPeacePH. “Unlike past presidents who harbor strong anti-communist bias, Duterte seems capable of rethinking the government’s peace strategy since he claims to be a socialist.”Opposition forces are not uncritical of the excesses in Duterte’s war on drugs. The CCP declared the campaign is becoming anti-people and anti-democratic. Due process must be respected, human rights must be upheld; the drug users and small drug dealers, who come from poverty, require rehabilitation and care, the CCP maintains.“Understandably, Duterte’s war on drugs and other crimes is given more coverage by the global media,” JustPeacePH wrote in its primer. “But Duterte’s aim to establish a lasting peace in the provinces deserves even more attention as this strikes at the root causes of the problem of illegal drugs and related crimes.”Jalandoni said, “Duterte is not a saint, but he stands for an independent foreign policy. His stand against the United States is respected and has received a lot of support.”The NDFP, Jalandoni noted, says that “if there are threats against Duterte by U.S. imperialism, the Left will be a reliable ally to him,” adding, “He is the first president to stand up to the United States.”Marjorie Cohn is professor emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, former president of the National Lawyers Guild, and deputy secretary general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.

45,WEIRD NEWS,Artist Turns Random Dog Poops Into Donald Trump Art Installation,David Moye,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dog-poop_us_583622a4e4b01ba68ac4212b,He has designs on making 'Trump' a new word for dookies.,2016-11-25,Florida artist Allan Adler is putting Trump photos around the dop poop in his Miami Beach neighborhood.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583623781700002500e7c27a.png?cache=tG3LqlScAO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A graphic designer in Miami Beach has designs on turning Donald Trump’s last name into a new euphemism for “poop.”The way he’s doing it will strike many as crappy: He’s putting Trump’s face and, occasionally, his quotes on pieces of dog poop he sees around his South Beach neighborhood.Every day, the artist, who goes by the name “Allan Adler” to avoid detection, walks around looking for pieces of dog crap suitable for his purposes. “I don’t want it too old,” he told The Huffington Post. Once he finds a piece of poop that fits his purposes, Adler sticks a toothpick with Trump’s face glued to it into the doggy defecation. Sometimes, he adds one of Trump’s infamous quotes, “such as ‘grab her by the pussy’ or ‘I like soldiers who weren’t captured.’” Then he photographs the Trumped-up dog poop and posts it on Facebook at “Pieces Of Trump.”The end result not only is a commentary on people who don’t bother to clean up after their pets, but also a subtle suggestion on what kind of president Adler believes Trump will be. Spoiler alert: Adler doesn’t think he’ll be a good one. “He’s a piece of shit,” Adler explained. “When Trump won, I was depressed, but my friends said, ‘Don’t be. Now is the time to get your voice heard.’” And his way of doing that is through dog poop. “He’s said a lot of crappy things and I still can’t understand how someone who’s said things like this could get elected,” Adler said. Adler first started doodoo-ing his poop protests November 15. He has averaged one a day since then.The “installations,” as he calls them, are easy since “there is literally dog poop everywhere here ― it’s a big problem here.”Still, Adler is seeing benefits from the project.“It’s been therapeutic for me,” he said. “I can laugh about the situation and I’m not super depressed. It’s hilarious because you know everyone who is picking one up is a Trump supporter.”There have been some embarrassing moments too.“I haven’t been caught put his face on the poop, but I’ve been caught taking photos of them and I get weird looks,” Adler laughed.Adler has two big goals for his lowbrow protest.First, he’d like to make Trump’s last name into an alternative for defecation, such as “That’s a bunch of Trump” or “I almost stepped in that Trump.”Second, he hopes to join “SNL” and the “Hamilton” cast as the subject of Trump twitter storm.“I am worried about hate mail, but it would be funny if Trump commented on it,” Adler said. “It’s possible he could get unhinged about it.”"
46,GREEN,"Even When A Leopard Cub Dies, These Filmmakers Don't Turn The Cameras Off",Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-geographic-savage-kingdom_us_58384146e4b000af95ee17a1,"""It's not all happy endings, it's not Bambis and rainbows.""",2016-11-25,"A leopard dubbed ""Torn Ear,"" featured in Nat Geo WILD's miniseries ""Savage Kingdom.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583841a21a00000b03cc9c00.jpeg?cache=9drNAfmeWM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the biggest lies you’ve ever been told is that Simba lives.Without a parent, alone on the plains of Africa, a lion cub will almost certainly die before he can find an all-you-can-eat grub buffet. It’s not sad, it’s reality, and like Disney, most wildlife films spare viewers the gritty details if the cub in peril is cute, cuddly or popular on the stuffed animal circuit.Not so for Brad Bestelink, the filmmaker behind a new miniseries from Nat Geo WILD called “Savage Kingdom.” Bestelink and his crew are based in northern Botswana, one of the world’s last remaining wild places where lions, leopards, hyenas and hippos roam free, kill each other and struggle to protect their own.“They’re mothers, they’re fathers, they are families like you and I. They fight every day just to keep their offspring alive and to keep themselves and their entire families fed,” Bestelink told me during a visit to Chobe National Park, one of the shooting locations for the series.“Savage Kingdom” is a different kind of wildlife film ― in nearly every episode, something cute dies. A leopard cub you watch grow up for 40 minutes is in the wrong place at the wrong time. A young lion gets mauled to death by his overeager family members. An unfortunate warthog piglet becomes a quick snack.His crew at Natural History Film Unit Botswana, a ragtag family of conservationists from nearly every continent, have one mission in mind when they go out to film: tell the real story, avoid embellishment and don’t lie.It’s a rough task. The crew often spends weeks at a time out in the bush filming and they form strong bonds with the animals. Richard Uren, a lead cameraman for the series, said at times it feels like the filmmakers are basically “one of the pride” and lions will occasionally stroll up and nap in the shade of their trucks.But when an animal gets killed, especially one they’re attached to, the crew mourns.“You get to know these animals so well, we’ve watched them grow up,” Uren, more of a “leopard guy,” said. But the cameras keep rolling, and Bestelink (a “lion guy”) said it’s this stark reality, this unvarnished look that shows animals “in a way you’ll inherently respect.”“I think it’s important to make sure it’s honest and it’s real and it’s raw,” he said. “We try to make sure that part of that portrayal is it’s not all happy endings, it’s not Bambis and rainbows. We’re talking about revenge, we’re talking about jealousy, we’re talking about power [and] kingdoms. It’s something that anyone can understand.”And the location couldn’t be more harsh.Botswana is one of the few countries in Africa with self-managed wildlife populations that live in unfenced national parks. The country has become a haven for animals, so much so that some scientists have warned there may soon be too many elephants in the country for nature to support. About 130,000 now live within its borders, the most anywhere on the planet.But African wildlife has been having a rough time lately.

It’s not sad, it’s reality, and like Disney, most wildlife films spare viewers the gritty details if the cub in peril is cute, cuddly or popular on the stuffed animal circuit.Not so for Brad Bestelink, the filmmaker behind a new miniseries from Nat Geo WILD called “Savage Kingdom.” Bestelink and his crew are based in northern Botswana, one of the world’s last remaining wild places where lions, leopards, hyenas and hippos roam free, kill each other and struggle to protect their own.“They’re mothers, they’re fathers, they are families like you and I. They fight every day just to keep their offspring alive and to keep themselves and their entire families fed,” Bestelink told me during a visit to Chobe National Park, one of the shooting locations for the series.“Savage Kingdom” is a different kind of wildlife film ― in nearly every episode, something cute dies. A leopard cub you watch grow up for 40 minutes is in the wrong place at the wrong time. A young lion gets mauled to death by his overeager family members. An unfortunate warthog piglet becomes a quick snack.His crew at Natural History Film Unit Botswana, a ragtag family of conservationists from nearly every continent, have one mission in mind when they go out to film: tell the real story, avoid embellishment and don’t lie.It’s a rough task. The crew often spends weeks at a time out in the bush filming and they form strong bonds with the animals. Richard Uren, a lead cameraman for the series, said at times it feels like the filmmakers are basically “one of the pride” and lions will occasionally stroll up and nap in the shade of their trucks.But when an animal gets killed, especially one they’re attached to, the crew mourns.“You get to know these animals so well, we’ve watched them grow up,” Uren, more of a “leopard guy,” said. But the cameras keep rolling, and Bestelink (a “lion guy”) said it’s this stark reality, this unvarnished look that shows animals “in a way you’ll inherently respect.”“I think it’s important to make sure it’s honest and it’s real and it’s raw,” he said. “We try to make sure that part of that portrayal is it’s not all happy endings, it’s not Bambis and rainbows. We’re talking about revenge, we’re talking about jealousy, we’re talking about power [and] kingdoms. It’s something that anyone can understand.”And the location couldn’t be more harsh.Botswana is one of the few countries in Africa with self-managed wildlife populations that live in unfenced national parks. The country has become a haven for animals, so much so that some scientists have warned there may soon be too many elephants in the country for nature to support. About 130,000 now live within its borders, the most anywhere on the planet.But African wildlife has been having a rough time lately. Some 30,000 elephants and 1,200 rhinos are killed every year across the continent by poachers looking for a quick payday. And African lions face extinction by mid-century without fierce conservation efforts.Bestelink said the role of a project like “Savage Kingdom” is to get past these statistics and simply make people care about wildlife again.

51,BUSINESS,6 Simple Ways to Motivate Yourself to Work Even if You Don't Feel Like it,"Vicky Law, ContributorFreelance Writer, Content Marketer, Social Media Junkie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-simple-ways-to-motivate_1_b_13208960.html,,2016-11-25,2016-11-23-1479908750-9232520-howtomotivateyourselfforwork.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-23-1479908750-9232520-howtomotivateyourselfforwork-thumb.jpg," Image CreditYou know that feeling where you have everything you need to have a productive day at work but for some reason you can't get yourself to move a muscle? Don't worry. You're not the only person who has felt that way. You may have an ideal work space in the perfect location, furnished and decorated in a way to get you in the right vibe to work. But it is not enough. There are other factors that will help get you in the mood to be productive. Here are ways you can jumpstart your day and motivate yourself to get in the groove of working. 1. Start your day with a positive affirmation Positive affirmations have the power to set you in the right frame of mind especially where you lack inspiration or you're not in the frame of mind to do anything. The idea behind positive affirmation is to direct your mind to positive thoughts. When your thoughts are focused on the positive, your body will follow suit. Positive affirmations like ""I'm full of energy to work"" or ""I am productive"" will help you re-orientate your mind to that area. As you keep repeating it to yourself, you'll gradually find yourself cultivating the desire to work. 2. Go through your goalsYour goals are what you desire to achieve within a particular period of time. Reviewing your goals whenever you lack the motivation to work will bring back to mind what you want to achieve. Doing this will help rekindle your zeal to start working.Sometimes the reason why people lose inspiration to work is because they temporarily lost focus of their goals. Reviewing your goals will help you know your progress and how much that needs to be done to achieve your goals. 3. Have a to-do listKnowing what exactly you need to accomplish during the day will keep you focused in the exact tasks that need to be completed. Do not write more than 3-5 items on your to-do list. Having a long to-do list may make you feel more overwhelmed instead of motivated. As you write your to-do list make sure you break down the exact steps you need to take to achieve each task. This will act as your plan of action. As you take each step and tick it off your to-do list you build momentum and you become more confident that you'll finish each item on your list. This makes you more eager to keep working. 4. Set deadlinesSetting realistic deadlines will help push you to start work and make sure you have it done. Without a deadline your work will continue lying on your desk and you'll never feel like working on it. With a deadline, you have a reason to make sure it's finished. Deadlines not only push you to complete your tasks, they also help you prioritize your activities. You'll know what to work on and how much time you'll dedicate to it. It'll prevent you from giving room to distractions. The reason why having a deadline is so effective is that even if you were not in the mood to work, you'll force yourself to get started. This is because your deadline keeps you in mind that not completing your task at the stated time or date will attract some sort of punishment. This will move you to keep going. On the flip side, as you complete your tasks before the deadlines you'll experience a feeling of accomplishment and you'll be more motivated to do the next task. 5. Get yourself an accountability partnerWhen you have someone who checks up on you and your progress, you'll be moved to make sure to get your work done. An accountability partner is someone who will keep you accountable to your promise to complete your tasks or goal. What binds you is the promise to get your work done. Once you make that promise your accountability partner will keep you in check. Anyone can act as an accountability partner so long as they keep checking on your progress and they are accessible enough for you to give report about your progress. 6. Change your work environment Sometimes a change of scene is what you need to kick you into action. Going to the same place to work everyday may start dampening your spirits. A fresh new environment could make all the difference. If you have the possibility to work somewhere else, try working in a coffee shop for a day, at the park or even a lobby of a luxurious hotel. The new environment will give you a new sense of inspiration so that when you go back to your usual desk you would feel refreshed. If you can't leave the 4 walls of your office, try and improvise. Clear up your cluttered desk, rearrange your office items, bring a potted plant or flower to put on your desk, or sit at the right side instead of the left side. Little changes such as those could help you see things in a new perspective and get you to be more productive."

However, knowing what to do as well as how to go about selling your business will definitely put the odds in your favor. The sale of your business might be your exit strategy or wealth building plan. Whatever reason it is, selling a business can be an emotional issue which you have got to prepare for adequately. When you decide to sell your business, there are things you have to be aware of. They will go a long way in preparing you for the process and help you do it right. I recently had a one on one interview with TejPrakash, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Should I Sign Inc. In the course of the interview, he shared some tips on how to maximize the chances of success in selling a business. This article is based on five of the issues we discussed. 1. Be Fully Aware of Your Business's valueOne of the reasons most participants don't get a deal in the popular show, Shark Tank , have to do with wrong business valuation. Trying to sell your business without having adequate knowledge of its real value could negatively impact the success of such transaction. The first, and probably the most important step to figure out in your bid to successfully sell your business is to determine what buyers are really looking for. What are the buyer's considerations when seeking for a business to buy? Majorly, there are three methods to assess a business's value:• Income Approach:  Simply, this is the present net value of the business's income stream.• Asset Approach:  The sum of all the assets and liabilities of the business.• Market Approach:  This approach involves analyzing other similar companies and determining their selling price. Most people go with whichever of these methods gives the best and highest valuation. Although, these approaches give a rough idea of the value of your business, bear it in mind that they only serve as a guide. There are many other factors that could play into the final value of your business.2. Profit Matters to Your Buyers, Not RevenueMost people believe that buyers are impressed with revenue. This is not the case with most buyers. Although revenue sounds lovely, a buyer is usually more interested in the profit. Consider these two business scenarios. Business A $60,000 monthly revenue, $55,000 monthly expenses, and $60,000 annual profit.Business B $30,000 monthly revenue, $20,000 monthly expenses, and $120,000 annual profit.While the monthly revenue for the first business is twice the second business, the real profit is only half. Thus, the size of the profit matters more to experienced buyers than the total revenue. 3. Don't live in the PastWhen it comes to selling your business, the past success is grossly irrelevant. Past success even becomes more irrelevant if your business has been struggling of late. Buyers are more interested in the current performance, most especially the last 12 months. Besides, the future sustainability as well as viability also matters. Most sellers often bombard their buyers with news of how successful their business was in times past, and emphasizing that all they require is a little effort to get it back on track. As interesting and promising as the above sounds, buyers are not seeing it your way. Fixing and recovering your business is not their headache especially if they are expected to pay a premium. However, if the business has been making substantial steady growth over the years, be proud to show it. More often than not, growing revenue and profit figure attract buyers. This is particularly helpful if future plans for the business has been made, based on realistic past performance. Having future plans ready makes it easy for the buyers to see how revenue and profit will grow upon the sale. I believe this is what happened with the acquisition of J. D. Byrider by Altamont Capital Partners in 2011. Within the two years of the acquisition this buy here pay here dealerships company was able to add 33 more locations to their operations. Selling your business can be in the best interest of the business, however, it is important to have a comprehensive future plans at hand during the sale.4. Prepare to answer a lot of Questions. Unless you employ the services of a broker that will handle questions and vet your buyers, trying to sell yourself will lead to a lot of questions. So, it is important to be adequately prepared for whatever question might come your way. Before any buyer will sign any independent contractor agreement with you, expect to be scrutinized. Expect buyers to know the history of the business, the size, the valuation and many other details. But one question that always comes up which you should adequately prepare for is why. Why are you selling your business?How you answer this might break or make a deal. However, this question is an opportunity to pitch the appeal and value of your business. Be aware of why exactly you are selling and be able to communicate your reasons. Whatever your reason, providing a motivating angle is necessary to sustain the buyer's interest. 5. Buyers will not pay more for potentials More often than not, some business owners believe they have a potential gold mine and expect to command a huge selling price. This kind of thinking assumes that price is based on perceived potential only. This makes sense if you are buying loose diamonds for its potential, not when you are selling a business. A business needs to have a proven revenue stream before it can be of any value to a potential buyer. Business owners should note that if prospective buyers are interested in building a business from the scratch, there are numerous resources that can be used. Buyers are interested in something successful both in theory and practice not just a concept waiting to be proved."

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb837b32200004301dd47c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump has made no utterance since his election about who he will tap to fill the Antonin Scalia vacancy on the High Court. However, this hasn't stopped others from endlessly speculating about just who that might be. Names have been tossed out all over the place. The consensus being that it could be a moderate conservative who would have the best chance of getting confirmed with a minimum of rancor. That's certainly a possibility. But it's not likely. Trump has already tipped his hand once when he said his ideal justices are Clarence Thomas and Scalia. He lionized Scalia during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention and again in a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. The other tip is the list of nearly a dozen names of his potential court picks he got with lots of help from the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation that he made public last May. He added a few more names in September that include a woman, a Hispanic, Asian, and an African-American judge. But this is mostly for cosmetic and image massaging purposes. Those on the original list were almost all white males, and hard line opponents of abortion, same-sex marriage, voting rights expansion, and increased federal regulations. The names that he added as a sop to diversity are cut from the same cloth as those on his first list. Trump's pick will be another judge exactly as he said in the mold of Scalia and Thomas. Said Trump,"" This list is definitive and I will choose only from it in picking future justices of the United States Supreme Court."" This is just the start. Trump almost certainly will have the chance to pick one maybe two more justices during his term replacing the two aging liberal and a moderate judges on the court. They also will not just be garden variety strict constructionists, but activists and influencers on the bench. They will be judges who won't just base their rulings on the standard conservative playbook, but will cajole, hector and badger other judges to toe the hard-conservative line in their rulings. And who will have the gall when it suits their purpose not even to try and hide it. GOP Vice Presidential contender Mike Pence made the Trump-Scalia axis official when he vowed to a campaign crowd in Michigan during the campaign that Trump's High Court pick would hit the bench with the practically sworn duty to slam down the curtain on Roe v. Wade. Pence didn't stop there. He repeatedly vowed that Trump would appoint strict constructionists in his appointments and not just for a Scalia type judicial hit on abortion rights. Pence reflected the brute truth that the Supreme Court has since the 1960s been the political jewel in the crown for staunch conservatives. The court became the right's main prize during the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren. The right-wing routinely railed at the Warren court for its liberal rulings upholding and expanding civil and voting rights, labor, environmental and civil liberties protections, abortion, and reining in the corporate abuses. Conservatives viewed the high court as an unapologetic advocate of activist liberalism, and loathed it for it. The far right repeatedly screamed for Warren's head with signs that popped up along the highways throughout the South and the Heartland, ""Impeach Earl Warren.""The right plainly wanted more judges on the bench who would rigidly toe the ultra-conservative line. The court became even more important as a political tool for the conservative remake of the country when it became clear that just having more conservatives in the Senate and the House was not enough to roll back the gains in civil, women's and labor rights of the past half century. Democrats even as the minority in Congress could obstruct or outright kill legislation through the filibuster. And with the nation's population and voter demographics rapidly changing with more minorities, women, same sex, and youth, who were mostly Democrats, and implacably hostile to conservative positions, this could put more spine in Democrats to stand firm against the machinations of conservatives in Congress.The right correctly saw the Supreme Court not just as a neutral arbiter to settle legal disputes. It was a lethal weapon to skirt congressional gridlock and serve a dual role as a judicial and legislative body. This meant scrapping the long-standing tradition on the court where justices based their legal decisions solely on the merit of the law, constitutional principles and the public good, and not ideology. Trump and his hard-right conservative backers are fully aware that the court's power to be de facto legislators could last for decades. After all presidents and congresspersons come and go, but justices can sit there until death if they choose. Scalia and Thomas are proof of that. Scalia sat for 30 years and Thomas has sat on the bench for a quarter century.Trump will be as good as his word in picking another Scalia for the high court. The Supreme Court is too much the right's jewel in the crown not to.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

It was the first time I really had a conversation, or was willing to, about the election and President-elect Trump. Both of my friends are successful professional men. Rob is in his 50s, and Jonathan just turned 60. Both men, like me, happen to be gay. And like me they have families and friends and colleagues who love them. Our conversation, however, explored these same relatives and friends who profess their love for us, and in some cases their own devout Christianity, but who for mysterious reasons, or perhaps in veiled hypocrisy, voted for Trump. ""I think there's a disconnect,"" I said. ""What's that called? Cognitive dissonance? I don't think they realize their vote has serious ramifications for people they claim to love.""""They're voting against us!"" Jonathan replied. ""They don't realize the impact their actions now have on our daily life. On our safety! I've always been an optimist but for the first time in my 60 years I am frightened.""""Thanksgiving dinner is sure going to be interesting at my parents' house,"" Rob said. Our discussion turned to the upcoming holiday dinners with family. Rob continued, ""I know friends who for the first time in their life are not joining their families for the holidays because of the election. They don't feel welcome in their own family home.""""There'll probably be 40 or 50 family members at my cousins' house for Thanksgiving,"" Jonathan said. ""If the dinner table conversation turns to politics, if any of them start singing the praises of Trump, I'm getting up from the table and leaving. I'm not engaging them."" ""Think about that,"" I said. ""Look at where we are as a society. Family members pitted against one another. The rhetoric, the misinformation, the concerted effort to fool with fake news, it's infiltrated the American family holiday dining table. How do we come back from that?"" My friends shook their heads in resigned disillusionment. The ongoing conversation delved into our experiences of growing up gay and struggling with our sexual orientation. We three shared stories from our teenage years and young adulthood, even as out middle aged gay men common tales of being rebuked by certain relatives, ostracized at school and in church, admonished by a particular pastor or congregant member, leaving a beloved house of worship because after coming out ""queer"" we were no longer welcome. We shared instances when the illogical and condescending condemnation ""love the sinner--hate the sin"" was used to placate us, or those moments when good God-fearing folks damned us to ""an eternity burning in Hell."" One particular heart-wrenching story was one in which my friend Rob's father said to him, ""The news of your coming out is going to kill your mother. You just need to lie to her. Tell her it's not true. You need to think about your kids. Her grandchildren."" When those relatives, friends, and colleagues who have in the past invited us to be their house-guests, best men in their weddings, godfathers to their newborns, and into their family fold, did they consider on November 8th what it must be like to grow up and struggle with these messages, these indictments against one's inherent orientation? Did these people who profess to love us think about our safety as American citizens when they pulled the lever for Trump? How his emboldened followers could take the win as permission to berate, beat, and even murder us?I don't think they understand. I don't think they get it. How could they? Or do they even want to know? At least from my perspective I have no clue about the very real struggle of women, immigrants, or black men. I only have empathy. Empathy it seems, in a post-election world, is not enough. Rob, Jonathan, and I share similar versions of the same story. The same story we've heard from others over and over and over again in our now beleaguered and brokenhearted post-election LGBT community. These stories, our stories, need to be told. ""We carried these experiences, theses negative voices, these heartaches and pain, our repressed anger, a parent's condemnation, the 1980s preacher who said on Sunday that ""AIDS was God's punishment against homosexuality"", all of this we carried with us into the voting booth on Tuesday, November 8th. I don't think our relatives and friends know this,"" I said.""What did they carry with them?"" Jonathan asked. ""I have no idea. But I do know that we must tell our stories.""Women, immigrants, the black community, Hispanics and yes, even the non-college educated heterosexual white American male, all of us must tell our stories. How else can we begin conversations, open-minded dialogue, and to understand one another? Currently, I am the walking embodiment of the southern Indiana gay guy who lost his boyfriend. And by lost I mean we broke up. Well, he broke up with me. It wasn't a long relationship but it was passionate--both fire and ice. For months prior I could sense its demise. So could he. I hold no anger or animosity. I wish no ill will. Ours was a fish vs. bird world. Our break-up came after a whirlwind summer book tour of my novel Some Go Hungry published by Kaylie Jones Books, an imprint of Akashic Books, and right before the November 2016 Miami Book Fair--the largest in the nation. It also occurred in tandem with our presidential election. To be honest, my disposition over the last several weeks wasn't panel discussion book fair worthy and a trip to Miami from my rural southern Indiana home seemed... well, lets just say the timing was off. After the breakup--and given the outcome of our presidential election--I felt akin to someone standing on the precipice of despair. I found no solace in the fact that our country broke up too. That Uncle Sam was now having an affair with a fascist xenophobe. It's not like I could meet Lady Liberty out for drinks so we could bash our ex-boyfriends over Mojitos. (Do they even know how to make Mojitos in Middle America?) No. It was just me standing there that Wednesday morning peering into the abyss of despair. ""I don't know this world in which I'm living. Maybe I should just jump."" That afternoon I sought out a moment of solitude. I sat myself down on a park bench under some pine trees, the palms of my hands open and placed upon my lap, my head tilted toward the sky, my eyes focused. I summoned the Universe, God, my ancestors, spirit guides, guardian angels, and anyone else willing to listen. We took a meeting. I call them 'my people.' ""I don't know what to do,"" I said aloud. ""I need assistance. Guidance. Do I belong here?"" The very next day I got my answer.I imagine my people meeting in a sky-high boardroom with 360-degree vistas sitting at a large round white table with white chairs. There is a dry erase board, lots of yellow legal pads, manila folders with my name on them--first name last--and one rather goofy but incredibly determined intern with his Trapper Keeper. He also keeps the minutes. Surprisingly there are no laptops. No cell phones. No digital anything. When information is requested it just appears. ""It's Redmond, again,"" I imagine the intern saying. I wonder sometimes, if in the eyes of my people, I am like the relentless deli or dry cleaner customer that insists on repeatedly ringing the service bell. Like the intern, I too am determined. He likes that about me. He's got my back.Arriving in Miami, I took the afternoon to walk around my old haunts. I felt like I'd come home. The parable of the prodigal son came to mind -- the lesson about suffering physical, emotional, and/or spiritual hunger (Luke 15:17). It is also about the resulting recognition of one's blessings and being grateful for what one is given. In it is the phrase, ""And he came unto himself."" I started to feel myself coming back into my very being.The next day, in the authors' hospitality suite at the Miami Book Fair I was introduced to and schmoozing in the company of literary icons such as Terry McMillan and Jay MacInerney, just to name a few. Even Senator Bob Graham was there. Dave Barry, whose Miami Herald columns I've followed for years but whom I never had the pleasure of meeting, was in attendance with his daughter. She attended the Miami Dade Public School where I taught English/Language Arts/Composition for 12 of the 16 years I lived in south Florida. Upon our introduction Dave Barry said, ""You're a legend at my daughter's school."" Wait. What? Dave Barry just called ME a legend? How in the hell did I end up here? Oh, right. My people. I came to myself. And I realized I was with all races, creeds, colors, genders, and orientations. There we were, all of us, in one room, authors from all over the world enjoying each other's company, laughing, talking, eating, drinking, meeting one another, shaking hands, hugging old friends and new acquaintances. The excitement was palpable and positive. Everyone was there to share his or her story with one another and the world. I realized that this Some Go Hungry journey of mine is in part about appreciation, gratitude, and counting my blessings. I am grateful for the time I spent with my southern Indiana boyfriend and the detour that relationship took me on; I am grateful that 49% of the country voted for progress and civil liberties for all; I am grateful for Kaylie Jones, Barbara J. Taylor, and Akashic Books. And, I am grateful for Mitch Kaplan and the Miami Book Fair. All of these people, these organizations, have reminded me that writing is my passion. So is teaching. I am most comfortable in my own skin when I am reading, learning, teaching, and writing. It is what I am meant to do. It is the path I am meant to pursue.As for Uncle Sam and his new relationship? I give it a year. He'll come to himself.Aside from my snarky comment about Uncle Sam--which I find some humor in given that Uncle Sam is having a homosexual affair with the President-elect--my story is about rejection, asking a higher power for help, an epiphany, and ultimately recognizing one's blessings and calling. It's a story about being grateful. What woman, immigrant, black man, or even non-college educated white male hasn't had the same feelings as I? Been in a similar situation? We each have more in common than we sometimes care to admit. Why then the divisiveness? Why the outright refusal to consider another's struggle? To think about others in terms of our own struggles? To listen to someone else's story?The title of my novel Some Go Hungry comes from Paul's letter to the Corinthians. He speaks about the divisiveness within the church, how members are only looking out for their individual selves and allowing others to go hungry. It is prophetic not only in terms of today's church but in terms of our contemporary society. I believe with all of my heart that telling our stories helps each of us find common ground, that in storytelling there has always been healing.Like my friend Jonathan will I walk away from my family's holiday table in the event a discussion about the election, or Trump, infiltrates the festivities? I don't know.Like my friend Rob will I avoid certain relatives, friends, and colleagues because they voted for Trump?I don't know.Am I willing to listen to someone I love with an open-mind, to hear of their own struggles, pain, humiliation, hurt, anger, and try to imagine what their daily life must be like? To consider if my actions in some way exacerbate their pain, or put their life in jeopardy? Will I ask myself if they feel safe in their family holiday home? At work? In their neighborhood?Yes.I will listen. And I will try to find common ground with them. I will try to ensure that those whom I love do not go hungry, both figuratively and literally. All I am asking as well as my friends Rob and Jonathan, and by proxy those within the LGBT community, is that those same relatives, friends, and colleagues who voted for Trump take the time to listen to us, to consider our struggle and to hear our stories with an open mind. It is, I believe, the only thing that will save us.Check out SomeGoHungry.com and follow J. Patrick Redmond on Facebook. J. Patrick Redmond, Kaylie Jones, and Barbara J. Taylor  J.

It was the first time I really had a conversation, or was willing to, about the election and President-elect Trump. Both of my friends are successful professional men. Rob is in his 50s, and Jonathan just turned 60. Both men, like me, happen to be gay. And like me they have families and friends and colleagues who love them. Our conversation, however, explored these same relatives and friends who profess their love for us, and in some cases their own devout Christianity, but who for mysterious reasons, or perhaps in veiled hypocrisy, voted for Trump. ""I think there's a disconnect,"" I said. ""What's that called? Cognitive dissonance? I don't think they realize their vote has serious ramifications for people they claim to love.""""They're voting against us!"" Jonathan replied. ""They don't realize the impact their actions now have on our daily life. On our safety! I've always been an optimist but for the first time in my 60 years I am frightened.""""Thanksgiving dinner is sure going to be interesting at my parents' house,"" Rob said. Our discussion turned to the upcoming holiday dinners with family. Rob continued, ""I know friends who for the first time in their life are not joining their families for the holidays because of the election. They don't feel welcome in their own family home.""""There'll probably be 40 or 50 family members at my cousins' house for Thanksgiving,"" Jonathan said. ""If the dinner table conversation turns to politics, if any of them start singing the praises of Trump, I'm getting up from the table and leaving. I'm not engaging them."" ""Think about that,"" I said. ""Look at where we are as a society. Family members pitted against one another. The rhetoric, the misinformation, the concerted effort to fool with fake news, it's infiltrated the American family holiday dining table. How do we come back from that?"" My friends shook their heads in resigned disillusionment. The ongoing conversation delved into our experiences of growing up gay and struggling with our sexual orientation. We three shared stories from our teenage years and young adulthood, even as out middle aged gay men common tales of being rebuked by certain relatives, ostracized at school and in church, admonished by a particular pastor or congregant member, leaving a beloved house of worship because after coming out ""queer"" we were no longer welcome. We shared instances when the illogical and condescending condemnation ""love the sinner--hate the sin"" was used to placate us, or those moments when good God-fearing folks damned us to ""an eternity burning in Hell."" One particular heart-wrenching story was one in which my friend Rob's father said to him, ""The news of your coming out is going to kill your mother. You just need to lie to her. Tell her it's not true. You need to think about your kids. Her grandchildren."" When those relatives, friends, and colleagues who have in the past invited us to be their house-guests, best men in their weddings, godfathers to their newborns, and into their family fold, did they consider on November 8th what it must be like to grow up and struggle with these messages, these indictments against one's inherent orientation? Did these people who profess to love us think about our safety as American citizens when they pulled the lever for Trump? How his emboldened followers could take the win as permission to berate, beat, and even murder us?I don't think they understand. I don't think they get it. How could they? Or do they even want to know? At least from my perspective I have no clue about the very real struggle of women, immigrants, or black men. I only have empathy. Empathy it seems, in a post-election world, is not enough. Rob, Jonathan, and I share similar versions of the same story. The same story we've heard from others over and over and over again in our now beleaguered and brokenhearted post-election LGBT community. These stories, our stories, need to be told. ""We carried these experiences, theses negative voices, these heartaches and pain, our repressed anger, a parent's condemnation, the 1980s preacher who said on Sunday that ""AIDS was God's punishment against homosexuality"", all of this we carried with us into the voting booth on Tuesday, November 8th. I don't think our relatives and friends know this,"" I said.""What did they carry with them?"" Jonathan asked. ""I have no idea. But I do know that we must tell our stories.""Women, immigrants, the black community, Hispanics and yes, even the non-college educated heterosexual white American male, all of us must tell our stories. How else can we begin conversations, open-minded dialogue, and to understand one another? Currently, I am the walking embodiment of the southern Indiana gay guy who lost his boyfriend. And by lost I mean we broke up. Well, he broke up with me. It wasn't a long relationship but it was passionate--both fire and ice. For months prior I could sense its demise. So could he. I hold no anger or animosity. I wish no ill will. Ours was a fish vs. bird world. Our break-up came after a whirlwind summer book tour of my novel Some Go Hungry published by Kaylie Jones Books, an imprint of Akashic Books, and right before the November 2016 Miami Book Fair--the largest in the nation. It also occurred in tandem with our presidential election. To be honest, my disposition over the last several weeks wasn't panel discussion book fair worthy and a trip to Miami from my rural southern Indiana home seemed... well, lets just say the timing was off. After the breakup--and given the outcome of our presidential election--I felt akin to someone standing on the precipice of despair. I found no solace in the fact that our country broke up too.

Well it depends on the circumstances.When I began working out at the age of 16, I had no idea what a training partner was. I just went to the YMCA and started doing weight exercises that I saw in the magazine. I picked a few exercises that I thought looked interesting such as bench press, standing press, curls and tricep pushdowns. Even at that I began to make some progress as my body responded very well. I'd look around the gym at the 2 other members and see what they were doing and sometimes copy them.It wasn't long before I asked for a spot on the bench press and then the other person would work in with me. Maybe that's where training partner came from?  I'm not sure but the inspiration did help.I started incorporating other exercises and results popped up fast. Some one in the gym had me work in with them doing squats, deadlifts and bench presses and it did inspire me to enter a power lifting contest which I took second. In this case a training partner was good. AS you can see by the photos my body was developing nicely.When I left Bakersfield and moved to Los Angeles I began training at Bill Pearl's gym in Inglewood which was really a hard core gym. I trained alone at first then met some other guys that would work in on sets with me and we motivated each other to train harder.I learned more from training with others but at time unless the person trains hard it slows down your tme in the gym and if they talk too much, then it really slows it down.I moved on to Gold's Gym after about a year and met a whole new group of friends. It wasn't long that I began training with Arnold himself and learned even more. We had some great workouts together and my progress was even better by far.These two pictures are only one year apart and you can see a huge difference just by training with Arnold. Having the support of someone else who was serious really helped a lot. I also trained with Bill Grant but his hours would change on his job so it was difficult to be consistent however we did have good workouts.There were many times over the years I trained alone but I'm self motivating and have to problem training by myself and in fact I can go faster and not be held back. Many times I've had younger guys want to train with me and I actually made seven of them throw up on my routine.As I get older I don't workout near as heavy and limit to 3 exercises per body part and seem to get good results. Then on occasion I will train with Inna, my Girlfriend and we can have a good workout together.Buy over all it's up to the person. If you want motivation and need a training partner to get through a work out, then by all means do it. If you are a self motivated person then you will be able to go faster through your workouts and really flush the muscle out. Try both and see what works for you. But for sure, keep training.http://ricdrasin.comhttp://ricscorner.com"

How could I turn down a plate heaped with string hoppers in Sri Lanka, accompanied by a spicy prawn curry. And Thailand's mango sticky rice? Only a fool would say, ""Sorry, too many carbs.""The fear of packing on the pounds while traveling is real. You get caught up in the adventure of a lifetime hopping from country to country and there seems to be a permanent beer bottle in one hand and street food in the other. Sleeping schedules get the boot as you're catching red eye flights, bumping along on buses or trains and trying to cope with changing time zones. Travel is a big ol' melting pot of let go, enjoy the ride, what happened last night and what day is it. After all, embracing unpredictability and complete freedom of routines and schedules is part of what makes it such a life changing phenomenon. I've always been an active individual with a slight health obsession. When I left home to backpack Southeast Asia, everything I practiced at home to stay in shape went out the window. After driving a motorcycle through Vietnam for two months, all of those hours of sitting on a bike, not to mention countless milky coffees, had taken a toll on my booty and belly...a 10 lbs toll to be exact. I hated how I felt and when I decided to stay in Southeast Asia indefinitely, I had to face the fact some changes had to happen, not just to stay in shape, but to take care of my overall health. After two years abroad, I learned not to be too critical, don't deprive and take baby steps to make it a lifestyle, not a diet. Here are some tips I follow every day that helped me to lose the extra weight and stay fit on the road.Mental makeover""I can't workout while traveling, it's too hectic."" ""I can't join a gym in this country, I'm on a strict budget."" ""I'm just not going to eat that much."" ""I'll start later, like whenever I get home months from now."" ""YOLO."" Don't give in to those poop thoughts. That routine from back home is ingrained in your mental hardware, and it's not going to disappear overnight. Make fitness a priority and a constant in your everyday life. There are plenty of ways to stay active and healthy anywhere without busting your budget. Keep it simple, keep it fun and try not to deprive yourself or go from one extreme to the other. Accept that you'll slip up sometimes and that's OK. It starts with YOU to make fitness a regular part of your daily thought process. Simple activitiesYou don't need a gym or fancy equipment to look good. Studies show that 40% of all physical activity happens outdoors with 25% resulting from the daily commute alone. When I touched down in Thailand and took a bus out to the countryside, my head was on a swivel ogling the spectacular landscapes outside my window. That's when I got the idea to walk- a lot. I don't mean sign up for treks or tours (although trekking is an awesome way to explore and get one hell of a workout), but instead, walking from place to place and not relying on public transportation. A 20 minute walk from the guesthouse to the market sucks you into the local culture, and you suddenly notice the interesting little shops, smell the aromas of a nearby food stall or have cultural exchanges that you would've otherwise missed on a speeding taxi or bus. Those short walks hauling a heavy backpack burn some serious calories. Best of all, it doesn't even feel like working out when you're immersing yourself into the unfamiliar. Water is MAGICALWater is the ultimate cleanser of the soul. If I feel like shit and then chug a liter of water, it's as if I was reborn. Unfortunately, remembering to stay hydrated while traveling is too easy to forget. Next thing you know, you've spent five days drinking under a scorching sun on Don Det Island in Laos, none of those drinks contained water and you get a bladder infection from dehydration. Drinking enough H2O can combat illness and flush out toxins. Carry a water bottle with you at all times and aim for a set amount to drink each day. If you have a liter bottle, 2-3 refills a day will have you peeing like crazy, but you'll also feel an immediate difference. Feel that energy surge? That's your hydrated body bursting with ecstasy and gratitude.Eat ALL of the foodEat that peanut-y pad Thai. Gobble up the lemongrass fried chicken. Slow chew those delectable dumplings. I'm all for indulging while traveling, after all, sampling foreign delicacies is a major part of the overall experience. The key to health lies in small tweaks that aren't impossible to hold up. Focus on smaller portions. Always add vegetables to your meals. For snacks, keep fruit and nuts in your backpack. If you gorge yourself on fried foods and beers one night, make a mental note to keep things light and healthy the next couple of days. It's not about sacrifice, it's about being mindful. I love keeping a stash of supplements in my backpack when I travel. Powder vitamin C packets don't take up much room and prove invaluable for a quick immune system boost, especially after partying. If you feel a cold coming on or thrush is an issue (ladies, you feel me?), garlic is a powerful natural aid that can be eaten raw or in powder capsules. You don't necessarily have to bring goods from home either, do some research on nutritional supplements offered in the country you're traveling (expat forums on Facebook are great for this!). When I traveled in Southeast Asia I learned that moringa oleifera is a nutrient rich plant native to the region. Not only could I purchase it in powder form almost anywhere, but it's cheaper than if I were to purchase it back home."
58,WOMEN,2016's Biggest Victories And Failures In The Effort To Eliminate Violence Against Women,"Janet Walsh, ContributorDeputy women's rights director, Human Rights Watch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-rapes-to-mass-protes_b_13227522.html,"From historic convictions to impunity for gang rapes, 2016 has been a year of highs and lows when it comes to efforts to stem violence against women.",2016-11-25,2016-11-25-1480093485-9987759-ARGENTINARAPEMARCH_original.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-25-1480093485-9987759-ARGENTINARAPEMARCH_original.jpg,"From historic convictions to impunity for gang rapes, 2016 has been a year of highs and lows when it comes to efforts to stem violence against women. November 25 is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It's a day to reflect on the pain and resilience of survivors. And it's a day to take stock of progress and failings in combatting this pervasive human rights abuse. In March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) reached its first conviction for sexual violence. It found a former Democratic Republic of Congo vice president, Jean-Pierre Bemba, guilty of rape, murder, and pillage in neighboring Central African Republic. Bemba was found guilty under the concept of ""command responsibility,"" in which civilian and military superiors can be held criminally liable for crimes committed by troops under their control. In Senegal, a court convicted Hissène Habré, the former president of Chad, of personally committing rape as an international crime. In May, decades after his victims started fighting for his prosecution, Habré was convicted of torture, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and sentenced to life in prison.But despite these victories, impunity for violence against women remains a massive problem. Around the world, Human Rights Watch documented horrific violent attacks on women, with the attackers facing no punishment. In Nigeria, government officials and other authorities raped and sexually exploited women and girls displaced by the conflict with the armed group Boko Haram. In Jordan, there was a spike in so-called ""honor killings,"" murders of women or girls by relatives for acts supposedly impinging family ""honor."" In South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Burundi, armed combatants gang raped women and girls. In Nepal, child marriage, as well as rape and physical abuse of child brides, is common.And in some countries, reports this year revealed sexual violence that has continued for years. In the United States, military service members have faced not only sexual assault, but also retaliation if they reported the abuse. In Burma, the military has committed rape and other sexual violence relating to the country's decades-long civil wars. Women raped in Kenya's 2007-2008 post-election violence have been unable to obtain reparations or justice. The list of horror goes on. The past year also saw contrasts in how governments address violence against women in legislation. Some countries, like Haiti, have no laws specifically criminalizing domestic violence. Others, like Morocco, are still discussing a draft domestic violence law. But some countries have strengthened legal protections. China, for example, started implementing its December 2015 domestic violence law, and Brazil set tougher penalties for ""femicide,"" or gender-motivated killings of women and girls. United Nations agencies and bodies also produced contrasts over the past year. The World Health Organization's governing body adopted a new global plan of action on health system response to violence. At the same time, UN peacekeepers were accused of rape and sexual exploitation in Central African Republic and other countries. A scathing independent report cited UN failures in handling peacekeeper abuse.Then, there are the contrasts in elected officials, and what this means for violence against women. There are contrasts across the globe, but you could hardly see a starker contrast than in North America. In Canada, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a proud feminist, lifted a prohibition on the use of foreign aid for abortion services, clearing a path for rape victims and others to receive comprehensive reproductive health services. Canada also began a national inquiry this year into violence against indigenous women and girls. At the same time, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has publicly bragged about sexual assault and dismissed this as ""locker room talk,"" has been accused by more than a dozen women of groping or sexual assault, and has expressed his intention to restrict access to legal abortion and reproductive health services, which would pose grave risks for all women. Plenty of people around the world are fed up with violence against women, fed up with the lack of accountability for abusers, and fed up with politicians and others who normalize abuse or fail to combat it. They're taking brave actions to keep shelters open, push for better protections, help survivors heal, and help bring abusers to justice. Many are taking to the streets. In Argentina, for example, thousands of people wearing black clothes braved torrential rain in Buenos Aires in October to protest the rape and killing of a 16-year-old girl. I hope next November 25 will be a day to celebrate more victories, and fewer failures, in the fight against violence against women.Image above: Women take part in a protest in Sao Paulo, Brazil -- where protesters held a one-hour ""women's strike"" -- on October 19, 2016, to protest against violence against women and in solidarity for the brutal killing of a 16-year-old girl in Mar del Plata The killing, in which the high school student was allegedly raped and impaled on a spike by drug dealers, is just the latest incident of horrific gender violence in Argentina, to protest brutality against women.

It’s unclear which policies the president-elect will implement. Although he called climate change a hoax “created by and for the Chinese” in 2012, he said in a meeting with The New York Times staff Tuesday that he thinks there is “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change. He also wouldn’t affirm his plans to back out of the Paris Climate Agreement, instead saying he’s now “looking at it very closely.” Meanwhile, he’s appointed well-known climate change denier Myron Ebell to lead the Environmental Protection Agency’s transition and named fossil fuel lobbyist Mike McKenna to the Department of Energy.That uncertainty has conservation nonprofits gearing up for a fight, whether it be lawsuits against the Trump administration for not protecting citizens from climate change, or doubling down on statewide initiatives ― and supporters are coming out in droves.The Sierra Club, one of the nation’s oldest large-scale environmental activism groups, told The Huffington Post that between Election Day and the following Monday, it had added 7,500 new monthly donors. That’s more donors than they had added between the first of the year and Election Day, Sierra Club national press secretary Trey Pollard told HuffPost. International environmental group Greenpeace told HuffPost it had about 1,000 new volunteers sign up in the week following the election. “During a typical week we get about 75-100 volunteer sign-ups,” Greenpeace media officer Jason Schwartz said, adding that that’s only one aspect of how people are getting involved.“It’s important to note that Greenpeace supporters are showing their support in many ways, including showing up to anti-Trump and NoDAPL protests around the world, signing up for trainings and nonviolent direct actions, millions of social media shares, calls and emails to their representatives, and reaching out to us to find out what they can do,” he said. The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit focused on protecting endangered species, told HuffPost that donations started rolling in when Trump’s victory became clear.“We started getting donations on our website Tuesday night as soon the media started to call the election for Trump,” the center’s executive director and co-founder Kierán Suckling said. In the last week, they’ve received $400,000 in donations. “This is a tenfold increase in the number and size of donations we usually get,” Suckling said.Other conservation groups told HuffPost they have noticed an uptick in donations and volunteer interests, but did not share specific numbers. The Union of Concerned Scientists, Ocean Conservancy and 350.org said they’re seeing more engagement.“[W]e have seen an uptick in unsolicited donations,” UCS media team manager Lisa Nurnberger said, noting that they’re still tallying up the exact amount. “People are asking how they can help and what they can do. Clearly people think science needs to play a role in the next administration, in terms of rulemaking (or rolling back).”Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting ocean wildlife, said it had an exceptional response to an email sent out from its CEO after the election, and that a follow-up fundraising email it sent was one of its top-five-performing emails this year.“Now more than ever, Ocean Conservancy will need the support of its members to ensure our shared ocean victories stand the test of time,” a spokesperson told HuffPost."

Trade is tough,” he said. “So we should not prejudge and jump to conclusions whenever any initiative is launched.”Trump has said he plans to kill the TPP, an ambitious Asia-Pacific trade pact, on his first day in office, although he appears to be treading more softly in other policy areas after months of combative campaign rhetoric.Azevedo said every country had concerns about particular aspects of trade policies and trade deals but he would wait for Trump’s team to announce its strategy before evaluating it.“I haven’t heard, at this point in time, anybody say trade is bad for the United States.”Trade liberalization has long been a target of anti-globalization protests and is often blamed in the United States for jobs and investment moving to Mexico or China.Azevedo said trade is beneficial overall, and although it can be disruptive, it was wrong to blame it for widespread unemployment, with 8 out of 10 job losses in advanced economies due to domestic-led drives for innovation, automation and productivity.“If you don’t have the right diagnosis you don’t have the right medicine. If the medicine is simply protectionism the outcome will be that you will harm the patient,” he said, adding that protectionism would hit poorer sections of the population hardest.(This story corrects fifth paragraph to refer to U.S. withdrawal from regional trade deals, not from WTO itself)(Reporting by Tom Miles and Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)"

65,POLITICS,Trump's Space Adviser Wants To Toss NASA's Climate Research Funding,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-nasa-climate-science_us_58364827e4b000af95edd961,"""Mr. Trump’s decisions will be based upon solid science, not politicized science,"" Bob Walker says.",2016-11-24,"A Greenpeace demonstration outside the U.N. climate talks in Marrakech, Morocco, this month. Diplomats at the talks discussed how to hold Trump to the Paris accord.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58364a9a1700002500e7c2b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Rep. Bob Walker, President-elect Donald Trump’s senior adviser on space policy, hopes to end NASA’s research into climate change and instead focus on “deep space” investigation, according to an interview published Wednesday in The Guardian.Walker, a Pennsylvania Republican, told the news organization that he envisions the space agency in more of “an exploration role” under Trump’s administration and would see the end of what he referred to as “politicized science.” NASA is one of the world’s leaders in climate change research, measuring global temperatures, levels of sea ice, the amount of carbon dioxide in that atmosphere and other important climate-related indicators.“My guess is that it would be difficult to stop all ongoing NASA programs, but future programs should definitely be placed with other agencies,” Walker told the Guardian. “I believe that climate research is necessary, but it has been heavily politicized, which has undermined a lot of the work that researchers have been doing. Mr. Trump’s decisions will be based upon solid science, not politicized science.”Walker, who was chairman of the U.S. House Science, Space and Technology Committee, isn’t a member of the presidential transition team, but he told Scientific American that, although he can’t predict what policies Trump will eventually follow through on, his view is based on concerns that exploration programs “were robbed in order to concentrate on Earth science, and we want to reestablish the emphasis of NASA itself on the things that go beyond Earth orbit and Earth-observation activities.”The pronouncement is the latest sign that a Trump presidency will almost certainly be very bad for the planet. The president-elect has promised to rapidly increase U.S. production of fossil fuels, including coal, and his appointment of a noted climate denier to lead the Environmental Protection Agency has rankled activists and scientists alike. His likely picks for Interior secretary look no better, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and oil executive Harold Hamm.Despite earlier threats to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement, Trump backtracked during an interview Tuesday with The New York Times, saying he had “an open mind” about staying in the pact alongside nearly 200 other nations.“We’re going to look [at the agreement] very carefully,” Trump said during the Times’ on-the-record meeting. “It’s one issue that’s interesting because there are few things where there’s more division than climate change. ... I do have an open mind.”But initial stories about Trump’s possible about-face ― he once tweeted that climate change was a “hoax” manufactured by the Chinese ― failed to point out that the New York businessman then almost immediately expressed some doubt to the Times about the overwhelming consensus that the Earth is warming and that humans are the primary cause.“You know the hottest day ever was in 1890-something, ‘98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views ...As New York magazine points out, a hot day more than a century ago has no bearing on the current changes in our climate. As NASA says (for now): “Weather is what conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time, and climate is how the atmosphere ‘behaves’ over relatively long periods of time.”Trump, when pressed about a human link to climate change by the Times’ James Bennet, said he thought “there is some connectivity” but went on to suggest that addressing climate change would take a back seat to economic interests.“There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it’s going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now.”Diplomats at the recent U.N. climate talks have already threatened to punish the U.S. with a carbon tariff or a potential trade war if Trump pulls out of the Paris accord."

Dogan Holding, a massive media and real estate conglomerate in Turkey, owns the conjoined buildings and pays the Trump Organization to license the Trump name and brand. It can now rely on that name and brand to be sitting in the Oval Office and singing its praises to President Erdogan.In his call with the Turkish leader, Trump passed on praise for Erdogan from Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, son-in-law of Dogan Holding owner Aydin Dogan and former president of the Dogan Media Group. His wife, Arzuhan Dogan Yalcindage, sits on the board of Dogan Holding. He’s friends with the Trump family and had worked closely on the Trump Towers project in Istanbul. On election night, he attended Trump’s shocking victory celebration at the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan.Trump’s praise for Mehmet Ali Yalcindag was first reported by Amberin Zaman in the independent Turkish paper Diken. Zaman’s report has since been picked up by other Turkish newspapers and television stations.Vouching for his Turkish business partner in the call with Erdogan is just the most recent sign of Trump’s near-impossible task in avoiding the significant conflicts of interest his global real estate business presents. During the campaign he promised to separate himself from his business and to work only for the American people.“I wouldn’t ever be involved because I wouldn’t care about anything but our country, anything,” he said in January.Since his election, Trump has declared that he would hand off his business to three of his adult children, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, in a so-called blind trust. He has done no such thing. Instead, he appointed his children to the executive committee of his presidential transition ― blending his business with his government activities.One week after his election, he welcomed three of his Indian business partners to Trump Tower in Manhattan. The Trump Organization is involved in at least five real estate deals in India. Ivanka Trump, despite her supposed separate role as head of the Trump business, joined her father last week for his in-person meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.The president-elect also reportedly handed the phone to Ivanka during a conversation with Argentinian President Mauricio Macri. Trump reportedly discussed the possibility of speeding up the permit process for a building that would bear his name in Buenos Aires. Spokesmen for both Macri and Trump denied that any such discussion took place. Further, Trump recently told British politician and former head of the UK Independence Party Nigel Farage that he should help lead the opposition to offshore wind farms in Britain. Trump has long opposed the construction of such offshore wind farms near his golf course in Scotland. When the New York Times asked Trump on Tuesday if he had this conversation with Farage, he said, “I might have brought it up.”Norm Eisen, the former top ethics official for President Barack Obama and former ambassador to the Czech Republic, called Trump’s references to his business partner in his conversation with Erdogan “entirely improper,” “wrong” and “reprehensible.”“There should be a big, beautiful wall between his personal interests and the public interest,” Eisen said. “It’s only a matter of time before not only will his voters and the more than half of the voters who chose someone else get fed up, but when you disrespect these boundaries it’s an invitation to people to disrespect them back.”For now, Trump’s touting of Yalcindag provides a major benefit for the company and its leadership. There is a reason the company’s stock briefly surged after Trump’s victory. In recent years, the Dogan Media Group has butted heads with the authoritarian Erdogan as he sought to punish dissenting media.“It will give them a layer of protection,” said Henri Barkey, director of the Middle East program at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan policy forum. “Not because Trump will necessarily defend them, but because the Turkish government will think twice about going after them because the president of the United States is supporting them and, also, Erdogan is really looking for Trump to change many of Obama’s policies, especially in Syria and with respect to Iran. So he’s not going after anything that would upset or annoy Trump.”In 2009, Erdogan’s government levied a $2.5 billion fine on Aydin Dogan’s company while Erdogan called for his supporters to boycott the company’s television stations and newspapers. The massive fine was nearly equivalent to Dogan’s entire net worth. Dogan was at the time an outspoken critic of Erdogan and his Islamist AK political party. The fine was compared at the time to efforts by Russian President Vladimir Putin to crush his wealthy political opponents, including Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who now lives in exile. And this was only one of many attacks the Erdogan government has made against Dogan and his business empire.“In the last decade, Erdogan put a huge amount of political and economic pressure on Dogan Group, which ended up with two outcomes,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the nonprofit Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “One, sales of Dogan-owned media to government-owned businesses. Second, change of editorial tone and content. For example, prominent columnists have been fired. Editors have been demoted.”While not entirely losing its independent voice, Dogan Media Group properties have adopted pro-government stances in all but the most egregious instances.The change was evident in its coverage of the 2013 popular protests in Istanbul’s Taksim Square by CNN Turk, a Dogan Media Group property. Instead of covering the protests, CNN Turk aired documentaries about penguins. The penguin soon became a popular image among protesters.CNN Turk was also instrumental in Erdogan’s successful defeat of the coup attempt in July. In a famous moment, Erdogan made his first appearance amid the chaos of the coup attempt on CNN Turk, when the anchor held up her phone with the Turkish president on the screen via FaceTime. He called for his supporters to flood the streets and show their support for his regime. It turned the tide in his favor. After the coup was defeated, Erdogan adopted emergency powers. He has since shuttered at least 20 television and radio stations while arresting reporters and columnists accused of working with or holding sympathies with the coup plotters.During this time, Yalcindag served as head of the Dogan Media Group. He resigned in September amid a computer hacking scandal that implied he coordinated with the government to censor news. A hacking collective released emails alleged to be from Yalcindag to Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan’s son-in-law, that purported to show the two ensuring the news stayed within bounds approved by the government. Yalcindag asserted that the hacked emails were fraudulent.Now Yalcindag is the key middleman between the incoming president of the United States and the Turkish government. Trump’s victory may also help keep his name on that complex. In June, Erdogan denounced Trump’s Islamophobia, stating that the then-candidate had “no tolerance for Muslims in America.” The Turkish president called for Trump’s name to be stripped from Trump Towers Istanbul and said that he regretted attending the opening ceremony. Now that the Trump brand is connected to American diplomacy, this topic apparently did not come up when the two leaders spoke.None of this is worrying to the president-elect, who has dismissed any concerns about conflicts of interest. In a tweet sent Monday, he blamed the media for reporting on his potential conflicts and said that everyone knew he had these business ties when they voted for him. In his Tuesday interview with New York Times reporters, Trump asserted that he could continue to run his business while in the White House if he really wanted to. He further laid down his explanation for this and all future conflicts as they present themselves: “The law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Trump had praised his business partner to Erdogan. In fact, according to the Turkish-language report, he passed on the business partner’s praise of Erdogan."

When the New York Times asked Trump on Tuesday if he had this conversation with Farage, he said, “I might have brought it up.”Norm Eisen, the former top ethics official for President Barack Obama and former ambassador to the Czech Republic, called Trump’s references to his business partner in his conversation with Erdogan “entirely improper,” “wrong” and “reprehensible.”“There should be a big, beautiful wall between his personal interests and the public interest,” Eisen said. “It’s only a matter of time before not only will his voters and the more than half of the voters who chose someone else get fed up, but when you disrespect these boundaries it’s an invitation to people to disrespect them back.”For now, Trump’s touting of Yalcindag provides a major benefit for the company and its leadership. There is a reason the company’s stock briefly surged after Trump’s victory. In recent years, the Dogan Media Group has butted heads with the authoritarian Erdogan as he sought to punish dissenting media.“It will give them a layer of protection,” said Henri Barkey, director of the Middle East program at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan policy forum. “Not because Trump will necessarily defend them, but because the Turkish government will think twice about going after them because the president of the United States is supporting them and, also, Erdogan is really looking for Trump to change many of Obama’s policies, especially in Syria and with respect to Iran. So he’s not going after anything that would upset or annoy Trump.”In 2009, Erdogan’s government levied a $2.5 billion fine on Aydin Dogan’s company while Erdogan called for his supporters to boycott the company’s television stations and newspapers. The massive fine was nearly equivalent to Dogan’s entire net worth. Dogan was at the time an outspoken critic of Erdogan and his Islamist AK political party. The fine was compared at the time to efforts by Russian President Vladimir Putin to crush his wealthy political opponents, including Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who now lives in exile. And this was only one of many attacks the Erdogan government has made against Dogan and his business empire.“In the last decade, Erdogan put a huge amount of political and economic pressure on Dogan Group, which ended up with two outcomes,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the nonprofit Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “One, sales of Dogan-owned media to government-owned businesses. Second, change of editorial tone and content. For example, prominent columnists have been fired. Editors have been demoted.”While not entirely losing its independent voice, Dogan Media Group properties have adopted pro-government stances in all but the most egregious instances.The change was evident in its coverage of the 2013 popular protests in Istanbul’s Taksim Square by CNN Turk, a Dogan Media Group property. Instead of covering the protests, CNN Turk aired documentaries about penguins. The penguin soon became a popular image among protesters.CNN Turk was also instrumental in Erdogan’s successful defeat of the coup attempt in July. In a famous moment, Erdogan made his first appearance amid the chaos of the coup attempt on CNN Turk, when the anchor held up her phone with the Turkish president on the screen via FaceTime. He called for his supporters to flood the streets and show their support for his regime. It turned the tide in his favor. After the coup was defeated, Erdogan adopted emergency powers. He has since shuttered at least 20 television and radio stations while arresting reporters and columnists accused of working with or holding sympathies with the coup plotters.During this time, Yalcindag served as head of the Dogan Media Group. He resigned in September amid a computer hacking scandal that implied he coordinated with the government to censor news. A hacking collective released emails alleged to be from Yalcindag to Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan’s son-in-law, that purported to show the two ensuring the news stayed within bounds approved by the government. Yalcindag asserted that the hacked emails were fraudulent.Now Yalcindag is the key middleman between the incoming president of the United States and the Turkish government. Trump’s victory may also help keep his name on that complex. In June, Erdogan denounced Trump’s Islamophobia, stating that the then-candidate had “no tolerance for Muslims in America.” The Turkish president called for Trump’s name to be stripped from Trump Towers Istanbul and said that he regretted attending the opening ceremony. Now that the Trump brand is connected to American diplomacy, this topic apparently did not come up when the two leaders spoke.None of this is worrying to the president-elect, who has dismissed any concerns about conflicts of interest. In a tweet sent Monday, he blamed the media for reporting on his potential conflicts and said that everyone knew he had these business ties when they voted for him. In his Tuesday interview with New York Times reporters, Trump asserted that he could continue to run his business while in the White House if he really wanted to. He further laid down his explanation for this and all future conflicts as they present themselves: “The law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Trump had praised his business partner to Erdogan. In fact, according to the Turkish-language report, he passed on the business partner’s praise of Erdogan."

The illness ultimately delayed his cancer treatments and has risked his chance of keeping his leukemia in remission, according to doctors cited in the documents.Authorities said the incidents began back in September, shortly after Alberts’ son went home after undergoing his first round of chemotherapy. The boy returned to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis a few days later with a fever, diarrhea and vomiting. Doctors performed blood tests, uncovering unexplainable organisms that are normally found in fecal matter.The hospital’s staff placed video surveillance in the boy’s room. This video allegedly captured the mother, in several instances, using a syringe to inject something into his IV bag, WLFI reported, citing the charging documents.When confronted, Alberts reportedly said that she had injected water into his IV bag because the medicine he was being given “burned.” She later confessed that it was fecal matter that she was injecting, the documents allege.Alberts faces charges including neglect of a dependent, neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury, battery and six counts of aggravated battery. All of the counts are third-degree felonies, according to jailhouse records posted on the Marion County Sheriff’s website.She was released Wednesday on her own recognizance. Her release included a no-contact order that a judge issued, online court records show.Alberts’ husband died in May, according to the Herald Journal, which did not specify a cause. A family friend started a GoFundMe account shortly after to help cover funeral costs and medical bills. It raised more than $40,000. An attorney representing Alberts would only say to The Huffington Post Thursday that “we do not comment on cases.”Requests for comment from the prosecutor’s office and sheriff’s office were not immediately returned."

Everyone",2016-11-24,<p>Nicki Minaj fighting for the American Dream</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583644a61700002300e7c2b2.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_628_835%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"If you still haven’t heard of the Mannequin Challenge, I assure you that you will hear someone mention it very soon. Everyone from Steph Curry to the Medal of Freedom recipients has recreated videos documenting themselves frozen in place, usually accompanied by Rae Sremmurd’s Black Beatles in the background. The sensation first spread among groups of visionary teenagers, who taped themselves in various settings and poses around their high schools- reaching into their lockers, mid text, or in gymnasiums. As fans of Black Beatles and Rae Sremmurd, the original videos often played this song in the background — inspiring many to refer to the song simply as the Mannequin Song. Per the name, the ‘challenge’ has inspired participants to try stopping in increasingly complex poses in elaborate settings, as evinced by the video taped at the White House. The duo even inspired Paul McCartney to participate in the Mannequin Challenge on November 10th, exactly two weeks after the challenge officially went viral and 2 days after President Elect Trump’s victory. After Black Beatles hit #1 on the Billboard 100, Nicki Minaj released a remix, Black Barbies, on November 15th. This week marks the fifth week that Black Beatles rules the charts as number one on the Billboard 100.According to a Pew study, 75% of Trump supporters claimed life was better for ""people like them"" in the mid-1960s. As segregation was still in full force at that time, I highly doubt you would find many African-Americans that would echo that sentiment. Now we have three young Black artists encouraging icons from that time period to engage with a new wave of cultural ideals for 2016 and beyond. At one point in Black Beatles, Slim Jxmmi croons “Black Beatle, me and Paul McCartney related.” McCartney reciprocated this admiration, captioning his mannequin video “Love those Black Beatles.” Nicki Minaj is a significant champion within the movement, coming out with her song post election and including direct mentions of Donald Trump’s abrasive immigration rhetoric, a tribute to Joan Rivers, and reference to Popeye’s strength. The latter two rose to popularity in the 1960s, signaling her awareness of the cultural icons during that time period. As a female, I love that she came up with the idea of black barbies to parallel the Beatles and harken back to a time when those were prevailing gender ideals. For those who believe life was better in the mid 1960s, these artists are offering a revolutionary image, challenging listeners to visualize black Beatles or barbies and forcing them to recognize they are thriving today.Black Beatles and Black Barbies are more than just popular songs. These artists are using music as a medium to Make America Great Again- this time on everyone's terms. Both end with the line “They lose it when the DJ drops the needle,” acknowledging the power of music to release emotions and generate new concepts. At this tumultuous time, music with a message is not only helpful but necessary. We simply cannot ignore what has been going on in our nation. Twitter collected a series of extremely disturbing tweets that document how some citizens reacted on the first day after Trump’s victory, evincing mounting challenges for people of color. We should take it upon ourselves to lead by example and create a Great America for every citizen through our everyday actions.Since the 1960s, we have new widely held values- remember that Hillary (who also participated in the Mannequin Challenge) won the popular vote while the number of minority women in the Senate quadrupled in one day. Now is a ripe opportunity for progressive female ideals to take form. Nicki Minaj and Rae Sremmurd open both songs with descriptions of a girl refusing to acknowledge flowers sent by an admirer because of his unsavory behavior. In my sophomore year of college, my friends and I dressed up as runaway brides and then as the American Dream (a combination of sleepwear and patriotic attire) the following day. That girl — confident in making her own decisions, discerning in choosing a worthy partner, and existing in a “no flex zone”, where everyone is encouraged to be their true selves without hating on anyone else, is a powerful model promoted in Black Barbies.While most writers have focused on Nicki Minaj's direct mention of Trump in her lyrics, I would argue her best line is ""they don't ever do shit/ get it douche?"" followed by Minaj’s signature maniacal laugh. Under Bill Clinton, Aqua's Barbie Girl skyrocketed to the top of the charts, with Barbie relying on Ken to ""undress her anywhere"" and show her a good time by taking her on a ride. That is a completely different American girl than the one Minaj describes in Black Barbies, where a new day means new money to be made. At this critical juncture in American history, it is time to have some fun with the fact that we can all pose as mannequins, but realize the importance of meaningful action to fearlessly pursue our iteration of the American Dream."

To say that this is an achievement is an understatement. To say that there was a collective pride felt by the black community throughout Toronto is also an understatement.As a mother to a little boy who idolizes the police, it was a proud moment to be able to show him a picture of the new police chief, who happens to have brown skin just like him. My son is young. He loves police, he waves, he has on more than one occasion, to our amazement, gone up to random police officers and asked to shake their hands. We encourage it. We laugh. We take pictures. But there’s a lingering unease. He is young. He is cute. He is small, but he is black. He won’t always be what he is right now. Soon, he will be like any other black youth navigating the city streets on his own and subject to the unconstitutional, blatantly racist and dehumanizing practice of ‘carding’, the random stopping of individuals by police, which overwhelmingly targets black people.In a city that for some time has been plagued by an undercurrent of tension, due to ‘carding’ there was a level of hope, that a black Police Chief could change this practice. But instead, along with the Toronto Police Services Board, he has reinforced the status quo at every turn.This is a man who dodged meeting after meeting with the Black Lives Matter Toronto and then told a national news outlet that he has chief, didn’t think he had anything to offer in discussing how police interacted with people of colour.Last week, when faced with the opportunity to do the right thing, the Toronto Police Services Board decided to continue on with the practice albeit in a revised form and to allow police to keep data from these unconstitutional checks.For black youth across the city of Toronto, this means that they can continue to be targeted and stopped for no reason other than being black. Desmond Cole’s story is perhaps the most well-known example of this. He had been stopped by police more than 50 times. Think about that. Think about the stress and anxiety of knowing that every time you set foot outside your door, you could be targeted by police, because you’re black… and therefore suspicious, a potential threat, and a crime waiting to happen. Think about the fact that you could be doing nothing more than walking through the park to meet your girlfriend, and you could be stopped by police, asked to show identification, the equivalent of the Gestapo’s call of “show me your papers” in Nazi Germany. Not only is your information collected, but it is archived and kept. You may be sent on your way, but every detail, every interaction has been recorded.Think about the fact that as a black youth, your parents may have had “the talk” with you and informed you on what to do if you get stopped by police, be submissive, be compliant, but you are young, you may show how upset you are at being stopped for no reason, and this emotion will be captured as aggression. Should you ever be in the unfortunate position of having to deal with police again… a single term “known to police” will sum up your experience, define your story, and send nods of ‘but of course’ echoing throughout communities across the city.This is the legacy of the Toronto Police Services Board and the cities first black Police Chief. It’s unfair to expect a black trailblazer in any field to make drastic waves, or deep systemic changes. It is understandable that he is walking a tight rope and to maintain order in the rank and file, the only colour he sees is blue. But in many ways, as a black leader you have to transcend that. You have to be willing to fight a system you know is biased. Particularly at a time like this, when there is an international conversation being held around systemic racism and the role it plays in the everyday lives of black and brown people. It is incumbent on black and brown leaders to speak out, to walk in the light, engage in a conversation and bring about change for the better.This isn’t happening in Toronto and carding lives on. In an open letter to the City of Toronto and Province of Ontario, 53 Black intellectuals, writers and organizers joined forces to voice their concerns over carding. I am grateful for this. I am grateful that they are acting on my behalf, and on behalf of all the black and brown boys and girls, who love police, but who may one day become their target. "

If Donald Trump offers him the job of secretary of State, should Mitt take",2016-11-24,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump (L) shakes hands with former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, U.S., November 19, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583662d51a00000b03cc99bf.jpeg?ops=crop_161_303_2369_1202%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Mitt Romney may soon be faced with a dilemma. If Donald Trump offers him the job of secretary of State, should Mitt take it? Normally this wouldn't even be an open question, much less a dilemma. The position is one of the most prestigious in the federal government, and any career politician would jump at the chance to fill it, in normal times. But this is Donald Trump's administration we're talking about, which will complicate Romney's choice (to put it mildly).Mitt Romney was one of the most vocal -- and most scathing -- critics of Donald Trump during the campaign. He wasn't afraid to say exactly what he thought of Trump, in no uncertain terms. Romney let it be known that he thought Trump was patently unqualified to lead the country, and he warned his fellow Republicans not to vote for such a charlatan. The voters didn't listen, of course, but it's pretty obvious what Romney thinks about Trump -- and his election to the presidency has likely not changed Mitt's opinion much at all. So to accept the job would mean working for the same man Romney was warning America about, not too long ago. Maybe Mitt could grow a beard and just give up shaving, so he wouldn't have to face himself in the mirror every morning.Secretary of State would be a perfect end to Romney's career -- if he were serving someone like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio, that is. Romney has always seen himself as a statesman, so it'd be a perfect fit. He wouldn't be in charge of anything to do with the economy, so his past career as a plutocrat wouldn't even be an issue. But being in charge of foreign policy for an average Republican president isn't what's being offered. Instead, Romney would be Trump's face to the world -- and that comes with a whole lot of potential downsides.Will Trump be surrounded with sober-minded people who will constrain his worst knee-jerk impulses? Or will he be tweeting freely about what he thinks of other countries, perhaps precipitating international incidents by doing so? No one, at this point, can tell. But the possibility certainly exists. Which would leave Romney the job of continually cleaning up avoidable messes. Or worse.How would Donald Trump take America to war? That's also a very real possibility. If this comes to pass, his secretary of State will be the one who has to try to get allies to stand with us. If the reasons for going to war are seen as illegitimate (or vindictive, or petulant, or irrational, or whatever...), then that's going to be a very hard sell. Trump may bear the blame for such a war, but the secretary of State will likely bear the blame if we wind up waging such a war unilaterally. The job will require a lot more reassurances and hand-holding than normal, that much (at least) seems certain.So why would Romney even consider setting himself up in the rather unenviable position of attempting to explain Donald Trump's thinking to world leaders? Romney obviously doesn't have a shred of respect for Trump, but he'd be responsible for trying to build respect for Trump among the world's leaders. That's a pretty duplicitous position to put yourself in, to say the least.Perhaps Romney could delude himself into thinking he'll be able to control Trump, or at least steer him away from his worst impulses. If that's the case, then Romney could convince himself that taking the job would be the highest form of public service -- saving Trump from himself for the betterment of the country and the world. That's a noble way to put it, but you could see Romney thinking along those lines. After all, if Romney is offered the job and doesn't take it, Trump could easily name some hothead instead -- which could lead to even more sticky situations. Romney could see himself saving America from such a fate, I suppose.One of the scarier things I've heard about Trump came from a former contestant on his reality television show. Trump, according to one of his former apprentices, makes up his mind on any given subject depending on the person he last talked to about it. This is scary indeed, since it suggests an incredibly high degree of suggestibility and an incredibly shallow method of decision-making. But the more you watch Trump, the more accurate this portrayal seems. When Trump talks to someone in favor of torture, then he's all for it. But then after he talks to a Marine general who thinks it's ineffective, Trump suddenly isn't such a big fan of it after all. If this really is who Trump is, then the obvious conclusion is that you would want a level-headed individual to be the last guy Trump talks to before making momentous decisions. Secretary of State Romney might just be a sobering influence on Trump after all, in this scenario.Whoever takes the job, they're going to have to navigate a minefield on a daily basis, that much seems certain. If anything blows up, the secretary of State will be in the middle of it all. If Trump has some spectacular failures on the world stage, that is going to reflect on whomever's job it is to explain Trump to the rest of the planet. Meaning it would be a very risky job to take for anyone who values their political career and public opinion (as Romney certainly does).Of course all of this is assuming that Romney is even in the running, and not just a massive feint by Trump to soothe the public's fears. He may wind up choosing someone else for the job, in the end. But if Trump does offer the job to Mitt Romney, then Romney will have a big decision to make. Should he risk his own reputation on the chance that he can constrain Trump and guide him to sober foreign policy decisions? Or is the possibility of Trump setting off some world crisis by an off-the-cuff decision just too high to even consider attaching your name to his administration? Romney would always have the option of just stepping down, should Trump do something completely unforgivable. He could then say ""I tried -- but failed -- to talk Trump out of it,"" and leave with at least some of his reputation intact.If Trump does offer Mitt Romney the job, Romney's going to have to ask himself some very tough questions, though. Can he follow the leadership of a man he has absolutely no respect for? Can he wake up every morning and go into work knowing full well that Trump is the least qualified person to sit in the Oval Office, or will this be too much for Romney's own self-respect to bear? Does he feel he owes it to America to try to constrain Trump by serving, or is that just too much to ask? These are not normally questions any cabinet officer would have to ponder, but they are very pertinent questions Romney is going to have to answer when deciding whether to serve President Trump or not.-- Chris WeigantCross-posted at The Huffington PostFollow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigant"

DeVos quickly accepted the nomination, which continues a trend that officials involved in previous transition teams say is concerning because, like many of Trump’s other early picks, she has no previous experience in government.“When we were in the Obama transition, one of the big concerns we had that there were a lot of people coming into government who did not necessarily have federal government experience,” said Norman Eisen, a former ambassador who worked on President Barack Obama’s White House transition team in 2008. “The Trump transition has that problem on steroids.”Indeed, Trump’s roster of key White House advisers and Cabinet officials could, in the end, rank among the least experienced in recent presidential history.Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, headed right-wing news site Breitbart News before chairing the president-elect’s campaign. Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff, previously ran the Republican National Committee. And Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a key presidential campaign strategist who is now being discussed as a White House adviser, ran his family’s real estate business before entering politics. None of those individuals has worked in government.In addition, Trump tapped South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) Wednesday to be his United Nations Ambassador. She has little, if any, official foreign policy experience.To Trump, who pledged to “drain the swamp” of the nation’s capital, and his allies, this may be a key selling point of his picks. To Eisen, who now works at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C., it points to potential problems ― both in the development of policy and in terms of simple governance.“Government is like any other profession ― it requires expertise,” Eisen told The Huffington Post. “I don’t think you’d want that gang, if they had a similar lack of expertise in surgery, operating on you with that level of comparable medical experience. And the same is true in government.”While DeVos has never worked in a school or agency that dealt directly with education policy, she has served as the chair of the Michigan Republican Party and headed organizations that focus on education reform.By contrast, Dr. Ben Carson. ― Trump’s preferred choice to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development ― has no identifiable expertise in housing policy. And he’s never served in government, let alone atop a federal agency. Carson himself has worried that his lack of experience could potentially “cripple the presidency” if Trump tapped him to serve in the Cabinet, his senior adviser admitted.“Unlike Betsy DeVos who at least has some experience with the issue, I think Carson’s experience with the sorts of things that HUD does is very, very top down ― to put it gently. Housing is a very complicated issue for example,” said William Galston, who was previously a policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton. He now heads governance studies at the Brookings Institution.Galston suggested that inexperienced Cabinet appointees would likely select more seasoned deputies. He likened it to the chief executive of a company having a chief operating officer with greater knowledge of the nuts and bolts of the business’s operations.“Frankly, I’m more concerned about what people stand for than I am about their lack of experience,” Galston said. “My assumption is that unless people are really stupid, if they want to move an agenda, then they will pick senior deputies who know how to move agendas through the machinery of government.”Galston raised concerns, however, about the outsize role that Trump loyalists and family members were likely to play in the incoming administration.“When you bring in so many friends and family into your inner circle that can easily create a circle the wagons phenomenon,” he said. “That can have the effect of slowing or even discouraging the free flow of information on which every president depends. The last thing any president needs is a palace full of courtiers.”Other Trump choices are raising eyebrows for reasons other than experience. Trump’s pick for national security adviser, Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for two years. But Flynn was fired in 2014, in part because of concerns over his management style, which one former Pentagon official called “disruptive.”A figure close to the Trump transition team said he’s concerned about this nomination, because being national security adviser requires a diplomatic style that appears lacking in Flynn.“What’s worrisome is that the NSC job is a traffic cop job. He should be coordinating policy, not dictating it. Imagine how this will go: Mattis (who outranked Flynn and whom everyone seems to like) disagrees with Flynn. Does Flynn then scream at him or spend time undermining him? Same with Secretary of State Romney,” said the source, referencing Trump’s consideration of former Gen. James Mattis for Secretary of Defense and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) for the top diplomat post.“And when it come time to brief Trump how does Flynn handle a situation where all of the Cabinet is unified and Trump disagrees?” the adviser added.Jay Lefkowitz, who advised former President George W. Bush on domestic policy and later served as the administration’s special human rights envoy to North Korea, was less concerned about the relative inexperience of Trump’s selections thus far.Lefkowitz noted that DeVos’ lack of federal government experience made her the ideal pick for an agency “in desperate need of reform.”“There is a little bit of institutional knowledge ― how things actually work. It actually helps to have been through this a little bit,” Lefkowitz said. “There are some really good people who have been in the White House before and been on the Hill before who I hope he takes a look at.”“On the other hand, one of his appeals was that he was going to break away from conventional politics and conventional bureaucrats,” Lefkowitz added.From this perspective, having fresh faces in key posts, he concluded, is “a net positive, not a net negative.”But Eisen, who noted that Trump is himself inexperienced, as the first president-elect who hasn’t served either in the government or the military, isn’t convinced.“You have either no experience or the wrong kind of experience,” he said. “That starts at the top, and it’s very troubling.”Ryan Grim contributed reporting.Do you work in a federal agency?

So when she delivered a baby boy, she and her husband, Travis, were shocked, to say the least.Birth photographer Susannah Gill captured the moment the Guileys learned the sex of their baby. Looking at the photos, the expressions on their faces can only be described as priceless. “It was a very big moment because a lot was as happening,” Gill told The Huffington Post. “It was about 5 a.m. after a very long night.”Kim gave birth at home in Santa Cruz back in July. Shortly before to the delivery, the midwife said they would have to transfer to the hospital because Kim’s tailbone seemed to be blocking the baby’s passage, the photographer said.As her husband and birth support team packed to relocate, Kim stood up. In that moment, she felt the baby coming, and soon started to push. Her tailbone broke as she birthed her son.“I was in excruciating pain,” Kim told HuffPost. “But he was well worth all of difficulty.”Travis and Kim, who is a birth doula, decided not to find out the sex of their baby ahead of time, so the moment of reveal was “very exciting and emotional,” the photographer recalled. “The midwife handed the baby to Kim in a blanket, and she took a peek.”Gill said the sex of the baby came as a surprise to the mom, who has a 3-year-old daughter named Hazel. “She’d really convinced herself this baby was a girl because her belly was showing in such a similar way to her first pregnancy,” she said. “I work as a doula, so I should totally know better than to take some random guess,” Kim said. “I had all these silly reasons why I thought it was a girl, all these feelings.”Kim also thinks she talked herself into believing it was a girl to avoid disappointment. “I come from a family with one girl and one boy, and as a parent, I wanted the experience of raising both a boy and a girl,” she explained.The mom had already felt a deep sense of loss and disappointment when she had a miscarriage in June 2015. “My overall perspective with this pregnancy was that as long as I have a healthy baby, I’ll be so thrilled,” she said.Still, pregnancy was very difficult for Kim, as she experienced hyperemesis gravidarum and had to be hospitalized for IV fluids. “It took a village to get everything done and make sure my daughter’s needs were met at that time,” she said. As a result, the mom decided she would not have more than two children. “I knew I couldn’t put my body and my family through that again,” she said. The difficulty the Guileys faced made the surprise of having a boy even more exciting and emotional. “Finding out we had a healthy baby boy was this culmination of our losses and struggles,” Kim explained. “It was especially poignant knowing this would be our last baby.”When Kim and Travis saw Gill’s photos from that moment of surprise, they started “cracking up,” the mom said. “We couldn’t stop laughing. I can’t believe my face could do that. I don’t think I could even replicate that face again if I tried!” She added, “The photo makes me laugh because it shows how much I could talk myself into things. It was as if someone had told me definitively I was having a girl ― that’s how convinced I was.”Kim and Travis have enjoyed reliving the moment and sharing it with others. Gill’s striking photos of the birth spread around Instagram over the summer, thanks to accounts like Birth Without Fear. But they had a viral resurgence on many social media platforms this week after appearing on more birth-themed accounts and The Daily Mail.Gill said she hopes her photos help others see the beauty of home birth and birth photography. “I think it’s a really special time to have documented,” she explained, adding that birth photography is not necessarily about capturing all the graphic details but more about chronicling beautiful moments. The photographer also said she hopes more couples feel inspired to wait to learn the sex of their baby. “There are so few surprises left in this world, and I feel like people find out the gender of their baby just because they can,” she said. “But there’s also a very beautiful thing in waiting. I think that’s how nature intended it to be. And it’s a lot of fun.”Keep scrolling and visit the photographer’s and mother’s Instagram accounts for more stunning birth images. "

My mother was her friend and worked as a full-time administrator of a New York nonprofit benefiting children. It was always perplexing to me to see the disparity between our society's low expectations of women and my experience of the leadership shown by these two women, my role models.Of course Eleanor was the leading voice for advancing the role of women in politics in the 20th century. I'm sure she'd be thrilled to see Hillary's accomplishments, particularly over the past 15 years.In October 1945, Eleanor wrote about women in politics, ""they need not function as a minority group unless they allow themselves to be pushed aside.... If women want to take part in their local, state, and national governments today, they can do so with complete equality. The only thing they have to do is to prove that they can obtain the votes.""Hillary obtained the votes. But seventy years later, sadly, equality remains elusive.In May 1954, Eleanor was promoting her book Ladies of Courage, which contained stories of women who held positions in and under the Republican and Democratic national committees. Her goal was to encourage women to consider these roles, but she conceded the obstacles, admitting that politics was still a man's world.That same month, she wrote a column updating the nation on the progress of the Equal Rights Amendment benefiting women, which was being discussed by the House Judiciary Committee. Eleanor observed that equal treatment is not accepted in our society in practice, and added, ""I doubt very much whether it ever will be.""And indeed, the amendment would go on to be discussed and voted on by Congress and the states into the 1970s, but ultimately was never ratified. How could it have been, with men then (like now) holding the vast majority of elected seats in state legislatures, just as they did (like now) in Congress?Our nation's founders asserted ""that all men are created equal."" We know in their use of the word men, the founders did not mean women, nor people of color. The education sector in which I work is committed to critical thinking and the study of history. We recognize the gaps between the soaring aspirational values of the words of our founders and the corrosive realities of inequality and injustice. It's a tragedy for our nation that 250 years later, we have yet to fulfill those aspirations.Last year a student at the college where I work wrote her thesis on the impact of the low percentage of women in federal and state elected office. Adrianna Taeko Perry reported that women make up only a fifth of Congress, a fifth of mayors of major cities, and a quarter of state legislatures. She found that each juncture in the political process is less accessible to women than men. The status quo of majority male representation has led to serious barriers to women having a sufficient voice and vote on issues such as economic equality, contraception, abortion, healthcare, education, childcare, and the safety and welfare of women and families.Women's rights are human rights: That was Eleanor's view before the slogan became associated with Hillary Clinton, from her speech at the 1995 UN Conference in Beijing. For representative democracy to work and succeed, our nation needs equal and diverse representation in our elected offices across race, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender.I agreed with President Obama when he voiced a suspicion that a great number of men in our country are uncomfortable at the sight of a strong woman leader. In a news story about hidden sexism this election season, PBS NewsHour reported that in the Democratic primaries, Clinton lost the overall male vote to Bernie Sanders by large numbers in many states.Then in November, the election's exit polls confirmed that men overwhelmingly voted for Trump -- marking the widest gap between men and women in at least half a century -- and more white women voted for Trump than Hillary.It's clear that breaking down patriarchal power structures will require more of us to accept women as their leaders, and more women to contend to be accepted as leaders.Adrianna Taeko Perry wrote in her thesis, ""Given that women's access to these rights are frequently being questioned and challenged in the majority male legislatures, more women need to be represented in the legislatures so that their diverse experiences and opinions can help form policy."" She concluded, ""Women's increased presence in elected office is positively connected to an increase in legislation affecting women's lives and interests.""We need many more women in elected office to see and shape our laws, policies, and regulations through their lens; and to achieve a reduction in patterns of neglect and violence, not only of and against women, but also of and against all of the weak and underrepresented communities in our society.In her concession speech, Hillary said, ""We are all equal in rights and dignity."" Speaking to women of all ages, she added, ""Nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. Hopefully we'll shatter that glass ceiling sooner than we think.""One thing that's clear, Hillary boosted the expectations of young women far beyond what Eleanor Roosevelt envisioned in those early decades of this essential movement."

Thank you Reverend Anne and Lisa Maria, and all of you for inviting me here on this solemn and important day, when we choose to honor the memory of those in the transgender community who have been taken away from us, for having the courage to live as their true selves.I am honored to be standing here on the Lexington Battle Green, which I think we can all agree, is hallowed ground. I wanted to be sure what this means, so I looked it up and found that Hallowed meansHolyConsecratedSacredReveredWe are standing on the grass roots where the movement that became America began. This is where the fight for American freedom began and I am sure many of you have stood right here on many cold April mornings to watch or take part in our Patriot's Day re-enactments.That was the fight for freedom, The fight against oppression. That was the fight that led to the founding of our country and the declaration that stated.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. And yet today we must remember those who were denied these rights; denied their liberty, their happiness and their lives..We must ask WHY?They were transgender, and they were singled out as different and less than others. I too am transgender, and I cry for those who have lost their freedom, their happiness and their lives, and I hope that you may share a tear with me in their memory. ...Today is a day of Remembrance. Let me share some of my own memories.I remember growing up as a young boy in Brooklyn New York I remember hiding my truthI remember as a young man, in 1969, moving to Massachusetts  I remember hiding my truthI remember being newly married in 1977 and moving to Lexington. I remember hiding my truthI remember raising my 3 children here, with great schools and coaching them in many town sports I remember hiding my truthI remember in 2010 coming to acceptance of my truth as being transgender and transitioning in 2011 I remember when I stopped hiding my truth.I remember then becoming the ""Other!""....When I wrote my book, I had a chance to ask my youngest son and his wife what, if anything he lost when I transitioned. He thought, and slowly shared....that he lost the illusion that his father was always happy!. He then told me that he and his wife agreed that they would never live their own lives in anyway that does not make them happy.  No one should be living a life that does not make them happy!I am one of the lucky ones, the blessed ones, in that I have lost no one in my family when I transitioned to live as my true self. Again my son stated that he could never understand how a parent could ever abandon a child or a child could abandon a parent for them just being true to themselves.  I too cannot understand it but it happens all too often in my community.  ...The statistics and surveys say that only 9 percent of Americans say they know someone who is transgender. To far too many, we are the other and there is ongoing discrimination against us. There are those that hide behind their view of religious freedom to discriminate against us. I just don't understand this. To me, religious freedom means Live and Let Live. If you do not agree with this, perhaps you really do not believe in either religion or in freedom!There are those right here in Massachusetts that want you to cast a vote to deny freedom to people like me! I ask you, I beseech you, and I beg you to never ever let that happen.We are standing on this sacred land where our freedoms began and I believe once again we all must make a stand that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.For those of you who do not know who we transgender people are, please help me share with you. We really are not much different that you. We want to love and be loved. We want to belong to groups and be accepted as a valued member of the many communities we are part of.If you do not know us, perhaps I can help you learn....Help me responsively - when I raise my hand join me in WHO WE ARE?Who We Are: We are your mothers, your fathers and your children.Who We Are: We are your aunts and uncles, and nieces and nephews.Who We Are: We are your grandparents and your grandchildren.Who We Are: We are your teachers and your students.Who We Are: We are your doctors, and your lawyers and your pilots.Who We Are: We are your soldiers, and your sailors.Who We Are: We are your neighbors, your shopkeepers.Who We Are: We are your friendsI hope that you will be our friends and have our backs if anyone tries to oppress us or tries to discriminate against us, or deny our pursuit of happiness, of liberty or of our lives, our lives of living our truth.There is a quote that I often repeat that goes:Every moment is a fork in the road. The path you take will shape your future. Choose love over fearToday, in our country, the voices of fear and discrimination have become brazen in speaking and actions in many non-loving ways. Many people are scared and seeking signs of hopeI, for one, do not ever want to give up hope - but if we are divided, it is that much harder to hold on to it.Here, on this hallowed, holy, sacred ground, I believe with all my heart that solidarity will keep our hope of freedom for all alive, as we all know that Love conquers Fear.Love Yourself, Live Your Truth, & Love Each Other.....Now please join us as we remember those whose lives have been stolen from us all....Grace Anne Stevens inspires people to find their truth and live their authentic life!

There is a crack, a crack in everything, That's how the light gets in.Why don't we pick a random day, say the third Thursday of a month. Any month, say the month of November, a quieter time of year. We don't we hit pause on our newsfeeds and playlists, our pagers and mobile phones, mute the soundtracks of our conflicted opinions, religions, politics, and have a feast.While you baste and roast the turkey, I will light candles, turn the music on, then run upstairs to join the children playing Indians and cowboys. Teepees and forts. We will fight make believe wars all afternoon, with bow and arrow, musket and bayonet, and when the sun sets put down our weapons and fight over stuffing and pudding instead.You could tell the story of another dinner the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians had, long ago. The Pilgrims were celebrating their first successful harvest; the Indians had taught them to grow corn. Those two peoples would ultimately quarrel over land and other differences too large and painful to ignore, but by the light of a campfire, one historic night, they had a feast and gave thanks.Then perhaps you could tell a more recent story of Indians and cowboys. Of the Standing Rock Sioux and Energy Transfer Partners in a stand off over a stretch of land; that spot where Montana meets North Dakota, that is rich in oil reserves.The world has been an unstable place lately. It has been a trying year. Dwindling resources and light trigger fear; there might not be enough to go around. More oil means more jobs, more money, resistance to volatility, so the company is building a $3.8 billion pipeline to move it to Illinois.But wealth comes at a price and for months, the Indians have been protesting: no pipeline near their land. It will destroy their historic, cultural, religious sites, and if it cracks pollute their water and soil.There is a crack, a crack in everything, And there are humans on either side. Through it protestors throw Molotov cocktails and officers, ice water and tear gas. Who am I to say who is right or wrong? I just play make believe with kids. I know that angry people are just people trying hard to survive.Markets and commodities will still be volatile tomorrow. Our differences will still be here. Our opinions, religions, politics conflicted. The fear of uncertainty. But it is quite dark and cold outside tonight; the cowboys and Indians must be hungry. So what if we hit pause, dug up more chairs and some more wine, and invited them in for a feast?We could also invite the seven hundred and ninety-five million people starving around the world. We may have to sit on the floor and share silverware, but there will be more than enough food to go around.We could turn this random third Thursday of the month into a historic night. Share recipes and stories and make a few memories to tell the children about next year.We could celebrate being alive, and that the sky above our heads is clear. That we have electricity and running water and heat. That we are allowed to disagree.There is a crack, a crack in everything, But we can patch it tomorrow.

84,WORLDPOST,Why Donald Trump Should Pursue A Foreign Policy Of Peace,"Doug Bandow, ContributorContributing writer, policy analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-donald-trump-should-p_b_13209022.html,"President-elect Donald Trump has a unique opportunity to redirect American foreign policy, which has become dangerously unbalanced and militarized. The answer is not isolation, but robust, thoughtful engagement.",2016-11-24,"Aston, PA, USA - September 22, 2016: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump delivers a speech at a rally in Aston, Pennsylvania.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d97ecd3b00004630ec9555.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Few people expected there to be a President-Elect Donald Trump. Winning the election wasn't easy. Governing will be much tougher.Although the Americans who voted for him likely are most interested in domestic and economic reform, international challenges are likely to prove more pressing. Indeed, the world may be messier in January than today. And the usual coalition of Neoconservatives and liberal interventionists undoubtedly will press him to embrace current policy and treat Uncle Sam as Globocop.However, Trump has an opportunity to dramatically reshape a conventional wisdom that has consistently failed America. The U.S. has been constantly at war since the end of the Cold War. Belief in America's ""unipolar"" movement led to disastrous, militarized hubris. The bipartisan presumption that Washington could use military force to simultaneously reshape reality, maintain stability, protect humanity, and promote democracy--especially in the Middle East--has proved to be a tragic fantasy.Trump's foreign policy views are sometimes inconsistent and often ignorant. His bombastic rhetoric and undisciplined nature is no boon for diplomacy. Nevertheless, he remained more likely than Hillary Clinton to follow a new approach.Indeed, he challenged the presumption that Americans must forever subsidize wealthy allies. He told Republican voters that George W. Bush's Iraq invasion was a catastrophe. And he rejected Republicans' and Democrats' common enthusiasm for confronting nuclear-armed Russia. He was more likely than a President-elect Clinton to emphasize protecting Americans' interests rather than attempting to transform the rest of the world.What should the incoming administration's priorities be?Diplomacy. Despite his claim to be the most militaristic of the presidential candidates, he simultaneously emphasized diplomacy, in which most of his GOP competitors demonstrated no interest. Trump sharply criticized some of his predecessors' aggressive policies and urged greater engagement with countries as diverse as North Korea and Russia. Although diplomacy offers no panacea, America's ""unipolar moment,"" if it ever existed, is over. Washington will have to do better at convincing instead of coercing other nations.Russia. The U.S. is involved in a dangerous mini-Cold War with Moscow. Vladimir Putin is an ugly character and the Russian Republic is a malign international actor. However, Moscow is not much of a threat to America.It is acting like the pre-1914 Russian Empire, focused on international respect and secure borders, rather than global ideological victory. Moreover, Moscow has far greater interests in Syria and Ukraine than does America. Washington has no cause to risk war in either conflict. Instead, the Trump administration should seek a practical deal in both cases. For instance, pledging not to bring Kiev into NATO in return for Russian de-escalation of the assault on Ukraine. And limiting American military involvement in Syria to mopping up the Islamic State.Syria. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did much to create the current crisis. By demanding Assad's ouster, she encouraged popular opposition and discouraged a negotiated settlement. Although Assad is an odious figure, he has never threatened American interests, as do the jihadists who have risen in opposition. Rather than expand U.S. involvement through additional arms shipments, training of insurgents, and creation of a no-fly zone, Washington should step back. Even a bad diplomatic deal with Russia would be better than turning the Syrian civil war into another American hot war. At the same time, Washington should seek to ease the humanitarian crisis, including vetting and resettling refugees, especially religious minorities who have few options in the Middle East.Islamic State. As ISIS weakens and loses ground, the U.S. should turn over ever more combat responsibility to those states most threatened by the jihadist group. A coherent policy is beyond Washington's reach: Iraq and Turkey are at odds, Iran is fighting the Islamic State but also is hostile toward the U.S., Turkey and Kurdish forces are bitter opponents, the ""moderate"" insurgents backed by America continue to make common cause with radical groups such as al-Nusra, long affiliated with al-Qaeda, the Gulf States have largely abandoned the anti-ISIS campaign in favor of a brutal offensive in Yemen, and Russia has invested militarily in the Assad regime despite America's support for its overthrow. Washington's attempt to ""manage"" such as an imbroglio is more likely to generate enemies than friends.Afghanistan. During the presidential campaign Afghanistan was a missing issue. After 15 years of attempting to create a liberal, Western-oriented, united, and competent Afghan central government, the U.S. should complete its withdrawal of combat forces. Washington has a continuing interest in preventing the country from again becoming a terrorist base, but that was largely achieved by ousting the Taliban after 9/11. Even if the insurgents eventually triumph, they are unlikely to risk a repeat experience by welcoming such forces back. Any future U.S. involvement should be far more limited, focused on intelligence gathering, cooperation with other regional powers, such as Pakistan, and targeted use of special operations forces when appropriate.Middle East. Although the Obama administration ""pivoted"" to Asia, rebalancing policy away from Europe and the Middle East, the U.S. later increased military activity in the latter while upping military commitments to the former. The U.S. has no interests at stake in the Middle East which warrant America's ongoing military fixation. The region no longer matters nearly as much for energy: indeed, the U.S. now is the world's biggest oil producer. Moreover, Israel is a regional superpower which is threatened rather than shielded by Washington's promiscuous military interventions. The U.S. should reject proposals for further meddling after the consistently disastrous record of past interventions.China. In the longer term the most likely economic and security competitor to America is the People's Republic of China. However, that doesn't mean there is any reason for conflict. Pressing for Chinese economic reciprocity makes sense in some areas--reducing restrictions on foreign investment, for instance. Nevertheless, the U.S. benefits from the current trading relationship and as the Chinese people grow wealthier they are likely to buy more American products and services.Perhaps even more important is accommodating China's growing influence in its own neighborhood. No one imagines a PRC attack on America or U.S. Pacific possessions. Rather, Beijing is most concerned about preventing intervention against China in regional disputes. Rather than expecting the Pentagon to be the frontline defender of American allies' interests, Washington should turn defense responsibilities over to those nations, all of which are growing economically and have strong incentives to defend themselves.Koreas. The president-elect has long criticized South Korea for relying on American defense guarantees. With 40 times the GDP and twice the population of the North, the Republic of Korea should take over responsibility for its own security. Rather than charge the ROK for its defense, Washington should begin a phased withdrawal of U.S. conventional forces.At the same time, the incoming administration should engage the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Rather than a presidential summit, as Trump suggested during the campaign, Washington should start small: negotiate to establish low level diplomatic relations and draft a peace treaty to formally end hostilities on the peninsula. Since isolation and sanctions have failed to halt the North's nuclear program, a new approach is needed.NATO. Trump correctly recognized that Europe long has enjoyed a cheap ride on U.S. taxpayers. His idea of charging the continent for American defense services is a bad idea--U.S. forces should not be rented out to wealthy allies unwilling to put their own military personnel at risk. Instead of burden-sharing, Washington should practice burden-shedding. The U.S. defense shield succeeded in giving war-torn Europe time to recover in the face of potential Soviet aggression.Today Russia poses no serious threat to Europe, even, likely, to the states on its border. Putin's ambitions so far have been brutal but limited, and he's shown no interest in triggering a general war, let alone one into which Washington could be drawn. To the extent that European nations feel at risk, they should increase their own military outlays, improve continental military cooperation, and further reduce economic dependence on Moscow. The burden of their defense should be theirs.Trade and Immigration. Although popular frustration with foreign competition, both goods and people, generated much of Trump's support, he should separate process and substance. In fact, trade has benefited the great majority of Americans. Immigration, too, is economically advantageous. The new administration should reinforce those positives, while addressing complaints that benefits are not adequately shared, non-economic issues have been ignored, and those more affected have not fairly consulted. The populist Trump has the credibility to ensure a broader political buy-in for policies which, despite his past criticisms, offer broad benefits.President-elect Donald Trump has a unique opportunity to redirect American foreign policy, which has become dangerously unbalanced and militarized. The answer is not isolation, but robust, thoughtful engagement. Americans benefit from being involved in the world. But not from attempting to forcibly transform the world in America's image. Paradoxically, the bombastic Donald Trump could become the president who puts into practice George W. Bush's long abandoned call for a more ""humble"" foreign policy.This article was first posted to National Interest online."

Needless to say, I was starving when I reached the museum. True fact is that I always eat first at art exhibits, firstly because I am always starving, and secondly because museums have the best cafés and shops.The Kimbell has a unique flat rate fee for plates of three sizes - small, medium, and large. The menu is the same for all. But you pay by the size of your plate. Some people have mastered the art of piling up tons of food in a precarious balance on their plate. I saw some lunchers with a small plate who had more food than me on my medium one.Was it ""worth"" it?But I digress. Claude Monet is one of these great French painters that everyone knows. They may not know his name but will recognize his art. He is a familiar painter with a subdued and sweet domestic life that accompanied his paintings all his life. His paintings of Venice, London, and Paris are vital witnesses to the cities' daily landscapes.Organized in collaboration with the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, thanks to loans from 10 countries, and a handful of private collectors, the show offers a unique view of the early years of the master, starting when he was 17 years old and painted the ""View at Rouelles"" where he lived.All the paintings presented at the Kimbell are from Monet's early years and have seldom been seen in museums. The precious exhibit is a must-see for lovers of impressionists' work.Le Déjeûner sur l'Herbe.My favorite Monet piece is the whimsical lunch on the grass, for its romantic setting, the fashion so beautifully described, and the funky story of its missing part. You will only see two pieces of this large painting at the Kimbell, as this is the only remaining parts of the massive representation of a lunch in the woods. Monet explained how the painting got cut up and subsequently gone shorter:""I had to pay my rent, I gave it to the landlord as security and he rolled it up and put in the cellar. When I finally had enough money to get it back, as you can see, it had gone moldy.""  When his landlord finally gave it back, Monet cut it up and kept only three pieces - but the third part has now disappeared.Pricey grain stacks.The auction house Christie in New York just sold last week the piece ""Grain stack"" for a hefty $81.4 million, when the hope was to sell it for half of that. I won't tell you who bought it, because it's a secret - the 1891 canvas was won by an anonymous collector bidding over the telephone.The wheat stack sold is not at the Kimbell, but a couple of the series of about 20 stacks canvases are on view - better hurry to see them before they sell for millions and vanish into some lucky private living room!Another Monet had already set a record for the painter; his ""Water Lily Pond"" was sold for $80.4 million in 2008. The 19-part elliptical painting of the ""Nymphéas"" is another familiar sight for many. A special studio was built for the size of his project, and he devoted the rest of his life to the large masterpiece.We are treading far away from cutting up paintings to pay the rent! If only Monet could see the frenzy of collectors around his art today.Claude Monet was a great impressionist master - good at drawing, and even better at rendition of material such as clouds, water, and snow. Friends with Renoir, his flowers show the influence the other master had on him."" Qu'y a-t-il à dire de moi ? Que peut-il y avoir à dire, je vous le demande, d'un homme que rien au monde n'intéresse que sa peinture - et aussi son jardin et ses fleurs ?""(What is there to say about me? What can possibly be said, I am asking you, about a man that nothing in the world interests except his painting - and also his garden, and his flowers?) More info:  Monet: the early years.

Without ID, these people, predominantly women and children in Asia and Africa, can't get healthcare, welfare or bank accounts. That figure also encompasses, most urgently, the 60 million refugees worldwide and many women trafficked into forced prostitution, whose lack of ID prevents them getting help.'It was one thing when we were living in a paper-based world,' says Dakota Gruener, Executive Director and presently sole full-time employee of ID2020, the public-private partnership. 'You can understand how providing people with pieces of paper and ensuring they were included in a larger registry was difficult. But in the era of Google and Facebook, it makes no sense.'""In the era of Google and Facebook, it makes no sense.""  ID2020 has enlisted the UN, some of the world's most powerful tech companies and dozens of start-ups to see whether a new technology, perhaps blockchain, could solve this problem.ID2020 was started by a pioneer of financial technology, John Edge, who told Apolitical, 'If you create a new derivative contract, it's like a human being born. It's a thing that doesn't exist that now does exist that needs an identity in a system. The trading system we built trades trillions of derivatives, stocks, bonds, and options. And there are systems that manage lots and lots of individual identities and transactions.'""Look, this is the future. There is just no question."" At a summit ID2020 organised at the UN headquarters in New York earlier this year, Marley Gray, who runs Microsoft's work on blockchain, said, 'We have a sort of technological perfect storm. First is the cloud, then very inexpensive mobile devices, and then this notion of establishing secure identity not just for individuals, but for everything, to be able to track and transact securely. The challenge is not necessarily the technology or the organisation, it's bringing it all together.'ID2020 is not trying to put forward one particular solution. Rather, it has convened a group including development agencies, think tanks and companies such Microsoft, PWC, Cisco, Accenture and Deloitte to spend the years to 2020 figuring out what a solution might look like.Nevertheless, Niall McCann of the UN Development Program, which does not yet have any formal relationship with ID2020 but has been involved in discussions on the project, told Apolitical, 'Look, this is the future. There is just no question that this is the future, digitising paper identity documents and making them into applications on a smart device.'At the moment, UNICEF makes great efforts to register children at birth, and the UN's sustainable development goal on identity cites birth registration as the benchmark for securing legal identity, but, says McCann, 'What do you do for people whose birth was never recorded or what about countries where management of civil registration is so poor that records have been lost or destroyed or they're simply not able to go back and find a copy for people who've lost one?'I've got my birth certificate but it's a very very old piece of paper at this point. It's a piece of paper with no photograph and, even if it did have a photograph, it would be a photograph just of a baby. I hope Ireland has an electronic database to back that up, but what about countries that don't, where people have lost theirs or are carrying around a shabby handwritten bit of paper?'Moreover, a lot of work on registration is being done at cross-purposes. UNICEF stops tracking people when they become adults, while UNDP engages in huge voter-registration drives, but then often leaves when the elections are over.""My birth certificate is a very very old piece of paper."" In fact, UNDP has used biometric tech to help create voter registers - preventing people voting more than once - in more than a dozen countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Zambia, Bangladesh and Nepal. But when it comes to registration, many prospective voters don't have any ID documents to sign up with in the first place. Says McCann, 'So several countries have said, can you now help us do a national identity card or register using this same biometric equipment?'Attempts to free identity from pieces of paper and bring it into the digital age are proliferating around the world. India's Aadhaar program has scanned the irises and taken the fingerprints of 1.07billion people, and issued them with an ID number. New South Wales in Australia is switching its driving licences onto smartphone apps and, while the state works up to fully digital driving licences, due 2018, has just begun trialling the technology with things like fishing licences.But national identity registers come with considerable risks of their own. As John Edge puts it, 'Aadhaar scares the daylights out of me. You wouldn't have wanted to deploy Aadhaar in Rwanda a few years ago. It would be a very efficient way of killing people. A centralised biometric identity system, if it falls into the wrong hands, is a weapon.'Some countries, like the UK, have rejected proposals for what is essentially a unified digital list of everyone who lives in the country. There are several nightmare scenarios: the people in, say, the driver licensing agency get to look at your tax records; a racist government cross-references data on ethnicity and crime and abuses the results; the database breaks and people's identities are digitally extinguished.That is why the people behind ID2020 are especially interested in a decentralised system, i.e. something involving blockchain. The technology, which underlies bitcoin, holds tamper-proof records across a network of computers. Although it seems unlikely that there will ever be a global ID system independent of governments, it is conceivable that the poorest and most vulnerable people would be able to log into a system and prove who they are to social services, banks or foreign governments.""This can protect a girl stuck in a mud hut with no electricity, no water, no education, not even a road to walk to school"" Dakota Gruener has also conceived a means by which to get many of those people registered in the first place. She came to ID2020 from GAVI, a public-private partnership that vaccinates children in poor countries. It has a huge distribution network which an ID scheme could piggyback onto. As Edge puts it, 'You've got the kid's arm in your hand, you're injecting them, and you don't capture their identity or medical records.'The potential is enormous. In Malawi, for example, some 90% of children are vaccinated, but fewer than 5% have a birth certificate. Worldwide, around 86% of children get three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, generally considered the gold standard, but an estimated 98% get vaccinated with at least something.Ruchira Gupta, a campaigner against sex trafficking who also participated in the ID2020 summit, said, 'I think this is going to be system-changing, because it can protect the last girl, who is stuck in a mud hut in a village and has no electricity, no water, no education, not even a road to walk to school, no second set of clothes, perhaps no food, and what that ID can do for her is link her to government services.'But for all the exciting developments, the question of precisely how this nut can be cracked is complex in the extreme. The World Bank also has a program, ID4D, which is examining some of the policy dimensions. The people involved with ID2020 believe that the answer will come from bringing governments and international organisations together with tech companies and start-ups, partly because private enterprise is pouring money into developing these kinds of technologies, and partly because it would be practically impossible for non-specialists in, say, UNDP or the World Bank, to stay at the forefront of everything that's being invented.Edge himself is profoundly committed to the project. PTB ventures, a company he cofounded with David Fields, has invested in GovCoin, a blockchain app that the UK government is trialling for welfare claimants. And he says he became interested in socially beneficial business because of a girl he met in a bar, and went on to marry. 'The girl I met works in early childhood development. She asked me on our first date what I was doing to make a difference. And the answer was: not very much.'The ensuing conversation led him to see Meena, a Lucy Liu film about a girl trafficked into prostitution, then to discovering that 230million children have no form of ID, and eventually to ID2020. 'If I want to write a white paper, there's a hundred places,' he said. 'If you want to start getting the private sector to work with the UN, there was nothing. And who currently has a plan to get some form of identity for the 60million plus stateless people? The answer to my mind is, aside from ID2020, no one.'"

Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984. But Bush and Reagan both did far better with Hispanic voters, capturing 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively, according to exit polling data compiled by the non-partisan Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.And Trump’s performance among Asian-Americans was the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in 1992.The racial polarization behind Trump’s victory has helped set the stage for tensions that have surfaced repeatedly since the election, in white supremacist victory celebrations, in anti-Trump protests and civil rights rallies, and in hundreds of racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic hate crimes documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks extremist movements. The SPLC reports there were 701 incidents of “hateful harassment and intimidation” between the day following the Nov. 8 election and Nov. 16, with a spike in such incidents in the immediate wake of the vote.Signs point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation.The Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a white separatist group that vilifies African-Americans, Jews and other minorities, plans an unusual Dec. 3 rally in North Carolina to celebrate Trump’s victory. Left-wing and anarchist groups have called for organized protests to disrupt the president-elect’s Jan. 20 inauguration. And a “Women’s March on Washington,” scheduled for the following day, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to protest Trump’s presidency.American politics became increasingly racialized through President Barack Obama’s two terms, “but there was an attempt across the board, across the parties, to keep those tensions under the surface,” says Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University.Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric “brought those divisions to the fore; it activated people on the right, who felt empowered, and it activated people on the left, who saw it as a threat,” she added.That dynamic was evident last week.When Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway musical “Hamilton” in New York on Friday, the multi-ethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fears of a Trump presidency. A far different view was on display the next day as a crowd of about 275 people cheered Trump’s election at a Washington conference of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist group with a strong anti-Semitic beliefs.“We willed Donald Trump into office; we made this dream our reality,” NPI President Richard Spencer said. After outlining a vision of America as “a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity,” he closed with, “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!”DIVISION BREEDS CONFRONTATION Though Trump’s election victory was driven by white voters, his performance even among that group was not as strong as some of his predecessors. Reagan and George H.W. Bush both won the presidency with higher shares of the white vote than the 55 percent that Trump achieved.The historical voting patterns reflect decades of polarization in American politics, but the division surrounding Trump appears more profound, says Cas Mudde, an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the University of Georgia. These days, he adds, “people say they don’t want their children even to date someone from the other party.”Indeed, voters’ opinions of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic lows. Surveys by the Pew Research Center showed this year that majorities of both parties held “very unfavorable” views of the other party – a first since the center first measured such sentiment in 1992.And the lion’s share of those people believe the opposing party’s policies “are so misguided that they threaten the nation’s well-being,” the center found.That level of division has spurred activists on both sides of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction.In the wake of Trump’s victory, protesters on the left took to the streets by the thousands in cities across the country, in some cases causing property damage.Much of the agitation was motivated by a belief that Trump’s administration will foster racism and push the courts and other political institutions to disenfranchise minority voters, says James Anderson, editor of ItsGoingDown.Org, an anarchist website that has promoted mass demonstrations against Trump’s presidency, including a call to disrupt his inauguration.Many on the left have come to distrust government institutions, embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see as condemnable political forces, Anderson says. “The answer now is to organize, build power and autonomy and fight back.”On the opposite end of the political spectrum, Trump’s election is bringing new hope for right-wing activists who felt abandoned by the major parties.John Roberts, a top officer in the Ku Klux Klan affiliate planning the December rally to celebrate Trump’s election, says the group is committed to non-violent demonstrations, but he sees Trump’s election as likely to bring a new era of political conflict. And much of the strife, he says, will be centered around racial divisions.“Once Trump officially takes office, there is going to be a boiling over at some point in time,” Roberts says. “Who knows when that’s going to be, but it’s not going to be pretty.”(Additional reporting by Chris Kahn in New York.
