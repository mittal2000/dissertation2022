The Huffington Post also confirmed the incident with an agency civil servant who said they were shocked and dismayed by the firing.Singleton was one of the few black Republicans in the Trump administration. He has worked on other GOP campaigns, including Carson’s 2016 bid. But he also wrote pieces that criticized Trump. In March 2016, for example, he wrote a column for The Hill that lamented Trump’s rhetoric toward people of color:I would like to see nothing more than a Republican win the White House this November, but I have to seriously ask myself if Trump is capable of doing just that. I have attempted to remain hopeful and a part of me will continue do so, but Trump’s antics make it impossible for any Republican — particularly a minority — to defend him, which can only mean bad things for the future of the GOP.Officials noticed the pieces during the vetting process, according to The New York Times, and asked him about them. Although Singleton said he regretted writing it, officials told him he would not get a permanent position at HUD because of them.Trump has not taken well to people who once criticized him. Elliott Abrams, a veteran Republican national security official, was taken out of consideration for a top job at the State Department after the president found out that he had opposed him during the campaign. Trump did so over the objections of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who wanted Abrams on his team.Singleton did not return a request for comment. HUD confirmed to the Times that as of Thursday, he is no longer working at the agency.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."

The Justice Department informed the White House last month that Flynn had misled the Trump administration on the nature of those discussions and cautioned that the national security adviser was vulnerable to blackmail by Russian officials. Now, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), its ranking member, are asking Sessions and Comey to brief their panel on the situation. They’ve also requested the transcripts of Flynn’s calls, which were reportedly intercepted by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.“These reports raise substantial questions about the content and context of Mr. Flynn’s discussions with Russian officials, the conclusions reached by the Justice Department and the actions it took in response, as well as possible leaks of classified information by current and former government employees,” the senators said in a letter sent Wednesday.Grassley and Feinstein asked for a briefing the week of Feb. 27. Read their full letter here.The Flynn revelations, as well as reports that other Trump officials had repeated contact with Russian officials during the presidential campaign, have prompted a flurry of activity on Capitol Hill. Democrats are pushing for probes of Trump’s ties to Russia, vowing to pursue committee investigations in the Senate and an independent inquiry by federal law enforcement. Democrats have also pressed Sessions, a noted supporter of candidate Trump, to recuse himself from any such investigation.Some Senate Republicans are also looking for answers, arguing that the scandal has made it difficult to get much else done.“I think with this continuing ― every day you guys are asking us questions ― it’s obviously disruptive to governing,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters on Wednesday. “The only way to make sure the country is not concerned about additional issues is to figure out a way to get it all out there, not dribble it out every other day so it’s totally disruptive.”House Republicans, meanwhile, have said they’re not interested in investigating Flynn."
2,POLITICS,"EPA Veterans Mobilize To Defend Agency's Work, Bracing For Trump's Impact","Neela Banerjee, InsideClimate News",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-employees-trump_us_58a5cfc9e4b045cd34bf5b60,"Former employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, who typically steer clear of politics, have begun advocating to support the work in Trump's crosshairs.",2017-02-16, Former EPA Region 8 employees protest outside Sen. Michael Bennet's office. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a5d0a625000017600b96b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story originally appeared on InsideClimate News.Retired and former employees of the Environmental Protection Agency are banding together in rare activism to defend colleagues still working for the agency, as fears of deep layoffs, regulatory rollbacks and science suppression spread through the federal ranks.Though organizing is still in its early stages, they’re holding protest rallies, looking to nurture agency whistleblowers and pushing senators to vote against President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator nominee, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Having vehement opponents of regulation and deniers of mainstream climate change science as president and administrator of the EPA propelled them into a type of activism most had never embraced, former EPA employees said.“I’ve never experienced this kind of outcry in the past,” John J. O’Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238 in Chicago, said of the retirees’ involvement.The EPA has about 4,800 staff in its Washington D.C. headquarters and 11,000 nationally, including in 10 regional offices. Networks of former employees from EPA Region 1 in New England, Region 6 in the Southwest, Region 9 in California and Region 10 in the Northwest have contacted the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) to confer about the best ways to advocate for current EPA workers, said PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch. Staff and former employees from Region 5 in Chicago recently staged a public protest in Federal Plaza during their lunch hour against threats of enormous staff cuts floated by an early leader of the Trump transition team, Myron Ebell. And more than 400 former employees signed an open letter to the Senate urging the rejection of Pruitt.Region 8, headquartered in Denver, has arguably the most active group of retirees. Six weeks ago, 20 of them met in a city bar during a snowstorm, discussing effective tactics against Pruitt’s nomination. About 80 of them rallied in front of the EPA in downtown Denver in mid-January before going to the offices of Colorado Sens. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, and Cory Gardner, a Republican, to meet with staff and submit letters protesting the choice of Pruitt. Now with 90 members and growing, the Region 8 group, called Save EPA!, is building its public advocacy efforts, reaching out to current employees and finding ways to be a safe conduit for whistleblowers to expose wrongdoing.“We want to show people they don’t have to give up and that we have their back,” said Suzanne Wuerthele, a toxicologist who worked for 23 years in Region 8. “They can leak information to us. We can find ways to blunt the damage from what the new administration does. This is an opportunity to reinforce EPA’s values.”Trump’s nomination of Pruitt ignited fears that the president would deliver on his campaign pledge to gut the EPA. The Oklahoma attorney general has a record of routinely suing the regulator and backing the fossil fuel industry, which has helped finance his political career. In late January, Ebell, a leader in climate denial campaigns who briefly helmed the EPA transition team, told the media that he expected Trump to slash EPA staff by one-half to two-thirds. That would take the agency to the staffing levels of the early 1970s, when it was established by President Richard Nixon.Since then, top EPA officials have scrambled to calm fears among staff. Bob Denton, who replaced Ebell as the head of the transition team, sent an email to employees that said they were “among the best I have ever had the opportunity to work with” and no final decisions had been made regarding layoffs. Acting EPA administrator Catherine McCabe released a video addressing another widespread concern, telling employees: “I would like to allay the fears and rumors that some scientific data and information are being deleted. That is not the case. The only changes that have been made...are ordinary housekeeping changes that have been made by EPA career employees.”Current and former staff, however, say they aren’t buying it. Unions representing EPA workers are organizing protests, such as the one in Chicago on Feb. 6 that was attended by several hundred current and former employees and local supporters. But in Denver, retirees and former staff seem to be taking the lead in shaping a sustained public response to the new administration’s pledges to undo rules and programs.The Denver-area retirees said they are particularly concerned about Trump’s disavowal of climate science. Within hours of Trump’s inauguration, the White House had purged nearly all mention of Obama administration climate policies from its website. Trump has vowed to end the Obama administration’s efforts to address carbon pollution at home and with other nations.“We want to be the voice for climate rules,” said Weston Wilson, who worked at the EPA for 36 years. “In all our 40 years, there has been nothing like the instability of climate change threatening the planet. It is the key to everything and the key progress that was made under the previous administration.”The Region 8 retirees are mapping out priorities. They seek to complement the efforts of union members, who they think could be overwhelmed when Congress and the administration begin slashing staff. They plan to pressure elected officials to defend the EPA, urging Sens. Bennet and Gardner to vote against the Pruitt nomination. Neither senator responded to multiple requests for comment on the Save EPA! letters.They are going to protest Wednesday when the Trump EPA and Department of Energy transition teams come to Denver.The group also wants to be a watchdog on the effects of legislation, executive orders and rule changes that would hurt the EPA, such as the recent Trump directive to get rid of two rules for each new one adopted.The trickiest part for them would be to serve as a channel for information from EPA whistleblowers to the public. Some of the Region 8 staff have experienced misuse of science in their careers. Wuerthele, for example, raised objections several years ago to EPA research on childhood exposure to pesticides that were known neurotoxins. Wilson, the recent retiree from Region 8, was a whistleblower in 2004 on a controversial EPA study of how fracking in coalbed methane affected drinking water. Many retirees withstood efforts by Ronald Reagan to hamstring the EPA and by the George W. Bush administration to thwart climate science.Federal whistleblower laws exist, “but I know how afraid people are under normal conditions” to use them, said Jeff Hart, who retired from Region 8 in 2010 after almost 20 years with the EPA. Retirees such as Wilson have been through the whistleblower experience and can advise and encourage those still with the agency.Unlike union reps, the retirees “can provide guidance and expertise on matters where they are experts or have first-hand knowledge,” said Ruch of PEER.The Region 8 group is discussing how to create safe channels of communication with current staff. The group is weighing using encrypted communications and finding safe places to meet and talk, Hart said. But Wilson worried that recommending encryption apps to potential whistleblowers would send the message that they are being monitored, frightening people even more and discouraging them from speaking out.“It feels Orwellian to me that we even have to consider such things, and I resent it,” Hart said.Technology is one of the challenges the Region 8 retirees face. They are from a generation that wrote letters to the editor and now have to quickly familiarize themselves with social media. They have to make sure that they can sustain their initial enthusiasm and keep their ranks populated for a battle that has only just begun and that could hand them many losses.The decision to act has not been a natural one for most of them. Federal workers are generally apolitical, in large measure because of the Hatch Act, which bans many types of partisan activities. But a sense of urgency has pushed most of them to shed their usual cautiousness.“The culture in general is cautious and not everyone at EPA would qualify as an environmental activist: they are professionals, scientists, engineers, hydrologists, technical people,” Hart said. “They are fact- and evidence-based. They don’t do anything lightly and they wouldn’t do a protest lightly. These people have to be truly outraged to do what we have done.”"

On February 6, the Supreme Court Justice sat down with Stanford University’s Dean for Religious Life, Jane Shaw, to discuss Ginsburg’s accomplishments, her recent book My Own Words, and to share some of the best advice she’s ever received.One of RBG’s best nuggets of advice came from her mother-in-law on Ginsburg’s wedding day, she reportedly told the crowd. “’In every good marriage, it helps sometimes to be a little deaf.’”RBG added that she applies this relationship advice not only to her marriage, but also to life.“I have followed that advice assiduously, and not only at home through 56 years of a marital partnership nonpareil. I have employed it as well in every workplace, including the Supreme Court,” she said. “When a thoughtless or unkind word is spoken, best tune out. Reacting in anger or annoyance will not advance one’s ability to persuade.” After the discussion, Ginsburg took a few audience questions. One student asked her how she would like to be remembered in 100 years. True to form, her response was perfection. “That I was a judge, who worked as hard as she could to be the best of her ability to do the job right.”Watch a short highlight reel from Ginsburg’s conversation with Shaw.

7,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Unveils Social Security Expansion Bill On The Day Millionaires Stop Paying,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-social-security-bill_us_58a61e12e4b045cd34bff1dd,The legislation would expand the payroll tax on high earners to boost benefits for everyone.,2017-02-16,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) questions Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), nominee to be director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Jan. 24, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a61e892800001f00999657.jpeg?cache=mRdKNZX7XG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) introduced a bill on Thursday to expand Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on earnings subject to payroll taxes.The progressive lawmakers presented their proposal on the day that Americans with wages of $1 million or more stop paying into Social Security for the year.Workers now contribute to Social Security based on the first $127,200 they earn every year. The new legislation would apply the 6.2-percent payroll tax to ordinary earnings of $250,000 or more, as well as to unearned income, like capital gains and dividends, above that threshold.Rather than increase benefits for those high-earning workers based on their additional contributions, the bill would use the revenue to extend Social Security’s solvency until 2078, and to boost benefits across the board with a disproportionate impact on low earners.“We can expand benefits, we can extend the life of Social Security, if we have the guts to tell the millionaires and billionaires, yes, they are going to have to pay a bit more in taxes,” Sanders said at a press conference on Capitol Hill.Sanders was joined by DeFazio; Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.); Democratic Reps. Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) and Paul Tonko (N.Y.); and representatives of progressive organizations like Social Security Works, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and the Alliance for Retired Americans.There has been a cap, or taxable maximum, on the amount of pay subject to the payroll taxes that fund Social Security since the government began collecting the tax in 1937. The cap rises with the average wage index. The share of the country’s ordinary earnings covered by the cap, however, has declined to just under 83 percent in 2014 from 90 percent in 1983.This drop is the result of the disproportionate wage growth of those with earnings above the cap, and stagnant pay growth for the vast majority of workers, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress released Thursday. An accompanying study published by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that just 1.6 percent of American workers make $250,000 a year or more, suggesting that Sanders’ bill would affect relatively few people.There is virtually no chance of the legislation advancing in the Republican-controlled Congress. Instead, the release of the bill was another opportunity for Democrats to hammer President Donald Trump for going soft on campaign promises not to cut Social Security and Medicare. Trump has not discussed his plans for the two programs since the election, but his proposals to invest in infrastructure, increase defense spending and reduce taxes will put him under enormous pressure to find savings elsewhere.Warren said at Thursday’s press conference that Trump’s appointment of Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as director of the White House Office of Management and Budget shows that Trump “has already turned his back on his promise to protect Social Security.” The Senate confirmed Mulvaney on Thursday morning in a 51-49 vote.In his confirmation hearing last month, Mulvaney refused to disavow a previous claim that Social Security is a “Ponzi scheme,” and reaffirmed his support for benefit cuts, such as an increase in the retirement age. Warren noted those positions in her comments.“That’s who Donald Trump put in charge of delivering a budget to the American Congress,” Warren said, referring to Mulvaney. “Well, I’m here to say, those budgets that cut Social Security will go down in flames. We will fight back.”"

The girl’s 56-year-old grandmother, Shirley Robinson, was treated for a gunshot wound to her leg.“That was a 7-year-old child, innocent. We were lying in the bed sleeping. What are we doing 4 or 5 o’clock in the morning? We’re in here sleeping,” Robinson told local CBS affiliate WBTV.A’yanna was shot in her head, torso and extremities, according to an autopsy report recently obtained by local media. Though the second-grader had 20 wounds, that doesn’t mean she was shot 20 times, since a single bullet may have caused both entry and exit wounds. “She was my joy, she was my everything,” Robinson said. “No matter where she go, she had to go home and be with Grandma, and that was my heart.”Robinson has already faced a family tragedy. A’yanna’s father, Antonio Allen, was shot to death on Christmas day in 2009.More than two months after A’yanna’s death, no one has been arrested. The Salisbury Police Department did not immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday.Authorities are offering a $20,000 reward for any information that leads to an arrest. Tips can be submitted to the Salisbury Police department or Crime Stoppers online or at 1-866-639-5245.Robinson, speaking to Fox 46 News this month, begged the public to help find her granddaughter’s killer.“I know y’all know something, tell something. If you hear something, tell it, because I need closure for A’yanna,” she said."

They arose again after this year’s ceremony when Adele’s “25” took home the coveted Album of the Year award over Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” Many people, including Adele and fellow singers Sufjan Stevens and St. Vincent, voiced their disappointment over Bey’s loss and the ceremony in general. (Beyoncé didn’t go home empty handed, though. She won Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video.)To provide a little context, a black artist hasn’t won Album of the Year since Herbie Hancock in 2008, and the last black woman to take home the award was Lauryn Hill in 1999. In the past 20 years, there have only been four black Album of the Year winners, along with a number of performers who sang on the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack, which won the award in 2002. When Pitchfork brought up the fact that Hancock was the last black artist to win the award, Portnow reminded the outlet, “This is a peer-voted award.”“When we say the Grammys, it’s not a corporate entity — it’s the 14,000 members of the Academy,” he said, noting that it’s hard to “create objectivity out of something that’s inherently subjective,” but added, “we do the best we can.” Portnow said that, in his opinion, musicians don’t “listen to music based on gender or race or ethnicity.”“It’s a matter of what you react to and what in your mind as a professional really rises to the highest level of excellence in any given year,” he said.Portnow explained that the Academy asks members to “listen to the music” and not pay attention to record sales, marketing or music charts when deciding on their votes. The process, he said, is “a democratic vote by majority.” “So somebody could either receive or not receive a Grammy based on one vote,” he noted. “It could be that tight.” With all that being said, Portnow did mention that the Academy is always working on increasing diversity. “In order to maintain our relevance, we have to be refreshing all the time and we have to be doing that across the board,” he said.

Now, under Trump, they think they hold the power.",2017-02-15,"President Donald Trump, flanked by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, speaks at the department headquarters in January. He told employees they were ""about to be very, very busy doing your job the way you want to do them.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a4ab912900002200f26983.jpeg?cache=GlQW1qnVEj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Donald Trump won the presidency in November, Shawn Moran’s border patrol colleagues high-fived and hugged each other.“There was a real sense that we were going to be able to do our jobs again,” said Moran, vice president at National Border Patrol Council. “That turned out to be true.” Border Patrol and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents complained for years that then-President Barack Obama constrained their ability to fulfill their mission. Trump campaigned on a promise that he would unleash them — and vowed to make large-scale deportation of undocumented immigrants a priority. This won Trump the endorsement of Moran’s group, which represents Border Patrol agents, and the National ICE Council, a union that represents ICE officers. Now, Moran said, the president is keeping his promise. Immigrant rights advocates, who were horrified at a multi-state deportation effort that swept up more than 680 people last week, agreed.“They feel emboldened and they feel that now they have a president that’s basically is going to give them carte blanche,” Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), a frequent critic of ICE tactics, said in an interview. The Obama administration, in its last years, considered only serious criminals and recent border-crossers priorities for deportation. During those years, ICE often released non-criminals and individuals who only had committed immigration-related crimes, like driving without a license. But in the first week of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order that classified almost any undocumented immigrant as an important target for deportation.ICE and Border Patrol agents anticipated they’d get more support under the new president, said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. Agents told immigrant rights advocates about “feeling really emboldened,” Hincapié said. “Like, ‘Wow, things could change, we’re going to do whatever we want, we agents will finally get to decide who gets deported and who doesn’t.’” Today, “there is a clear ‘everything goes and everyone is a target’ culture in ICE,” said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director at the undocumented activist group United We Dream. “It’s the realization of the dreams of a lot of ICE agents that endorsed Trump.”Last week, ICE carried out what it calls targeted enforcement actions — the agency doesn’t like to use the term “raids” — and arrested hundreds of people. ICE officials said that about 75 percent of those it detained were convicted criminals. But the agency has not released detailed data on those convictions, or said how many were immigration-related.Some of the people arrested or deported under Trump would have been considered low priority for removal under Obama, advocates said. Guadalupe “Lupita” García de Rayos, a mother of two U.S. citizens, had been on ICE’s radar for years after a conviction for a crime related to her immigration status — making up a Social Security number to get a job — but was not deported until last week. ICE agents arrested a recipient of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in Seattle last week, even though he had passed a background check for deportation relief. DACA does not fully guarantee safety from deportation, but recipients have typically been protected from removal unless convicted of a crime. ICE agents said the man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, was a “self-admitted gang member” and a threat to public safety. His lawyer said he “was repeatedly pressured by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to falsely admit affiliation” and “unequivocally denies” the charge. ICE was allowed to deport those types of people before, and sometimes did, even during the Obama administration. But in the final years of Obama’s presidency, some ICE and Border Patrol agents were frustrated that they had to focus on deporting immigrants convicted of serious crimes, while ignoring other people in the U.S. without authorization. Obama went “beyond prioritization or discretion into the area of nullification,” said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors increased deportation. Under Trump, Mehlman said, enforcement agents are less hamstrung. The president and the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and Border Patrol need to give immigration enforcement agents specific guidelines to ensure enforcement is uniform and prevent discrimination — even if doing so frustrates agents, Hincapié argued.ICE declined to say whether it had given additional guidance to officers in the field, pointing only to Trump’s executive order. The president has made clear he wants Border Patrol Agents and ICE officers to do what they please.Border Patrol and ICE agents are “about to be very, very busy doing your job[s] the way you want to do them,” Trump said during a speech at the Department of Homeland Security after signing the executive order. “For too long, your offices and agents haven’t been allowed to properly do their jobs. ... That’s all about to change — and I’m very happy about it and you’re very happy about it.”"

16,POLITICS,Trump Abandons Commitment To 2-State Solution In Press Conference With Netanyahu,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hedges-two-state-solution_us_58a490efe4b0ab2d2b1b4da3,"U.S. presidents have long been committed to the two-state solution, but maybe not anymore.",2017-02-15,"President Donald Trump greets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a joint news conference at the White House on Feb. 15, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a4b41025000017600b93b5.jpeg?cache=zqbSMQtGCn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump suggested he was no longer committed to a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in a joint press conference with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday.“I’m looking at two-state and one-state,” Trump said when asked whether he would seek a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that included the creation of a Palestinian state. “And I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both parties like.”“I can live with either one. I thought for a while that two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two,” Trump said. “But honestly, if Bibi [Netanyahu] and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy ― I’m happy with the one they like the best.”Trump’s comments could be an indication of a major change in U.S. policy, one that would carry complex and far-reaching implications. For almost two decades, Democratic and Republican presidents alike have sought to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution. Trump’s Wednesday comments were previewed in a background briefing to a handful of reporters Tuesday evening.While the president framed the conflict as a bilateral matter between Israel and the Palestinians, the U.S. in practice continues to play a decisive role in shaping the parameters of a potential Israeli-Palestinian agreement. If the U.S. casts aside a blueprint for resolution that dates to the Clinton administration, it would put the two groups in uncharted territory.Absent a two-state solution, Israel would soon be in a position of choosing between trying to deny occupied Palestinians citizenship in perpetuity, or forfeiting the Jewish demographic majority that gives the state its Jewish character. Israel is already under increasing pressure from pro-Palestinian activists, many of whom have long despaired of a two-state solution, to grant equal rights to all people in the territory it controls.Palestinian leaders, for their part, would almost certainly refuse any deal that did not grant them full sovereign rights, whether in their own state or a shared state with Israeli Jews. Nor is it clear how the abandoning the two-state framework is compatible with enrolling U.S.-backed Arab states like Egypt and Jordan in peacemaking efforts, as the Trump administration suggested it would like to do.Some experts have offered more nuanced readings of Trump’s remarks, however, pointing out that they do not necessarily mark a radical shift in U.S. policy.“The way Trump said it, which is, ‘whatever they both agree to is fine with me,’ doesn’t strike people as particularly unusual,” said Shibley Telhami, a specialist in American Middle East policy at the University of Maryland.But something that might give Palestinians, in particular, cause for concern is the idea that the conflict should be managed between Israel and the Palestinians alone, according to Telhami, who is also a fellow at the Brookings Institution.“If it is simply up to them, without reference to international resolution and international law, or any sense of fairness, then [Palestinians] are on the losing end,” Telhami said. “Because it’s an asymmetric world. They’re occupied and Israel has more power.”In other ways, Trump hewed toward more conventional U.S. peacemaking parameters on Wednesday. He expressed a desire for concessions from both sides, including a pause on Israeli settlement expansion.“I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit,” Trump said, addressing Netanyahu directly. “We’ll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made.”Trump also appeared to walk back his campaign promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “I’d love to see that happen,” Trump said of the move. “We’re looking at it very, very strongly. We’re looking at it with great care.”Trump has made similar comments in interviews in recent weeks. But his remarks alongside Netanyahu were perhaps the clearest sign yet that he is rethinking the decision, which many Middle Eastern leaders have warned could have an incendiary effect in the region.Trump and Netanyahu are meeting this week for the first time since Trump’s inauguration. Expectations were high for the meeting, given Trump’s promises to repair ties with Netanyahu’s conservative government after years of on-and-off tensions with the Obama administration.Netanyahu was reportedly under pressure from his right-wing coalition partners to elicit a promise from Trump that the U.S. would no longer pursue a two-state solution. A majority of Netanyahu’s Cabinet openly opposes the two-state solution, preferring to annex major portions of the occupied West Bank while continuing to deprive the Palestinians of full sovereignty. But Netanyahu told his Cabinet that he wants to avoid a confrontation with Trump, and that he feels the American president believes in a peace deal, Haaretz reported.Naftali Bennett, the head of the right-wing Jewish Home Party and the education minister in the current Israeli government, interpreted Trump’s remarks favorably, applauding them on Twitter.Netanyahu responded to Trump’s comments at Wednesday’s press conference with characteristic diplomacy, observing that few Americans or Israelis agree on what a two-state solution would look like in any event. Rather than embrace Trump’s comments as evidence that the two-state solution is no longer viable, Netanyahu reiterated his two “prerequisites for peace” with the Palestinians. Those conditions are Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, and ensuring Israel “the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River.”The Palestine Liberation Organization, which maintains control of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, recognized Israel’s existence in 1988. Netanyahu insists, however, that it must also recognize the state’s Jewish character.In addition to addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Trump and Netanyahu spoke about their shared commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.But even in a matter where the Trump administration is largely in agreement with the Israeli government, the two men had very different ways of expressing their views. Trump lambasted the Iran nuclear arms control deal negotiated by former President Barack Obama, although the White House has given no sign that it intends to jettison the agreement. “The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which I’ve talked a lot about. One of the worst deals I’ve ever seen is the Iran deal,” Trump said. “My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing ― I mean ever ― a nuclear weapon.”Netanyahu, by contrast, did not directly address the deal.“Preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons [is] something that President Trump and I, I think, are deeply committed to do,” he said. “And we are obviously going to discuss that.”He went on to praise Trump’s handling of the separate matters of Iranian ballistic missiles and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia.“Challenging Iran on its violations of ballistic missiles; imposing sanctions on Hezbollah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the Middle East and beyond, well beyond, I think that’s a change that is clearly evident in ― since President Trump took office,” he said.Khaled Elgindy, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised Palestinian leaders during negotiations with Israel from 2004 to 2009, argued that a positive outcome of Trump’s remarks might be the expansion of the debate to consider a one-state scenario where Palestinians and Israelis enjoy equal rights.But he warned that absent additional details, the president’s comments could, in the near term, bolster the vision of the Israeli right wing, which effectively supports continuing the one-state occupation indefinitely.“For the administration to not clarify what it means by alternatives to a two-state solution is unsettling,” Elgindy said. “If you have the status quo, permanent occupation, essentially that is a form of apartheid.”“I would expect that there will be probably some pushback from allies in the region,” he went on. “My sense is that [the Trump administration] really didn’t think this through.”"

Amid fears that U.S. President Donald Trump’s platform means the U.S. is no longer a safe place for refugees, they’re trying to get around the Safe Third Country Agreement, a reciprocal deal the U.S. and Canada signed in 2002 establishing that refugees must file asylum claims in whichever of the two nations they arrive in first. Already, two men making the journey into Canada have lost their fingers to frostbite. Afraid that dangerous irregular crossings will rise, refugee rights organizations and immigration lawyers are leading the calls to revisit the agreement.But it’s not just because of Trump. Advocates say heightened anxiety over the new U.S. administration and a small surge in irregular crossings are bringing attention to an agreement that’s always put refugees at risk. “Our view is that the United States has never been a safe country for all refugees,” said Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees. In theory, the Safe Third Country Agreement is meant to stop cross-border asylum claims and prevent internal migration issues. But lawyers and rights groups say that the U.S. and Canadian systems are too dissimilar for the agreement to be fair to all refugees, and that it should be suspended to stop people from endangering their lives trying to get to Canada, where the asylum process and climate for refugees are seen as more favorable. “The reality is that despite our similarities, our laws are different. The criteria is not exactly the same, the adjudication is not the same,” said Michael Niren, immigration lawyer and CEO of VisaPlace.com. “There are cases where an asylum-seeker in the U.S. wouldn’t get approved but would get approved in Canada, and possibly vice-versa,” he said.Under the current agreement, refugees can’t, for example, arrive in the U.S. but then decide to make a Canadian asylum claim at the nearest U.S.-Canada land border crossing. (There are exceptions, including for unaccompanied minors or people with direct relatives in one of the two countries, but they are limited.) However, once people get past the border of the country they want to settle in, the agreement no longer applies. That’s why people are making the illegal crossings in the first place ― once they’re in Canada, they can apply for Canadian asylum. The longstanding debate over the Safe Third Country Agreement has gained increased media attention and urgency in recent weeks, as uncertainty grows over U.S. asylum and immigration policy under Trump.Immigration lawyers are reporting a spike in calls since Trump’s election, not only from those seeking asylum but from a wide range of immigrants who are worried about what the new administration will mean for their status.“Every time there’s a news cycle about another move the Trump administration makes, it’s met with an increase in phone calls from the U.S.,” Niren said. “We’re getting calls from ... individuals who thought they would be making a refugee claim in the United States or who are in the process of it and are worried. They are considering Canada.” Dench made the same observation. “The situation since President Trump came into office has got markedly worse,” she said, citing Trump’s now-suspended ban on immigration from seven Muslim majority countries and his anti-refugee rhetoric.Yet Trump is likely not the sole reason behind the increase in irregular crossings, Dench says, explaining that the global number of refugees has risen in recent years and it’s only natural that a certain percentage of that group will find its way to Canada. Those crossing illegally also make up a tiny percentage of Canada’s overall refugee intake. Dench’s organization and other refugee advocacy groups have long opposed the Safe Third Country Agreement and have challenged its legality in Canadian federal court. They believe that the government should make use of an article in the agreement that allows either party to unilaterally suspend the Safe Third Country designation for a renewable period of three months.The agreement has created a situation in which people who worry they won’t receive a fair asylum hearing in the United States are now pushed toward illegally crossing the border, immigration lawyers argue. The argument is similar to one that migration experts have advanced amid the refugee crisis in Europe. For years, aid groups have called for greater access to safe and legal means of applying for asylum in the European Union to prevent migrant deaths and irregular crossings. A similar debate over what constitutes a safe third country also exists in the context of the European crisis, after the EU and Turkey reached a controversial agreement to return migrants entering EU countries to Turkey. Rights groups believe that Turkey shouldn’t qualify as a safe third country due to restrictive laws and poor conditions for refugees there.

18,THE WORLDPOST,Canada Debates Whether The U.S. Is Still A Safe Place For Refugees,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/canada-us-refugee-agreement_us_58a1f8dfe4b03df370d8ebc1,Refugees are risking their lives to apply for asylum in Canada rather than in the U.S.,2017-02-15,"Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers take a Sudanese family into custody after they walked across the U.S.-Canada border into Hemmingford, Quebec, on Feb. 12, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a4d84825000017600b947b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dozens of asylum-seekers have walked miles in freezing temperatures to illegally cross from the United States into Canada, arriving in small towns along the border in recent weeks. Amid fears that U.S. President Donald Trump’s platform means the U.S. is no longer a safe place for refugees, they’re trying to get around the Safe Third Country Agreement, a reciprocal deal the U.S. and Canada signed in 2002 establishing that refugees must file asylum claims in whichever of the two nations they arrive in first. Already, two men making the journey into Canada have lost their fingers to frostbite. Afraid that dangerous irregular crossings will rise, refugee rights organizations and immigration lawyers are leading the calls to revisit the agreement.But it’s not just because of Trump. Advocates say heightened anxiety over the new U.S. administration and a small surge in irregular crossings are bringing attention to an agreement that’s always put refugees at risk. “Our view is that the United States has never been a safe country for all refugees,” said Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees. In theory, the Safe Third Country Agreement is meant to stop cross-border asylum claims and prevent internal migration issues. But lawyers and rights groups say that the U.S. and Canadian systems are too dissimilar for the agreement to be fair to all refugees, and that it should be suspended to stop people from endangering their lives trying to get to Canada, where the asylum process and climate for refugees are seen as more favorable. “The reality is that despite our similarities, our laws are different. The criteria is not exactly the same, the adjudication is not the same,” said Michael Niren, immigration lawyer and CEO of VisaPlace.com. “There are cases where an asylum-seeker in the U.S. wouldn’t get approved but would get approved in Canada, and possibly vice-versa,” he said.Under the current agreement, refugees can’t, for example, arrive in the U.S. but then decide to make a Canadian asylum claim at the nearest U.S.-Canada land border crossing. (There are exceptions, including for unaccompanied minors or people with direct relatives in one of the two countries, but they are limited.) However, once people get past the border of the country they want to settle in, the agreement no longer applies. That’s why people are making the illegal crossings in the first place ― once they’re in Canada, they can apply for Canadian asylum. The longstanding debate over the Safe Third Country Agreement has gained increased media attention and urgency in recent weeks, as uncertainty grows over U.S. asylum and immigration policy under Trump.Immigration lawyers are reporting a spike in calls since Trump’s election, not only from those seeking asylum but from a wide range of immigrants who are worried about what the new administration will mean for their status.“Every time there’s a news cycle about another move the Trump administration makes, it’s met with an increase in phone calls from the U.S.,” Niren said. “We’re getting calls from ... individuals who thought they would be making a refugee claim in the United States or who are in the process of it and are worried. They are considering Canada.” Dench made the same observation. “The situation since President Trump came into office has got markedly worse,” she said, citing Trump’s now-suspended ban on immigration from seven Muslim majority countries and his anti-refugee rhetoric.Yet Trump is likely not the sole reason behind the increase in irregular crossings, Dench says, explaining that the global number of refugees has risen in recent years and it’s only natural that a certain percentage of that group will find its way to Canada. Those crossing illegally also make up a tiny percentage of Canada’s overall refugee intake. Dench’s organization and other refugee advocacy groups have long opposed the Safe Third Country Agreement and have challenged its legality in Canadian federal court. They believe that the government should make use of an article in the agreement that allows either party to unilaterally suspend the Safe Third Country designation for a renewable period of three months.The agreement has created a situation in which people who worry they won’t receive a fair asylum hearing in the United States are now pushed toward illegally crossing the border, immigration lawyers argue. The argument is similar to one that migration experts have advanced amid the refugee crisis in Europe. For years, aid groups have called for greater access to safe and legal means of applying for asylum in the European Union to prevent migrant deaths and irregular crossings. A similar debate over what constitutes a safe third country also exists in the context of the European crisis, after the EU and Turkey reached a controversial agreement to return migrants entering EU countries to Turkey. Rights groups believe that Turkey shouldn’t qualify as a safe third country due to restrictive laws and poor conditions for refugees there. Yet despite some parallels, the scale of irregular crossings into Canada from the U.S. is infinitely smaller than migration to Europe. Advocates of suspending the agreement dismiss fears that doing so would cause a massive surge in asylum applications ― and even if that happens, they say, it would be better to deal with refugees in an orderly way through legal channels.Canada has so far shut down talk of revisiting the Safe Third Country Agreement.

President Donald Trump may be fond of claiming that immigration leads to crime, but the data show just the opposite. A large-scale new study led by the State University of New York at Buffalo found no association between immigration patterns and higher crime rates. In fact, immigration actually correlates with minor decreases in some crimes, according to the report published in the latest issue of the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice.“Our research shows strong and stable evidence ― across 200 U.S. metropolitan areas and 40 years ― that for murder, robbery, burglary, and larceny, as immigration increases, crime decreases on average in American metropolitan areas,” Dr. Robert Adelman, a sociologist at the University at Buffalo and the study’s lead author, told The Huffington Post.The study found no effect of immigration on aggravated assault rates, he added.In the current political climate, we need data like this to support informed ― rather than emotionally charged ― dialogue and decision-making. “This research is important because our policy debates and arguments should center around data, evidence, and facts,” Adelman said. “The more rigorous our policy discussions, the better.”The researchers analyzed census information and FBI crime data from 200 cities between the years 1970 and 2010. They found that in most cases, crime was stable or actually declined slightly in communities with large immigrant populations. This generally agrees with most previous research on the subject. “Communities experiencing demographic change driven by immigration patterns do not experience significant increases in any of the kinds of crime we examined,” Adelman said in a press release. Not only do immigrants not drive up crime rates, they also make positive contributions to their new homes. Overall, immigration waves tend to have a favorable effect on community and economic life, the study’s authors noted.“There is a large literature about the contributions and benefits of immigrants in the communities they live in,” Adelman said. “From sheer population growth to economic revitalization, immigrants often bring social and economic vitality to cities and communities.”In a 1997 study, psychologist Dean Keith Simonton found that periods of increased immigration often precede periods of exceptional creative achievement in a culture. Immigrants offer fresh ideas and perspectives, thereby spurring innovation for all of us. So yes, Lin-Manuel Miranda had it right: Immigrants do get the job done. "

Philip Pullman has you covered.Pullman, the acclaimed British author of the fantasy series “His Dark Materials,” recently announced that he will be publishing The Book of Dust, the first installment in a planned trilogy, in October.The book will feature Lyra Belacqua, the protagonist of “His Dark Materials,” though the events of The Book of Dust will take place when Lyra is still an infant. He has described the book as revolving around “the struggle between a despotic and totalitarian organization, which wants to stifle speculation and inquiry, and those who believe thought and speech should be free.”The apparent parallels between contemporary political concerns and the events of The Book of Dust are not mere coincidence, according to Pullman. “I might not be writing about Donald Trump or Brexit or Nigel Farage directly in ‘The Book of Dust,’” he stated in an interview with the Associated Press.Nonetheless, he said, the “questions they pose and the situations they set up are very much part of the world that I’m writing about.”Readers familiar with Pullman’s wildly popular “His Dark Materials” trilogy won’t be surprised by his inclusion of provocative, politically charged themes. The Golden Compass (published as The Northern Lights in the U.K.), The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass saw young, street-smart Lyra drawn into a massive conspiracy engineered by a corrupt and repressive religious order, the Magisterium, that strongly resembles the Catholic Church. Lyra, who lives in a parallel universe where each human’s soul is housed in an external daemon companion and where witches are real, crossed paths with Will Parry, who stumbled over from our dimension in pursuit of his lost father. The series blends earnest fascination with physics, metaphysics and spirituality with a critique of organized religion. (Pullman, who has openly stated that he wishes the “wretched” Catholic Church “will vanish entirely,” has identified himself as an atheist.) Despite occasional controversy surrounding the book’s anti-organized religion bent, the series has sold 18 million books worldwide and spawned a 2007 film starring Nicole Kidman as malevolent Magisterium authority Mrs. Coulter.The new series, which Pullman describes not as a prequel or sequel but an “equel” to “His Dark Materials,” will focus on inquiries into the nature of “Dust,” a mysteriously powerful substance much feared by religious leaders in the original series. As copies of George Orwell’s 1984 sell out on Amazon and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale hover at the top of the site’s best-seller list, there’s no denying that our collective appetite for tales of dystopian worlds ruled by theocratic and totalitarian oppression is at a peak. In an era when terms like “fake news” are being bandied about to discredit objective journalism and science, there’s no one better than Pullman to infuse our stacks of anti-authoritarian reading with a fresh saga about free speech and inquiry.The only downside? American and British reader have to wait until Oct. 19 to read the first book. We’ll be counting the days."
21,POLITICS,Trump's Russia Scandal Means Sessions And His Justice Department Now Face A Choice,"Jessica Schulberg, Dana Liebelson, and Ryan J. Reilly",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sessions-flynn-trump-investigation-russia_us_58a3ac76e4b03df370db99e1,The attorney general has indicated he doesn't think he needs to recuse himself from the investigations.,2017-02-15,President Donald Trump with Attorney General Jeff Sessions at his swearing in ceremony in the Oval Office. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump's Republican presidential campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a3af1125000017600b9166.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Less than a week on the job as U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions faces a potentially explosive situation: He was a top adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, but he’s now overseeing the agency investigating members of that campaign. The FBI, which falls under the umbrella of Sessions’ Justice Department, is leading a multi-agency probe of possible connections between Trump associates and the Russian government. Law enforcement and intelligence officials have phone records and intercepted calls that show members of Trump’s campaign repeatedly communicated with senior Russian intelligence officials in the months before the election, the New York Times reported Tuesday. Sessions has ties to at least two of the people who are reportedly under investigation.The FBI is also separately examining intercepted communications between the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who served with Sessions as a member of the Trump campaign’s national security advisory council. The FBI interviewed Flynn days into the Trump presidency, according to The New York Times, and reportedly had concerns about whether he was entirely forthcoming. Lying to the FBI is a felony. If the FBI investigation into Flynn’s conduct turns up wrongdoing, Sessions could be responsible for signing off on the prosecution. Flynn, who resigned as national security adviser on Monday, denies intentionally mischaracterizing his conversations with the Russian ambassador. The incident, he said in his resignation letter, was due to the “fast pace of events.” Investigators are also reportedly looking into Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, whom Sessions has known since the 1970s and communicated with frequently during the campaign. Manafort said in an email that he has never been contacted by the FBI and that he has never had any connection to Putin or the Russian government. He gave a similar statement to The New York Times but added, “It’s not like these people wear badges that say, ‘I’m a Russian intelligence officer.’” Former foreign policy adviser Carter Page and Republican operative Roger Stone are also under scrutiny, The New York Times reported. The FBI applied for a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year to monitor several members of the Trump team as part of its investigation, The Guardian reported in January. If the FBI wanted to request another FISA warrant to monitor those individuals, it would likely have to get approval from Sessions.Sessions’ relationship with the Trump campaign is especially relevant because Flynn’s contacts with Russian envoys reportedly began before the election. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon described Sessions as “the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy” in the Trump administration, and the “fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump’s agenda” during the election. Sessions regularly appeared with Trump on the campaign trail, and the Alabama senator formally nominated Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. One of Sessions’ former aides became a senior adviser in the Trump White House.Flynn resigned from his post only after a series of leaks revealed that he had mischaracterized the contents of his conversations with the Russian ambassador. After initially claiming that the discussion centered on setting up a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Flynn later admitted he discussed sanctions imposed by former President Barack Obama’s administration against Moscow after evidence of election-related hacking. Trump was notified less than a week after his inauguration that Flynn hadn’t told Vice President Mike Pence the truth about his contacts with the ambassador, White House officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday night. But Trump waited two weeks to ask for Flynn’s resignation. Flynn did not respond to a request for comment sent to an email listed as his in public records. It’s still not clear who on the Trump campaign ― if anyone ― knew that Flynn was discussing U.S. sanction policy with the Russian ambassador, potentially sending mixed signals to Moscow while Obama was still president. It’s also not clear what other members of the Trump campaign discussed with contacts in Russia before the election. The U.S. intelligence community believes that Russian government-backed hackers obtained access to email accounts of top Democrats and leaked incriminating information in order to hurt former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign and help Trump’s. Investigators have not found evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to interfere with the election, according to The New York Times. Asked during his confirmation hearing if he backed the intelligence community’s assessment that Moscow interfered with the election on behalf of Trump, Sessions was evasive. “I just know what the media says about it,” he said last month. The Justice Department traditionally prides itself on its independence from the White House. It’s not uncommon for an attorney general to send an agency-wide memo making clear that it won’t allow the White House to interfere with investigations, said Matthew Miller, who worked as a Justice Department spokesman during the Obama administration. There’s no law that says the attorney general must recuse him or herself from dealing with a case in the absence of a criminal investigation or prosecution. Rather, it’s up to Sessions to decide whether he can handle the issue fairly. As of now, one AG ethics expert said, Sessions doesn’t necessarily need to recuse himself. But Democratic lawmakers are concerned. “I believe that Attorney General Sessions has no choice but to recuse himself, and then he should and must put an independent investigative authority in charge,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday afternoon.The Huffington Post sent several questions to a Justice Department spokesman about Sessions’ recusal plans. Had he consulted with Justice Department ethics officials about whether recusal would be appropriate? Would he recuse himself from any investigation into members of the Trump team? What about specific individuals Sessions had worked closely with? A department spokesman and a Sessions spokeswoman declined to comment. By not placing someone else in charge of the investigation, Sessions risks, at the very least, creating the appearance of impropriety. The Justice Department has previously made recusals public to reassure the public of the independence of an investigation and maintain the department’s image. (In one recent instance, the acting head of the Civil Rights Division recused himself from a voting case because he had offered legal advice to the state in question when he was in private practice.)Democrats, who are worried that the Trump administration will stymie ongoing investigations into the president’s ties to Russia, asked Sessions during his confirmation hearing if he would recuse himself from cases related to Trump and his advisers. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) specifically asked Sessions whether he planned to recuse himself from any FBI or Justice Department investigation into whether Flynn’s communications with the Russian ambassador were permissible under law.  Sessions said he didn’t think he needed to. “I am not aware of a basis to recuse myself from such matters,” he wrote in response to Feinstein’s question. He added that if a “specific matter arose where I believed my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, I would consult with Department ethics officials regarding the most appropriate way to proceed.” He also told Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) that “if merely being a supporter of the President’s during the campaign warranted recusal from involvement in any matter involving him, then most typical presidential appointees would be unable to conduct their duties.” There is a regulation that bans DOJ employees from participating in a criminal investigation or prosecution if the person has a personal or political relationship with anyone “substantially involved” in the case. But the Justice Department has not announced any criminal proceedings. “There is a presumption against recusal, and for a good reason,” said James Tierney, the former attorney general of Maine and an expert on AG ethics. “These people are there to make the tough decisions. That’s why you want them there,” he said. Usually, attorneys generals need to recuse themselves only if they believe they can’t look at a matter fairly because they have personal feelings about the issue or people involved, “and these situations are very rare.”Tierney told HuffPost that, as of now, he doesn’t believe Sessions needs to recuse himself. He also pointed out that it’s more difficult for Sessions to recuse himself because the Senate has not confirmed a deputy attorney general who could handle the matter in his stead. As it stands, Tierney said, “I would assume he would not recuse.”But Miller, the former Justice Department spokesman under the Obama administration, said that if Sessions doesn’t recuse himself, he risks prompting resignations at the Justice Department.Miller would like to see Sessions appoint a special prosecutor for a criminal investigation and for Congress to create an independent fact-finding panel modeled after the 9/11 Commission. The benefit of the 9/11 Commission-style panel, he said, is that it could reveal wrongdoing that wouldn’t amount to criminal charges. “Whether the [Trump] campaign behaved appropriately, whether they coordinated with the Russian government ― there are things they could’ve done that might not be criminal violations that still would be fundamentally contrary to our democracy,” Miller said. “The American public has the right to know that.” "

On Tuesday, Politico obtained a 27-year-old episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in which Lisa Fierstein spoke out about the alleged abuse she suffered. She has since recanted her claims. Kashen said the domestic violence allegations helped sealed Puzder’s fate and also credited the many Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s employees who came forward with stories of discrimination endured while working at those restaurants. Puzder is the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of those fast-food chains. Women’s groups have been relentless in voicing their opposition to Puzder’s nomination. “He will be bad for women, bad for workers, and bad for women who work,” Ultraviolet, a national women’s advocacy organization, said when Trump announced his pick for labor secretary. “Good riddance,” the group said Wednesday in a statement.“Andrew Puzder’s withdrawal from consideration for labor secretary is a testament to the power and persistence of women and working people in this country,” Debra Ness, president of National Partnership for Women & Families, said in a statement. “This is a major victory for America’s workers spearheaded by a strong, broad-based coalition that will continue to scrutinize and challenge the administration’s anti-woman and anti-worker agenda.”The accusations from women’s groups helped bolster the outcry from labor advocates who were upset Puzder was being considered for a job that would involve protecting and defending the safety and rights of workers. Overall, nearly 150 civil rights, women’s rights, labor and faith organizations had called for Trump to withdraw Puzder’s nomination.Puzder, 66, has been a vocal opponent of worker’s rights, coming out against minimum wage increases and other benefits that would disproportionately benefit women, who make up a majority of low-paid hourly workers. He’s been outspoken about the allure of automating fast-food and retail jobs.“They [robots] never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a slip and fall, or an age, sex or race discrimination suit,” he said recently.And even before his fast-food career began, Puzder had a history of working against women’s rights. As an attorney in Missouri, he authored a fetal personhood law that defined life as beginning at conception and was part of a broader strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade. As the CEO of fast-food chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., Puzder stood up for widely criticized advertising campaigns featuring nearly naked women eating burgers.“I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American,” Puzder told Entrepreneur last year. “I used to hear, brands take on the personality of the CEO. And I rarely thought that was true, but I think this one, in this case, it kind of did take on my personality.”The sentiment behind these ads led to harassment and discrimination at Puzder’s restaurants, according to women’s groups. “The corporate culture created by the ads has put his employees at risk, given the already high level of sexual harassment in the restaurant industry,” the National Women’s Law Center said in a statement released Wednesday morning.Almost from the instant Puzder was nominated, organizations working to end domestic violence and sexual assault focused on allegations that he had physically abused his wife in the 1980s. Fierstein alleged in court documents that Puzder assaulted and battered her on May 22, 1986, “striking her violently about the face, chest, back, shoulders and neck.” That beating, she claimed, caused “severe and permanent injuries” ― a sentiment she repeated during an appearance on the “The Oprah Winfrey Show” a few years later. In recent weeks, government watchdog group Campaign for Accountability has led the fight to unseal Puzder’s divorce filings, arguing that the public deserves to know if they contain domestic violence allegations. While a judge released some previously unseen documents, the full records remained sealed on Wednesday. Dan Stevens, the executive director of Campaign for Accountability, said he was gratified that Senate Republicans recognize that allegations of domestic violence should disqualify a person from serving at the highest level of government.“[We] worked to make the labor secretary nominee’s entire record available for public inspection to ensure the American people knew exactly who they who were getting with Mr. Puzder,” he said in a statement. “It’s clear that the more senators learned about Mr. Puzder, the less inclined they were to support him. All nominees should be subject to similar scrutiny.”"

(It was an interview that led to some popular memes): Tapper explained that the interview happened during a time when the president had falsely said that the murder rate was higher than it had been in 47 years and that the media isn’t covering terrorism properly.“There were just empirical lies that the president was telling, and I was challenging her on them. She wasn’t really disputing it,” he said.Tapper explained Conway said something “to the effect” of, “Do those things he says that aren’t true, are they more important than the things he says that are true?”“What?” said Tapper while Conan talked about how that moment felt like we had all just gone through a “time warp.”Tapper said he hadn’t heard anyone in the administration admit that the president was lying before. He continued, “It’s just such a bizarre formulation, ‘What about all the lies that Nixon didn’t tell?’ What? What are you talking about? ‘What about all the presidents that John Wilkes Booth didn’t kill?’”The CNN anchor ended the segment by talking about White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Tapper said journalists used to have good relationships with Spicer when he was a communications director at the Republican National Committee, and now, “A lot of us don’t necessarily recognize the guy that we see on the podium.”We’ll help you out, Jake.Here he is, right?"

Lisa Fierstein, who used a pseudonym and wore a wig and dark glasses, told viewers that her ex-husband threatened revenge after she went public with claims of abuse.“The most frightening thing was leaving, because once I made that break and once I made it public, and remember my ex-husband was a public figure and everyone knew him and knew what he was doing, and once I made that public, he vowed revenge,” she said. “He said, ‘I will see you in the gutter. This will never be over. You will pay for this.’”Allegations that Puzder, now a fast-food executive, was an abusive husband first emerged in 1989 when The Riverfront Times published an article detailing claims made in the couple’s divorce filings. The newspaper resurfaced the story after Puzder was chosen by President Donald Trump to lead the Labor Department in December.Fierstein has since recanted, stating that she was counseled to file a report of abuse during divorce proceedings. Puzder has always denied the allegations. The Oprah Winfrey Network provided members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee with a copy of the tape for viewing, but didn’t release it publicly.Puzder is scheduled to appear before the committee on Thursday for his long-delayed confirmation hearing. In a letter sent to the committee, Fierstein said she regretted appearing on the show.“I was hesitant,” Fierstein wrote, “but encouraged by friends and became caught up in the notion of a free trip to Chicago and being a champion of women and women’s issues.”She previously accused him of hitting her and throwing her to the kitchen floor during an altercation in 1986. She also filed for a protective order, claiming that Puzder “attacked me, choked me, threw me to the floor, hit me in the head pushed his knee into my chest twisted my ar​m and dr​agged me​ ​on the floor, threw me against a wall, tried to stop my call to 911 and kicked me in the back.”In her “Oprah” episode, she said that men in high positions, such as her former husband, often don’t leave marks.“The damage that I sustained, you can’t see. It’s permanent, permanent damage. But there’s no mark, and there never was,” she said. “They don’t hit you in the face. They’re too smart. They don’t hit you in front of everyone.”The Campaign for Accountability, a government watchdog, has been fighting to unseal Puzder’s divorce records before his confirmation hearing, arguing that any allegations of domestic violence contained within them should be weighed by the senators vetting him.

Bob Corker takes questions on reports that members of Trump's team were in contact with Russian officials throughout the campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a4b7d12900002200f269be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) wants answers about any contact that occurred between Russian officials and top members of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and he wants them fast, before the steady trickle of revelations cripples the Republican agenda.Whether it’s reforming tax laws or repealing Obamacare, Corker said, “you name it,” that’s an issue Republicans won’t be able to focus on until they get to the bottom of what now-former Trump adviser Michael Flynn told Russia’s U.S. ambassador about sanctions.After fielding questions about Flynn all Tuesday, Corker and his fellow Republicans were again flooded with queries on Wednesday ― this time about reports that members of Trump’s campaign were in “constant contact” with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year leading up to the election.Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters Wednesday that the latest development “influenced” his thinking on how Republicans need to proceed with an investigation.“I think with this continuing ― every day you guys are asking us questions ― it’s obviously disruptive to governing,” Corker said. “We need to figure out a better way to handle this, and I don’t know what the answer to that is right now.”“The only way to make sure the country is not concerned about additional issues is to figure out a way to get it all out there, not dribble it out every other day so it’s totally disruptive,” he continued.The investigation into what Flynn and others on Trump’s campaign team did, and what the White House knew and when, will fall primarily on the shoulders of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But that panel’s meetings are closed to the public and press. So Corker said he and others are weighing the best options for how other committees should proceed to make sure the American public gets some answers.“We’re talking about this and not something else. We’ve got to figure out a way to get it behind us,” he said, adding that he’s “hoping the White House will tighten up” and stop sending conflicting messages.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, agreed that timing is key.“I think sooner is better than later,” Blunt said, noting that an independent commission could possibly delay the story by months.Republicans aren’t alone in feeling besieged by the constant stream of leaks about Trump’s administration. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called it “extraordinary” that the U.S. “intelligence services seem to be at war” with the president.“This is an unprecedented moment,” Murphy told reporters on Wednesday. “I’ve never been a part of something like this in my political career. News is breaking at such a dizzying pace.”The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner (Va.), said the investigation needs to be done “expeditiously” and “thoroughly.”“The challenge is not a day goes by without some new incident potentially complicating things,” he said.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had expressed similar frustrations on Tuesday. A reporter told the senator that he had a non-Flynn question. McCain lifted his arms and hugged the reporter. “It sucks the oxygen out of the room,” McCain said of the constant scandals. “We’re like small children, in that we only have certain priorities. Our attention spans are short and when you take the attention away from one issue and put it on another, honestly, it slows the progress of the issue that is not paramount at the time.”Speaking Wednesday, McCain disputed the idea that the Flynn scandal was distracting Capitol Hill leaders from getting work done, although he said it’s important for Republicans to “keep our eye on the ball.” The bigger threat to the GOP’s ability to advance its agenda is the general “dysfunction” at the White House, he said, where it’s unclear who is calling the shots and why communication has been so bad.The “mixed messages” and “contradictory statements” coming out of the White House can’t be denied, McCain told reporters.“On literally every major issue there is, there’s been contradictory statements,” he said.McCain had some free advice for Trump on how to restore order. “Set up a process of decision-making in the White House,” he said. “You get somebody who’s really well-regarded as the new national security adviser, and you start the machinery. And don’t, by the way, roll out again a refugee executive order that takes everybody by surprise.”Pressed for his thoughts on those reports that Trump’s campaign team communicated regularly with Russian officials, McCain couldn’t say with “confidence” that such contact didn’t extend all the way up to the president.“All of it is concerning, all of it is very concerning, all of it is very concerning.” he said."

In fact, one in four women die from coronary heart disease, which is what commonly causes a heart attack. “I found out fairly recently that heart disease is the number one risk for women and I feel like people don’t talk about that,” Britton told The Huffington Post. “I like to advocate for women, so it felt really important to me to get this conversation out there.” Coronary heart disease occurs when plaque builds up along the arteries that supply blood to your heart. It can be very sneaky ― most women don’t know they have it until they’re experiencing a heart attack. Symptoms can present as unusual fatigue, shortness of breath, pain in one or both arms, nausea, vomiting or pain in the jaw, teeth and neck.The onset of heart disease can be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise and eating nutritious food. It’s also critical to monitor your psychological health: Depression and stress can affect women’s hearts more than men’s, according to the Mayo Clinic. Research also links chronic stress to an increased chance of having a heart attack.“I really try to encourage women to get to know their own body,” Britton said. “Because what works for your best friend is not necessarily going to work for you. And it’s such a moment of self care when you actually get to know what your body needs.”For Britton personally, that means keeping tabs on the mental health component of heart disease. The actress is already a fairly healthy eater ― she has a bowl of oatmeal with almond milk and maple syrup for breakfast, leafy greens for lunch and good protein for dinner, she said. But it’s her mentality that she really tries to balance, which she does through meditation.“Meditation has become a part of my life,” Britton said. “It’s literally just sitting and accessing your breath and letting your mind quiet. You can do it for five or 10 minutes a day. It’s nice to take longer, but as women, particularly, it becomes hard to take that time for ourselves.” So, do all of these healthy habits also contribute to Britton’s incredible head of hair? Not exactly, the actress the said ― she credits her famous mane to good genes.Luscious locks and a healthy heart? Goals."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andy-puzder-goes-down_us_58a4a8bce4b094a129f176f4,The former Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chief executive is the first casualty among the president's controversial Cabinet picks.,2017-02-15,"Fast-food workers in Los Angeles take part in nationwide protests to denounce Donald Trump's nomination of Andy Puzder, a restaurant mogul who owns Carl's Jr. and other chains, as labor secretary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a4a9bd25000017600b938c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Andy Puzder confirmed Wednesday afternoon that he will pull himself from consideration for labor secretary. He is the first of President Donald Trump’s nominees to not make it through the confirmation process.In a statement, Puzder praised the “highly qualified team” of Trump picks that he will no longer be joining.“I want to thank President Trump for his nomination,” Puzder said. “I also thank my family, and my many supporters ― employees, businesses, friends and people who have voiced their praise and hopeful optimism for the policies and new thinking I would have brought to America as Secretary of Labor.”The move came as support evaporated among Republicans for the former fast-food executive. At least seven Republican senators refused to publicly back the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the burger chains Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, as criticism mounted over his hefty stack of labor violations and long-standing support for increased immigration.After five separate delays, his confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee was scheduled for Thursday. Puzder is the 13th Cabinet pick in history to withdraw his nomination and the first since Tom Daschle dropped from consideration to head the Department of Health and Human Services in 2009.Puzder needed support from at least 50 of the 52 Republicans in the Senate, as no Democrats or independents had pledged to vote for him. The nominee could have yielded the closest vote since Vice President Mike Pence cast a historic tie-breaking vote to confirm Education Secretary Betsy DeVos earlier this month.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one of the Senate’s most vocal opponents of Trump’s nominees, sounded ready for the withdrawal Wednesday.Labor groups who opposed Puzder’s nomination used the news to remind the president what they hope for in the next labor secretary.“We urge President Trump to listen to the American people, remain mindful of the promises he made to working families during the campaign and in his inaugural address, and nominate a candidate for secretary of labor who will always put workers first and foremost,” Christine Owens, the executive director of the nonprofit National Employment Law Project, said in a statement. “Any less, and the American people will once again say NO to a secretary who doesn’t speak for America’s workers.”Puzder was a controversial pick to lead a department with the explicit mission “to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners.” His company repeatedly stiffed its badly paid workers, whom Puzder suggested should be replaced by machines. He opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.“When Donald Trump first tapped Andy Puzder to be labor secretary, fast-food workers told the President that if he sided with fast-food CEOs instead of fast-food workers, he’d be on the wrong side of history,” Darin Brooks, a Hardee’s worker campaigning in North Carolina for the Fight for $15 labor movement, said in a statement. “And today, we are on the right side of history. This is a major victory for the Fight for $15, but we can’t and won’t back down until the Trump Administration gives us a real labor secretary who will put working people over corporate profits.”After Puzder became CEO in 2000, Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s were hit with more federal employment discrimination lawsuits than any other major burger chain in the country, according to an investigation published last month by Capital & Main, a California-based investigative news outlet. The company failed to send new workers to staff restaurants after a 2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement audit forced the franchises to fire some 1,200 workers in a matter of days, as HuffPost reported.“It was extraordinary that Trump nominated Puzder in the first place,” Sue Schurman, a professor at Rutgers University’s School of Management and Labor Relations, told HuffPost. “The president ran on his determination to bring jobs back to America. Then he nominates a guy who essentially says ‘my employees are the best of the worst and I’d like to replace them all with technology.’”Puzder’s personal life became a major point of criticism after his nomination. On Wednesday, Politico obtained a copy of a 1990 “Oprah Winfrey Show” episode in which Puzder’s ex-wife said he was physically abusive and that he “vowed revenge” toward her for speaking out. She has since retracted the allegation. The alleged abuse seemed to compound Puzder’s macho public image, forged from statements about his unabashed love of “boobs and burgers.” His restaurants frequently run TV ads in which scantily clad, large-breasted women chow down seductively on burgers. Adding to his sexualized reputation, he sold his $8 million mansion in California to a porn mogul. Even the conservative National Review came out against Puzder. In an unsigned editorial published Wednesday, the magazine praised his staunch opposition to minimum wage hikes and “unsympathetic” deflection of “bullying by organized labor,” but railed against his long-standing support for increased immigration.“Not only is Puzder a representative of the worst reflex of corporate America on one of Trump’s signature issues, he is now significantly weakened,” the magazine’s editors wrote. “We understand the impulse of the White House and the Senate to try to bulldog through rather than to give obstructionist Democrats a scalp. Yet, all the major Trump nominees have won their confirmation battles. The country, and the administration, can weather a re-do on this one.”This story has been updated with Puzder’s confirmation that he is withdrawing as the labor secretary nominee and reaction to it."

One of her biggest sellers is her series of milestone cards to track every step in a preemie’s journey and celebrate their progress. The milestones range from first snuggles to first weight gain to first day without wires.Purling told The Huffington Post the project was inspired by her son, James, who was born just 30 weeks into her pregnancy and spent the first five weeks of his life in the NICU.“It was the toughest thing we have ever experienced,” she said. “But each day I would sit by the side of his incubator scribbling in a journal and taking photos to document every little step he took and every little milestone he reached ― it was my way of coping.”Though Purling had milestone cards for full-term babies, she found that none of those captured the special leaps that little fighters in the NICU take every day.“I was celebrating milestones that seemed so simple to everyone else, such as his first suck of his dummy and finally being able to breathe on his own, but they were absolutely huge in the NICU world,” the mom explained.“With each new milestone, we could breathe a sigh of relief and a weight was lifted from our shoulders,” she added. “Ultimately, each milestone meant James was getting stronger and was a step closer to coming home with us.”The preemie milestone cards are available for purchase at the Miracle Mumma online store and The Preemie Store website. There are card packs for twins, baby boys and girls, as well as gender neutral options.Purling said she’s received heartwarming feedback from parents who have purchased the cards for their preemies. Many send her updates and photos, and she enjoys staying in touch and following their babies’ progress. “I love being there to support them every step of the way,” she said. In addition to the milestone cards, Purling has also launched a Facebook page for Miracle Mumma, which has become a sort of support network for preemie parents. The mom said she’s glad she’s been able to bring so many people together.“I believe these cards give parents of premature babies something to look forward to and offer a glimmer of hope at a time that is so uncertain and frightening,” the mom said, noting that the cards can help parents break down the overwhelming experience and focus on each small step.“One of my customers said these cards allow her to feel excited about something at such a difficult time ― she is able to celebrate the small things like any other parent would, and it somehow helps ‘normalize’ the precarious situation,” Purling added. She’s also happy her work can raise awareness around premature birth and help others understand what preemies go through. Ultimately, Purling wants preemie parents to know they are not alone. “The NICU can be quite isolating, and parents may feel like others don’t understand ― but there is a community of preemie parents out there who get it,” she said. “I believe these milestone cards are helping to make this scary time just a little bit brighter for these families.”Keep scrolling and visit the Miracle Mumma website and Facebook page to see more preemie milestone cards.

Many send her updates and photos, and she enjoys staying in touch and following their babies’ progress. “I love being there to support them every step of the way,” she said. In addition to the milestone cards, Purling has also launched a Facebook page for Miracle Mumma, which has become a sort of support network for preemie parents. The mom said she’s glad she’s been able to bring so many people together.“I believe these cards give parents of premature babies something to look forward to and offer a glimmer of hope at a time that is so uncertain and frightening,” the mom said, noting that the cards can help parents break down the overwhelming experience and focus on each small step.“One of my customers said these cards allow her to feel excited about something at such a difficult time ― she is able to celebrate the small things like any other parent would, and it somehow helps ‘normalize’ the precarious situation,” Purling added. She’s also happy her work can raise awareness around premature birth and help others understand what preemies go through. Ultimately, Purling wants preemie parents to know they are not alone. “The NICU can be quite isolating, and parents may feel like others don’t understand ― but there is a community of preemie parents out there who get it,” she said. “I believe these milestone cards are helping to make this scary time just a little bit brighter for these families.”Keep scrolling and visit the Miracle Mumma website and Facebook page to see more preemie milestone cards.

Tell us what you stand up for, with #LoveTakesAction.Part of the perks of being a woman of color are the unique bonds we form with one another. As a homage to these sisterhoods, Brooklynites, social activists and best friends Mickey Ferrera and Brittany Brathwaite created The Homegirl Box. The quarterly gift box contains items inspired by revolutionary women of color like Frida Kahlo and Assata Shakur. Each box includes four to five clothing, beauty, decorative, health and wellness or home items as well as a staple herstory card which informs on the legacy of the historic women who inspired the box. The box was created not only as a means of celebrating iconic women, but also as a means for women to remind their friends ― or themselves ― of their power and purpose. “The love that homegirls show for each other and realness of how they show up is what we wanted to invoke with the naming of this box,” the co-founders told The Huffington Post. “It’s a proclamation to homegirls - women who never called what they were doing (i.e sending flowers to someone’s job or making sure someone is fed, checking in and sending affirmation of worth) sisterhood but it is ― and it’s radical and transformative.”But the co-founders said the box serves more than one purpose.“[It’s meant to] to celebrate and acknowledge women business owners,” they continued. (All of the box’s items are from businesses owned by women).“To tell other women in your life: I see all of you and I want you to stay fueled and ready for the revolution -whether that revolution is internal or fighting the racist heteronormative patriarchy or whatever; to help you get or stay inspired for the revolution,” they said. The inaugural Homegirl Box was named The Frida Box in honor of the legendary Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. It debuted as part of their soft launch in December and sold out in 24 hours. “We started with Frida because we thought it was important to re-write and re-shape how she was being portrayed. The unibrow-less Frida who wears Daft Punk shirts and flower crowns isn’t the Frida that we know - [she is] a radical and political activist who transformed her illness and physical disability into art that begged to be seen and felt,” they said. “Frida painted herself because she didn’t see herself reflected, she made space for herself in a male-dominated industry [and] she loved hard.”While Brathwaite and Ferrera acknowledged that love in itself isn't the answer to all of society's ailments, they do believe there is “space for radical love, radical hope, and joy” ― with an emphasis on black joy -- in the resistance movement. “We both know from our experience as organizers, youth workers, movement builders, and trap scholars that keeping ourselves and our sisters fueled must be part of our work,” they said. “Women carry much of the work in visioning and creating revolution and yet, who is looking out for us? Who is making sure we are fed and that we can cover rent? Who has our backs? Our Homegirls.”The Homegirl Box officially launches on March 3rd. Their next box will be dedicated to civil rights activist Assata Shakur. Know a story from your community of people fighting hate and supporting groups who need it?

Now a man identifying himself as “Harald Hitler” and sporting the clothing, slicked-down black hair and toothbrush mustache of der Führer has been arrested by Austrian police on suspicion of “glorifying” the Nazi dictator.“Hitler” had been spotted several times over the last week in the border town of Braunau am Inn, Adolf Hitler’s birthplace, and posing for photos at the building where the German dictator was born.Police said the 25-year-old man had recently moved to the town. He had also been seen on the streets of Graz and Vienna, according to police.Officials said his intent was to honor the Nazi leader. “It is definitely not a carnival joke or an art project. The young man knows exactly what he is doing,” said a local police spokesman, the Telegraph reported. “I have often seen this gentleman in Braunau and wonder if this means something,” the Oberösterreichische Nachrichten quoted a local resident as saying, reported German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.Glorifying the Nazi era or Hitler is a crime in Austria. Similar anti-Nazi laws exist in Germany, France and Italy. Media that ran photos of “Harald” blurred out the man’s face.“Harald’s” actual name wasn’t provided by police.Austrian officials reportedly plan to turn the building where Hitler was born in 1889 into a charity headquarters for the disabled, though some also want the structure demolished. The building has become a magnet for neo-Nazis. Hitler moved to Germany in 1913.Hitler’s shadow lurks in the background whenever there’s a resurgence in Europe of the extreme right — and the emergence of Nazi symbols and sympathizers triggers crackdowns. On Sunday, Amazon yanked controversial self-published books that deny the Holocaust occurred off its websites in countries where such books are prohibited under anti-Nazi laws. The books vanished from the sites following an investigation by The Times of London that found dozens of such titles were being offered for sale in those countries. The books are still available on Amazon websites in other countries, including in Britain and the U.S. Want more crazy stories like this? Get the HuffPost Weird News email."

Gen. Michael Flynn seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Dec. 10, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a375f92900002200f2668d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Michael Flynn, an early and enthusiastic backer of President Donald Trump, resigned from his post as national security adviser on Monday evening, after just 25 days on the job.It was the second time in less than three years that the former intelligence analyst was forced out of a prestigious government position. In 2014, Flynn, a lieutenant general at the time, announced that he would step down as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency about a year before he was expected to leave. DIA officials have said he was forced out because of his “chaotic” management style, but Flynn has said he believes that the real issue was that he raised the alarm about the threat of “radical Islamism.” Trump’s presidency offered a second chance for the ousted lieutenant general ― and this time with a commander in chief who would take seriously his warnings about Islamic terrorism. But before even entering the White House, Flynn made a mistake that would ultimately cost him his job in the Trump administration.Congressional Democrats began calling for Flynn’s resignation after a series of leaks revealed that he spoke with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. over the phone on Dec. 29 ― the same day that the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its alleged effort to help Trump win the election through a series of cyberattacks. Flynn initially said that he didn’t discuss the sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, but later backed away from that denial after it became clear that the FBI had transcripts of the conversations.Here’s what we know about Flynn’s ties to Moscow and his interactions with Kislyak: Dec. 10, 2015: Flynn traveled to Moscow for a paid speaking gig at a celebration of the 10th anniversary of Russia Today, a state-owned news network that critics characterize as a propaganda outlet for the government. Flynn was photographed sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the trip. The Army is reportedly investigating whether Flynn received money from the Russian government at the time, which could violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution.Nov. 18, 2016: Trump chose Flynn to serve as his national security adviser, a role that guarantees Flynn access to the country’s most closely guarded secrets and a direct line to the president. Dec. 29, 2016: President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russian intelligence services and expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. Flynn and Kislyak spoke several times by phone, The Washington Post later reported.Dec. 30, 2016: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested his country would retaliate. “We, of course, cannot leave unanswered the insults of the kind, reciprocity is the law of diplomacy and foreign relations,” he said. The Foreign Ministry recommended Putin expel 31 U.S. diplomats from Moscow and four from St. Petersburg. Putin issued an official statement, announcing that Moscow would not retaliate. Instead, Putin said, they would wait to work with the incoming Trump administration to restore relations. Trump congratulated Putin on the decision. Late December 2016/early January 2017: Intelligence analysts looked for clues to explain Moscow’s unexpected reversal. That search led them to transcripts of intercepted conversations between Flynn and Kislyak ― whose communications are monitored by the FBI.Jan. 12, 2017: Eight days before Trump’s inauguration, David Ignatius of The Washington Post reported the Dec. 29 phone calls between Flynn and Kislyak. Ignatius noted that the calls occurred on the same day as the new sanctions against Russia, but did not describe the contents of the calls. He later updated the article to include a Trump transition official’s claim that the calls took place before the sanctions were announced.Jan. 13, 2017: Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in a conference call that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak “centered on the logistics” of setting up a post-election call between Trump and Putin. “That was it, plain and simple,” Spicer said.Jan. 15, 2017: Justice Department officials discussed whether the White House should be told about the contents of the conversations between Flynn and Kislyak. Amid questions about whether Flynn had undercut Obama’s sanctions in conversations with Kislyak, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Flynn “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.” The timing of the phone calls was “strictly coincidental,” Pence said.  Jan. 19, 2017: Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and outgoing CIA Director John Brennan argued in favor of telling Trump about the Flynn-Kislyak communications, The Washington Post reported. FBI Director James Comey opposed telling Trump, fearing it could interfere with an ongoing investigation into ties between Trump associates and Russia.Jan. 23, 2017: Spicer told reporters Flynn and Kislyak had one phone conversation. It covered a plane crash that killed members of a Russian military choir, Christmas greetings, negotiations related to the civil war in Syria and setting up the Trump-Putin phone call. Yates pressed Comey again about notifying the White House. By this time, his opposition had faded.Jan. 26, 2017: Yates briefed White House counsel Donald McGahn about Flynn’s discussion with Kislyak, Spicer told reporters Tuesday. The Washington Post previously reported that Yates and a senior career national security official told McGahn that they believed Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the content of the conversations. They reportedly warned that Flynn may have placed himself in a position in which he could be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow.Feb. 8, 2017: Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Kislyak during an interview with the Post.Feb. 9, 2017: Through a spokesman, Flynn told the Post he “couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”The Post reported that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions in December. “Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” a former official told the Post.  Feb. 10, 2017: The Kremlin confirms that Flynn and Kislyak spoke by phone, but denies that they discussed sanctions.  Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that he was unaware of the Post report that quoted former and current U.S. officials accusing Flynn of misleading the administration about his conversations with Kislyak. “I haven’t seen that. I’ll look into that,” Trump said. Flynn called Pence to apologize for misleading him about conversations with Kislyak, ABC later reported. Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called for Flynn’s removal. “The allegation that General Flynn, while President Obama was still in office, secretly discussed with Russia’s ambassador ways to undermine the sanctions levied against Russia for its interference in the Presidential election on Donald Trump’s behalf, raises serious questions of legality and fitness for office,” Schiff said in a statement. Feb. 12, 2017: White House policy adviser Stephen Miller dodged questions about Flynn during interviews on the Sunday morning talk shows. Asked if the president still has confidence in his national security adviser, Miller told NBC, “That’s the question that I think you should ask the president, the question you should ask Reince [Priebus], the chief of staff.” Feb. 13, 2017: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Flynn to be “fired immediately.” He “cannot be trusted not to put Putin before America,” she said in a statement. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to Trump, told MSNBC that Flynn has “the full confidence of the president.” Priebus said “the president is evaluating the situation” in a statement released an hour later. Flynn submitted his resignation letter later that night. He admitted to mischaracterizing his phone calls with Kislyak, but chalked the incident up to an accident. “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,” Flynn wrote in his resignation letter. “I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.”"

They reportedly warned that Flynn may have placed himself in a position in which he could be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow.Feb. 8, 2017: Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Kislyak during an interview with the Post.Feb. 9, 2017: Through a spokesman, Flynn told the Post he “couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”The Post reported that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions in December. “Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” a former official told the Post.  Feb. 10, 2017: The Kremlin confirms that Flynn and Kislyak spoke by phone, but denies that they discussed sanctions.  Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that he was unaware of the Post report that quoted former and current U.S. officials accusing Flynn of misleading the administration about his conversations with Kislyak. “I haven’t seen that. I’ll look into that,” Trump said. Flynn called Pence to apologize for misleading him about conversations with Kislyak, ABC later reported. Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called for Flynn’s removal. “The allegation that General Flynn, while President Obama was still in office, secretly discussed with Russia’s ambassador ways to undermine the sanctions levied against Russia for its interference in the Presidential election on Donald Trump’s behalf, raises serious questions of legality and fitness for office,” Schiff said in a statement. Feb. 12, 2017: White House policy adviser Stephen Miller dodged questions about Flynn during interviews on the Sunday morning talk shows. Asked if the president still has confidence in his national security adviser, Miller told NBC, “That’s the question that I think you should ask the president, the question you should ask Reince [Priebus], the chief of staff.” Feb. 13, 2017: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Flynn to be “fired immediately.” He “cannot be trusted not to put Putin before America,” she said in a statement. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to Trump, told MSNBC that Flynn has “the full confidence of the president.” Priebus said “the president is evaluating the situation” in a statement released an hour later. Flynn submitted his resignation letter later that night. He admitted to mischaracterizing his phone calls with Kislyak, but chalked the incident up to an accident. “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,” Flynn wrote in his resignation letter. “I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.”"

A state government-run scholarship program makes up the remaining $49,664.Every qualifying high school graduate in the county should expect about $1,000 in aid this year, with more being awarded based on merit and need. PCC in-state tuition is slightly more than $3,000 per year, while CSU-Pueblo can cost up to around $6,000 per year depending on the number of credit hours taken.County commissioner Sal Pace told local news outlet KKTV he’s thrilled to see the money applied to something that can benefit the community.“A couple years ago, these are dollars that would have been going to the black market, drug cartels ... now money that used to fund drug cartels is now being used to fund college scholarships,” he said.Pueblo County’s excise tax applies a 2 percent tax on marijuana that growers sell to retailers. That tax is slated to increase by 1 percent each year, maxing out at 5 percent, with at least half earmarked for the Pueblo County Scholarship Fund.The scholarship fund is expected to grow in the next several years, as both marijuana cultivation and the taxation rate increase.“It will grow annually because the excise tax increases annually,” Pace told The Huffington Post. “We also expect many new farms to come online this year. Only roughly half of the licensed farms were operational in 2016.”"

The meaty documentary won the Short Film Jury Award: Non-fiction at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and premiered Tuesday on the New York Times’ Op-Docs.The film, set in New Orleans, uses the long-distance relationship between Watts and her fiance, Desmond Watson, to explore the connections between the systematic separation of black families for the past 400 years ― starting with African enslavement ― and the current prison-industrial complex. Watts began dating Watson about two years ago, and he has been incarcerated for over a year as he awaits trial.Louisiana, often called “the prison capital of the world” incarcerates more people per capita than China and Russia. Black men, like Watson, are disproportionately affected and are locked up at a rate of 362 per 100,000 ― over five times the rate of white men ― according to The Sentencing Project. Bradley noted that our thoughts about mass incarceration are often rooted in these numbers, which causes us to overlook the people affected by the system and how it shapes their lives.“We need to have more opportunities for people to connect on an emotional level to those facts,” Bradley told The Huffington Post. “It isn’t always the facts.” Bradley gives us a look into Watts’ daily sense of disempowerment and shame while unpacking the stigma of marrying a man who’s in jail. We’re forced to question assumptions we may have about women who marry incarcerated men, and to reckon with the fact that Watts’ man has been snatched from her in a continuance of a sick tradition meant to undermine black families.The desire for a legalized union between Watts and Desmond then becomes symbolic.

No matter how loaded her decision may be, she’s seizing her right to get married on her own terms. “Alone considering marriage was less about being a wife in this typical sense of playing a role,” Bradley said. “It really became more of this symbolism of allowing yourself a right that’s been taken from you for the past 400 years.”In a second scene of extreme vulnerability in the film, Watts is seen entering a house. Once inside, she takes a deep breath and says, “I was coming here to tell ya [on] Saturday me and Desmond getting married.” “Girl, why you marrying a n***a in jail,” shouts her mother. “What is it about fuckin’ Desmond that you got to marry fuckin’ Desmond in jail?”Watts’ grandmother soon joins the conversation, saying her “heart is sad.” “That’s a bad decision,” her grandmother says. “What point is it? What it’s gon’ do for y’all? What it’s gon’ do for you?” For Bradley, it was important that people hear this conversation, which happened off camera. “All of that anger and aggressiveness can be looked at, from one perspective, as a form of abuse, but it also can be looked at as a form of deep love and fear,” she said. “Spending a very long time trying to protect your child from a system and realizing that there’s other ways for them to participate … without them even doing anything wrong.” When Watts leaves the house with her head hanging, fighting back tears, the viewer can sense her shame and agony ― which is exactly what Bradley wanted. “When we see Alone leave that house, it really brings home the idea of loneliness,” Bradley said. “You really have very few people that you can turn to when you are in this kind of situation and that is something that I hope can change because loving somebody ― love should be equal, you know?”Bradley’s exploration of how mass incarceration plays out in black female relationships continues as she shows a conversation between Watts and a woman who truly understands her reasoning for wanting to marry an incarcerated man. “This system breaks you apart. It is designed just like slavery to tear you apart. And instead of using the whip, they use Mother Time. They use hardships,” says Fox Rich, a mother of six whose husband has been incarcerated for 20 years. “They may not hang you from the tree but the experience itself is just like when they used to hang people … and leave their feet just tiptoeing around in the mud so that they’re constantly on their tiptoes fighting for their life — that is a daily experience when you are an incarcerated family,” she continues. Bradley wants us to see Watts having these cross-generational conversations with other women about what it means for her to bind herself to being married to an incarcerated man. “She’s really at the infancy of the possibilities,” Bradley said. “Alone” captures generations of trauma and the deep vulnerability and shame that black women are forced into when they become intertwined with the prison system.

46,POLITICS,Government Watchdog Presses Jason Chaffetz To Investigate Kellyanne Conway Himself,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chaffetz-kellyanne-conway_us_58a337d8e4b03df370da9573,"Since, you know, he chairs the oversight committee.",2017-02-14,Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trump's brand line on Fox News despite federal ethics laws banning the endorsement of particular products and companies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a33cd825000034080b8fa3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Office of Government Ethics responded to a request by House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) about White House adviser Kellyanne Conway’s possible breach of federal ethics rules by informing him that his committee has more authority to investigate this matter than the agency.The letter from OGE Director Walter Shaub to both Chaffetz and Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the top Democrat on the oversight panel, came in response to a letter the two congressmen sent urging the agency to determine if disciplinary action was warranted for Conway after she told people to purchase Ivanka Trump’s brand line while appearing on Fox News. Federal laws ban executive branch employees from endorsing particular commercial products or companies.Shaub said that the agency would follow the available disciplinary process for Conway, but he added that the oversight committee headed by Chaffetz has far more powers to investigate this matter than OGE.“Unlike the Committee, OGE cannot issue subpoenas, question witnesses, compel the production of documents or take action against individuals who refuse to cooperate,” Shaub wrote to Chaffetz and Cummings.Chaffetz told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that his takeaway from the letter was the recommendation that the White House take disciplinary action.“We’re going to see what the White House does at this point,” Chaffetz said.And if it does nothing, would the oversight committee investigate?“Well, they should do something,” he said. “I don’t know what the proper remedy is. It is a first-time offense. I’m not trying to make any excuses for it, but I want the White House to let us know what they’re doing.”Chaffetz has called Conway’s endorsement of Ivanka’s product line “wrong, wrong, wrong.” The only action he has taken so far is the letter sent to OGE that Shaub is now responding to. There are no committee hearings scheduled to investigate Conway’s possible ethical breach or whether the White House actually required employees to undergo ethics training.OGE’s role is mainly preventive, helping to ward off conflicts of interest and ethics violations before they happen. It is not an investigative or enforcement body. As Shaub notes in his letter, OGE does not have “any actual investigative authority or resources for hiring investigators.”Shaub further explains in his letter that the disciplinary process that Chaffetz suggested the agency undertake for Conway is really just a case of kicking the can down the road. It is entirely possible, Shaub writes, that the disciplinary process would not reach its conclusion until late April or early May. Even then, the ultimate disciplinary decision would be left in the hands of the president and not OGE. The oversight committee could, however, compel testimony and subpoena documents immediately.The agency’s disciplinary process began when OGE asked White House deputy counsel Stefan Passantino on Thursday to notify the agency if the White House took corrective action against Conway.The same day that OGE asked to be notified if the White House disciplined Conway, press secretary Sean Spicer stated at the daily press briefing that Conway “has been counseled.” According to a letter sent from Shaub to Passantino and White House counsel Don McGahn on Monday, the agency did not receive “notification of any disciplinary or other corrective action against Ms. Conway.”In the letter to Passantino and McGahn, the agency explained that it has the legal authority to suggest the White House take disciplinary action against an employee. Shaub went on to state in the letter, “There is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted.”President Donald Trump attacked the luxury department store Nordstrom after the company announced that it would no longer carry Ivanka Trump’s brand line due to poor sales. Spicer said that the president had every right to defend his daughter and claimed that the department store was inappropriately reacting to political pressure. Conway subsequently went on Fox News, in an official capacity as a representative of the president of the United States and in front of the official seal of the White House, and told viewers, “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff, is what I would tell you. I hate shopping, I’m going to go get some myself today.”She added, “This is just a wonderful line. I own some of it, I fully ― I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody, you can find it online.”Shaub wrote to Passantino and McGahn that this act is a “clear violation of the prohibition against” federal employees pitching products in their official capacity. The OGE director pointed out that the federal ethics manual includes an example of what not to do that is practically identical to what Conway did.For this reason, OGE recommended the White House take disciplinary action. The problem, though, is that OGE cannot compel the White House to discipline Conway. Instead, this recommendation begins a lengthy process that would start with a White House response by Feb. 28 and end at the beginning of May.Discipline for Conway will not be left to OGE, but to President Trump. CNN reported that Trump “completely” supports Conway after her endorsement of Ivanka’s brand. Chaffetz’s committee would be the only remaining arena to press for actual consequences.“This was a textbook violation of federal ethics rules, and the President should follow the independent advice of the Office of Government Ethics to impose discipline on Ms. Conway,” Cummings said in a statement to HuffPost. This post has been updated with comment from Chaffetz and Cummings. "

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.You covered the Olympics in Rio. Team USA had a stretch where it wasn’t dominant and actually struggled a bit, before ultimately capturing a third straight gold medal. Did you ever get the sense that coach Mike Krzyzewski was worried?I think that Coach K was very concerned, actually. Carmelo [Anthony] didn’t look like he was in the greatest shape, and also his shoulder was bothering him. The only good game he had ― we talk about it constantly ― was against China, where you and I might have put up double figures. Until they finally changed the rotation and went with [Kyle] Lowry and [Jimmy] Butler ... that’s when they started to roll. Even though [DeMarcus] Cousins overpowered people, it was better to have DeAndre Jordan in there. He had to figure it out. You’ve covered George Karl throughout your career. He just published a book that was very critical of Cousins, as well as many other players he coached. We always spent about 10-15 minutes before games with the coaches and you couldn’t leave, he didn’t want us to leave ― he just wanted to talk. Phil Jackson did that too, while he was still coaching the Lakers. He’d take shots at Kobe in his books. He couldn’t reach Shaq, and Kobe [Bryant] too, which is tough. He would take shots in the papers ― in Chicago he did it a little bit. He was a little more careful because Michael [Jordan] was not going to accept that. The only people he would take an occasional shot at was like [Toni] Kukoc, who was a great guy and really a very good player but he was like the whipping boy. He always had a guy he would be screaming at, Horace Grant and Kukoc.Do you enjoy the current NBA product, considering there is such an assortment of one-and-done college players?The fundamentals are not, at times, what they were when guys were playing three or four years [in college]. A guy like C.J. McCollum, who comes in from Lehigh and turns out to be a tremendous player ― but I mean, he’s gifted ― that doesn’t happen that often. Usually, if the guy is really that good, they wanna come out, and I can understand it. You don’t want to get hurt, you could blow a contract, obviously you get the higher salary quicker. But the league is in the best shape it’s ever been in terms of marketing, the global aspect, and I realize there’s always an argument ― are you better off with parity, or having the super teams? And right now, you basically have two teams ― maybe three in the West ― who maybe have a shot? I don’t know if that’s even true ― it’s probably Golden State and San Antonio. And in the East, although Boston is getting better, they’re like a player away from something.  When did it really hit home for you that this league is, at its core, a business?I think more so in the ‘90s. Teams when I first started ― you did have nucleuses of teams staying together, of the better teams. In the ‘70s, the Knicks, the Celtics, Milwaukee, you had teams with seven or eight guys that would be there for several years. Young players are pushing older players out because they are often cheaper, even if they aren’t as good. Except if they have contracts, those players pushed out would be the eighth player on the roster. Do you remember such an influx of talented point guards? You always have to go back and look. Sometimes it seems like the present, but you’re probably right. I’m thinking just like a broad view in my mind of the ‘90s. It was different ― it was more plodding. It’s funny, I’m doing stuff on [Russell] Westbrook. He’s chasing Oscar [Robertson] for the triple-double. It didn’t seem like it when I think back to it, but Oscar ― when he did it in ‘62 ― they played at a faster pace. They had like 120 possessions a game and Oklahoma City has 105 or something, it didn’t seem like it. Today’s NBA puts such a premium on the whole league. With social media, it often feels like playing in a major market doesn’t matter anymore.It doesn’t matter at all, because if you’re a big market now, it doesn’t mean that you’re necessarily a destination for a player. Look at the Knicks: I don’t know if there are that many players [who would want to go to New York] with the way they have been for the last 15-20 years. I mean, they’ve gone to the playoffs three times in 15 years. This would not be a destination. I mean, you see [Kristaps] Porzingis, you see a couple of the other guys. Would you want to come here? And then if you don’t do well, you get killed media-wise, but it’s different also because, I think, [of] the commercials. It shows that you can be in Oklahoma City, you can be in a small market, you look at when [Kevin] Durant and Westbrook were here: They got a lot of commercials, so they became national stars and they are big attractions, aside from being an attraction at home. I know it’s better for the league if New York or LA, Chicago ― you know, the big markets ― do well, but it doesn’t matter anymore. Because of the television, in terms of the marketing, in terms of international. Like when I’ve done games overseas. You’d be in Japan and they knew every player from 1-12 ― that started to happen I think after the Dream Team [in 1992]. It really took off after that.You mentioned the Celtics. Brad Stevens has been the one guy to go from coaching in college to coaching in the NBA successfully. I think he’s exceptional. And what happened was ― I mean, Butler went to the finals twice, it was amazing. I think it added to the reputation, that guys respected him. At any age, that’s a terrific job putting that roster together and collecting draft picks, and it was a lot of young guys and they were looking at Brad Stevens as, ‘Boy, this guy can coach,’ as they saw in college. But I think there will be others. It’s a risk for a guy who is extremely successful in college, it doesn’t always translate. Considering how long you have covered the league, do you still feel the same level of excitement and inspiration from the game today? Oh yeah, definitely, I love doing it. I still do, I kinda like the preparation. There’s some weeks I’d like to be home, go to the movies. My wife and I see every movie, we somehow get it in in between, and I’m like a news fanatic ― I watch CNN and MSNBC all the time, then I’m checking out Fox to see what their point of view is just to see it. But anyway, I like doing the preparation, I still love being around and talking to guys. I love talking to coaches, working with the guys that I work with. It’s filled with fun and laughs, it’s a challenge, and the crowds ― I still get a rise out. It can give you the chills sometimes.The Knicks are just an utter disaster, from top to bottom. Obviously you know all too well about the failures of this organization. I really feel removed. It’s funny when someone says, well, ‘Who do you root for, who do you want to win?’ and I haven’t rooted for anybody. I mean, when I was doing a local team, I did the Knicks and I did the Nets for five years. You get to know guys and you want them to do well. There’s certain guys I always wanted, or I had more interest in because I had a personal relationship, but I feel you have to be objective. And even doing local games, the level of my voice would be raised if the opponents did something really well, too. But it’s better, if you’re doing a local team, if your team is successful ― because I went through a number of years with the Knicks where they were pretty bad. It’s not as interesting. I kind of distance myself from that, but I haven’t rooted for anyone in any sport since I was a kid. You worked with Steve Kerr in the broadcast booth. You’ve said how impressed you were with him, but have you even been surprised at the tremendous success he’s had leading the Warriors? He’s the best. Such a good guy, and he’s very smart, like [Gregg] Popovich. But he’s well read, and you saw what both he and Popovich had to say [politically]. They’re both terrific guys.To me, it was like a no-brainer [for Kerr to decide to coach the Warriors over the Knicks]. You look at the rosters. The papers came out, and it was crazy. I mean, he asked me, and I did say, ‘There’s no choice here,’ but I know the Knicks blamed me initially. I was one of many who told him, but his friendship with [Knicks president Phil Jackson] had a lot to do with the fact that he was even leaning in that direction. He’d never coached! He was a general manager and actually did well, he stepped away from broadcasting for a couple of years.His Phoenix Suns team reached the conference finals.He did pretty well with that. As a coach, he’s so good with people. I mention it on the air: I say it was a tumultuous eight years with Steve, but he was the best to be around. And very competitive ― he doesn’t take any crap! With Draymond [Green], too, he was ready to go at him last year, that was written, he’s pretty tough. He had that little brief tiff with Michael [Jordan] in practice. But that’s Michael. What was your relationship with Michael?Michael is the greatest to talk to, though. He was smart enough to know he was good to be on TV in the ‘90s, where we’d sit down with the guys and get a soundbite or two. Everything he said you could put on the air ― he was so good. Everything out of his mouth from a television point of view was just worthwhile.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report."

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.You covered the Olympics in Rio. Team USA had a stretch where it wasn’t dominant and actually struggled a bit, before ultimately capturing a third straight gold medal. Did you ever get the sense that coach Mike Krzyzewski was worried?I think that Coach K was very concerned, actually. Carmelo [Anthony] didn’t look like he was in the greatest shape, and also his shoulder was bothering him. The only good game he had ― we talk about it constantly ― was against China, where you and I might have put up double figures.

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), left, and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a274de2800001f00998b3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus voted among themselves Monday night to band together and support only an Obamacare repeal that is at least as aggressive as a bill the House and Senate passed in 2015, putting GOP leaders in a bind with their conference and perhaps even threatening the possibility of passing a repeal.The group of roughly 35 to 40 House conservatives voted to take this official position ― meaning it received the support of at least 80 percent of the members and is therefore supposed to be the position of all lawmakers in the group ― amid some GOP consternation that Republicans ought to focus more on repairing the law rather than repealing it, as well as amid heavy voter pressure in many districts to leave the law intact.“If it’s less than the 2015 [bill], we will oppose it,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told a small group of reporters Monday night.Meadows added that the Freedom Caucus would encourage replacing Obamacare at the same time Congress repeals it but that if GOP leaders put the same 2015 reconciliation bill gutting major parts of Obamacare on the floor, conservatives in the group would support it.The 2015 repeal bill removed the Medicaid expansion that is popular in many red states ― including among many Republican governors ― and repealed the individual and employer mandates. The bill also removed the law’s subsidies and the taxes that helped to pay for them. In short, it would disassemble Obamacare.By insisting that the repeal bill be as forceful as that 2015 measure ― which technically got to President Barack Obama’s desk at the beginning of 2016 ― conservatives have staked out a hard line that some GOP moderates may now have a problem following.Many Republicans had seemed ready to support parts of the law. If conservatives really can stick to this position, they could be endangering the ability to get 218 Republicans in the House and 50 in the Senate ― to say nothing of the ongoing disagreements among Republicans about what a replacement should look like.The current Republican gambit seems to rely on repealing the 2010 health care law as quickly as possible and then trying to pressure some Democrats in the Senate to support a replacement, potentially by offering a health care alternative in pieces, such as one bill to establish health savings accounts and another bill to allow people to buy insurance plans across state lines.A plan like that would have the benefit of not allowing lawmakers or the public to truly evaluate the GOP alternative. But some Republicans are concerned a piecemeal approach would bring demands from voters and health insurance providers for clarity.Which is to say a repeal was already in some degree of trouble, as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement. Now that conservatives are demanding the repeal meet that 2015 standard, it could be even more difficult for GOP leaders to find coalitions in the House and Senate.But conservatives don’t see it that way.They noted Monday night that Republicans had already voted on the 2015 repeal ― at least the ones who were here last Congress ― and they believe it would be hypocritical for Republicans to balk at the plan they supported a year ago.“They voted for it already, so, be consistent,” Freedom Caucus member Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said."

Heavy storms pushed its water levels to record highs, threatening to release uncontrolled flooding over a number of communities south of the dam. Another storm system is forecast to bring more rain to the area later this week.“The situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday during a press briefing.“Dams, bridges, roads and all ports around the country have fallen into disrepair,” he added. “In order to prevent the next disaster, we will pursue the president’s vision for overhaul of our nation’s crumbling infrastructure.”It’s anyone’s guess what the results of that vision will be. Trump promised during his campaign that he would deliver a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to Congress within his first 100 days in office. Deficit-averse Republicans are skeptical of that trillion-dollar figure, and are already chafing at the prospect of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that would cost tens of billions of dollars.Democrats have warned that Trump’s plan would involve privatizing infrastructure development through the use of tax credits rather than funding infrastructure projects with hard taxpayer dollars. But as The Atlantic’s City Lab noted, a project like the emergency spillway at the Oroville Dam “isn’t the kind of investment likely to lure profit-minded private developers.”Spicer said the White House is working with Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), who represents the city of Oroville and surrounding communities, to help people who were evacuated due to the emergency.“We hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations continue,” he said.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Oroville is California’s largest reservoir."

The California Department of Water Resources, which runs the dam, reported Tuesday morning that water levels were dropping by three to four inches per hour. While weather conditions have been fair this week, the National Weather Service forecasts three storms lined up to hit Northern California. Heavy rain is expected to return Wednesday night and continue throughout the week. Officials don’t expect that rain to overwhelm the reservoir as crews continue draining water and making repairs. President Trump on Tuesday approved a request by California Gov. Jerry Brown for federal disaster assistance for the area. The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced that three countries near Lake Oroville, as well as other parts of California hit by massive storms in recent weeks, will receive assistance. But the dam and its spillways will likely face other storms in the near future. The rainy season typically continues through March, and spring will bring runoff from melting snowpacks.“That will be the challenge at Lake Oroville in the coming months — keeping people downstream safe while managing the dam itself,” atmospheric scientist and Washington Post weather editor Angela Fritz wrote Tuesday. “If the past is any indicator of the future, they should prepare for more precipitation, not less.”"

At least, it never was to me. It meant you won a championship and you got to experience something cool with your team, with your teammates. Everyone has their own choice. It’s an offseason. These days are valuable for everybody. You only get so much time with your family and friends, and if people don’t want to go they don’t want to go and that’s their choice.”Multiple Patriots players have said they will skip the trip, including free safety Devin McCourty. “I’m not going to the White House,” McCourty told TIME. “Basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.”Trump and Brady have known each other for years, and the POTUS claimed to have Brady’s vote back in November. “Tom Brady, great guy, great friend of mine, great, great champion, unbelievable winner,” Trump said at a November rally. “He called today and he said, ‘Donald, I support you, you’re my friend, and I voted for you.’”Gisele later denied it. But either way, Trump ― who is also friendly with team owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick ― was happy the Patriots won. "

If Marissa Alexander ran out of milk, she couldn’t dash to the grocery store to get more. She went without. If one of her kids needed a ride to a sleepover, she couldn’t take them. The ankle bracelet clamped to her left leg was a constant reminder of the ordeal that began over six years ago, when she says she picked up a gun to ward off a terrifying attack by her abusive husband.At first, she was embarrassed by the GPS monitor, and hid it under long pants even during the sweltering summer days in Jacksonville, Florida. Later, she grew used to it.On Jan. 27, when the bracelet was cut off, a physical and mental weight was lifted, she said. She was finally free.“It’s fully liberating,” Alexander said in a phone interview with The Huffington Post last week, exhaling slowly. “I feel like I can live.”Alexander was thrust into the national spotlight in 2012 after she was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a single warning shot in the vicinity of her estranged husband, Rico Gray, during an altercation.The incident occurred in 2010. According to Alexander’s telling of the story, she was visiting with Gray nine days after giving birth to their daughter, when he saw texts on her phone that made him jealous. She said he flew into a rage, and attacked and threatened to kill her. She retrieved her gun and fired one shot to protect herself, she said. No one was injured in the shooting, but Alexander was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, as two of Gray’s children were also in the home.She was 31, a mom of three, and had no criminal history. Gray had been arrested twice before for domestic violence, and was subject to a restraining order barring him from seeing Alexander at the time of the shooting. In a sworn deposition, he admitted that he abused Alexander, and said she never pointed the gun at him. “I got five baby mamas and I put my hands on every last one of them except for one,” he told investigators. “The way I was with women, they was like they had to walk on eggshells around me.” He later recanted that deposition, claiming he said those things to keep Alexander out of prison.But despite Alexander’s insistence that she was in fear for her life, a judge rejected her effort to invoke Florida’s “stand your ground” law, which allows people to use deadly force if they are in danger. A jury convicted her after deliberating for 12 minutes. Under Florida’s strict laws involving gun violence, she was sentenced to a mandatory minimum prison term of 20 years. Her case stood in stark contrast to another Florida case involving self-defense. George Zimmerman, who fatally shot unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin, was acquitted after a jury concluded he was afraid for his life.Critics of “stand your ground” laws said the divergent outcomes were proof of racial bias, and Alexander emerged as a symbol of miscarriage of justice for black women who act in self-defense. Her conviction was eventually overturned because of an error in jury instructions. In 2014, she reached a plea deal. She ultimately served three years in prison and two years on home detention, which ended last month. Alexander’s first few days of freedom were spent with her family, she said. She took her daughter out to breakfast at Cracker Barrel before school. She visited her sister’s new house and celebrated her pregnancy. A party was held in Alexander’s honor, where she was surrounded by friends, family and supporters.“I wanted to be with the people I loved the most, immediately,” she said.She is surprisingly upbeat about all she has endured. “I am obsessed with transformation,” she said. “I wanted to take this situation that was meant to stifle me, stagnate me, and separate me, and use it to benefit me the best way it can.”While on house arrest, she wrote a book detailing her experiences, and exercised in a home gym she had installed. She also established a nonprofit, called the Marissa Alexander Justice Project, which will provide support to domestic violence survivors who are involved in the criminal justice system.“My life was literally devastated and turned upside down by one shot, a 12-minute verdict, and a 20-year sentence,” she said. “It was important to me that this was not in vain, that I came out of this experience stronger.” She wants to help other women who are in the same position that she was. While she was in prison, she learned about many women who were being punished for acts taken to protect themselves, she said.“I am a servant at heart,” she said. “There is joy for me to be able to give back in this way.” She also wants to help change attitudes on domestic violence. There’s still a lot of judgment of women who don’t leave abusers, she said. “People ask, why did you stay?” she said. “Nobody ever said, you were the victim and one of the choices you had was to preserve your life, and that’s OK. I did the best that I could do that day. I preserved my life. I made a situation that could have been fatal not fatal, and I still was penalized.” For women who relate to her story, her message is to persevere. “My whole thing is to not be bitter, but to be better,” she said. “Your past does not determine the entire course of your life unless you allow it to.”______Related stories:"

But another section of the speech was also incredibly powerful. The singer spoke candidly and beautifully about motherhood. She first acknowledged the three-year hiatus she took to focus on raising her son, who was born in 2012.“As you can see, it took an army to make me strong and willing again to do it. And I thank you all from the bottom of my heart,” she began.“Five years ago when I was last here, I also was pregnant, and I didn’t know,” she continued. “And I was awarded that shortly after ― I found out shortly after ― which was the biggest blessing of my life.”Adele proceeded to get real about the challenges of motherhood and her personal identity struggle as a parent.“In my pregnancy and through becoming a mother I lost a lot of myself, and then I’ve struggled and I still do struggle being a mum,” she said. “It’s really hard.

62,POLITICS,Most Border Residents Didn’t Vote For Trump’s Wall,Roque Planas and Adam Hooper,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/border-residents-didnt-vote-for-trumps-wall_us_5890e016e4b02772c4e9bc88,South Texas precincts overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton.,2017-02-13,"Texas voted for Trump, but its border precincts voted overwhelmingly for Clinton.<br>Source: Texas Legislative Council.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a207c825000034080b8b7c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― One of President Donald Trump’s first actions in office was to order the expansion of the fence on the U.S.-Mexico border, arguing that he was fulfilling a campaign promise. But many of those who will have to live alongside the wall don’t see a need for it, and a precinct-by-precinct tabulation of voting results from Texas shows they voted overwhelmingly for Clinton. Some 701,000 ballots were cast in Texas precincts within 100 miles of the border. In those precincts, twice as many voters picked Clinton as Trump.Trump won his election largely by railing against illegal immigration, deriding the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement as a bad deal and by portraying the U.S.-Mexico border as a lawless area that needs a multibillion-dollar wall to make it more secure. Those arguments appealed to red state voters and flipped Democratic strongholds in the Midwest, where the manufacturing economy declined in recent decades and wages have stagnated.But those areas are nowhere near the border itself, where people usually view the situation differently. Not only did Trump lose the Rio Grande Valley, he lost it by whopping margins of more than 50 percentage points in some counties. The Texas data reveals a more extreme but consistent version of what happened along the rest of the borderlands. While Trump won two out of the four states that touch the U.S.-Mexico border, Clinton won more than 60 percent of the counties that touch the border itself.That Southern Texas backed Clinton is no surprise. The heavily Hispanic area region has been a Democratic stronghold for years, and Trump largely repelled Hispanic voters, especially in the Southwest. The area is home both to people who can trace their roots back to the era of the Texas Revolution and people who migrated in recent years. Spanish is spoken as commonly as English in many border towns. While Trump has justified last week’s executive order to expand the barrier as a security measure needed to prevent violence from spilling over, residents often view the wall as unnecessary spending that would be better used for schools, hospitals and roads. That’s partly because the border region is already heavily policed and has long been one of the safest in the United States. El Paso, in West Texas, has for years boasted some of the lowest crime rates of all mid-sized American cities, even as one of the most brutal episodes of Mexican cartel violence raged just across the border in Ciudad Juárez. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed an $800 million package last year to bolster the federal government’s efforts by sending officers from the state’s Department of Public Safety to help patrol the border. Gilberto Hinojosa, the state Democratic Party chairman, viewed both the state and federal spending as misguided. He’d rather see the money help the region develop economically or educate Valley students. But, at the very least, he thought it should put to rest the notion that the area is violent. “Do you know that if I drive from La Jolla, Texas, to Laredo that I run into no less than 15 or 16 Department of Public Safety troopers parked on the side of the road every mile or two?” Hinojosa told HuffPost last week, referring to two South Texas border cities. “It’s absurd. These people do nothing but sit there in their car all day long. This is not an effective use of resources.” The region’s residents are also less likely to view Mexico with hostile eyes, whether or not they are themselves Hispanic. The Rio Grande, which separate the United States and Mexico in Southern Texas, makes for an odd boundary, since rivers unite people by facilitating transportation. The river slices through town after town that, prior the Mexican American War, were unified settlements without borders or fences. That geography makes for a business climate in which Texas is perhaps more connected to Mexico economically than any other U.S. state, according to Mark Jones, a political scientist at Rice University. The value of Texan exports alone to Mexico are roughly four times larger than those of China, Mexico’s second-largest trading partner. Trump’s calls to renegotiate NAFTA or slap a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports unnerves people who depend on commerce with Mexico for their livelihood. “[Valley residents] don’t view a need for a wall, and they’re opposed to anything that creates barriers between them and Mexico,” political scientist Mark Jones told HuffPost. “It creates the impression of the border as an insecure and dangerous place where people won’t want to travel or invest.” "

Eve Ensler and the One Billion Rising campaign have an alternative V-Day event that might strike your fancy.Come Feb. 14, One Billion Rising will opt less for cards and candy and more for awareness of the violence endured by women and girls. As it has done every year since 2012, the organization ― which takes its name from a stark statistic claiming one in three women around the world will be beaten or raped during their lifetime* ― will host a series of “risings” in over 200 countries that advocate for the victims of such violence and rail against the impunity that persists in its wake.In New York City, however, the V-Day rising will be unique. Dubbed “Artistic Uprising ― A Call For Revolutionary Love,” the event is not only aimed at shining a light on the women and girls at risk of violence, but also on “refugees, immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQI people, black people, the indigenous, the poor” ― individuals who find themselves under threat in America’s present political climate.“Activists will RISE against the neo-fascist, racist patriarchy taking hold in governments throughout the world, against bigotry, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, anti-immigration, nativism, white nationalism, climate change denial, imperialist and capitalist aggressions, misogyny and hate,” One Billion Rising wrote in a press release for the NY-specific rally. “From Standing Rock to financial deregulation to the ‘Muslim Ban,’ activists will demand the new regime’s agenda be dismantled.”In a conversation with The Huffington Post, Ensler, the writer and activist behind “The Vagina Monologues,” explained that “Artistic Uprising” will honor various marginalized communities while maintaining a particular focus on women’s rights in the United States. “We’re seeing an assault on women [here],” Ensler told HuffPost. “This administration has not only escalated [rape culture] but has really normalized it,” she added. “So we are rising for immigrants. We are rising for African-Americans. We are rising for LGBTQIA. We are rising for women. We are rising for everyone in this country who is under siege, which is just about everyone except for white men for as far as I can tell.”The rally will feature performances and speeches by over 25 artists and activists ― singers, dancers, hip-hop artists, spoken word poets, drummers, gospel choirs, Ensler ― as well as a participatory project from the Where We Meet artist collective, called the “Ranting Box.”Inspired by the silencing women like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have experienced under the leadership of President Donald Trump, Ensler and the Artistic Rising organizers are encouraging rally participants to combat hate with love.“Everything that’s done is backed up with state violence on one level or another, right?” Ensler said. “Everything that’s done is done with an aggression and a force and lack of consent, right? A disregard for laws, a disregard for rights, a disregard for what people want, a disregard for people’s feelings, a disregard for people’s safety. And I think we have to model the opposite of that.”For Ensler, the opposite of that is “revolutionary love.”“We have to model listening,” she added. “We have to model empathy. We have to model being unified and understanding that anyone they’re coming for ― they’re coming for all of us. We have to be willing to stand up each time one of us is come for. And I think the only way we really do that is [...] with fierce, unabiding love. Just really give ourselves, for the most marginalized, who are under the greatest threat and to do that with love. To do that with generosity. To come out of our silos and our own communities and reach further than we’ve ever reached before.”“Artistic Rising” will take place in New York’s Washington Square Park. It is the latest in a series of protests, rallies and strikes that have erupted in the city following Trump’s inauguration in January.If you’re not based in NYC, Ensler has some advice for those interested in taking part in One Billion Rising’s events:What we’re seeing right now across the planet is this determination from women and men to say, “We will not accept fascism. We will not accept hatred. We will not accept misogyny. We will not accept racism.” So I urge everyone to find a rising near you and to rise and dance for what it is that you want ― for the communities that are under siege that you want to protect.*The global population is north of 7 billion, which would mean that a total of over one billion girls and women encounter this level of violence. As the group notes online, women and girls is an inclusive term reflecting all those who were assigned and/or identify as female.Additional reporting from Alanna Vagianos."
64,POLITICS,Trump Pretends To Care About Women By Meeting With A Man Who Actually Does,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-women-justin-trudeau_us_58a20bb1e4b094a129edbfb2,"The pinkwasher-in-chief paid lip service to women in the workplace at a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a real feminist.",2017-02-13,"Trump and some of his men: Chief of staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, senior advisor Steve Bannon, Communications Director Sean Spicer and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a219ca290000f616f26242.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to talk about women in the workplace. The contrast between the two leaders on this issue could not be more stark.Trudeau is a progressive leader who understands that women are not a minority, but a critical part of any strong leadership team. When he took office in 2015, he named 15 women and 15 men to his Cabinet, intentionally creating an even split.  At the time, a reporter asked him why the gender balance was so important. “Because it’s 2015,” Trudeau explained. His answer, lengthier than “duh,” but more charming, quickly went viral.Trump’s Cabinet, meanwhile, harkens back to 1980. Of 22 appointees, four are women. Only two are high enough in the pecking order to even make it into the presidential line of succession: Betsy Devos was so grossly unqualified as education secretary that she almost didn’t gain the approval of the Republican-dominated Senate. Elaine Chao has real experience and was simple to recruit as transportation secretary ― she’s married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).It’s as if Trump doesn’t even know where to find qualified women, Avivah Wittenberg-Cox noted in a recent piece for the Harvard Business Review. She runs a consulting company that helps big companies with gender equality.At Monday’s meeting, Trump tried to portray himself as a great supporter of women at work. It was “pinkwashing” ― paying lip service to gender equality while doing little to foster it ― at a new extreme.“Women, as you know, and I can say that from my past life, I had so many women executives, they were phenomenal, phenomenal, and really helped me, and it was really fantastic,” Trump said. “They play a tremendously important role, women in our economy.”You need only look at Trump’s Cabinet and inner circle to understand what he really thinks about women.“If he were truly enlightened leader who gets that women bring value, his team in the White House would reflect that,” Wittenberg-Cox told The Huffington Post.There are no women in Trump’s inner Cabinet ― the secretaries of defense, state, treasury and the attorney general are all white guys. A situation like that was last seen under Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama appointed eight women to his Cabinet in his first term. Like Trump, George W. Bush appointed only four women in his first term, but to slightly higher-level positions. Bush’s choice of Colin Powell for secretary of state also increased diversity on this team by a hair. Trump and Reagan both nominated a single black person to their Cabinets ― both to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.Wittenberg-Cox categorizes Trump as a “plodding leader” who doesn’t value women as independent players, but instead slots them into positions where they take on supportive, traditionally female roles. The woman closest to the president (and not a relative), senior counsellor Kellyanne Conway, illustrates this well: She is sort of like a “babysitter/shrink/bear tamer,” Wittenberg-Cox said. Conway has a support role, not central to defense or security. She’s not in the Cabinet.At the highest levels of corporate America, you’ll often see a similar trend. Men dominate, taking most mission-critical roles. Women pepper the outer spheres of the circle.You’ll see women heading up human resources, or the legal department, or the diversity and inclusion team. More frustrating, a lot of these companies engage in pinkwashing. Walmart, which suffers from a lack of women in critical roles, sent its CEO to the White House talk about women in the workplace earlier this month. Audi, which has no women on its global management board, ran a Super Bowl ad about gender pay equality.This was more common 10 or 20 years ago, Wittenberg-Cox said, but has changed as more companies realize that women help strengthen the bottom line. If a majority of your customers are women, you need women on your team as a practical necessity. Plus, well, it’s 2017.Not at the White House. Look at Trump’s female Cabinet nominees. Two women are in the “outer cabinet.” Devos at the Education Department is 15th in line to succeed the president. Transportation Secretary Chao, one of the most experienced members of Trump’s administration, is 13th in the order of succession. As ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley is not part of the line of succession. Nor is Linda McMahon, a billionaire who Trump named administrator of the Small Business Administration.None of these positions are core to the presidency or part of Trump’s most urgent agenda, which appears focused on security and the economy.None of Trump’s female appointees joined him at Monday’s roundtable discussion. Instead, Trump brought his daughter Ivanka, who seems to have taken on the unofficial role as spokesperson for all women in the Trump administration ― a supportive daughter just doing her part. "

You’re welcome.On the heels of his Golden Globe-nominated role in the bleak miniseries “The Night Of” and his turn as a Rebel Alliance fighter in the battle-torn “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” it appears Ahmed is finally getting to have some fun.On “Girls,” he plays Paul-Louis, a Long Island surfing instructor who takes a liking to Hannah while she attempts to write an article about how wealthy women are co-opting the waves just like they co-opted yoga. Hannah being Hannah, she has no patience for surfing lessons or sand ― until Paul-Louis shows her some special attention. (Beware spoilers below!) Out dancing one night, after Hannah spills some sort of red cocktail all over her bosom and grinds on the floor, Paul-Louis steps up to the DJ booth for a little surprise: “Slow Jamz.” Ahmed displays his well-documented rap skills, ripping through one of Twista’s verses from the 2004 hit, featuring Kanye West and Jamie Foxx. Paul-Louis flashes his nipple, plops his scantily clad leg on the table and crystallizes Hannah’s affection. “I’m gonna fuck him,” she screams from the crowd of supportive onlookers. She’s right.As things tend to go for Hannah, not everything comes together seamlessly after she and Paul-Louis sleep together. Turns out, he’s in an open relationship and his girlfriend is arriving in a few days. But Paul-Louis has such surfer-groove charm that Hannah is drawn to him anyway. (Is she even still working on her article at this point?) He’s about to become a blip on her ostensibly maturing radar before being thrust back to the clamor of New York City. If only there were more! “Why get mad at fun, right?” Hannah asks reluctantly. It’s lovely to see Ahmed smile, something he hasn’t done much of onscreen since breaking out as Jake Gyllenhaal’s antsy assistant in 2014’s “Nightcrawler.” Paul-Louis doles out wisdom from the School of Chill Vibes, like, “If you look down, you’re gonna fall down. That’s what I always say. Just like life.” He reflects a recurring “Girls” adage: escaping the big city provides a clarity and a sense of possibility only achieved through a temporary reprieve from the claustrophobia. Most importantly, he raps in a bathing suit. Thanks, Riz. We love to see you smile. "

However, she and her colleagues point out in the Journal of Adolescent Medicine, there are many other medical situations where a discussion of fertility preservation could be warranted, including for transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy.Current guidelines and ethics committee statements recommend that transgender patients receive fertility counseling and be offered fertility preservation before they begin hormone treatment. They also recognize that transgender individuals may have the same desire for biological children as other populations, Nahata noted.The researchers studied 73 adolescent patients treated at their center (50 transgender males and 23 transgender females). All but one received fertility counseling, but only two - both transgender females - opted for fertility preservation.About three-quarters of the study participants had a documented reason for refusing fertility preservation, with 45 percent saying that they were considering or planning to adopt, 22 percent saying they never want to have children, and 8 percent saying they thought fertility preservation would be too expensive.By comparison, the authors note, about 25 percent of pubertal males diagnosed with cancer will bank their sperm, while pubertal females may be less likely to choose fertility preservation.“Our findings suggest that parenthood goals among transgender individuals may not be the same as they are in other populations,” Nahata noted.Unease or dissatisfaction about one’s body, urgency to start treatments, developmental factors and mental health concerns could also make these patients less likely to use fertility preservation, she and her colleagues note.“Many of the adolescents in this study said ‘I don’t ever want to have kids,’ or ‘I want to adopt,’ and we don’t know if that attitude persists into adulthood for these kids,” Nahata said. “We intend to pursue prospective work in those areas to examine if and how parenting goals may change over time, and what the perceived benefits and barriers to fertility preservation are in this population at different ages and developmental stages.”SOURCE: bit.ly/2lutMN9 Journal of Adolescent Health, online February 1, 2017."

But the legacies of Deah Barakat, his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, live on in the charity work that loved ones have done in their name.The students were gunned down inside Barkat’s apartment in Chapel Hill. A neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, is facing the death penalty after being charged with their murders. His wife claimed the violence resulted from a parking dispute, but the victims’ families have long said that Hicks targeted these students because of their faith. Before the shootings, Hicks reportedly shared multiple posts that expressed disdain for religion on his Facebook page. Barakat and the Abu-Salha sisters are now the inspiration behind #LoveThyNeighbor, a campaign meant to encourage people to “stand against hatred, xenophobia, and prejudice.”The campaign is a collaboration between the Our Three Winners Foundation, which seeks to fund humanitarian projects that were important to Barakat and the Abu-Salha sisters, and #LoveArmy, a project launched by activist and CNN political commentator Van Jones. #LoveThyNeighbors launched on February 10, exactly two years after the Chapel Hill shootings. Participants were asked to “perform an act of kindness, service or solidarity for your neighbor or fellow community member” within the next week. Interfaith leaders held services last weekend in honor of the victims, according to a press release.Ammal Elhaddad, a spokesperson for the Our Three Winners Foundation, told The Huffington Post that the campaign was inspired by the faith of three victims.“Faith has always been at the center of a lot of the work around remembering Deah, Yusor, and Razan, because it was their faith that inspired them to be the humanitarians that they were. And loving thy neighbor transcends any one particular faith,” Elhaddad said. “It’s about looking at the similarities that everyone has.” She said the campaign is meant to encourage people to know who their neighbors are, whether at work, at school, or in any public space.“There are so many places where people can extend that kindness and awareness and do a little more than you normally would to understand folks that are maybe feeling vulnerable or scared in the current political climate,” Elhaddad said. A few participants have started posting about their action projects on social media. “In a time of divisiveness and hateful rhetoric, our families ask that you join hands and come together to fight hate with love and fight darkness with light,” Dr. Suzanne Barakat, Deah Barakat’s sister, said in a press release.The three victims of the Chapel Hill shootings have inspired many community service projects over the past two years. Volunteers have helped build two Habitat for Humanity homes and have delivered dental supplies to Syrian refugees.On February 4 this year, a rental property that Deah Barakat owned was reopened as a community center. Named The Light House, the center is meant to serve as an incubator for local faith-based programs targeting for young people. “Since Day No. 1, we’re trying to fight the hate and sadness with doing good and being positive,” Namee Barakat, Deah’s father, told Religion News Service. “That makes us feel better and it makes our wounds a little easier.” "

It remains to be seen when authorities will be able to properly repair the compromised dam and allow residents to return to the area.The main spillway ― which operators use to control the flow of water from the manmade Lake Oroville into the Feather River ― began eroding last week following heavy rains that filled the lake to capacity, requiring the use of a second, emergency spillway for the first time since its construction.By Sunday evening, officials had detected erosion in both spillways as water began pouring over onto the hillside and dragging trees and mud into the Feather River, which runs near downtown Oroville. Officials ordered about 188,000 residents of Yuba, Sutter and Butte counties to evacuate amid concern that the emergency spillway could completely collapse and send a 30-foot-high wall of water toward downstream towns.That much water could be disastrous, experts warn.“You look at 30 feet times the area of the reservoir,” which has a surface of about 25 square miles, said University of California, Berkeley, civil engineering professor Nicholas Sitar. “That is how much water is going to come out. That is a huge volume of water,” he told The Sacramento Bee.While the emergency spillway has not overflowed and remains functional, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea stood by his decision to evacuate the area.“I recognize and absolutely appreciate the frustration people who were evacuated must feel,” Honea said at a press conference Monday afternoon. “It wasn’t a decision I made lightly.” Most schools were closed Monday morning as residents cleared the area and headed to evacuation centers at churches, fairgrounds, campgrounds and an Air Force base.California has been battered with three atmospheric river storm systems since the start of the year. With rain expected to return Wednesday and continue for several days, emergency responders are working to drain at least 50 feet of water from the lake to relieve pressure on the spillways.But with seasonal runoff still flowing in, “it’s like trying to drain the bathtub with the faucet still running,” local PBS affiliate KQED Science Editor Craig Miller said Monday morning on the station’s radio broadcast.“The good news is they say there’s more water coming out than coming in,” he noted. A graph on the state’s website shows that water levels have declined more than five feet from Sunday morning to 9 a.m. local time on Monday. The crisis prompted Gov. Jerry Brown (D) to issue an emergency order diverting resources to Oroville.“I’ve been in close contact with emergency personnel managing the situation in Oroville throughout the weekend and it’s clear the circumstances are complex and rapidly changing,” he said in a statement on Sunday.On Friday, Brown asked President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster for the state following “relentless heavy precipitation and high winds that caused flash flooding, debris and mud flows, erosion, power outages, and damage to critical infrastructure.” It would open up assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but the request had gone unanswered as of Monday afternoon.Since the Oroville Dam secures water for more than 20 million people and much of the state’s farmland, the emergency has triggered questions about whether the state is equipped to maintain and update its aging infrastructure. An assessment by the American Society of Civil Engineers graded California’s levees and flood control systems an F in 2006 and a D in 2012."

The 20-year-old model was surprisingly candid about the end of her year-and-a-half long relationship.“It was my first breakup ... and so public,” Hadid told the magazine. “As an outsider, you might think I handled it so well, but it’s always in your heart, and you always feel it very heavily.”“It’ll be hard for a while,” Hadid added. “Love hurts, but you have to pull through.”Hadid’s struggle is compounded by the fact that her former flame has seemingly moved on. The Weeknd was photographed kissing Selena Gomez last month, and the pair recently jetted off to Italy for a romantic vacation. While Hadid did unfollow Gomez on Instagram after the kissing photos surfaced, she’s taking the high road when it comes to her ex.“I’ll always respect him, and I’ll always love him,” Hadid said. “Sometimes you want to be sad about it or handle it differently, but at the end of the day, you never want to burn a bridge that you’ve fought so hard to build.” We have to applaud Hadid for being the model of maturity in a difficult situation.

71,POLITICS,Trump’s Supreme Court Pick Wants To Gut Legal Rule That Environmental Groups Rely On,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-epa-chevron-doctrine_us_58a1ecaee4b03df370d8cdc9,Even Antonin Scalia supported the doctrine. But not Neil Gorsuch.,2017-02-13,Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch looks at a landscape painting in Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Washington office as he arrives for their meeting on Feb. 6.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a1ef8a280000c63a9988c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Back in 1984, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a huge oil company in a landmark case laying out how much deference courts should give to a federal agency’s interpretation of the laws it enforces. The answer in nonlegal terms was “a lot.”Ironically, that meant a major environmental group lost to President Ronald Reagan’s more conservative Environmental Protection Agency.Some three decades later, the environmentalists are the ones vigorously defending the legal doctrine that is based on Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. And the leading critic of so-called Chevron deference is Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee and a man whose mother ran the EPA when the Chevron case first went to court.Eliminating the Chevron doctrine would be a radical move today. It’s a cornerstone of U.S. administrative law, so widely accepted that it was endorsed by the very conservative Justice Antonin Scalia (the man whose Supreme Court seat Gorsuch is set to take over).The Supreme Court’s ruling, written by then-Justice John Paul Stevens for a unanimous court, directs judges to respect an agency’s interpretations of those laws it’s in charge of administering where Congress’ meaning in writing the law is not clear. Nixing the doctrine would give judges more leeway to second-guess agencies’ rules.Environmental groups argue, in particular, that undoing Chevron deference would cripple the federal government’s ability to enforce rules against pollution, even long after Trump leaves the White House. EPA regulations are based on extensive analysis of science to inform the legal standards set by Congress.“If you abandon agency deference, it really means that you want to ignore scientific and technical analysis and evidence in policymaking,” Yogin Kothari, a Washington representative with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Huffington Post.“The idea of undoing Chevron deference is a recipe for stymying science-based safeguards for public health, safety and the environment,” he added. “Chevron deference allows us to actually ensure that we don’t have judges overriding scientific expertise … and substituting their own views with limited information.”Gorsuch doesn’t see it quite that way.The Supreme Court nominee, who currently sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, made his views clear in August in an immigration case called Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch. In a concurring opinion, Gorsuch wrote, “[T]he fact is Chevron … permit[s] executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers’ design.”In other words, Gorsuch said, federal agencies have too much unfettered power.Although the 10th Circuit case was not about the EPA, Trump and his supporters in Congress would clearly apply that criticism to the environmental agency.Trump put Myron Ebell, a once-fringe conspiracy theorist who rejects the widely accepted science on manmade global warming, in charge of the EPA transition team. He nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who made his reputation suing the EPA 13 times, to lead the agency. A policy memo leaked to Axios outlined proposed cuts to the EPA’s budget, including slashing hundreds of millions from grants to states and Native American tribes, climate programs, and environmental programs and management. Indeed, some environmental researchers took the memo as evidence that Trump wants to permanently cripple the EPA. Inside EPA reported that the administration was also planning to slash the agency’s enforcement division.At least two of the president’s strongest supporters in Congress seem to be on board with any anti-EPA push. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) held a hearing last week on “Making EPA Great Again,” at which three of his four witnesses were a coal lawyer, a chemical industry lobbyist and a libertarian scholar who recently accused the agency of “regulatory terrorism.” Meanwhile, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) introduced a bill to “completely abolish” the EPA by the end of next year.Although she led the EPA, Gorsuch’s mother, the late Anne Gorsuch Burford, might well have agreed with the idea that the agency needs to be restrained. (She died in 2004.)During her nearly two-year tenure at the EPA, described by The Washington Post as “tumultuous,” Burford gutted the budget, coddled the chemical industry, purged scientists from the agency’s ranks and oversaw a sharp drop in lawsuits against polluters. She resigned in March 1983 (two months before the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Chevron case) amid what some have called “the worst scandal in the history of the Environmental Protection Agency.” The opprobrium erupted after Burford refused to hand over documents relating to her handling of the $1.6 billion toxic waste Superfund. She was the first federal agency director to be held in contempt of Congress.But environmental groups argue that Americans need the federal government to play a strong role in protecting the environment.“Whether Republicans like it or not, we live in a society that has a lot of administrative agencies trying to provide safeguards against all kinds of things, not just environmental, but consumer protection, labor and more,” Patrick Gallagher, legal director for the Sierra Club, told HuffPost. “This regulatory state arose over many decades, including following the Great Depression, because of a need to protect common people from the excesses of corporate greed, technology and industrialization.” Still, Gorsuch’s skepticism of executive power could become a check on Trump as well. Gorsuch called the president’s attacks on a federal judge who had blocked his travel ban “disheartening” and “demoralizing,” in what may be the first case of a Supreme Court nominee publicly criticizing the White House. “I would imagine, based on Gorsuch’s history and previous opinions, that he might strike down some of this executive power Trump is exercising right now,” said David Kemp, a lawyer at the legal information site Justia. “The [Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch] opinion exalts judicial independence and separation of powers and condemns executive overreach. He might then stand up to executive overreach, even by President Trump.” How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Twitter fans were quick to point out the religious references. Some suggested that she was embodying Oshun (also spelled Osun), a Yoruba deity associated with love, fertility, and female sensuality. Oshun is often depicted wearing yellow and surrounded by sweet, life-giving water. Folktales told about Oshun claim that she was involved in the creation of the world, and that all living things owe their existence to her.As a result of the slave trade, a reverence for Oshun and other deities whose origins lie in African spirituality, like Yemonja, was carried across the Atlantic. Yoruban female deities are still worshipped in countries like Brazil and Cuba. Beyonce has channeled Oshun before, in the song “Hold Up” from “Lemonade.”Others suggested that Beyoncé was evoking the Virgin Mary during her Grammy performance. In the Christian tradition, Mary is the mother of Jesus Christ ― the holy woman who brought God into the world. In religious art, Mary is often depicted with a halo surrounding her head, symbolizing the fact that she is no ordinary woman. Another ode to Christian art was reflected in the way the stage was set. For part of the performance, Beyoncé walked on a long table surrounded by chairs ― evoking Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper.” But this time, it was Queen Bey at the head of the table.Several other fiercely feminine religious myths made an appearance in the performance. At one point, a special effect made it seem as if Beyoncé had multiple arms. It could have been a reference to Hindu deities like the mother goddess Durga, or Kali, who is associated with death, sexuality, and motherly love.Later on during the show, Beyoncé lay on a bed of flowers, a possible reference to the Roman goddess of love, Venus.The performance came days after Beyoncé announced to the world that she was pregnant with twins. Her epic tribute to divine motherhood ended with a quote from the poet Warsan Shire, whose work featured heavily in “Lemonade.”“If we’re gonna heal, let it be glorious,” she said."

The attacks killed nine people and took place between Nov. 17 and Dec. 13, 2016, in the final stages of the battle for the city. Around 200 people were injured. One local resident told researchers: “The smell isn’t something you can handle. The moment you’re exposed to it, your throat burns, it’s like a fire rod going in. It won’t let you swallow or breathe. Your neck starts boiling. You feel nauseated. Your eyes burn and you are not able to control the tears. Eventually, you are not able to breathe. It’s not like having your nose and mouth blocked, rather, your body won’t let the air in anymore.”According to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian army used the chemical attacks to weaken rebel positions before its troops moved into those districts. “The pattern of the chlorine attacks shows that they were coordinated with the overall military strategy for retaking Aleppo, not the work of a few rogue elements,” Ole Solvang, deputy emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. Syrian forces supported by Russia and Iran regained full control of Aleppo on Dec. 22 after months of intense fighting between government forces and rebels. The city’s fall was one of the biggest victories for embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad since the start of the conflict. Syria has repeatedly been under investigation for targeting civilians and opposition forces with chemical weapons ― which is prohibited by the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. Former U.S. President Barack Obama vowed that the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict would constitute a “red line.” But when a chemical attack in eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, killed hundreds of people in August 2013, the U.S. did not intervene. Rather, Russia and the U.S. forced Assad to give up his chemical weapons stockpiles and join the chemical weapons treaty.But a United Nations and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inquiry has determined that Syrian forces used chemical weapons in at least three instances in 2014 and 2015, months after joining the treaty. The inquiry also identified top Syrian officials involved in the decision to deploy the weapons, including Assad and his brother Maher, Reuters reported. The Syrian government has denied the allegations. While Russian planes played a crucial role in the campaign to retake Aleppo, there is no evidence that they were directly involved in the chemical attacks, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.However, given Russia’s permanent seat in the U.N.

He is the antithesis of tolerant and accepting.""",2017-02-13,<p>Trump supporters at the Bellingham Pride Festival in Washington</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589e974e2900002a00f25c0b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A 30-year-old Aussie recently approached me in Sydney and said the most ridiculous thing. After he proposed marriage and a move to the U.S. (not the most ridiculous part, incredibly), I mentioned the elephant in the conversation.“But what about Donald Trump?”“Actually, I’m a big fan of Donald Trump.”His tone-deaf admission sent several shudders down my spine. How could he have brought up a visa exchange with that bombshell waiting to be dropped? If he were a few shades darker, he might not even be allowed into the U.S.He didn’t stop there. He went on and on about what a pity it is that most guys like me are only visitors in Sydney. Guys like me? “It’s too bad that most black men you meet in Australia are only on holiday and don’t stay here,” he elaborated, clearly elated that I wasn’t one of “most.”Seriously? Was he even aware of the immigration issue currently affecting the entire world and Trump’s role in it? Was he actually talking race and immigration in one sentence and Trump love in the next without even a hint of irony?Clearly he was just a pretty face.Despite the questions racing through my head, I didn’t ask him to explain himself. I didn’t argue with him. I just quietly dismissed him. He was the fourth white Australian guy since the election who had pursued me in one breath and defended Trump in another. I’d probably never get used to them, but I was beginning to master the art of sending them on their way.Despite the dismissal, the tough question lingered on my mind: How could a gay white man pursuing a gay black man praise Trump with a straight face? I had two possible explanations: Either a lifetime of white privilege had obliterated his better judgement, or his interest in black men had everything to do with sex and nothing to do with understanding where we’re coming from, both our struggles and our triumphs. If you’ve never experienced true oppression because of something you couldn’t hide or force into the closet, if you’ve always been included in the immoral majority, if you are unable to see life outside of your own personal experience, of course, it’s easy to support someone who represents oppression and non-acceptance at its scariest. What do you have to lose?I, however, have way too much to lose. As a gay man, as a black man, as the son of immigrants, as an immigrant myself, I consider Donald Trump to be the enemy. And his defenders are my enemies by default. I can’t just shrug my shoulders and say, “Support the President,” like Nicole Kidman and Matthew McConaughey, when he clearly doesn’t support me and so many people who matter to me. (P.S. Anyone who knows anything about American history knows the role protest has played. Without it, gays still would be unable to marry, blacks still would be sitting at the back of the bus, women still would be unable to vote, and we would all still be British subjects. So please stop telling Trump’s opponents to shut up and just blindly support him and his actions because it’s the patriotic thing to do. “Freedom of speech” doesn’t only apply when it works in your favor.)I couldn’t possibly have any kind of meaningful relationship with someone who can’t look outside of his own privileged existence and see what a danger Trump and his political cohorts are to the rest of us. As far as I’m concerned, “I’m a big fan of Donald Trump” is tantamount to “As long as I’m safe, who cares about everyone else?”This is not about me hating people whose political ideology differs from mine. I’ve always side-eyed Democrats who shun Republicans just because they’re Republicans. I used to have a black acquaintance in New York City who was a Republican. I never agreed with a word he said, but I never came down on him for saying any of them.I’ve heard much worse since then. How quaint our old complaints about George W. Bush seem now. Trump isn’t just a Republican. He is the antithesis of tolerant and accepting. I don’t believe I’ve ever heard a Trump fan offer a reason for supporting him that didn’t involve fear, money or hating Hillary Clinton. I’ve never heard anything about his intelligence, his compassion, or his virtue. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m able to tune them out without much effort. But when you are voicing your Trump support in one sentence and romantically pursuing me in the next, as if racial strife and racial oppression don’t exist, and as if Trump isn’t making both worse, then we’ve got a problem.As the late, great Maya Angelou once said: “When people show you who they are believe them the first time.” Well, what about the second and third time? The 47th? Every time Trump appoints another racist or homophobic politician to a top post, he’s showing us exactly who he is.When he imposes an arbitrary immigration ban on anyone entering the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries, he’s showing us who he is - and I believe him! I suspect Trump, who appears to think iconic 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass is still alive and well and building a social media following, has never even heard of Maya AngelouI do concede that if you’re with Trump, it’s your prerogative to accept him, like him even. And it’s my prerogative to reject you for it, the same way your guy rejects pretty much all of my defining characteristics. The one thing Trump has yet to take from us is the right to chose whom we sleep with – and I’m not so sure that isn’t coming. Until it does, love Trump all you want. But my lovin’? In the immortal words of En Vogue, you’re never gonna get it."

In 2013, it actually",2017-02-13,<p><em><strong>Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch wanted to be able to put factories on barges and ship them to countries where it was cheaper to operate on a corporate whim.</strong></em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a0b30b28000023009985d6.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whirlpool, the big appliance manufacturer, stressed in recent years its preference to make it in America.In 2013, it actually moved dishwasher manufacturing jobs back to the United States from Mexico. The next year, it announced a $40 million investment in its Greenville, Ohio KitchenAid plant, adding 400 jobs. Last year, Whirlpool CEO Jeff Fettig said the company would spend another $40 million to expand its Findlay, Ohio dishwasher plant, adding 50 jobs and raising to $1 billion its investment in U.S. manufacturing since 2010.Last week, Intel announced it would spend $7 billion to upgrade an Arizona facility and employ 3,000 people to fabricate advanced computer wafers – meaning its CEO Brian Krzanich chose the United States over Ireland, Israel and China where Intel already produces silicon wafers.So it makes sense that Fettig and Krzanich serve on President Donald Trump’s new Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. The initiative is supposed to help the president promote U.S. job and manufacturing growth.Curiously, though, named to that same 28-member committee are at least seven CEOs who have recently – and sometimes infamously – offshored manufacturing and jobs. They include Greg Hayes, CEO of United Technologies, the corporation that is shipping Indiana jobs from its Carrier subsidiary to Mexico.The performance of the manufacturing council is crucial to large swaths of workers who voted for President Trump based on his promises to stop unfair trade and resurrect American manufacturing. In his inauguration speech, the president told those voters that he would enact “America first” policies. It is no “America first” policy to send jobs from two profitable Carrier plants in Indiana to Mexico for the sole purpose of making extra bucks. That kind of offshoring exhibits a greed first mindset. The CEOs who have pursued that philosophy should shut up and take advice from the committee’s American job creators.The U.S. job generators on the committee include the likes of Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla. His cars were rated the most American-made electrics for content and assembly for the second year in a row in 2016. The council also includes Mario Longhi, the CEO of U.S. Steel, and Klaus Kleinfeld, who last fall became CEO of Arconic, but who for eight years before that was CEO of Alcoa, the corporation that split to create Alcoa and Arconic. U.S. Steel and Alcoa have suffered from unfair trade, so Longhi and Kleinfeld have a strong interest in policies that support American manufacturing.But, oddly, placed on the committee was recently retired Caterpillar CEO Doug Oberhelman, who announced two years ago that the corporation would move 230 jobs making gear and engine oil pumps and valves from its plant in Joliet, Ill., to a factory in Monterrey, Mexico.Another advisor is Nucor CEO John Ferriola, who is building a new mill in Mexico instead of the United States. The joint venture with a Japanese company will make steel for the auto industry.Dana CEO Jim Kamsickas is on the committee too. This month, Dana is closing a truck parts manufacturing plant in Kentucky, shifting the work out of the country and killing 180 good, family-supporting American jobs. In 2007, it closed plants in Syracuse, Ind., and Cape Girardeau, Mo., and shipped the auto parts manufacturing work to Mexico. More than 250 American workers lost their jobs.This is what happens when so many corporations transport factories to Mexico. Then the supply chain – the manufacturing of components like engines and auto parts and steel – moves to Mexico too.For example, while Ford announced in January that it would invest $700 million and create 700 new jobs in Michigan, the auto company still intends to transfer production of its small car, the Focus, from the United States to Mexico. And yet, Ford CEO Mark Fields was chosen for the American manufacturing initiative.The United States lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect. Robots didn’t do it. Trade deficits did. Corporations like Carrier and Rexnord that offshore American factories then ship the manufactured products back to the United States kill good American jobs while ballooning the trade deficit.Those are the problems that workers who voted for Donald Trump wanted him to solve. They want those factories and those jobs back.That, however, is the opposite of the longstanding philosophy of General Electric. Its former CEO Jack Welch famously said, “Ideally, you’d have every plant you own on a barge to move with currencies and changes in the economy.” In other words, when a country like China manipulates the value of its currency and suppresses its workers’ wages, GE would uproot production from Peoria and float it to Beijing – allegiance to the United States be damned.That’s exactly what General Electric does under its current CEO Jeff Immelt. The show 60 Minutes described GE this way in 2009: “No company has gone global more aggressively than General Electric, the conglomerate that makes everything from refrigerators to MRI machines to jet engines.”Between 2004 and 2014, the number of GE employees in the United States declined by nearly 18 percent, from 165,000 to 136,000, while the number abroad rose 19 percent, from 142,000 to 169,000.Immelt was GE chairman that entire time. So it’s confounding that he is a member of an initiative that’s supposed to prioritize American jobs.Under Immelt’s leadership, not only does GE move factories, it uses offshoring as a threat when lawmakers don’t cave to its demands.In September of 2015, two months after Congress declined to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, Immelt announced that GE, which had been among the largest benefactors of the bank, would move 500 U.S. jobs overseas.It was Republicans in Congress who had called the bank corporate welfare and refused to renew its charter. The bank provides financing for transactions that commercial lenders decline as too risky.But within six weeks of GE’s threats, Congress restored the bank, with a majority of Republicans suddenly on board.Frankly, it’s unpatriotic CEOs like Immelt and Hayes who should be stuck on a barge and shipped offshore.

Before graduating from high school, Columbus was all I knew, and more importantly it was my home. But Black girls building home together is a threat to white supremacy. That’s why in schools Black girls are being suspended at 5 times the rate of White girls for exhibiting leadership qualities like attitude, confidence, and assertiveness. It’s why Black girls are continuously told that we must leave our communities in order to be successful. And it’s why we are encouraged to achieve the dreams that our families have dreamt for us by not only leaving our homes, but by creating distance between ourselves and the Black women–led communities that gave us space to be leaders. I embodied these messages that were fed to me about the power, and the danger, of my intelligence and leadership qualities and I left. I went to college in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I studied abroad in Istanbul, Turkey. I took my first political organizing fellowship opportunity in Portland, Oregon. And I landed my first big girl job in Washington, DC, where I have stayed. I’ve made it around the world on my own, using my energy and know-how to make positive change for others.However, my need for community, home and Black-only spaces never left me.What I have needed all along is not just my power, but also the expression of my love, perhaps the most threatening thing of all to systemic oppression. In the final book of her three-part series on love, Communion: the Female Search for Love, bell hooks writes, “We can all speak of our longing for power. Our longing for love must be kept secret. To give voice to such longing is to be counted among the weak, the soft.” After moving to Washington, DC, and working to live my greatest Barbara Jordan dreams, I realized that it meant very little if I wasn’t in community with the people I claimed to be working on behalf of as a reproductive justice organizer – Black women and our communities. I’m writing these words with the attitude, confidence and assertiveness of love, because it has become clear to me that the people I love and who love me are the foundation and core of every move I make. I prefer to do everything in partnership. Whether it’s to build a business (BLACK) with my Co-Director Kevin Banatte or to expose my deep love of politics and pop culture on a weekly podcast (The Black Joy Mixtape) with my SisterHomieFriend Jazmine Walker. With every step I make as an organizer, there is a group chat or a physical gang of Black women to whom I run back to for guidance, support and feedback until I go out into battle again. If we are invested in ensuring the collective liberation of all Black people, we must be in healthy and constant relationship with the community we claim to love. To be sure, healthy doesn’t mean there is a lack of conflict, difficult conversations and struggles towards creating a practice of accountability to address the hurt we are bound to cause one another simply by being in a relationship with one another. Our chosen families should not only include people who agree with us and cheer us on when we win. Our community also includes the people who are quick to be honest with us when we’ve fallen short or cause harm.Time and time again, my community has held my hand and said “Look at me. I’m your family now, too.” Through firings, promotions, direct actions, babies and the loss of families members – they remain. They remind me that even when I am away from home, I should seek to create home, building and strengthening ties to home, by any means necessary. To look at a person you love in the eye and to tell them where they harmed you takes courage. For that person to acknowledge your pain and to work to address the hurt they’ve caused takes fortitude. To move forward and to love each other just the same or more is justice. Though this hardly ever happens for Black people within our criminal justice or political system, there’s no reason not to model it in our families, workplaces and communities. Adrienne Maree Brown says that all organizing is science fiction because we are working towards a world that is free from oppression even though that is not our current reality. Yes, we have a lot of work to do before our society is a source of the love we deserve. Still, my vision for this Black Futures Month is that we take that next step, whatever it may be for each of us, toward love. I encourage all of us to start creating love and community for ourselves wherever and within whomever we call home.This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network. Each day in February, look for a new post exploring cultural and political issues affecting the Black community and examining the impact it will have going forward.

Citizens can safely return to their homes,” Regional Governor Apostolos Tzitzikostas wrote on Twitter.For one group of refugees and migrants the discovery of the bomb led to an excursion to a museum.The group, many of them Syrians fleeing the civil war there, live in a nearby former toilet paper factory. They were taken to the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, a listed monument whose permanent exhibitions include masterpieces of ancient Greek art dating from prehistoric times to late antiquity.About 450 people live in the Softex refugee camp in an industrial zone on the outskirts of the city, in conditions described as “prison-like” by Amnesty International.They are among about 60,000 refugees and migrants stranded in makeshift and formal camps across Greece since Balkan countries closed their borders last March to those seeking passage to western and northern Europe.Greece’s migration ministry said Sunday’s trip was organized at the request of the refugees, and Greek state TV said they would also visit Thessaloniki’s White Tower, a waterfront monument and one of Greece’s most recognizable buildings."
