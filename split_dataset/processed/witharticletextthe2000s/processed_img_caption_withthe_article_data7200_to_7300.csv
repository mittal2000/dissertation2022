0,RELIGION,How One Houston Synagogue Is Facing Yom Kippur After Hurricane Harvey,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-synagogue-yom-kippur-hurricane-harvey_us_59cd2059e4b03b0879cfeff1,"On the Day of Atonement, members of the United Orthodox Synagogues will face a poignant time of reflection.",2017-09-28,The main sanctuary in southwest Houston was flooded after the storm.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cd6f49180000f507c9d720.jpeg?ops=crop_0_35_3024_3698%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement that falls on Friday this year, is one of the holiest days on the Jewish religious calendar. It’s meant to be a time set aside for prayer, repentance and spiritual renewal.For one Jewish synagogue in Houston, Yom Kippur will be a day filled with reflections on the past and particularly focused questions about the future.The United Orthodox Synagogues of Houston sits just a few hundred yards from Brays Bayou, which flooded by several feet as Hurricane Harvey dropped record rainfall on the city in late August. The modern Orthodox congregation has weathered its fair share of storms ― the synagogue’s complex has flooded three times in just the last three years. But nothing prepared Rabbi Barry Gelman for the destruction that touched nearly every corner of his synagogue this time. The building took in 4 to 5 feet of water, Gelman told HuffPost. All the rooms were affected, including the main sanctuary, classrooms and the rabbi’s office. Prayer books and Bibles had fallen off shelves and were soaked. Chairs were toppled. The Torah scrolls had been taken out of the building before the storm hit, but water had crept close to the ark where the scrolls are typically kept ― missing it by inches. “It was very sad to walk through,” Gelman told HuffPost about the first time he saw the synagogue after the hurricane. “Primarily because it came with the realization that we’ll likely never see the synagogue in its full beauty like that [again]. We have to figure out what to do next.”Harvey made landfall near Texas’ Gulf Coast on Aug. 25 as a Category 4 hurricane, eventually dropping 40 to 65 inches of rain in parts of southeast Texas. The storm claimed the lives of at least 50 people across eight counties and caused billions of dollars in damage to homes, businesses and places of worship. Harvey was worse than previous storms, Gelman said, because so many congregants’ homes were affected. Many members live near the synagogue, so they can walk to services on Sabbath. At least a third of its 320 families’ homes took in water. Many families, including Gelman’s, had to find temporary lodging in hotels or apartments. “We’ve been focusing ever since the flood on being positive and first helping people through the initial stages of this, which is very complicated,” he said. “You walk into your home and see 1 or 2 or 5 feet of water, and stuff is ruined. It’s paralyzing and demoralizing.”Because the hurricane hit just a few weeks before the start of the busy High Holidays, synagogue leaders needed to scramble to figure out how to prepare the building for Rosh Hashanah on Sept. 20. Thankfully, they had help. Gelman said that his congregation received both financial and physical donations from volunteers and wellwishers from around the country. Neighboring congregations donated chairs. Publishing companies and other synagogues donated prayer books. Youth groups pitched in and Gelman’s rabbinical colleagues from other states flew in to help for a few days. Some people even showed up at the rabbi’s house.“There was a guy in my house cutting out wet bookshelves and sheetrock from Hawaii. I didn’t know him. He just called me and said, ‘Do you need help? I’ll be at your house in 10 minutes,’” the rabbi told HuffPost. “A wonderful group of Mormons helped me get wet furniture and other items out of my house right after the flood.”As Rosh Hashanah drew near, Gelman said he was focusing on telling his congregants not to succumb to quick solutions and to be thoughtful about what the future holds.UOS was able to clear the water out of a social hall in its complex that was slightly more elevated than its main sanctuary. On Rosh Hashanah, the congregation met there to observe the holiday.“It was very emotional,” Gelman said. “It was wonderful to be able to be all together, but there are so many members of our congregation who are still affected.”As Yom Kippur approached, he said that UOS will have to think deeply about the congregation’s next steps. They are holding services in the social hall for now, but the future remains unclear, Gelman said.“The big question mark that we have is what’s next for our community and our synagogue, as this neighborhood has a tendency to flood. What are we going to do to avoid that in the future?”In the meantime, he’s trying to focus on the good. “People have responded with great strength and great resilience, and our community, which is very united and very tight, was able to provide wonderful support for the members whose houses were flooded,” Gelman said. “To me that’s a testament to the strength of a faith community, and a community bound by thousands of years of tradition and common history.” "

President Donald Trump made dismantling huge portions of the EPA a priority and proposed shrinking its budget by 31 percent, a plan endorsed by controversial EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.“Pete Lopez has spent nearly a decade in one of the country’s largest state legislatures working to improve the quality of life of his constituents,” Pruitt said in a statement. “His familiarity with the region and his experience working to solve environmental problems in New York will be invaluable in helping EPA serve Americans in the Northeast and the Caribbean.”Enck said Region 2 ― with a $700 million budget and 800-person staff, including 50 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and two in the U.S. Virgin Islands ― risks losing capacity to respond to disasters. She said it’s not unusual to name a regional administrator months after a new administration takes office, but she declined to comment on the timing of the EPA’s announcement. Still, she described Lopez’s appointment as “a pleasant surprise.”  About 32 years ago, Lopez, whose father is from Puerto Rico, interned for her at the nonprofit Environmental Advocates in Albany, New York’s capital.Plus, he has experience managing disaster relief in his upstate New York district after back-to-back storms tore roofs off barns and flooded businesses throughout Schoharie County. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene, then the worst storm in decades, made landfall in the state, causing $1.3 billion in damage and leaving 1.1 million without power. Weeks later, Tropical Storm Lee hit, inducing another round of devastating flooding.The state Assembly affords little power to the minority party, so, Enck said, leaving in the middle of his term could offer Lopez a chance to wield real power. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) must now either call for a special election or wait until 2018 to replace Lopez, as the deadline to run in the state’s Nov. 7 election has passed. “He’s terrific,” Enck said. “He’s smart, he cares about the environment and he’s super nice, which counts when you’re working with a demoralized workforce.”  The EPA drew criticism last month after The Associated Press reported that agency officials were nowhere to found as toxic waste sites in Houston flooded during Hurricane Harvey. The agency, which has become increasingly politicized under Pruitt, took the unusual step of publicly attacking the reporter who uncovered the story. Pruitt, who sued the EPA to block environmental rules at least a dozen times in his previous job as Oklahoma’s attorney general, has taken drastic steps to redefine the agency’s mission since taking office in February. He’s embraced executives from heavily polluting industries and scrapped regulations, including ones to reduce planet-warming emissions and limit exposure to toxic chemicals. He helped orchestrate the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and has repeatedly repudiated the widely accepted science linking global warming to human activities. “He should buy boxes of Wheaties by the cart,” Enck said, “because he’s going to have to be very strong, standing up to Pruitt.” "

3,QUEER VOICES,The Satanic Temple Has An Ingenious Plan To Troll Anti-Gay Bakeries,Curtis M.

The 2012 case was originally filed when Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips cited his Christian faith when turning away a gay couple, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, who had planned to order a wedding cake. Regardless of how the Supreme Court ultimately rules, however, the queer community has found an unlikely ally: The Satanic Temple. The Salem, Massachusetts-based group is encouraging LGBTQ rights supporters to order Satan-themed cakes from bakers who oppose same-sex marriage because of their religious beliefs. In case anyone needs inspiration, Temple co-founder and spokesperson Lucien Greaves tweeted a mock-up of a cake with a Satanic theme earlier this week. Greaves told HuffPost that he and his parishioners hope the plan will prompt the Supreme Court to “consider either adding sexual orientation as a protected class, or taking religion away from protected class status.”“We’ve received a good deal of messages from people who have asked if there is a way to leverage religious freedom in such a way as to allow business owners to refuse service to theocratic evangelical nationalists,” he said. “If these self-proclaimed defenders of religious freedom want to leverage their religious privilege to deny service to same-sex couples, perhaps they’ll appreciate making a cake for Satan instead.”Greaves isn’t optimistic that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of LGBTQ equality this fall, particularly following the addition of Neil Gorsuch, who has a history of opposing queer rights, in April. “Gorsuch’s record of ruling 100 percent of the time against church-state separation, and in favor of religious privilege, further deepens suspicions as to how this ruling will go,” he said.So far, no one has taken the Satanic Temple up on the offer, but Greaves expects that will change if the Supreme Court rules in Phillips’s favor. “After the ruling ― if it turns out the way we expect ― I’m sure there will be plenty of opportunities,” he said, “and likely many situations outside of the context of wedding cake requests.”He then added, “We’ll have to be creative on a case-by-case basis.”Catch the latest in LGBTQ news by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter."

Evidence has emerged in each case that contradicts police accounts of the deaths, highlighting what rights groups have long alleged are widespread abuses in Duterte’s drug war.Earlier this month, a body believed to be that of 14-year-old Reynaldo de Guzman was found in the Philippines’ Gapan City. The teen’s body had been stabbed around 30 times and his head was wrapped in packing tape.Guzman’s parents identified their son in the morgue on Sept. 6, after he had been missing for 20 days. He was last seen near his home on the outskirts of the capital of Manila with 19-year-old Carl Arnaiz, a friend who was also found dead 10 days earlier in a separate town over 50 miles away from where Guzman’s body was recovered.Police claimed Arnaiz died in a shootout after attempting to rob a cab driver, but forensic reports showed that he had been shot while on his knees and potentially tortured. Police also stated that the young boy’s body found in Gapan City did not match Guzman’s DNA, but both Guzman’s parents and the Public Attorney’s Office disputed the police findings and questioned their credibility.Public suspicion of police accounts in the drug war is common in the Philippines, and a poll released on Wednesday showed that about half of the country believes that many of those killed are neither drug dealers nor resisted arrest.Although the exact series of events that led to the deaths of Guzman and Arnaiz is currently unknown, the incident fueled outrage from activists and rights groups who saw echoes of a third extrajudicial killing of a teenager last month.Kian delos Santos, a 17-year-old student, had been at the center of protests and investigations into police conduct after CCTV footage from Aug. 16 captured plainclothes officers taking Santos from his home on the fringes of Manila. Santos was dragged to an alley, where an autopsy report revealed he was shot twice in the head and once in the back.Footage showed two policemen walking with the incapacitated 17-year-old in a headlock before his death ― seemingly contradicting official claims that he pulled a gun on them during arrest. Rights groups say the recent high-profile killings of teenagers are just a few of the dozens of minors that have died in the Philippine drug war, which is persisting despite blatant abuses of authority and human rights violations.“Kian’s death sparked a national outcry, but we have seen that was not an isolated case,” Amnesty International researcher Rachel Chhoa-Howard said.“We’re seeing a breakdown in the rule of law, and the killing of Kian and Carl and Reynaldo are all examples of how the drug war has spiraled out of control.”At Santos’ funeral, over a thousand people gathered to protest in one of the country’s biggest public displays of dissent against Duterte’s deadly drug war. Weeks later, thousands more demonstrated in the streets to oppose Duterte’s growing authoritarianism and the surge in police killings under his presidency.Police and vigilante groups have killed at least 7,000 people since late June of last year, when Duterte took office and followed through on a campaign promise to violently target drug dealers and users. Rights groups say that at least 54 children under the age of 18 have been killed as part of that total.“Children have been victims of the drug war since Duterte launched in July of 2016, but what we have seen is a sinister evolution in how children are targeted,” said Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.In the early days of the drug war, many of the children killed were hit by stray bullets while with older relatives, but Kine says that the recent deaths highlight that police and vigilantes are also targeting minors.Although Duterte has promised an investigation into the killings and police are carrying out internal probes, rights groups believe that the government and security forces can’t be trusted to credibly hold themselves accountable.“We’re no longer calling for the Philippine national police to investigate. They are basically beyond redemption. What we have consistently been calling for in recent months is an urgent, United Nations-led international investigation,” Kine said. Duterte and his allies have continuously supported the drug war ― often viciously objecting to human rights groups’ concerns ― and have attempted to crackdown on any dissent against their rule. Prominent Duterte opponent Senator Leila de Lima, for instance, has been jailed on what rights groups claim are false charges.“The jailing of Senator Leila de Lima really put a chill into public discourse about this, because the message that was sent was, ‘If we can target a senator and former secretary of justice with trumped up, politicized drug charges, what do you think we can do to you?’” Kine says. Duterte has also targeted institutions that aim to put a check on government abuses, and earlier this month lawmakers voted by an overwhelming majority to cut funding for the Philippine Commission for Human Rights from $17 million per year to just twenty dollars. But despite continued killings and international criticism, public opinion polls have consistently shown that Duterte enjoys widespread support both personally and for his violent crackdown. Most recently a Pew Research Center poll conducted this spring and released last week showed that around three quarters of Filipinos backed the drug war, while 86 percent held a favorable view of the president.

The only thing between Moore and the Senate now is the Dec. 12 special election against Democrat Doug Jones, whose odds in the solidly red state are decidedly low.Moore was twice suspended from court as chief justice of Alabama for putting his religious views before his duty to uphold the law of land ― first for refusing to remove a 2.6-ton Ten Commandments monument from the state Supreme Court building in 2003, and again in 2016 for telling judges to defy a federal ruling on same-sex marriage.And yet a man who has said “homosexual conduct should be illegal” and who recently called Islam a “false religion” could soon fill the Senate seat vacated by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The former judge’s unabashed religious views and apparent disregard for the legal establishment have won hearts in the overwhelmingly Christian Alabama. But they have also raised a red flag for secular advocates who work to uphold the separation of church and state.“The centerpiece of Roy Moore’s political campaign is a commitment to Christian supremacy,” Larry T. Decker, executive director of the Secular Coalition for America, said in a statement. “Throughout his career and his campaign, Judge Moore has flaunted his disregard for the Constitution and unapologetically asserted that his religious beliefs must take precedence over the law.“Judge Moore’s approach to politics is an attack on the separation of church and state and a rejection of the rule of the law.”In the wake of Moore’s suspension for ordering the state’s probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark ruling on same-sex marriage, the Southern Poverty Law Center called it “the culmination of a judicial career spanning 25 years in which he often put his personal views above the law and the U.S. Constitution, frequently bringing religion into the courtroom and basing judicial opinions on his Biblical beliefs.” The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, at the time called Moore “a dangerous demagogue.”Richard Cohen, president of the Montgomery, Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, went so far as to refer to Moore as the “Ayatollah of Alabama.”“We are talking about someone who is truly, truly unhinged,” Cohen told HuffPost in 2016. “He has concocted legal theories to justify his religious goals, but none that makes any sense.”One of the central themes of Moore’s campaign is the notion, as The Washington Post’s Michael Scherer reported, “that removing the sovereignty of a Christian God from the functions of government is an act of apostasy, an affront to the biblical savior as well as the Constitution.”Moore reportedly even carries with him at all times a pocket pamphlet he published that contains his legal theory of God’s supremacy.The former judge has said he believes that the First Amendment applies only to Christians, that Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who is Muslim, shouldn’t be allowed to take the congressional oath, and that everything from the Sept. 11 attacks to child abuse are a result of God’s anger at America.“I want to see virtue and morality returned to our country and God is the only source of our law, liberty and government,” Moore said last week in a debate with Strange.Decker noted that the Secular Coalition is careful not to endorse or oppose political candidates but that the organization felt it was necessary to “speak out” given Moore’s constitutional track-record.“Our nation was founded on the principle of religious freedom for people of all faiths and none,” Decker said. “We urge the voters of Alabama to take seriously what it would mean for our country if they were to vote in a U.S. Senator whose sole mission is to destroy this bedrock principle of American democracy.”"

8,POLITICS,"Trump Promises A Tax Cut For The Middle Class, Guarantees One For The Rich",S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tax-cuts_us_59cad42ce4b02aef6cd5fd04,"The only details released so far slash taxes for business owners and the richest taxpayers. Everyone else gets the White House’s word they’ll get a cut, too.",2017-09-27,President Donald Trump is expected to announce tax cut plans Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cad4d01900004e5d565cc6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump plans to unveil Wednesday what the White House is calling a “middle-class” tax cut but which at this point cuts taxes only for business owners and the wealthy.Shareholders of corporations would enjoy a rate cut from the current maximum of 35 percent down to 20 percent, according to a White House briefing Tuesday. Owners of “small businesses,” who pay taxes on their individual returns rather than with a corporate filing, would pay no more than 25 percent, instead of the current maximum of 39.6 percent. And the wealthiest Americans would see that top 39.6 percent rate fall to 35 percent.As for lower- and middle-class Americans, three Trump administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity would say only that Trump and House and Senate Republican leaders are promising to set rates and tax bracket thresholds so that those taxpayers would enjoy the most savings.“This package is completely designed with the middle class in mind,” one of the officials said. “Tax relief in this package is focused on middle-class families.”The details of how that would happen, though, is left to the House and Senate tax committees.“We are not going to provide the specific income levels,” the official said. “We’re not trying to write a bill. We’re trying to provide a framework.”The White House officials said the current seven tax brackets that range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent would be collapsed into three: 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent.Most deductions apart from home mortgage interest and charitable deductions would be eliminated, including the deduction for state and local taxes, which currently provide a major break on federal income taxes for residents of coastal and high-tax states.Also eliminated would be the personal exemptions, which let taxpayers deduct $4,050 per person in the household.The White House officials said these would be offset by an increase in the standard deduction from the current $12,600 per married couple to $24,000 and an increase in the child tax credit from $1,000 to a higher level.Still, how much and even whether this would provide an overall tax reduction for a family of four is unclear. Currently, that family starts out with at least $28,800 of income exempt from taxes, thanks to the standard deduction plus four exemptions. That figure is nearly $5,000 more than the $24,000 standard deduction the administration is touting.“If they’re not going to show any numbers, it’s impossible to know how this works,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the liberal Tax Policy Center.Gleckman added that it was theoretically possible that a larger child tax credit would offset the loss of the exemptions but that it would depend on the size of the family and a range of other itemized deductions that would likely be eliminated.“Without knowing exactly what the plan is for those other itemized deductions, it’s very hard to say whether people are better off or not,” Gleckman said.The White House officials would not provide any target thresholds for the tax brackets that could help determine how much, if anything, different families would save under the new plan. Nor would they say how much the child tax credit might be increased. They did say that House and Senate committees would be allowed to impose a fourth bracket above the 35 percent one.“We are committed to making sure the tax code is at least as progressive as the existing tax code, and does not shift the tax burden from high-income to low- and middle-income taxpayers,” another official said.But congressional tax writers have always had the ability to create higher tax brackets for the wealthy, and Republicans for decades have been loath to do so. Without a fourth, higher bracket, though, the plan would almost certainly cut taxes for the richest Americans ― something Trump has said repeatedly he would not do.The White House officials also said the plan would increase the projected debt by as much as House and Senate members choose to allow in their budget resolution for the tax bill. The special “budget reconciliation rules” would let congressional Republicans pass tax cuts with only 50 votes in the Senate, where they currently hold 52 seats and the vice president could break a tie. Ordinarily a bill needs 60 votes to avoid a possible filibuster.One major disadvantage of using the special rules, however, is that tax changes would expire in 10 years unless projections show that the 11th year would no longer generate a deficit ― an unlikely scenario given the steep cuts Republicans want.

9,POLITICS,A Manners Lesson For Donald Trump About The Stars And Stripes,"Steven Petrow, ContributorAn author and journalist often referred to as Mr. Manners.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-manners-lesson-for-donald-trump-about-the-stars-and_us_59cbc02fe4b02ba6621ff974,"The U.S. flag code says nothing about kneeling, Mr. President",2017-09-27,<p>A clear-cut violation of the U.S. Flag Code</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cbc3152000001700083d53.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With Puerto Rico in ruins and North Korea’s president, Kim Jon-un, seemingly ready to hit the “strike” button, it might seem like the wrong time to give Donald Trump a down-and-dirty history lesson about flag etiquette and the esteemed U.S. Flag Code. But nothing bothers me more than manners faux pas and misremembered history (except an island in tatters and a world on the verge of extinction.) Of course, these lessons have everything to do with the current epidemic of “kneeing” taking place across the NFL before and during the national anthem. Former San Francisco Giants quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the “Patient Zero” of this viral phenomena, originally said his action was a silent protest about the treatment of Americans of color. But the noise around this issue has grown deafening, especially regarding what is considered right and proper when it comes to respecting the flag.In this, the president has been front and center, and largely in a corner by himself, in protesting that “when somebody disrespects our flag… that son of a b*tch” should be taken off the field, stat. “Out.” And, oh yes, “fired.”As a manners expert, I’ve had to pass the required course on “flag etiquette,” which is actually more complicated than you might think. Of all the etiquette mavens — past and present — the late Amy Vanderbilt (in her “guide to gracious living”) detailed the do’s and don’ts of “The Flag and Our National Anthem” in OCD perfection. With over seven pages of instruction, Vanderbilt lists the “major regulations” concerning “the display of the flag,” positing that many of us “do not realize that there are definite rules concerning the proper display of the flag to protect it from desecration.” Mr. President, are you paying attention?I’ll run through a handful of them here quickly: Never fly it upside down except when a sign of distress. Don’t ever let it touch the ground or get in the water. Taking the wetness principle one step further, lower it promptly if it rains (although an exception was later made for “all-weather flags.”) Other flags can’t be flown above ours, but don’t make the mistake of ever placing another flag to the right of the stars and stripes. I do not know why that is the case, but it’s on page 629 of Vanderbilt’s tome.Although many people think that advice givers — such as Vanderbilt, Emily Post and myself — make up our rules, that’s not the case, and in this instance flag etiquette is derived from the U.S. Flag Code, also known as U.S. Code Title 4 Chapter 1. In case it’s not clear, Title 4 Chapter 1 is a federal law. The law also makes clear that the stars and stripes should never “be used for any advertising purpose”— although the president (like most politicians) violated that rule with impunity in the recent election as any Google search of “Trump, election, American flag” will reveal. Of course, other pols aren’t making the case that kneeling is disrespecting the flag.Speaking of the president and the flag, John Oliver reminded us this week of an October appearance by Trump where he bear-hugged the American flag. “OK, putting aide the free-speech implications there, how is kneeling in front of a flag more disrespectful to it than grinding it against your gnarled old boner?” remarked Oliver. In one of the photos (not the one above) I noticed that Trump is also in violation of the edict not to place another flag to the right of the stars and stripes. Gotcha, Mr. President. But that’s not a reason to fire you.One more thing about the Flag Code: It also prohibits use of it as part of “a costume or athletic uniform.” If you’ve ever been near an Old Navy around the Fourth of July, eyed online retailer’s Bonobos’ stars and stripes shorts, or watched any U.S. team compete in the Olympics, you know that particular stipulation is routinely ignoredOK, putting aide the free-speech implications there, how is kneeling in front of a flag more disrespectful to it than grinding it against your gnarled old boner, without presidential apoplexy, because it’s good for business.What may surprise the president and many Americans is this: Nowhere is it codified that Americans must stand, salute, or cross our hearts out of respect to the American flag. Nor is there any language that makes it a criminal offense to disobey the guidelines. “Can you be fired?” I asked David Cole, the ACLU’s legal director. He replied: “There are no consequences if one chooses to ignore the flag code.”Still, the president insisted in a tweet, “you know what, it’s still totally disrespectful [not to salute or stand for the flag].” That’s his opinion, which he’s certainly entitled to as an American, but I fear that he’s forgotten the constitutional history class about our right to actually burn the American flag. Back in 1968, when young Donald was avoiding the military, anti-Vietnam protests regularly featured the burning of U.S. flags. No surprise, given the tenor of the times, that was also the year that Congress approved the “Federal Flag Desecration Law,” which made it illegal to “knowingly” mutilate, deface, or burn the flag.Bu wait. All that changed in 1990, when the Supreme Court struck down the law and upheld the right of protestors to burn the flag as expression guaranteed by the First Amendment. A year earlier, in a related flag case overturning a similar Texas law, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan had written: “If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.”Still in November, the president tweeted that flag burners should perhaps be punished by “loss of citizenship or year in jail.”If the Supreme Court says we can’t coerce speech in politics or religion, then surely we can’t coerce it in sports. The polite—and right― response, Mr. President, is to let the NFL players and owners take a knee, or sit it out, as they wish – as long as they don’t chew gum while doing so.Agree or disagree with me?

In a new interview, she also touched on her guilt surrounding her privilege and her feelings of frustration and loneliness because of postpartum depression.While chatting with Us Weekly, the model and author explained that she “lost all interest in everything” while struggling with postpartum depression, even keeping her pajamas in her pantry because she had no desire to go upstairs to change. One of the most difficult parts for Teigen was combating these feelings while also recognizing the amount of help and success she had.“It’s really hard to know how privileged you are and still feel frustrated, angry and lonely,” she said. “It makes you feel like more of a bitch.”Teigen and her husband, singer John Legend, turned to IVF to welcome their daughter, Luna, in April 2016. In March 2017, Teigen’s essay about her experience with postpartum depression was published in Glamour, and in it, she wrote similar sentiments about struggling to understand how she could have the condition.“I also just didn’t think it could happen to me,” she wrote. “I have a great life. I have all the help I could need: John, my mother (who lives with us), a nanny. But postpartum does not discriminate. I couldn’t control it.”Teigen told Us Weekly that she and Legend finally learned what she was experiencing after visiting a doctor.“Sitting with John, our doctor pulled out this book and was like, ‘Do you have these feelings? Would you be happier tomorrow if you didn’t wake up?’” she said. “And yes, I probably would be. That’s a big deal! I didn’t realize how bad it was until I was out of it.” Teigen continues to be vocal about her experience to help other moms with their struggles. She also frequently thanks Legend for supporting her.“Kids, friends and work are hard, but John is the easiest part of everything,” she said."

When Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during the national anthem in 2016, he made it clear that he was protesting American racism.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said.However, as of late Trump has twisted Kaepernick’s protest against racism as a “disgrace” to veterans.Ignoring race now just because Trump says so is intellectually dishonest, and like Kaepernick said, America has shown a consistent pattern of oppressing black people. Yet somehow, those who disagree with the protest on behalf of veterans ignore an obvious fact.Veterans suffered oppression in the United States.Throughout American history, black veterans put their lives on the line for their country only to return to a nation that treated them as subhuman.The Equal Justice Initiative released a 2016 report titled “Lynching in America: Targeting Black Veterans” and director Bryan Stevenson wrote:“No one was more at risk of experiencing violence and targeted racial terror than black veterans who had proven their valor and courage as soldiers during the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Because of their military service, black veterans were seen as a particular threat to Jim Crow and racial subordination. Thousands of black veterans were assaulted, threatened, abused, or lynched following military service.”After World War I, black veterans returned to the violence of the Red Summer of 1919, during which black civilians and veterans alike were forced to fight against white mobs. During this time, a black veteran wearing his uniform was seen as a sign of “defiance,” and at least “13 veterans were lynched.” On August 3, 1919, a white mob lynched black veteran Christian Briggs because he “insulted” a white woman by not moving out of the way fast enough for her on the sidewalk.Racism and police brutality toward black veterans continued after World War II. On February 8, 1946, a white conductor shot honorably discharged black marine Timothy Hood five times for removing a Jim Crow sign in Bessemer, Alabama. Instead of arresting the shooter, police chief G.B. Fant apprehended Hood. He then shot Hood in the head in the back of his car and claimed Hood reached for his hip “as if to draw a weapon”.There was no evidence that Hood was armed, but Fant was cleared anyway.Just four days after Hood was shot, Isaac Woodard, a black veteran who served in the Philippines, was on a Greyhound bus in Georgia and heading home after he was honorably discharged. Woodard asked the driver if he had time to use the bathroom during a stop, and the driver cursed at him. After they argued, the driver called the police who then beat Woodard and arrested him for disorderly conduct. When they arrived at the station, police chief Linwood Shull literally beat Woodard blind. At trial, Shull admitted to beating Woodard, but his attorney said suggested that South Carolina should secede from the union again if the all-white jury found him guilty.The jury acquitted Shull.“Negro veterans that fought in this war…don’t realize that the real battle has just begun in America,” Woodard said. “They went overseas and did their duty, and now they’re home and have to fight another struggle that I think outweighs the war.”Black veterans also suffered abuse when they fought for equality in their own country. Hosea Williams served in World War II in the all-black unit of General George Patton’s Third Army and went home with a Purple Heart after suffering injuries that left him reliant on a cane. Then a mob of white men attacked him in his uniform for drinking out of a white-only water fountain at a Georgia bus station.Williams helped organize the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama and was jailed over 125 times for his work with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.“I had fought in World War II,” Williams said. “And I once was captured by the German army, and I want to tell you the Germans never were as inhumane as the state troopers of Alabama.”But not all black veterans from the Civil Rights Movement survived after returning home. Medgar Evers fought in the Battle of Normandy before becoming the NAACP’s first field officer in Mississippi in 1954, and he was a major player in the desegregation of the University of Mississippi in 1962.On June 12, 1963, klansman Byron De La Beckwith shot Evers in the back in his own driveway, leaving him to bleed on his steps in front of his wife and children before he died at the hospital.Two all-white juries deadlocked on Beckwith’s guilt, and he wasn’t convicted until 1994.It’s easy to brush these incidents off as just “in the past,” but systematic racism remains an issue in our country that has survived civil rights legislation, and black veterans are no exception. In 2015, Officer Robert Olsen shot and killed unarmed, black Air Force veteran Anthony Hill in DeKalb, Georgia. Hill’s family alleged in a wrongful death suit that Hill was suffering a nonviolent mental episode due to PTSD from serving in Afghanistan. In 2016, a grand jury indicted Olsen for two counts of felony murder, two counts of violation of oath of office, and one count each of aggravated assault and making a false statement, per the Washington Post.Unlike the previous examples, it is unlikely that Olsen knew Hill was a veteran before killing him, but Hill was one of many black people killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans in 2015 and 2016.This is exactly what Kaepernick decided to protest.“To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,” Kaepernick said. “There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”Before you tell people to stand for the flag in honor of our veterans, it’s important to ask if veterans are honored and respected equally in America. Before you say kneeling has nothing to do with race, it’s important to ask why Kaepernick and his colleagues kneeled in the first place. When you’ve asked yourself those questions, ponder if serving in the United States military has ever saved a black man from racial oppression and police brutality. Answer these questions honestly, and maybe you’ll understand why these athletes are able to kneel during the national anthem while respecting our veterans as much as anyone else.Black veterans fought for the American flag too, and they were killed by the people they risked their lives to protect. On a scale of disrespecting our armed forces, kneeling during the anthem pales in comparison to getting beaten, shot, and lynched, but when Trump mentions veterans he neglects this context as if brushing race aside is the proper way to address a protest against racist policing. Considering Trump’s history of siding with law enforcement, even when it’s unethical, this isn’t surprising. He doubled down on the guilt of the Central Park Five despite their obvious innocence and pardoned Joe Arpaio,whose practices earned him comparisons to Bull Connor.Instead of addressing the grievances of his citizens, Trump is attempting to hijack their protest by propagandizing its purpose. He is not defending the flag or our armed forces. He’s pushing to silence figures like Kaepernick when their protests for police accountability and equality become popular by using veterans as political tools.Eric Reid called the accusation that kneeling protesters are anti-military a “false narrative.”In pushing this narrative, Trump revealed why this protest is necessary by ignoring the black veterans who fall under the umbrella of oppression our professional athletes are speaking out against. Kaepernick and the NFL haven’t dishonored any veterans, but Trump has dishonored our black veterans by pretending race doesn’t matter, just for the sake of silencing black protesters. If he’s serious about honoring those who sacrificed and died for our country, he should honor those who died because of our country too. Trump should support Kaepernick’s message if he expects the American people to believe he cares about the veterans who fought overseas, but became casualties of racial oppression in their own communities due to the same violence the NFL is protesting.Based on Trump’s track record of calling white supremacists “very fine people” and black protesters sons of bitches, holding your breath waiting for a change of heart is not advised."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59caacd61900004e5d565c37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Zooey Deschanel holds many charitable causes close to her heart and is vocal about the importance of gender equality. Now that she has two kids, she plans on passing down her passions to them.On Monday, the “New Girl” star teamed up with Baby2Baby and Huggies to help donate 2.5 million diapers to families in need. Deschanel has personally donated diapers, as well as clothes her 2-year-old daughter, Elsie Otter, and 4-month-old son, Charlie Wolf, have outgrown to Baby2Baby, but this was her first big event with the organization.“I was really excited because Huggies is donating about 3 million diapers to families in need, and that’s so huge,” Deschanel told HuffPost. “It helps to understand how crucial diapers are. It’s an absolute bottomline basic need, and you shouldn’t have to choose between diapers and food or diapers and clothes. It should be something that’s a given.”Deschanel is encouraging others to help, too, with the hashtag #DonateDiapers. Huggies will match every tweet this week with the hashtag with a day’s worth of diapers for a family that receives help from Baby2Baby.On the day of the event, HuffPost Parents spoke with Deschanel about her work with Baby2Baby, her new project about sustainable living, feminism and how she’s instilling important values in her two kids. How did you get involved with Baby2Baby?I actually sought them out because they do really amazing work. Since my daughter was born a few years ago, I’ve been donating diapers as she grows out of them or clothes that we don’t need anymore or baby gear. I just had observed how efficient they are and how many people they’re able to reach. You’ve always had many charitable causes close to your heart, including children’s charities. Now that you’re a mom, how are you teaching your kids to give back?It’s really important to teach your kids at a young age to volunteer and how to help raise money and raise awareness. I think raising awareness about issues is the most important thing, because not everyone has the time to volunteer or the funds to donate money, but if you are able to spread the word then the awareness really sparks a lot of the ability of these causes to attract attention and to fix some of the problems that are out there.You and your husband, producer Jacob Pechenik, have a new series called “Your Food’s Roots,” which keeps people in tune with the origins of their food and promotes sustainability. How have you incorporated these elements into your day to day as a mom?When I was pregnant with my daughter, I really wanted to give her the best chance possible to be healthy. Their brains are developing, and you want to eat all the right things. I realized that even though I was healthy and well-informed, how little even I know about my food. I didn’t see the farmers that were growing the food, and I didn’t know exactly where everything that I was eating came from. And I consider myself to be a healthy, well-informed person, so I realized if I was that way then probably a lot of people didn’t know where their food came from. We’re trying to help everybody get back in touch with their food.We’ve been growing a lot of stuff at our house in a vertical garden. We have an organic farm in Austin, Texas. We have been trying to eat more fish and cut back on meat, and when we do eat meat, we know where it comes from. Just being as aware as possible really helps.You have also been vocal about being a feminist. HuffPost Parents has a Facebook group and newsletter called “So You Want To Raise a Feminist” that highlights how parents can teach their kids about gender equality and gender stereotypes. How are you raising your kids as feminists?I think that the main thing is just not standing in their way. My daughter is only two, but she’s so strong and confident. I think it’s not letting those societal kind of pressures and those stereotypes affect them. Mainly I think it’s protecting her confidence, because she was born with it.I come from a family of pretty strong-willed women, and all the women in my husband’s family are amazing. I think we have a pretty good network for strong women, so that’s a start. I think it’s mainly encouraging kids to express themselves and speak out and be confident.What’s the best piece of advice you ever received about parenthood?Get the kids on a schedule. If they have regular naps and they don’t get too overtired they sleep so much better at night. And when you’re able to get sleep as a parent, you’re a better parent and a better human"

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the first Muslim elected to Congress, were to run into U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore on Capitol Hill, Ellison “would be happy to tell him why he’s wrong” about Islam and how his Islamophobic views conflict with the Constitution, Ellison told HuffPost on Wednesday.Moore, who was twice ousted as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and who won the GOP nomination on Tuesday for an open Senate seat to represent Alabama, called on Congress not to seat Ellison due to his Islamic faith when Ellison was first elected in 2006. In a December 2006 column, the hard-line social conservative jurist claimed that Muslims’ adherence to Sharia, or Islamic law, was incompatible with allegiance to the Constitution. Even if Moore wins in the general election, Ellison does not anticipate seeing him much on Capitol Hill.“The people in Congress who I deal with are usually people I’m working with ― Democrats or Republicans,” Ellison said. ”But I can’t imagine a scenario under which he and I are working together.”Should their paths cross, however, Ellison, a fellow attorney, would not shy away from speaking his mind.“He has to swear an oath to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says, ‘Congress shall make no law establishing religion, nor abridge the free exercise thereof,’” Ellison said, approximating the text of the First Amendment. “How then can he justify the anti-Islam stance he takes?”Ellison, who is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, noted the irony that Moore, a man twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court for failing to obey federal court orders on religious grounds, claimed that Muslims could not be trusted to respect the Constitution. In both cases, one in which a court required him to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments and another in which a court forced him to permit the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses, Moore asserted that Christian values took precedence over other constitutional considerations.“It’s like he’s engaging in psychological projection,” Ellison said. “He accuses Muslims of trying to push Sharia law and yet he’s the one trying to impose religion on other people, which is why he was ordered out of his seat.”“He was lawless! He wouldn’t obey the law,” he added.Ellison was aware of Moore’s comments about him before Tuesday’s election outcome, but Ellison said he has endured so much anti-Muslim bias that it no longer fazes him.“If I had a nickel for every time some mean, bigoted person said something mean, I’d have a lot of nickels,” he said.Moore soundly defeated Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) with a populist campaign that fed on anger toward the Republican establishment. His win was a major setback for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), both of whom campaigned for Strange. Then-Gov. Robert Bentley (R) appointed Strange to temporarily fill the open Alabama spot after Trump nominated Jeff Sessions, who held the seat, as his attorney general.In the meantime, Ellison is optimistic that Alabama voters will reject Moore’s reactionary politics in the Dec. 12 general election, when Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney.“There are plenty enough fair-minded Alabamians to defeat him in the general. People don’t like that intolerance,” Ellison said.Jones is a “great candidate” and a “civil rights hero,” according to Ellison.As a U.S. attorney, Jones successfully prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the deadly 1963 bombing of a black Birmingham church.“He couldn’t be better-suited for the moment,” Ellison concluded. “He is offering inclusion, human rights, civil rights for everyone, at a moment when the Republican candidate is trying to deny that.”"

Most of us will not understand what the House and Senate are doing. The political dynamics and complexity of changing the 30-year-old code will make health care reform look simple.We’ve heard the numbers. At around 75,000 pages and 2.4 million words, the tax code is twice the size of Encyclopedia Britannica and nearly 200 times longer than it was a century ago. According to the latest report from our National Taxpayer Advocate at the IRS, it takes individuals and businesses 6 billion hours every year to prepare and file their taxes.Congress will have the opportunity, but not necessarily the political will, to clean up the code by trimming away loopholes, unnecessary subsidies and obsolete provisions. We have entered a new century, a new economy, and a new set of urgent national priorities since the last comprehensive reform.If Congress makes its deliberations transparent, as it should, we will see a debate whose subject matter is more opaque than advanced calculus. So how will we know that the code doesn’t turn out to be another bundle of privileges for the privileged, designed to keep the same winners and losers in the economy?One approach is to identify the high-level goals we want tax reform to accomplish and to stay alert to whether Congress is addressing them. Closing the debilitating gaps in the economy should be at the top of the list. They include the opportunity gap, the income gap, the wealth gap and the skills gap.The Income Gap: Since the1970s, income inequality has grown in every state. Analysts are still citing a 2013 report from the Economic Policy Institute that the average annual income of the top 1% in the United States is $1.15 million, 25.3 times more than the income of the 99%. Between 2009 and 2013, the top 1% of earners captured more than 85% of income growth. GDP doubled over the last 30 years, but median household income grew only 16%.This year, the jobless rate has fallen but average Americans find that their wages are not keeping up. Analysts say the slow growth in national average wages is partly the result of highly paid Baby Boomers retiring and being replaced by lower-paid younger workers. The bottom line, however, is that the United States has the third highest level of income inequality among developed nations.The Wealth Gap: Many analysts consider the wealth gap to be more important than the income gap. Wealth is defined as a person’s or family’s total assets minus their debt and other liabilities. Wealth assets include things like home ownership, investments, retirement accounts and cash savings.Forbes reports that in 2015, the 400 richest Americans held as much wealth as 16 million African American households and 5 million Latino households.The income and wealth gaps are especially pronounced between urban and rural populations, a pattern known as “spatial inequality”. “Our country isn’t just divided by politics or class, it’s divided by where you live,” according to University of Toronto Prof. Richard Florida. “The advantaged urban parts of the country by the coast…they’re the blue areas, but the rest of America is increasingly red.”The backlash motivated by the wealth gap between urban and rural populations is widely cited as a significant factor in the election of Donald Trump.The Skills Gap: The skills gap results from rapid changes in the economy combined with a lack of applicable worker training. Industries, technologies and consumer preferences are evolving so quickly that the labor force cannot keep up. Even if good jobs are available, there may not be enough skilled workers to fill them.In the 1970s, nearly 20 million Americans worked in manufacturing, 22% of the workforce. While there has been an uptick recently, only 12.4 million Americans, or 8% of the workforce, have jobs in manufacturing now. The anomaly is that although manufacturing jobs have declined, manufacturing output in the United States is at an all-time high. One reason is that robots are replacing human workers.New ways to extract low-cost natural gas are leaving coal miners without work. Renewable energy technologies that were not competitive a few years ago are creating jobs 12 to 17 times faster than the rest of the economy today. Self-driving vehicles will leave truck, taxi and delivery drivers jobless. We can expect auto-making to shift increasingly to electric vehicles, requiring new skills and changing the demand for petroleum.In other words, new and better technologies may improve our lives, but they are disruptive. Workers may find that they have to change their skill sets several times during their careers. The nation’s policies, and perhaps the tax code, should support life-long education.The Investment Gap: Much of the capital spent by domestic businesses today, 80%, is used to replace old capital stock – for example, obsolete or worn out equipment. Only 20% goes to new investments. A similar imbalance is found in the nation’s infrastructure investments. Economist Timothy Taylor says this is a problem because it may lead to a slow-growth future for the United States.Another troublesome fact is that 500 of the biggest corporations based in the United States have parked $2.6 trillion offshore to avoid the taxes they would have to pay if they repatriated their foreign profits. That capital is more than enough to repair and modernize the nation’s aging and failing infrastructure while creating many new jobs over the next 10 years, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).If we do not make that investment, the ASCE says, the U.S. economy will lose nearly $4 trillion in GDP and 2.5 million jobs by 2025. Deteriorating infrastructure will cost each U.S. household $3,400 yearly in disposable income, the ASCE says. Repatriated capital could be used for other investments, too, since several other sources of revenue help pay for infrastructure.Right now, repatriated profits are taxed at 35%. Lobbyists and the Trump Administration are encouraging Congress to lower that rate. Congress should consider another option: No federal tax on the current stash of offshore profits when they are invested in critical job-creating national priorities. It is possible, if not likely, that the money put into stimulating the economy would result in greater benefits for the American people than money given to the government. The government would eventually benefit anyway from higher tax revenues resulting from the stimulus.Future offshore profits could be taxed at a lower rate when they are repatriated, such as the 10 percent rate the Trump administration has proposed.Congress should also consider motivating U.S. investors to liberate the $70 trillion in cash they have kept on the sidelines because of low investment returns. That’s nearly 10 times the $787 billion stimulus package Congress approved in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help end the Great Recession.If we close the income, wealth and skills gap, we will go a long way toward closing the opportunity gap that is keeping many Americans from reaching their full potential.There are many more ways that tax code reform can help us capture the opportunities of the 21st century while ending problems caused by the current code. With the help of some friends in the investment business, I’ll offer a few additional suggestions in an upcoming post."

I don’t entirely relish writing one, either. So fair warning: We’re going “there.” But maybe, just maybe, we may feel a bit better afterward.Whether you were Berning for Bernie or With Her in 2016, by this stage, you likely feel a particular kind of queasy dread when you come across an article, a TV interview or a Facebook post that reheats the over-salted emotional stew that sometimes boiled over during the Democratic primaries. In most quarters, it slowly cooled once the primaries ended, though the flame got turned up high again when Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election to the most unpopular candidate in American history. Following Donald Trump’s inauguration, the daily outrages that have been his presidency’s hallmarks have inspired many Democrats, Democratic Socialists, progressives and independents to put aside their differences and link arms in resistance.Then, all in one week, Hillary Clinton released her post-election memoir, What Happened, and Bernie Sanders launched his Medicare for All bill. With both of them front and center on the national stage again, the rancor and finger-pointing between their two camps are back with a vengeance. Those who were long suspicious of her point to Clinton’s book as evidence that she’s an out-of-touch elitist, a policy wonk devoid of big ideas. And those who’ve been dismissive of him think that Brother Bernie is off on another doomed quixotic quest, one that emboldens Republicans by evoking a whiff of socialism—which, to most noses in the U.S. Congress, stinks like a fart.Because of the aforementioned queasy dread, I initially tried to avoid anything that re-ignited the Hillary vs. Bernie wars. But it was like trying to avoid looking at disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner’s infamous “Carlos Danger” crotch shots: You know it will do you no good, but seemingly everyone else is doing it—and like Weiner, they keep waving their provocations in your face.As a Bernie sis who wound up not only voting for Her, but making canvassing calls once Clinton was the only candidate standing between us and Trump, I kept hearing Bernie’s exasperated “What the hell difference does it make now?” refrain in my head whenever somebody tried to get a Hillary-Bernie squabble started. I was mostly able to avoid the melee—until the media started devoting about 80 percent of its attention to Clinton’s What Happened.Some of what Clinton says in that book jibes with my own perception of the campaign. Sexism is alive and thriving in America today, and women like Clinton who have the temerity to be powerful, outspoken, and no longer young are basically walking around with bull’s-eyes on their backs. The man who went on to become America’s misogynist in chief, Donald Trump, was indeed personally menacing to Clinton during the presidential campaign, especially during that bizarre second debate, when he loomed right behind her like a gilded golem as she rather heroically kept her cool and continued making cogent points.And FBI Director Comey’s decisions and timing in talking about what my man Bernie termed Clinton’s “damn emails” were hard to fathom—and unquestionably hurtful to her presidential ambitions. Especially Comey’s decision to repeatedly address the topic of those “damn emails” while staying pretty mum on the far more consequential topic of what the intelligence community knew to be Russian meddling in the election. It would have been nice to know a good bit more about that before we cast our ballots. Especially when many of us were fighting over fake news planted by trolls, bots, and the other weapons in what we can now see as Russia’s undeniably successful cyberwarfare.Watching Clinton on The Rachel Maddow Show as part of the What Happened book tour last week—and listening to her astute and withering assessment of Donald Trump’s potentially world-smashing flailing—I felt, as any sentient being must, that America would be far better off with Clinton as president. And as an individual who has dedicated most of her life to public service and knows better than most how the U.S. government works, Clinton has every right to speak out. Not only that, but we should listen, since some of what she has to say is important and instructive.Certainly, she has Trump’s number. We see that now, in her full-throated denunciation of Trump’s conduct since he “showed up” in the White House, as basketball legend LeBron James phrased it so delightfully in a recent tweet. And Clinton delivers her indictments of the current president with a coherence that make some of us want to weep with longing for the past (President Barack Obama) and for what might have been (President Hillary Clinton).Looking at things from a post-Charlottesville vantage point (I shudder to think how much darker things may become), it’s painfully clear that Clinton’s was one of the most articulate and impassioned voices sounding the alarm about Trump’s authoritarian, xenophobic, and white-supremacist tendencies during the 2016 campaign. It’s not that we didn’t believe her. But too many Americans—myself included—looked at Trump and thought, “Eh… never gonna happen. So no need to sweat it.”Chardonnay and Rotten GrapesThat’s the good stuff I have to say about Clinton and her book. Now onto the stuff that might get me kicked out of Facebook’s Pantsuit Nation group. (Which, yes, I joined the autumn before the election.)For starters, considerable swaths of What Happened sound canned, tone deaf, and overworked—perhaps unsurprising in a supposed cry from the heart that was produced in collaboration with two speechwriters and a researcher. For instance, Clinton’s talk of consoling herself post-election with chardonnay and alternate-nostril breathing probably won’t do much to endear her to Rust Belt voters.Other parts of the book are downright infuriating. Take her claim that Sanders’ criticisms of her during the primaries did lasting damage. It seems inconceivable that a political animal like Clinton has forgotten how primaries work, but maybe she needs reminding that they involve politicians running against one another. To do that, they draw distinctions and yes, take some shots at opponents. Clinton and Obama certainly did that when they squared off in 2008. And they did so with more vehemence than Sanders ever directed at Clinton.The charges that Sanders didn’t campaign hard enough for her—and that his bitter supporters handed victory to Trump—are even more galling. They’re so easily disprovable; they’re more worthy of Trump than Clinton.Here are the facts: Polls indicate that about 12 percent of Sanders supporters went for Trump in 2016. About 25 percent of Clinton supporters voted for John McCain in 2008. That’s more than double the number of Sanders supporters who cast ballots for Trump last year.Dream a Little Dream for MePart of Clinton’s problem is that, fastidious wonk that she is; she revels in number crunching, policy analysis, and market research. Those are all components of crafting good policy and successful campaigns; but they’re methodologies better suited to understanding what is, not what can be.Which brings me to the thing that vexes me most about Clinton’s memoir—a flaw that would have undermined her presidency as well. It’s also the flaw that will doom the Democratic Party if it doesn’t learn one basic lesson: Voters like big ideas.Clinton dismisses Sanders’ dogged calls for Medicare for all, free tuition at public colleges, and a $15 an hour minimum wage as pie in the sky. Which they are—if we don’t advocate and fight for them, if we look at the status quo and think that’s all that can ever be. In What Happened, Clinton writes, “I’ve always believed that it’s dangerous to make big promises if you have no idea how you’re going to keep them. When you don’t deliver, it will make people even more cynical about government.”I’d argue precisely the opposite: If you want to make people even more cynical about government, keep talking about “solutions” that are simply variations on the unworkable, compromised, and often downright corrupt policies we have today.Since everyone’s talking in sports metaphors thanks to Trump’s war on athletes who express opinions, I’ll offer this suggestion on the way to revive the Democratic Party: Go big or go home.When Democrats first proposed the programs that are now the bedrock of U.S. civil society—Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the Voting Rights Act—those programs were attacked as not only socialist and possibly communist, but positively un-American. As leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Martin Luther King did in the past, today’s progressive leaders must shrug off those charges and keep their eye on the prize.Trump gives populism a bad name, but the kind of principled populism Sanders espouses is the way forward. What Happened during the 2016 election is complex, and it’s isn’t easy to point to a single factor. But I’ll say it again: If we don’t want it to happen again, the Democratic Party needs to go big or go home.Previously published as ‘Democrats: Go Big or Go Home’ in Maria’s SPOTLIGHT column at The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays:Why Jesus Would Want Us To Speak Out Against Prejudice by Reverend Rachel KesslerThe Lessons My Family Have Learned From the Past by Annie Mark-WestfallHow My Mother Saved Summer by Irena Ioannou"

Jerry Brown (D) signed a bill Wednesday moving the state’s presidential primary from June to March, a change geared toward increasing the influence of the nation’s most populous state in selecting presidential nominees.Senate Bill 568, the “Prime Time Primary” bill, written by state Sen. Richard Lara (D-Bell Gardens), would move presidential and statewide primary elections to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March, on what is typically known as Super Tuesday, when many other states also hold nominating contests. California had held its primary on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June. The new schedule will go into effect in 2019, setting California up to be one of the first states in the nation to cast ballots in the 2020 race.Lara and other proponents of the bill hope that by moving the race to primary season’s “prime time,” Californians will have more say in the process. They’ve cited the 2016 primary, when both the Democratic and Republican nominations were all but formally locked up by the time California voted, as an example of why the change would benefit the state’s voters.“Moving California’s presidential primary to March from June means candidates in both parties can’t treat immigration, climate change, criminal justice reform and investing in jobs and innovation like afterthoughts, as they did too often in 2016,” Lara said in a statement after the bill passed the state Assembly. “The prime-time primary will lift up the voices of Californians on issues where we are leading the nation if not the world.”California is an overwhelmingly Democratic state ― roughly 45 percent of state voters are registered as Democrats, versus 26 percent as Republicans. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton received 61.5 percent of the state’s votes to 31.5 percent for Donald Trump.The bill’s proponents also argued that moving the primary up will engage more voters and increase turnout. They’ve pointed to 2008 — when California moved its primary to February and saw the highest turnout since 1980 — as an example of how an earlier election could increase interest. (California’s Legislature moved the primary back to June in 2011.)“Too often California is relegated to serving as a political ATM for presidential candidates,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D), a sponsor of the bill, said in September. “Moving up California’s primary will strengthen the voice of California voters in the presidential nominating process.”"

Many of his best known songs, including “Oh What a World” and his 2001 cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” are defined by their lush, theatrical qualities ― making them ideal, performers say, for a cabaret-style interpretation.Many of the “54 Sings Rufus Wainwright” performers cited the singer-songwriter’s willingness to challenge musical and social boundaries as a personal influence. “As an out queer performer, I’ve always looked up to Rufus ― one of the first out musicians I was aware of,” Mientus, who was recently seen on “The Flash,” told HuffPost. “I’d define him more by his artistry than his sexuality, but both speak to me and my experience, so I am doubly honored to sing one of his great tunes with this amazing group of people.”Taylor, who is gearing up to return to Broadway this fall in the musical adaptation of “SpongeBob SquarePants,” echoed those sentiments.“When I was a freshman in college, I came out of the closet and was embraced by a sort of gay fraternity of new friends. I was introduced to books and films and music that blew my mind,” he said. Citing 2003′s “Want One” and 2004′s “Want Two” as two of his favorite Wainwright albums, he added, “I know almost every word of every song in his canon.” Many of Wainwright’s tunes have taken on new resonance in America’s divided political climate, too. Singer-actor Dave Thomas Brown, who appeared on Broadway in 2016′s “American Psycho,” told HuffPost he’ll be performing “Going to a Town” from Wainwright’s 2007 album, “Release the Stars,” because it “really does say musically how I’m feeling about the world right now, in a way I haven’t really been able to put into my own words yet.”No doubt Wainwright’s devoted, cult-like legions of fans would agree. “54 Sings Rufus Wainwright” plays New York’s Feinstein’s/54 Below on Sunday, Oct. 1.

Though Buckley covered the song in 1994, it was originally performed by Leonard Cohen. "

Singer-actor Dave Thomas Brown, who appeared on Broadway in 2016′s “American Psycho,” told HuffPost he’ll be performing “Going to a Town” from Wainwright’s 2007 album, “Release the Stars,” because it “really does say musically how I’m feeling about the world right now, in a way I haven’t really been able to put into my own words yet.”No doubt Wainwright’s devoted, cult-like legions of fans would agree. “54 Sings Rufus Wainwright” plays New York’s Feinstein’s/54 Below on Sunday, Oct. 1.

Though Buckley covered the song in 1994, it was originally performed by Leonard Cohen. "

The agency is already facing a backlog of asylum requests, Politico reported, and would therefore have a hard time handling 50,000 people. Senior officials noted on the call Wednesday that some of the refugee resettlement program’s resources need to be devoted to this backlog going forward.A group of top administration members led by Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior policy adviser, allegedly wanted to see a quota no higher than 15,000, according to The New York Times.Trump has signed two executive orders establishing a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries.

The killer took off in a white convertible, but not before the victim’s son, Joseph Aherns, who was then in his early 20s, caught a glimpse of the suspect’s brown eyes.Aherns, reached by West Palm Beach station WPBF on Wednesday, expressed relief upon hearing news of Sheila’s arrest.“It was a big shock.

A Publix store’s clerk described a woman with long brown hair, similar to Sheila’s, having purchased the balloons less than an hour before the shooting.Employees at a costume store also tentatively identified Sheila as the woman who purchased clown paraphernalia two days before the murder.The white convertible driven by the clown, which was later found abandoned, was eventually linked to the car dealership Michael and Marlene operated. A search of the vehicle by detectives recovered orange fibers, possibly belonging to the clown wig.

She was a senior engineer in the Outer Planet and Navigation Section until 1981.Morabito, author of Parallel Universes, a Memoir from the Edges of Space and Time, and associate professor of Astronomy at Victor Valley College, discovered in 1979 that the moon of Jupiter moon called Io was geologically alive.For her work in space exploration and discovering the volcanic plume emanating from an active volcano on Io (considered by some planetary scientists as the largest discovery of the planetary exploration program), she was awarded three NASA Group Achievement Awards, for Voyager Flight Operations, Navigation Team; Voyager Mission Operations System Design, Ground Data Systems Development; Voyager Mission Design, Ephemeris Development and NASA’s Certificate of Appreciation.In the decades since both of these space pioneers launched their careers, much has changed, but much more needs to be done for women in science and in all STEM fields.NASA astronaut and biochemist Peggy Whitson recently broke the record for the longest time spent in space for any American man or woman—more than nine months.“Astronaut Peggy Whitson touched down in Kazakhstan alongside a fellow American and a Russian in their Soyuz capsule, wrapping up a record-breaking mission. Whitson spent 288 on this latest mission aboard the International Space Station. But over the course of her career, she has been away from earth for three long-duration missions, an accumulation of 665 days — longer than any American ever and more time than any woman worldwide,” according to NPR.Called an “American space ninja” by her Russian colleague aboard the spacecraft, Ahy Held write sin NPR about Whitson, “The Iowa native began working for NASA in 1989. She started astronaut training in 1996 and first docked with the ISS in 2002. By 2008, she was serving as the station commander — the first woman to do so, according to her NASA bio.”In that time, “attitudes have changed as well,” towards women in space and science, says Bagenal, who also participated in NASA’s Gallileo, Deep Space I as well as Voyagers missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.“MIT was very proactive,” Bagenal says, “and has been graduating 30 to 40 percent of women in programs for many decades.” She adds, “What worries me are the ups and downs. The percentage of women getting physics degrees was up to 35 percent,” she says, and had been for the past 13 years. Those numbers are now down to 22-25 percent of women earning physics degrees in the U.S.“As these programs are getting larger, more are attracting guys than women. Smaller schools are keeping a large fraction of women, but at large programs they are alienating women and the fraction of women is decreasing,” Bagenal says. “We need to find out why.”Bagenal has been concerned with this pipeline issue for years, as she spells out in her 2004 presentation, “Leaky Pipeline of Women in Physics and Astronomy,” and her work for Women in Astronomy.As a mentor to women in physics and astronomy, Bagenal says she has simple advice. “Follow your passion. Also make sure you get good grades in math and physics to keep your options open.”At the undergraduate and graduate levels, Bagenal says too often women “try to do everything” and get involved in too many clubs or activities and take too many courses so their grades suffer.Physics courses are particularly difficult after the first year and it is difficult with the instructor often just lecturing and offering no social support system of study groups. “Women need to work together and need support,” she says. A system of mentorship of senior level students and sophomores can help with this, she says.What also helps women in science and all STEM are public events and activities that bring science into the popular culture and prove that “science is not only in a closed up lab.” The PBS documentary, “The Farthest” succeeds in that mission of showing the “humanity and the people involved,” she says.Begenal, who is featured in the film along with Morabito, says, “The directors worked hard at having us all express our feelings about doing the science. But it is a disproportionate representation of women in the field” in the documentary, she says. There are not as many prominent women in the field as the documentary shows.“I do blame Hollywood for showing only weird white guys as scientists,” Begenal says, even though the recent film, “Hidden Figures,” helped to bust the myths and show the importance of black female computers in the early days of space exploration.Of course, compounding the myth that women are not leading in science or should be, are outbursts such as James Damore’s anti-diversity memo circulated at Google and far beyond earlier this summer, that also echoed the 2005 proclamations by then-president of Harvard University Lawrence Summers questioning the biological aptitude of women in math and science.“I blame TV, movies, fashion and magazines, all that push gendered” notions of what women are capable of, Begenal says.But working with young girls and women to get them interested in the possibilities of a career in science is worth the effort, she says. Many programs and inititatives around the country aim at brining girls and women into the STEM fields.A new effort to interest students in elementary, middle and high school, as well as college level is the iFLY STEM education curriculum, that promotes field trip opportunities customized by teachers and STEM educators at iFLY tunnel nationwide, according to the company release. More than 60,000 students from 3,000 schools across the country have participated.Aimed to encourage young girls and women, “The program uses iFLY’s state-of-the-art vertical wind tunnel to inspire and educate students about STEM.

27,WORLD NEWS,Saudi Arabia Lifts Ban On Women Driving,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-lifts-ban-on-women-driving_us_59caa485e4b0964242bbc7c3,"""I'm full of hope and optimism and joy and very proud today to be a Saudi woman,"" one student told HuffPost.",2017-09-26,"Azza Al Shmasani alights from her car after driving in defiance of the ban in Riyadh on June 22, 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59caa6ab1a00002850f08a62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Saudi Arabia is lifting its ban on women driving, officials said Tuesday, prompting applause from progressive Saudis, especially women who have battled the policy for years, and international commentators.The royal decree from King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud was announced almost simultaneously in Saudi Arabia, via state television, and in the capital of its most important partner, the United States, by the king’s son and ambassador, Prince Khalid bin Salman ― a reflection of the Saudis’ desire to improve their image abroad.A statement from the state-run press agency spread the news online, saying women can begin applying for licenses just like men. They will be officially allowed to drive starting next June.The driving policy was the best-known aspect of the conservative Muslim kingdom’s broad restrictions on women’s rights, which include requiring women to secure a male family member’s approval for actions such as working and traveling. Saudi women will not need such approval before applying for a license, Prince Khalid told reporters. “I’m just trying to hold back the tears,” Sara Althari, a 26-year-old Saudi completing a doctorate at Oxford University, told HuffPost. “It’s been a long time coming. ... I’m full of hope and optimism and joy and very proud today to be a Saudi woman.”Female activists in the kingdom had been challenging the ban with increasing fervor, including by staging demonstrations that sent some to jail and others to face threats. Manal al-Sharif, who was arrested in 2011 after publicizing footage of herself driving, said activists have the entire system of male “guardianship” in their sights next. Although the policy change came from a king who seems open to liberalizing Saudi society in some ways, Middle East watchers emphasized that the efforts of Saudi women were responsible for turning the issue into a priority that decision-makers had to deal with. Analysts have noted that the ban was a problem for the Saudis in the U.S. and other liberal societies that the kingdom counts as essential friends. “I’ve said this to the Saudis many times: You really want to improve your image? There’s one simple thing to do: Let women drive cars,” former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel told HuffPost last year. “I understand that’s easier said than done.”Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old heir who is expected to take over from his elderly father in a matter of months, has invested heavily in trying to change perceptions of Saudi Arabia abroad, as well as pushing to modernize society at home. This reform is seen as one he has been lobbying for behind the scenes for months.But it’s still a controversial step, given the power that hardline clerics and ultra-conservative interpretations of Islam have long held in a kingdom shaped by the relationship between the royal family and key religious leaders.It’s unlikely that scholars opposed to gender equality or their followers will stage public protests against the king’s decision, not least because the kingdom recently arrested some 20 prominent critics of the government, said Andrew Bowen, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. But there is a risk of growing polarization between Saudis in urban areas who support progress and those in less developed provinces, as well as fresh enthusiasm for armed militancy against the Saudi government from groups like the Islamic State.The eventual popularity of Crown Prince Muhammed’s reform agenda also depends on the success of his economic proposals to improve young Saudis’ job prospects and make the country less reliant on oil revenue, Bowen said. Some Middle East experts have cast doubt on the feasibility of the prince’s plans, which recently had to be rejiggered.Saudi Arabia also appears to be backsliding in other areas, leading some analysts to suggest the step forward for women was in part a public relations ploy. The arrest this month of those noted critics ― from human rights activists to clerics ― sent a message about the limits of free speech. Prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, writing in The Washington Post, revealed that he had gone into self-exile.“In the starkest terms, Saudi Arabia is trying to moderate the extreme viewpoints of both liberal reformers and conservative clerics. And the arrests span that spectrum,” Khashoggi wrote. “Regardless of who is being targeted, this is not what Saudi Arabia needs right now. We are going through a major economic transformation that is supported by the people, a transformation that will free us from total dependence on oil and restore a culture of work and production. This is a very painful process. [Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman is best served by encouraging constructive, diverse opinions.”Meanwhile, the Saudi military continues to pummel neighboring Yemen, hitting civilians, blocking proposals for independent investigation of alleged war crimes and slowing aid deliveries in a brutal war that U.S. lawmakers have increasingly condemned. And the government is boycotting neighbor Qatar, another important Arab partner of the West.Still, Tuesday’s announcement seemed to suggest an upward trajectory and many Saudis are keen to celebrate.“Headlines from Western media outlets are trying to downplay the magnitude of the moment by focusing on technicalities and logistics. ... Cut us some slack and join the party at least for once,” Althari said.Slow, steady progress in Saudi Arabia has made a difference for her family, she noted. In 2013, then-King Abdullah appointed her mother, cancer research scientist Khawla Al Kuraya, as one of the first women to sit on his advisory Shura Council.Althari credits Crown Prince Muhammed for his role in lifting the driving ban and plans to return to the kingdom after earning a Ph.D. in genetics to work for more positive change. That’s something she believes most young people ― who constitute the majority in Saudi Arabia ― want to see.“Over 50 percent of university graduates are women in the kingdom, and there are tens of thousands of university students sponsored abroad, many of whom are women. If we come back and use our degrees, be part of the workforce and energize each other, we will eventually see the outcomes that we hope to achieve,” Althari said. “It is an opportune time to go back as a Saudi woman.”"

Just hours later, though, he discovered the absolute opposite was true. ArcelorMittal announced that, within a year, it would idle the mill that stretches half a mile along the Schuylkill River. Company officials broke the bad news to Kameen, president of the United Steelworkers (USW) local union at Conshohocken, and Ron Davis, the grievance chair, at a meeting where the two union officers had hoped to hear about hiring.ArcelorMittal wouldn’t say when it would begin the layoffs or how many workers would lose their jobs or which mill departments would go dark. The worst part for everyone now is the uncertainty, Kameen told me last week.“If ArcelorMittal said they would shut down on a date certain, everybody could move on to something else or prepare. Right now, we are in limbo. We have a lot of guys with a lot of time, but they’re still not old enough to retire. The only thing we can do is ride it out. But the uncertainty is very, very hard on them. It’s difficult not knowing who and what departments are affected and how long we are going to run,” Kameen said.Uncertainty from Washington, D.C., is a major contributor to the idling of the plant. ArcelorMittal and every other aluminum and steel producer in America are in limbo as they wait for a decision on import restrictions that could preserve U.S. capacity to produce defense materials – like the light armored plate that’s Conshohocken’s specialty ­– and to build and repair crucial infrastructure, like roads, bridges and utilities.Initially, the Trump administration promised a determination in June. But June came and went. As the months dragged on, imports surged. That threatens the viability of mills like Conshohocken. Then, just last week, administration officials said they would do nothing until after Congress passes tax legislation. That compounded uncertainty. The Conshohocken mill may not survive the delay. Kameen, Ron and the 203 other workers there could lose their jobs because Congress dawdles or fails to act on taxes. America could lose its domestic capacity to quickly produce large quantities of high-quality light-gauge plate for armor. After work at other, non-union jobs, Kameen began at Conshohocken at the age of 25. He finally had a position that provided good wages and benefits. “That gave me an opportunity to plan for a future and build a family,” he explained.Ron, the mill’s training coordinator, is 45 and has worked at the plant for 22 years. “This was my first true job that I could sustain a family with,” Ron told me. He has five children ranging in age from five to 26. He needs a good job with good benefits. He knows jobs like the one he has at the mill are rare, but he’s not giving in to gloominess. “I am just trying to stay positive,” he said. “That is all I can do right now.”Both Ron and Kameen are frustrated by the Trump administration’s failure to penalize the foreign producers whose illegal trade practices have killed steel and aluminum jobs, closed mills across the country and threatened America’s domestic capability to produce metals essential to construction of critical infrastructure and vital to the defense department to safeguard the country.Since the Trump administration launched the national security probes into steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act in April, imports have risen significantly. Steel imports are up 21 percent over last year. Countries like China, fearing impending penalties for predatory and illegal trade practices, dumped more than ever. The administration has nine months to complete the Section 232 investigation. It could be January before the results are announced. Then the president has another three months to decide what to do. Instead of the two months the administration initially promised, the whole process could take a year. A year could be too long for mills like Conshohocken.“It doesn’t take that long to investigate this,” Kameen said. “We are losing jobs. They are dropping like flies. The administration needs to act now to prevent these unfair imports from killing more American jobs.”Because of unfair and illegal imports since 2000, particularly from China, U.S. steel mills idled sections or closed, cutting the nation’s capacity to produce by 17 million tons a year and throwing 48,000 steelworkers out of jobs. Now, there is only one surviving U.S. mill capable of producing grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) required for electrical transmission.The same decline occurred in aluminum, only it happened even faster. The number of U.S. smelters dropped from 14 in 2011 to five last year. That is the loss of thousands more good, family-supporting jobs. It happened because China expanded its overcapacity to produce cheap, state-subsidized aluminum, depressing the global price by 46 percent in just eight years. Now, there is only one surviving U.S. smelter capable of producing the high-purity aluminum essential to fighter jets like the F-35 and other military vehicles.While ArcelorMittal may contend that it can manufacture military-grade steel plate at its other U.S. mills, the loss of Conshohocken would mean a dangerous decline in U.S. capacity. Capacity is crucial in emergencies. An example occurred in 2007 when U.S. military deaths were rising in Iraq and Afghanistan. In response, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ordered a 15-fold increase in production of mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles. That meant the number produced each month had to rise from 82 to more than 1,100. The Conshohocken plant produced much of the steel needed to achieve the goal. Without that mill, the nation’s ability to gear up in such an emergency is compromised. Two weeks ago, 10 retired generals wrote President Trump warning: “America’s increasing reliance on imported steel and aluminum from potentially hostile or uncooperative foreign governments, or via uncertain supply routes, jeopardizes our national security.”They also said of the Section 232 investigation, “Prompt action is necessary before it is too late.”When Kameen started at the mill 11 years ago, he felt good about the work. Conshohocken was making a lot of armor for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that gave him the sense that he was doing something for his country. Now, he’s concerned for his local union members, whose average age is 50.As their president, Kameen, who is only 37, feels responsible to help each of them through the uncertainty and the difficulties ahead. “My members are looking at me for answers and leadership,” he told me. “So if I don’t stay strong and lead, then I’m the wrong man for the job.”Every steelworker and aluminum worker in America is looking to President Trump for that kind of leadership. Their uncertainty could be relieved if the administration would announce the results of the Section 232 investigation now and act immediately to ensure the United States has the domestic ability to produce essential metals.

30,TASTE,Cooking Off The Cuff: The Early-Autumn Market Yields Something Resembling A Chinese Dinner,"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-the-early-autumn-market-yields_us_59ca4e50e4b0b7022a646daf,At our farmers’ market last week Jackie and I saw peppers at the height of their perfumed ripeness and eggplants/aubergines,2017-09-26,"<p>For this eggplant dish, the first thing to be cooked is ripe red peppers</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ca4ee01a00004500f088e7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At our farmers’ market last week Jackie and I saw peppers at the height of their perfumed ripeness and eggplants/aubergines just starting to get a little seedy but still sound and flavorful. These could have been the foundation for a fine Mediterranean dish, but one grower was selling young, juicy ginger. Not much ginger is grown near New York, and it is always a surprise to see it. We bought some, and that pushed our dinner in a more Asian direction. As I said last time, I feel safer qualifying my Asian-style cooking as “faux,” and this time it was to be faux-Chinese, because Chinese eggplant dishes are among our favorites. And what might be our favorite of favorites comes from the late Barbara Tropp’s China Moon Cookbook: Dry-fried Chinese eggplant nuggets. It is a balanced, zippy dish, with sweetness and tartness in just the right equilibrium.But I took the basic idea and flavors beyond the borders of the Middle Kingdom: I brought in another vegetable (those beautiful peppers) and some meat (ground pork) to make this a dish that, with rice, would stand on its own; and I used lots and lots of ginger because I was so tickled by the idea of it having been locally grown. The result was almost over the top, but it was delicious and worth sharing.For three main-dish portions, I first prepared the sauce that would be used at the very end of cooking. This was almost pure Barbara Tropp, apart from my use of sherry vinegar: she specifies balsamic (of the mass produced kind), which is better than the Chinese vinegars that are available where I shop. And sherry vinegar is even better. I stirred together 3 tablespoons each of good soy sauce and brown sugar; 1-1/2 tablespoons of sherry vinegar (or you can use everyday balsamic); a teaspoonful of toasted-sesame oil and 2 or 3 tablespoonsful of hot water. Set this sauce mixture aside. I also made an aromatic mixture that would start the main part of the cooking: 4 tablespoons of finely chopped ginger; two tablespoons of finely chopped garlic; the white and some of the green of a small bunch of scallions (spring onions), cut fairly fine – there should be a heaping half cup (120 ml by volume); one tablespoon Chinese chili sauce – I used the kind with fermented beans, but see what you have in the fridge; and a half tablespoon of fish sauce (I used Japanese ishiri, but any fermented fish sauce will add the desired flavor – you might even try a squirt of anchovy paste, or you could omit this ingredient). I set this aside too.With these two foundation elements ready, I cored two medium-size sweet peppers and cut them into 3/4-inch (2 cm) lozenges – dice, but cut on the bias. Dice would be fine too, or half-inch strips. I fried them in a scant tablespoonful of peanut oil (a neutral oil would be fine) over medium-high heat, along with a couple of teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger, until nearly done. Depending on the peppers and the heat, this could take two minutes or three. I set them aside. (This and the next step could be done in advance.)Next, I stir-fried about half of the reserved aromatic mixture in a tablespoon of oil over medium heat, just until it was fragrant. Then I added half a pound (225 g) of ground (or hand-chopped if you have the energy) pork, and fried it until cooked through and no longer pink, breaking it up with a wooden spatula as it progressed. I transferred this to a bowl and set it aside.I now moved on to the main ingredient: about a pound (450 g) of long rather than bulbous eggplants. These could be the small “Japanese” variety or longer ones like those in the accompanying photo – or it could be tiny ones, such as Fairy Tale eggplants, which you’d merely cut in half. The problem with big, round varieties is that they are hard to cut it into chunks all of which have some skin – and the skin provides some of the texture you want.To form chunks, I “roll cut” the eggplant (which will work only on elongated varieties): this entails making a diagonal (ca. 45º) cut, then rolling the eggplant a quarter turn (90º) and making another diagonal cut and continuing to roll and cut until done. There are YouTube movies illustrating this.As with the meat, I stir-fried the remainder of the aromatics in oil until fragrant, then added the eggplant and cooked it over medium heat until tender but not reduced to a mush, adding oil when it began to look a trifle too dry. This took 10 or 11 minutes, but “Japanese” or Fairy Tale eggplants will take a little less time. You may wish to cover the pan for a couple of minutes during the cooking time; this will help with even cooking.Nearly done. Over medium heat, add the cooked pork and stir well to combine; half a minute later stir in the peppers, and when warmed through add the sauce mixture. Reduce it slightly to form a glazy but still liquid sauce, probably no more than half a minute. Finish with a big handful of cilantro/coriander (optional for those who hate it) and another of chopped scallion greens.Serve with lots and lots of plain rice. So much flavor: spicy from the chili sauce but also from the large amount of ginger; a well rounded sweetness from brown sugar; sourness from the vinegar; savoriness from the meat – and pure, juicy joy from those delicious peppers and eggplants.As part of a less faux Chinese meal – one comprising other dishes as well – this would serve six people easily; eaten as the sole dish, the three of us were happily full by the time we’d finished it."

32,TASTE,Cooking Off The Cuff: The Early-Autumn Market Yields Something Resembling A Chinese Dinner,"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-the-early-autumn-market-yields_us_59ca4e50e4b0b7022a646daf,At our farmers’ market last week Jackie and I saw peppers at the height of their perfumed ripeness and eggplants/aubergines,2017-09-26,<p>Cut the peppers into lozenges: think of dice on the diagonal</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ca4f591d00002a00e72e1a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At our farmers’ market last week Jackie and I saw peppers at the height of their perfumed ripeness and eggplants/aubergines just starting to get a little seedy but still sound and flavorful. These could have been the foundation for a fine Mediterranean dish, but one grower was selling young, juicy ginger. Not much ginger is grown near New York, and it is always a surprise to see it. We bought some, and that pushed our dinner in a more Asian direction. As I said last time, I feel safer qualifying my Asian-style cooking as “faux,” and this time it was to be faux-Chinese, because Chinese eggplant dishes are among our favorites. And what might be our favorite of favorites comes from the late Barbara Tropp’s China Moon Cookbook: Dry-fried Chinese eggplant nuggets. It is a balanced, zippy dish, with sweetness and tartness in just the right equilibrium.But I took the basic idea and flavors beyond the borders of the Middle Kingdom: I brought in another vegetable (those beautiful peppers) and some meat (ground pork) to make this a dish that, with rice, would stand on its own; and I used lots and lots of ginger because I was so tickled by the idea of it having been locally grown. The result was almost over the top, but it was delicious and worth sharing.For three main-dish portions, I first prepared the sauce that would be used at the very end of cooking. This was almost pure Barbara Tropp, apart from my use of sherry vinegar: she specifies balsamic (of the mass produced kind), which is better than the Chinese vinegars that are available where I shop. And sherry vinegar is even better. I stirred together 3 tablespoons each of good soy sauce and brown sugar; 1-1/2 tablespoons of sherry vinegar (or you can use everyday balsamic); a teaspoonful of toasted-sesame oil and 2 or 3 tablespoonsful of hot water. Set this sauce mixture aside. I also made an aromatic mixture that would start the main part of the cooking: 4 tablespoons of finely chopped ginger; two tablespoons of finely chopped garlic; the white and some of the green of a small bunch of scallions (spring onions), cut fairly fine – there should be a heaping half cup (120 ml by volume); one tablespoon Chinese chili sauce – I used the kind with fermented beans, but see what you have in the fridge; and a half tablespoon of fish sauce (I used Japanese ishiri, but any fermented fish sauce will add the desired flavor – you might even try a squirt of anchovy paste, or you could omit this ingredient). I set this aside too.With these two foundation elements ready, I cored two medium-size sweet peppers and cut them into 3/4-inch (2 cm) lozenges – dice, but cut on the bias. Dice would be fine too, or half-inch strips. I fried them in a scant tablespoonful of peanut oil (a neutral oil would be fine) over medium-high heat, along with a couple of teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger, until nearly done. Depending on the peppers and the heat, this could take two minutes or three. I set them aside. (This and the next step could be done in advance.)Next, I stir-fried about half of the reserved aromatic mixture in a tablespoon of oil over medium heat, just until it was fragrant. Then I added half a pound (225 g) of ground (or hand-chopped if you have the energy) pork, and fried it until cooked through and no longer pink, breaking it up with a wooden spatula as it progressed. I transferred this to a bowl and set it aside.I now moved on to the main ingredient: about a pound (450 g) of long rather than bulbous eggplants. These could be the small “Japanese” variety or longer ones like those in the accompanying photo – or it could be tiny ones, such as Fairy Tale eggplants, which you’d merely cut in half. The problem with big, round varieties is that they are hard to cut it into chunks all of which have some skin – and the skin provides some of the texture you want.To form chunks, I “roll cut” the eggplant (which will work only on elongated varieties): this entails making a diagonal (ca. 45º) cut, then rolling the eggplant a quarter turn (90º) and making another diagonal cut and continuing to roll and cut until done. There are YouTube movies illustrating this.As with the meat, I stir-fried the remainder of the aromatics in oil until fragrant, then added the eggplant and cooked it over medium heat until tender but not reduced to a mush, adding oil when it began to look a trifle too dry. This took 10 or 11 minutes, but “Japanese” or Fairy Tale eggplants will take a little less time. You may wish to cover the pan for a couple of minutes during the cooking time; this will help with even cooking.Nearly done. Over medium heat, add the cooked pork and stir well to combine; half a minute later stir in the peppers, and when warmed through add the sauce mixture. Reduce it slightly to form a glazy but still liquid sauce, probably no more than half a minute. Finish with a big handful of cilantro/coriander (optional for those who hate it) and another of chopped scallion greens.Serve with lots and lots of plain rice. So much flavor: spicy from the chili sauce but also from the large amount of ginger; a well rounded sweetness from brown sugar; sourness from the vinegar; savoriness from the meat – and pure, juicy joy from those delicious peppers and eggplants.As part of a less faux Chinese meal – one comprising other dishes as well – this would serve six people easily; eaten as the sole dish, the three of us were happily full by the time we’d finished it."

(After all, this is the guy that went on a 3-minute rant about the power of the pussy.) But, as he told “2 Dope Queens” host Phoebe Robinson, it wasn’t always that way.The “Daily Show” host sat down with Robinson for Glamour. They talked about his upbringing, Trump, and his feminist awakening. Noah credits the latter to Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie (and his mom). Robinson asked the 33-year-old South African comedian if it was fair of her to call him a feminist. Noah responded that indeed it was, crediting his mother and other female authority figures with building a feminist foundation for him when he was young.“Without a doubt, that’s because of my mom. My aunt, grandmother. Most of my teachers were female in school. I grew up in a world where authority was female,” said Noah.However, he didn’t call himself a feminist until later in life ― not because he didn’t believe in political, economic and social equality for all genders, but because he had negative associations with the term feminist.“I never thought to call myself a feminist because of branding,” said Noah. “I had this skewed idea of feminist: I thought it meant being a woman who hates men. When I read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists, I was like, ‘Oh, this is what my mom taught me. This is simple. I don’t understand why everybody is not this.’”The lesson here? When in doubt, pick up a book ― specifically one written by Adichie.Head over to Glamour to read the full interview."
34,IMPACT,West Virginia Is More Diverse Than You Think,"Lynn Clarke, ContributorAttorney in Charleston, WV and volunteer board president of th...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/west-virginia-is-more-diverse-than-you-think_us_59c94f46e4b0cdc77333a801,Even our coal mining history gets falsely homogenized.,2017-09-26,"A local artist's painting, """"The Diamond of West Virginia,"" really captures the diverse spirit of Charleston.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c950131a00002850f086e6.jpeg?ops=crop_23_714_2966_2373%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"At last year’s West Virginia Interfaith Refugee Ministry’s rally, one of my friends asked me if I knew that her doctor is a Muslim. She’s been going to see him for years and was surprised when he mentioned that he’s a Muslim from Syria. Yes, I did know. I also know that about one in three of the active physicians in West Virginia is a foreign medical school graduate. As it happens, there’s a lot of diversity right in our little city of Charleston, West Virginia ― even if the media, and often our own perceptions, tell us otherwise.For example, who thinks of Charleston as a city with a percentage of African-American residents that is above the percentage for the nation as a whole? Our city’s African-American community has represented 15.07 percent of us. That’s above the current percentage for the nation as a whole of 13.3 percent.Do we ever stop to consider how fortunate we are to have an HBCU (Historically Black College or University) in nearby Institute, West Virginia? How many of the baby boomers who grew up in Charleston speak and write well because of Ruth Newsome, their African-American English teacher at the former Charleston High School? Mrs. Newsome chose to teach here, giving our community the benefit of the stellar education and skills she’d gained in other states. Given that even today only 7.7 percent of public school teachers are African-American, that’s something we should recognize and celebrate. But somehow West Virginia is seen without remembering our diversity.Even our West Virginia coal mining history gets falsely homogenized. As the volunteer board president of WVIRM, I’ve given talks at small churches and various community groups around our state about refugees and resettlement. Often a retired coal miner will speak up, wanting to push back against the idea that welcoming ethnically diverse newcomers would be something new for West Virginia. One very elderly retired miner raised his hand at a talk I gave at a small, rural church. He spoke of working side by side in the mines with Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks who spoke little English. He trusted them with his life, and they trusted him just the same, even if they could barely communicate.While part of the beauty of America is that we strive to see everyone as American ― all the same, regardless of ethnicity or heritage ― we still need to recognize and celebrate the diversity we have in our communities and our history. When I attend St. John’s Episcopal Church here in Charleston, I see the people surrounding me in the pews as my friends, all struggling with their faith, just as I am. But I also need to remember to be grateful to the past parishioners who welcomed so many of my friends’ parents and grandparents to worship here when they arrived from Lebanon and Syria throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. For the early arrivals, Charleston did not yet have an Orthodox Christian Church, so they were welcomed in Episcopal, Roman Catholic and other denominations.Let’s remember and celebrate this history, and let’s recognize and be grateful for the thriving Orthodox and Coptic Churches we have today in our community.Something people do notice is that many gas stations and mini-marts in West Virginia have truly delicious pepperoni rolls on their shelves. But do they recognize the depth and history of the thriving Italian community in West Virginia? Do they reflect on the fact that both of our senators, Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito, are a part of that community and heritage by birth or marriage?On my father’s side of my family, I have Jewish relatives who live in other states. One of them turned to me at a family wedding and commented that he could never live in a place like West Virginia because there is no Jewish community. In fact, Charleston has a thriving Jewish community, with a Reform temple and a traditional Synagogue. Each congregation hosts classes and events that are well attended by Jews and non-Jews alike.If you look at our local mosque, you will see healthy growth (from 10–20 families in 1987 to 300-400 families today) in membership. When we had historic flooding last year, our Muslim community responded with generosity and quick action, working hard to help their neighbors.How does all that add up to the homogenous, white Appalachian image of Charleston, West Virginia? It doesn’t. Charleston is a welcoming, supportive and diverse community. Generations of people have come here and built their lives, in any faith or no faith, with any ethnicity, color, creed or orientation. Come see."

Kennedy quote about free speech and revolution. Neither the Golden State Warriors or the University of North Carolina ― the NBA and college basketball champions respectively ― will travel to the White House the traditional photo-op and visit.Reporters, talking heads, politicians, and ordinary folk are savvy enough to drop the visceral reactions to ask a basic question that had been out of reach for a year: What was Colin Kaepernick reacting to in the first place?Dialogue begins, and the dawn rises on a real discussion of the repercussions of the savage inequalities in the criminal justice system, from police shootings to prison rates.Ah, if only.Unfortunately, the White House is populated by men and women who appear to be out of their depth. Donald Trump consistently strays into areas that require nuance. Instead, he spits fire, then retreats to safety.Healing is not part of his deal. Indeed, the administration, most noticeably through the Justice Department, is dismantling decades of Civil Rights work that was meant to right centuries of injustice. In that view, the president’s response may be disquieting, but hardly surprising.And what of Colin Kaepernick, the best out of work quarterback on the planet? He explained his protest in an interview last season. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he said. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”And there’s the frustration that I feel now ― the rants about entitled athletes disrespecting veterans and the country with Kaepernick’s thesis buried in the shrill cacophony of misguided and phony patriotism.If you want to know what our damaged justice system looks like, take a look at a recent report by the Sentencing Project: “Black youth were more than five times as likely to be detained or committed compared to white youth, according to data from the Department of Justice collected in October 2015 and recently released.”Or read what ArchCity Defenders have been tackling in the St. Louis Metropolitan region since the death of Michael Brown in August 2014, including defending a falsely charged ex-Navy veteran whose four-year odyssey in the criminal justice system cost him his job and his home.Even libertarian organizations are busting myths such as the “war on cops,” as well as showing the harm to communities by the administration’s militarization of the police, whose tactics and weaponry have been on display in St. Louis after the dismissal of homicide charges against a white police officers in the shooting death of a black motorist.St. Louis police tactics led to physical actions taken against non-violent protesters, including a grandmother who was seen being choked by an officer, and an Air Force lieutenant, who was outside watching a protest in his neighborhood, and says he and his wife were inexplicably mistreated by police.“It was incredibly unnecessary,” he says. “I’ve had training on how to arrest and be arrested, and I capitulated to every demand that was made of me, even before I was on the ground.”What began as one man’s quiet protest before a football game has now become solidarity between players, coaches, and even some owners, none of whom, as of NFL’s week 3, have employed Colin Kaepernick.My hope is that the dialogue Kaepernick had hoped to foster won’t be silenced, too.Fredrick McKissack, Jr. is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

On the surface, his comments are a slap in the face to athletes protesting the oppression of people of color in the United States and those in solidarity with them. Also on the surface, however, is the same misogyny we’ve seen Trump spew time and time again. Trump’s “son of a bitch” comment may have been directed at men like Kaepernick, but it displays his disrespect toward the mothers that raised these protesting athletes, the female athletes who have also been protesting, and the black women who have been killed or assaulted by police.“Son of a bitch” isn’t just some phrase used by angry dudes in film. It’s a way of insulting a man, but at its underbelly, is an insult towards women. It implies that the man addressed is cowardly but the heart of this cowardliness exists in the woman that raised him – the “bitch” who could not parent because she was too promiscuous. Similarly, Trump’s “son of a bitch” comment implies an attack on protesting male athletes, but at its heart is an attack on women who have raised sons to stand up against oppression. People shouldn’t be clapping when our president manages to belittle black men and black mothers in the same sentence.Protest doesn’t just concern male athletes either. “Sons” aren’t the only ones taking the knee. Trump’s comments show that he fails to understand the intersection between protesting police brutality and feminism. Rejecting police brutality against black people means rejecting rights for black women, or rejecting feminism. Feminism involves respect of the female body. This respect includes protecting the female body from police brutality, and allowing the female body to protest against police brutality.Several WNBA teams have protested police brutality in the past. In July 2016, members of the New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury, and Minnesota Lynx donned black warm-up shirts supporting #BlackLivesMatter – resulting in a $5,000 fine per team and $500 fine per player that was later rescinded. These protests came after the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile on July 5 and 6, respectively. In September 2016, members of the Indiana Fever and Phoenix Mercury linked arms and kneeled during the national anthem of their first round playoff series. On Sunday, during Game 1 of the WNBA finals, members of the Minnesota Lynx locked arms during the national anthem. The opposing team, the Los Angeles Sparks protested by staying in the locker room during the anthem. The Los Angeles Sparks had previously protested in August, locking arms with the Washington Mystics to stand against white supremacist terrorism in Charlottesville. With nearly 69 percent of players in the WNBA being black women, the WNBA cannot be ignored as a site of protest, and women of color cannot be ignored as protesters.Of course, black women also cannot be ignored as victims of police brutality. There have been several instances of police brutality in the past few months. In May, video posted on social media revealed Texas police forcibly restraining a 14-year-old black girl outside of a party, and one officer punching her in the face. In June, Charleena Lyles, a pregnant mother of four who suffered from mental health challenges, was shot and killed by police inside her Seattle apartment after calling law enforcement to report a burglary. In August, Texas attorney Samuel Cammack III released police dash cam footage showing officers searching a black college student’s vagina for eleven minutes. A grand jury had previously dismissed the charges against the officers involved. Belittling protest against police brutality means belittling the lives of black women.The importance of pointing out the misogyny in President Trump’s statement isn’t about pouncing on yet another presidential rant, or nitpicking. Calling out misogyny in President Trump’s demeanor towards women is important considering this presidency was partially built on comments degrading women. It is also vital under a presidency that thrives on white supremacy, which hurts black women just as much as it hurts black men."

In fact, pediatric cancer is the number one cause of death by disease in children. The Gold Hope Project tries to bring a little normalcy and joy to families facing pediatric cancer. Founded by Cynthia Dawson, the nonprofit organization connects professional photographers with children battling cancer and young cancer survivors for free photo sessions. Dawson was inspired to create the Gold Hope Project after her daughter Ava’s 11-month fight against a terminal brain tumor known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). During this painful time, Dawson’s family leaned on the support of a network of people, including their family photographer.“She photographed Ava in October of of 2012, just a month before she passed away, and that was the first session done for the organization,” she told HuffPost. “At her session, Ava laughed, giggled and sang songs while playing with glitter.

41,POLITICS,What The Movement For Gun Violence Prevention Is Missing,"Mike Weisser, ContributorMike the Gun Guy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-the-movement-for-gun-violence-prevention-is-missing_us_59cab187e4b07e9ca11f6715,"Back in 2006, one of the country’s stellar gun violence researchers, Kristin Goss of Duke University, wrote a book in which",2017-09-26,"A woman holds a sign while marching with the Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America contingent at the San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade in San Francisco, California, U.S. June 26, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59caca37190000505d565c97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Back in 2006, one of the country’s stellar gun violence researchers, Kristin Goss of Duke University, wrote a book in which she tried to explain why there was no mass movement for gun control in the United States. As opposed to mass movements which sought to end the Vietnam War, or reduce drunk driving, what she found after mass shootings like Columbine was the following pattern: “collective outrage, followed by a momentary flurry of unorganized calls and letters and donations from thousands of individuals, and then a quick return to the status quo.” Otherwise, the issue of gun violence would lie dormant between the random, high-profile shooting events.Goss argues that the pro-gun folks were much more successful than the gun-control crowd in building a mass movement for two reasons: they were funded both by industry and private sources whose resources the gun-control groups couldn’t match; they took advantage of a fragmented, federalist political system which rewards political initiatives at the local level but frequently restricts the implementation of national policies even when such policies gain broad, popular support.Is it time to revise Kristin’s argument about the lack of a mass movement for gun control given how the landscape appears to have changed in the 10 years since she wrote her book? To some degree yes. Despite the sycophantic utterings by Forbes and various other pro-gun media outlets, the decision by Mike Bloomberg to pour 50 million bucks into gun-control initiatives each year isn’t chopped liver, and money like that always has an effect. There has also been a shift in the tactics of gun violence prevention (GVP) organizations towards a greater focus on state-level gun issues rather than only thinking and organizing in national terms; an example of this being the spread of laws which force persons served with a domestic abuse order to turn in their guns.Of late there also appears to be some parity developing between the two sides on social media venues which have become an important, indeed necessary venue for how organizations connect with the folks they represent. Right now on Facebook, the NRA page has 630,000 Likes, the Moms Demand page has 570K. As for website traffic according to SimilarWeb, the NRA site registers around 300,000 visitors a month, visits to Everytown are around 200K every 30 days. How many years has the NRA been around? At least 150 years longer than Everytown or Moms – I would say that the numbers for those GVP sites are pretty substantial and pretty good.On the other hand, over the last five days I received six email communications from the NRA, including three messages offering to sell me clothing, backpacks and all kinds of other consumer crap. During that same five-day period I received only three emails from the GVP folks, and every message consisted of asking me to donate money to the cause. Several of the NRA emails were also straight out of the organization’s fundraising kit, but overall the NRA messaging did one thing that the GVP messaging didn’t do – it conveyed the idea that being involved with the NRA is not only important but also fun.The idea that you can have a good time by being a member of America’s “oldest civil rights organization” is an important aspect of the pro-gun messaging strategy that I’m not sure the GVP community understands. It certainly isn’t mentioned or analyzed in Kristin’s book. But later today I’m going to drive over to Marlborough where the semi-annual gun show is going on, and the reason I’m going to the show is the same reason that millions of people attend gun shows all over the country every weekend – the shows are fun. I can wander around, play with lots of guns, eat a hot dog and wash it down with a full-calorie drink and buy a Make America Great Again baseball cap for under five bucks.Spending money on some useless junk may not be the preferred method for raising political awareness within the GVP, but it sure works for the NRA."
42,POLITICS,National Republicans Put It All On The Line In Alabama Senate Election,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-senate-election_us_59ca8c44e4b0cdc773353843,"If GOP voters reject the incumbent senator, it will be a significant embarrassment for Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.",2017-09-26,"President Donald Trump at a rally for Luther Strange in Huntsville, Alabama, on Sept. 22.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cabf441d0000c30ee72ffc.jpeg?cache=g62kgnTQGV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans have been anxiously watching Alabama on Tuesday, as GOP voters have headed to the polls to choose their candidate in the state’s special Senate election.Sen. Luther Strange is facing off against Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court chief justice who made his name by opposing same-sex marriage and fighting for a Ten Commandments monument in the court building. The governor appointed Strange to the seat in February, when Jeff Sessions vacated it to become attorney general. The election has been a proxy fight between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ― who backs Strange ― and the conservative activists supporting Moore who make up President Donald Trump’s base. Trump, however, supports Strange. He went to Alabama on Friday to campaign for the candidate he affectionately calls “big Luther.” Moore may be a more natural fit, but Trump appreciates that Strange has supported his agenda and been a reliable vote. A top White House staffer with ties to Alabama also reportedly helped convince Trump to stick with Strange by warning that Moore could be a nuisance in the Senate. Nevertheless, Trump has publicly admitted that he isn’t sure he made the right decision. “I might have made a mistake, and I’ll be honest I might have made a mistake,” Trump said Saturday at his rally for Strange. “If Luther doesn’t win, they’re not going to say we picked up 25 points in a very short period of time. They’re going to say Donald Trump, the president of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line. It is a terrible, terrible moment for Trump. This is total embarrassment.”Trump also praised Moore and said he’d be “campaigning like hell for him” if he wins the primary.The real loser, however, may be McConnell. The race has largely been set up as a referendum on him and the GOP establishment that he represents. If Moore would be a headache for Trump, he’d be a migraine for McConnell. And a loss for the man McConnell has put his operation behind, on the same day that the Senate GOP attempt to repeal Obamacare failed yet again, would be extremely embarrassing. It would also cause more headaches for McConnell in the next two years. Steve Bannon, the chairman of Breitbart News and former Trump adviser, is backing Moore. If Moore wins, Bannon will be empowered to encourage more conservative insurgents to challenge establishment incumbents for 2018. Trump has provided a bit of a distraction from his potentially embarrassing endorsement this week, by launching a battle against the NFL and players who kneel during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination and police brutality. At the rally on Friday, the president said NFL owners should get the “son of a bitch” player off the field if he disrespects the flag. The line provided a bit of red meat to his base, and he’s been playing it up ever since then as a useful distraction.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

43,BLACK VOICES,How The NFL Gentrified A Black Man's Protest,"Percell Dugger, Contributor@MrGOODWRK",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-nfl-gentrified-a-black-mans-protest_us_59c90a70e4b08d661550444b,The league has mobilized to blunt the power of its protesting players,2017-09-26,Colin Kaepernick’s protest is being rebranded to appease the sensitive palates of culturally insensitive Americans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ca63a21d0000c50ee72e6c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Gentrification, according to the dictionary, is defined as “the process of conforming to an upper- or middle-class lifestyle, or of making a product, activity, etc., appealing to those with more affluent tastes.” That about sums up what the NFL has done to Colin Kaepernick’s peaceful protest against police brutality. Colin Kaepernick’s protest is being rebranded to appease the sensitive palates of middle-class and culturally insensitive Americans, while simultaneously attempting to undermine the effectiveness of his protest by marginalizing the issues that he set out to address.The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Back in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick began his peaceful protest by sitting for the national anthem, the NFL, most fans, a number of former players and league executives, and most of the greater sports community opposed him and the ideals he stood for. His integrity was challenged and his character was questioned because of his protest. At that time, there wasn’t a single NFL owner who stood by Kaepernick’s side. Jerry Jones, Daniel Snyder, Robert Kraft, and others ― none of them showed any support for his protest. But after tons of bad press due to Kaepernick’s continued unemployment and the recent attack on Kaepernick by Donald Trump, NFL leadership has now “sided” with Kaepernick. Why the sudden change in course? No NFL Owners, not Shad Khan, or Bob McNair or any of their peers, cared to take a knee or support Colin’s noble cause back in 2016. The entire world was watching when Colin first stood (or rather sat down) to advocate for the marginalized experiences of oppressed people. The NFL didn’t care about his protest then, and they certainly don’t care now. But when arguably the most hated man in America, Donald Trump, attacked athletes for protesting by calling them “sons of bitches,” the NFL saw an opportunity that they couldn’t refuse.You see, when the NFL conspires to oppose Trump, who is commonly looked upon as the most disliked individual in the country, they benefit by appearing to be on the good side of this situation. The NFL doesn’t want anymore bad press, and they certainly want to eliminate any possible threat of a decrease in their ratings and overall viewership/engagement. But let’s be very clear here, the NFL doesn’t care about Colin Kaepernick’s protest. Their agendas are to project positivity, look progressive in the eyes of casual fans and media outlets, while simultaneously taking the steam out of Kaepernick’s protest by making it more appealing and tasteful to middle class Americans. In a statement issued over the weekend, billionaire owner of the New England Patriots Robert Kraft had this to say about Trump’s recent comments:“I am deeply disappointed by the tone of the comments made by the President on Friday. There is no greater unifier in this country than sports, and unfortunately, nothing more divisive than politics.”Kraft’s words are all too accurate, but these words are nothing more than insufficient funds within the bank of opportunity.Kraft and other prominent NFL owners have funded Trump’s administration and campaign. The divisive rhetoric used to attack protesting athletes is the same divisive rhetoric that Trump used during his 2016 campaign. NFL owners are responsible for aiding the growth and platform of an individual whom they knew had a history of idiotic outburst. So are these 32 NFL Owners really surprised by Trump’s recent comments? I highly doubt the ones who donated millions to him are surprised. I mean, who gives a million dollars to a person without getting a good feel for their character? Oh, I know! The same people who are leading the way in making a protest more refined and tasteful for middle-class Americans, while failing to address the root issues of said protest.The NFL hasn’t done anything to actually aid Colin Kaepernick’s cause. The league hasn’t donated to his fundraising initiative. They haven’t collaborated with him in an effort to bring awareness to the issues surrounding his protest, and they probably won’t. Because that’s exactly what gentrifiers do. They come into a community that’s already established and take over, while simultaneously displacing those who occupied said space. Only in this instance, instead of literally displacing Colin, they are leaving him in a state of displacement by not signing him to a contract. The next thing on the Gentrifiers list of things to do is redevelop the community they “inhabited.” In the case of the NFL, this means taking a knee and locking arms for a few weeks while simultaneously rebranding the league as a progressive space where diversity and community are valued. That’s a great way to inhabit an issue they previously opposed, and redevelop a new image to fit their agenda. Now all they need to do is put a Connecticut Muffin and a Whole Foods at every stadium, and they’ll be in business.MAN, WHAT A TIME!"
44,POLITICS,"Right After Trump Linked High Drug Prices To Campaign Cash, Drugmakers Gave More","Sydney Lupkin and Elizabeth Lucas, Kaiser Health News",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-drug-pharma-donations_us_59c9a413e4b06ddf45fa977e,Big Pharma went on a political spending spree the next day.,2017-09-26,"Merck CEO Ken Frazier listens to President Donald Trump at a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House on Feb. 23. Merck's PAC donated $148,000 to 60 political candidates on March 21, a day after comments on drug prices by Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c9a916190000505d565988.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“The cost of medicine in this country is outrageous,” President Donald Trump said at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, two months after his inauguration. He went on about how identical pills have vastly lower price tags in Europe.“You know why?” the president asked, before spreading his hands wide. “Campaign contributions, who knows. But somebody is getting very rich.”It was March 20.The next day, drugmakers donated more money to political campaigns than they had on any other day in 2017 so far, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of campaign spending in the first half of the year, as reported in Federal Election Commission filings. Eight pharmaceutical political action committees made 134 contributions, spread over 77 politicians on March 21. They spent $279,400 in all, showering Republicans and Democrats in both legislative bodies with campaign cash, according to FEC filings. Brendan Fischer, who directs election reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, said he found the timing of the contributions interesting: “I think it’s entirely possible that the drug companies sought to curry favor with members of Congress in order to head off any sort of potential attack on their industry by the press or by the federal government.” A spokeswoman for Merck, the most generous of the pharmaceutical companies on March 21, said the contributions were “not tied to specific events.” “Decisions on contributions are made at the beginning of a cycle and are approved by a contributions committee,” Claire Gillepsie said. A White House official referred requests for comment to the presidential campaign, which did not respond.During the Louisville rally, Trump also promised to lower drug prices, and pharmaceutical stocks tumbled afterward. Although drug industry PACs have different structures and protocols, they are equipped to mobilize quickly to disperse funds to legislators.“Writing a check doesn’t require much beyond putting pen to paper,” Fischer said.FEC records show Merck’s PAC led the way that day, donating $148,000 to 60 candidates on March 21. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) received three maximum contributions to his various PACs from the drugmaker, totaling $15,000. Behind him with $7,500 was Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who sits on the Senate Finance Committee.Companies may donate funds or lobby ahead of impending legislative issues and executive orders, or they may react to something a politician says.“Presidents get a lot of attention to what they say,” said former congressman Lee Hamilton, who founded the Indiana University Center on Representative Government after three decades in the U.S. House. “[Companies] have to react to that and defend the drug prices.”Overall, FEC records show Merck spent $242,500 on campaign contributions and $3.7 million on lobbying in the first half of 2017.The drugmaker, which makes diabetes pill Januvia, cancer drug Keytruda and shingles vaccine Zostavax, responded to outrage over drug prices earlier this year by revealing on its website that the average list prices of its drugs increased from 7.4 percent to 10.5 percent each year since 2010. Merck said discounts and rebates also increased, meaning it took home less money. But Thomson Reuters pointed out that the price increases outpaced inflation. FEC records don’t indicate why a company donated to a politician or what that contribution led to, but when House Democrats accused Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) of failing to schedule a hearing on prescription drug price hikes in 2015, The Intercept pointed out that the pharmaceutical industry had been among Chaffetz’s top campaign contributors.Pharmaceutical lobbying dollars have also swelled in 2017, Kaiser Health News has previously reported. In their disclosures, drug companies listed tax reform and drug pricing among issues on which they lobbied Congress.March 21 was also the date of the National Republican Congressional Committee’s annual fundraising dinner, featuring Trump as keynote speaker. The event, which raises money for House Republicans, drew a record-breaking $30 million from a variety of industries, the NRCC reported. But on that day, drugmakers also gave generously to Democrats and senators, according to FEC filings.Pfizer and Novo Nordisk PACs donated $76,900 and $38,500 on March 21, respectively, to several dozen candidates on March 21, according to their filings. Five additional pharmaceutical PACs spent between $1,000 and $5,000 on contributions that day.The companies say the timing was a coincidence. A Novo Nordisk spokesman said the March 21 contributions from its PAC had been scheduled in advance “and in no way were tied to any specific statement.”Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said it takes three to four weeks to orchestrate and approve a PAC contribution.Pfizer’s PAC has donated more than any pharmaceutical PAC in 2017, contributing $418,400 in all — nearly 70 percent more than the first six months of the 2015 election cycle, according to FEC records. In February of this year, the company’s CEO was among several executives from drugmaking firms and other global companies to sign a letter to Congress in support of tax reform. In December 2016, Pfizer received a letter from the Senate Special Committee on Aging, asking it to explain its price increases for the opioid overdose reversal drug, naloxone. “Pfizer is committed to addressing the prevention, treatment, and effective response to the growing opioid abuse in the United States,” Castillo said, adding that the company is donating up to 1 million naloxone doses and $1 million in grants toward opioid addiction awareness efforts.Novo Nordisk has spent $178,000 on campaign contributions so far this year, or nearly four times more than it spent in the first six months of 2015, according to its filings with the FEC. The company is one of the top three insulin makers, and in July, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) sent letters to the companies asking them to justify their price increases. In November, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the insulin makers for possible price collusion. The companies have denied the allegations.“From the public record, you can’t tell for sure” what prompted the spike in political contributions from pharmaceutical companies, said Tony Raymond, a former FEC analyst who founded Political Money Line to track campaign finance. The PACs could have been “killing two birds with one stone” by donating to legislators across the board on the night of the NRCC fundraiser, or they could have been responding to what Trump had said.“We’re talking about a couple phone calls,” he said, “and then they could courier a check over to someone.”Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation."

According to our data, as someone becomes a registered voter, it’s often the first and most influential step they can take toward being engaged in local issues. And by becoming active and informed citizens we can impact our world on a local, state and national level.RISE to Vote is partnering with state and local election officials and nonpartisan organizations like the League of Women Voters and the Drum Major Institute with expertise in leading and executing effective voter registration drives in all 50 states. Our goal is to encourage athletes to become informed and engaged citizens and inspire their fans to do the same.Four professional teams – the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins and the NBA’s Atlanta Hawks and Brooklyn Nets – already have completed RISE to Vote sessions, where the players also met with Martin Luther King III, who spoke to them about the significance of engaging in our democracy.This is only the beginning.More and more teams from across various sports leagues are ready to hold RISE to Vote sessions. This movement can begin with professional athletes but grow to one that involves coaches, staff, fans and student-athletes who follow in the steps of their role models. Information about the importance of voting could be distributed, and registration could be offered at major sporting and community events. Athletes can voice the importance of voting through social media and can go back to their hometowns or universities and hold voter registration drives of their own.The work that’s required to bring people together and advance equality and positive change in our country becomes more powerful and effective when athletes are leading the charge. And, as I recently told The Washington Post, regardless of your political leanings, we all have a stake in making sure our society is one where we are unified.One of the most moving and inspiring moments I’ve observed this week was seeing Martin Luther King III, oldest son of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., remind athletes that his father stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in May 1957 and said, “Give us the ballot, and we will transform the salient misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs into the calculated good deeds of orderly citizens.”The athletes in the audience heard his message and responded by registering to vote and embracing their rights and their power to change the world.As we move forward to Week 4 of the football season, we can anticipate that other issues will emerge to dominate our national discourse. But what will remain is a steadfast and growing number of athletes at every level in every league registering to vote and leading their fans to do the same.Jocelyn Benson is CEO of the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality (RISE)."

The public comment period on nominees ends this Thursday.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c9bda41d0000980ee72d1a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A third of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Science Advisory Board, an influential panel that reviews the science the agency uses in formulating safeguards, could be succeeded by climate science-denying, polluter-friendly replacements when their terms expire at the end of this month. The board, which has been in existence for nearly 40 years, is traditionally populated by bona fide scientists from academia, government and industry who volunteer to serve three-year terms. This time around, as first reported by E&E News, at least a dozen of the 132 candidates vying for one of the 15 open seats reject mainstream climate science. But that’s not all. There are at least 10 other equally inappropriate candidates on the list, and not all of them are scientists, despite the fact that it’s supposed to be a panel of science advisers.Among the 12 climate science deniers are Weather Channel co-founder Joseph D’Aleo, who wrongly claims global warming is due to natural oceanic, solar and volcanic cycles; and former Peabody Energy science director Craig Idso, now chairman of his family’s Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, who insists “there is no compelling reason to believe that the rise in [average earth] temperature was caused by the rise in carbon dioxide.” D’Aleo, Idso and six of the other climate-fact-challenged candidates are affiliated with the fossil fuel industry-funded Heartland Institute, which has a long history of misrepresenting science. The other 10 unsuitable candidates consistently side with industry when it comes to protecting the public from toxic hazards, regardless of the scientific evidence, and falsely accuse the EPA of being unscientific to try to undermine its credibility. Soot Makes You Live LongerOne of the 10, toxicologist Michael Honeycutt, failed to secure a seat on the EPA’s seven-member Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee when he was nominated for one last fall — with good reason. Over the last decade, Honeycutt, who heads the toxicology division of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, rolled back the state’s relatively weak protections for 45 toxic chemicals, including arsenic, benzene, formaldehyde and hexavalent chromium, the carcinogen that made Erin Brockovich a household name. Honeycutt also has attacked EPA rules for ground-level ozone (smog), which aggravates lung diseases, and particulate matter (PM) (soot), which has been linked to lung cancer, cardiovascular damage, reproductive problems and premature death. In October 2014, Honeycutt argued that there would be “little to no public health benefit from lowering the current [ozone] standard” because “most people spend more than 90 percent of their time indoors” and “systems such as air conditioning remove it from indoor air.” And despite the overwhelming scientific evidence directly linking fine soot particles to premature death, Honeycutt testified before Congress in June 2012 that “some studies even suggest PM makes you live longer.” Better Living Through ChemistryAnother industry-friendly nominee, Kimberly White, is senior director of chemical products at the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the country’s largest chemical manufacturing trade association. Representing the interests of 155 corporate members, including chemical companies Dow, DuPont and Olin; pharmaceutical firms Bayer, Eli Lilly and Merck; and petrochemical conglomerates BP, ExxonMobil and Shell, the ACC has delayed, weakened and blocked science-based health, environmental and workplace protections at the state, national and even international levels.For example, the ACC has lobbied against establishing federal rules on silica dust exposure and disclosing the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. It has been instrumental in limiting community access to information about local chemical plants. And it has played a key role in quashing government efforts to regulate bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical used in plastics and can linings; flame retardants, which have been linked to birth defects and cancer; and formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. White downplayed formaldehyde’s risks in a September 2016 blog on the ACC website.The ACC also lobbies to weaken existing environmental safeguards. In written testimony for a House Science, Space and Technology Committee hearing last February, for example, White charged that the EPA uses irrelevant or outdated data and procedures when drafting new regulations. Who Needs a Cleaner Environment?Finally, three of the pro-polluter candidates are economists with a distinct corporate tilt: Richard Belzer, whose clients include the American Chemistry Council and ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences; Tony Cox, whose clients include the America Petroleum Institute, Chemical Manufacturers Association and Monsanto; and John D. Graham, dean of Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs, who is currently doing contract work for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers on fuel economy standards and the libertarian Searle Freedom Trust on regulatory “reform.” All three emphasize the cost to industry to reduce pollution, discount scientific evidence of the risk of exposure, and ignore the benefits of a cleaner environment. Perhaps the best known is Graham, who ran the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for five years during the George W. Bush administration. His appointment to that position was hotly contested because in his previous job, directing the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, he routinely understated the dangers of products manufactured by the center’s corporate sponsors by using questionable cost-benefit analyses. As predicted, Graham applied that same simplistic, industry-friendly calculus at OIRA, which oversees all government rulemaking, and at the tail end of his tenure in 2006, he unsuccessfully attempted to standardize risk assessments across all federal agencies. Public interest groups and the scientific community, spearheaded by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, came out in full force against the idea, and a National Research Council (NRC) committee unanimously rejected it as “fundamentally flawed.” “Economists like Graham are frustrated because the EPA has been conservative about risk,” said Center for Progressive Reform co-founder Rena Steinzor, who wrote a stinging indictment of Graham’s government-wide proposal in a May 2006 issue of Inside EPA’s Risk Policy Report. “The EPA gives more margin to safety. That drives economists crazy. They think it leads to over-protection. But there are not many examples of chemicals that turn out to be less harmful than we thought.”Foxes Advising the Foxes in the Henhouse?Putting climate science deniers and industry apologists on the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) would not only undercut the panel’s legitimacy, it also would provide cover for the corporate shills now in key positions at the agency, starting with Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has the final say on who is selected, and Nancy Beck, a deputy assistant administrator who most recently worked for the American Chemistry Council, and before that, for Graham at OMB.“The Science Advisory Board has been providing independent advice to the EPA for decades, ensuring that the agency uses the best science to protect public health and the environment,” said Genna Reed, a policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “SAB members have always been eminent scientists who are committed to the often-challenging public service of working through complex scientific topics to help guide EPA decision-making. They are the EPA’s scientific compass. The agency’s mission to safeguard our air and water will be further compromised if Administrator Pruitt winds up selecting these unacceptable candidates.”Elliott Negin is a senior writer at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Joseph McCarthy’s campaign to root out alleged Communists. “Even then I don’t remember a case of a president explicitly calling for a particular American to be fired from private employment. And what does it say about our moment that the closest comparison is McCarthyism?”Another academic pointed to Ronald Reagan, who in August 1981 fired more than 11,000 air traffic controllers who refused to quit their strike and go back to work. “To strike as a group or refuse to cross a picket line as an individual are examples of free speech,” said Elizabeth Tandy Shermer, an assistant history professor at Loyola University Chicago. But that case was different, as Reagan was taking a legal action and, under federal law, the air controllers weren’t legally permitted to strike.In his previous career as a reality television star, Trump could fire someone for not standing during the national anthem — the First Amendment limits the power of the government, not private entities like the Trump Organization or NBC’s “The Apprentice.” NFL team owners’ power to fire their employees is similarly unrestrained by the Constitution. (Though union contracts may offer protection.) But when the president urges an employer to punish employees who engage in free speech, that is against at least “the spirit” of the First Amendment, said Floyd Abrams, an attorney and expert on constitutional law. “We would ordinarily look to a president to protect, not vilify” that spirit, Abrams added.An employer can impose certain rules that may abridge free speech rights at work. But “we’re really talking about Donald Trump here,” said Wilma Liebman, the former chair of the National Labor Relations Board under President Barack Obama. If a football player is fired for kneeling and the team owner cites the fact that the president told him to do it, “I think you have a First Amendment case,” she said. Not everyone agrees: “It’d be very hard if a player got fired to sue the president and say he’s responsible,” countered Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. “It’d be the team’s decision to fire the player.” But Trump calling for NFL players to lose their jobs is troubling for another reason, the president’s critics say: It shows he treats the right to free speech as conditional rather than absolute. Trump didn’t call white supremacists at the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, “son of a bitches,” Kwame Rose, a prominent Baltimore activist, pointed out. “They pick and choose when you can exercise your First Amendment right, and they also choose who can exercise their First Amendment right.” Trump and his administration have attacked First Amendment protections for the media, people who burn the American flag and a protester who laughed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a congressional hearing. Administration figures have unleashed a barrage of attacks on NFL players. On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested that athletes who are upset about police violence should protest to police officers directly. Sessions called it “a big mistake to protest in that fashion.” And Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that players can “do free speech on their own time.” “The wonder is not the unhinged behavior of this weekend but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment,” The New Yorker’s Jelani Cobb wrote Sunday. ”He’s fine with punishing dissenters, so long as he abhors what the dissenters are saying,” former Obama administration official Cass Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg View on Monday.There are exercises of speech that Trump and his administration do support: free speech on college campuses, the kind that aims to counter liberal “political correctness”; a baker who doesn’t want to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple; the First Amendment Defense Act, which could codify discrimination against LGBTQ Americans; support for keeping Confederate statues; and the president’s own right to to express his views on Twitter. “Here, they’re saying on the one hand you have the right of free speech to design a cake [and not sell it to a same-sex couple], but you can’t express yourself on something as central as whether you think there’s racial justice in the country,” said Paul Secunda, a law professor at Marquette University in Wisconsin. “It’s so inconsistent and so hypocritical, but then again, it doesn’t surprise me or anyone else who has been watching this administration.” There is one precedent for a president weighing in on an NFL athlete protesting racial injustice, but for the opposite reason. In 2016, Obama said, “I also always try to remind folks that part of what makes this country special is that we respect people’s rights to have a different opinion.”"

Despite Merkel’s win, only 31 percent of those elected to Germany’s parliament, known as the Bundestag, were women. The 2013 elections saw the percentage of women sitting in the Bundestag rise to 36.5 percent, according to European Union statistics. A similar percentage of women exists at the federal levels of government, but local governments are seriously lacking in female representation.From the outside, it’s easy to look at a country with a longstanding female leader and expect the approach to women in politics ― and the workplace more generally ― to be rather evolved.Yet experts paint a grimmer picture. It’s particularly difficult for women to break through in politics unless it’s in an ultra-liberal party with a female quota, Eva Högl, deputy faction chairman of the Social Democratic Party, explained in Bundestag’s magazine, Der Bundeswahlleiter. And fewer than four percent of CEOs in the country are women, according to European Union statistics.It’s not surprising that so few women exist at the highest levels of government or the private sector, seeing as large parts of the country have for decades been defined by the male breadwinner model.Germany is known for its abnormally high wage gap ― women earn about 22 percent less than men on average, according to EU statistics from 2016, which is six points higher than the EU average. But some experts say it’s not because companies tend to be discriminatory towards women. Women just tend to work part time, leading to lower wages, or they gravitate towards industries that are more traditionally “female,” Corinna Kleinert, a sociology professor at the University of Bamberg and the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories, told HuffPost. The male-female distinction dates back to the Cold War. West Germany prided itself on a patriarchal social structure, she said, while socialism in East Germany required both men and women to work.This means that today, Kleinert said, although more women than ever are employed across the country, the part-time trend is more prevalent in West Germany (the more populous part of the country). West German mothers traditionally “feel they are not good mothers if they put their children in early care,” she added.Plus, the eastern part of the country has pre-existing childcare infrastructure that the western region has struggled to match up to.“Even if western German women would like to [work full time], they have problems getting their kids into early care and difficulty finding care that allows full-time work,” she said.Merkel has been chancellor since 2005 ― in other words, she’s had ample time to set a more rigorous gender agenda. Part of the problem is her obligation to cater to her party’s largely conservative base.Some significant reforms during her time in office have, however, created incremental improvements.A law passed in 2013 offers every child over the age of one a spot in a daycare facility. But in many parts of the country, Kleinert said, “it allows only part-time work because [daycare] facilities close too early.”Merkel also put in place a system whereby women (or men) receive partial income in the first year of parental leave, thereby encouraging them to come back to work sooner.The issue remains that they mostly gravitate towards part-time work. “This explains why women don’t make their way into management positions,” according to Kleinert. In an effort to rectify that, the government passed a law in 2015 requiring the non-executive boards of publicly-traded German companies to consist of at least 30 percent women. “There is still a lot to do, that’s evident,” Katarina Barley, who heads the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, said in June.Yet there is an undeniable “call from the economy to integrate more women into the labor market,” Kleinert said. Germany suffers from an aging population that could leave the economy partially bereft of skilled labor in the coming years. “The easiest way to fill that gap is by qualified women.”"

However, it is designed to give Masoud Barzani, who heads the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), a mandate to negotiate the secession of the oil-producing region.For Iraqi Kurds - the largest ethnic group left stateless when the Ottoman empire collapsed a century ago - the referendum offers a historic opportunity despite intense international pressure to call it off.“We have seen worse, we have seen injustice, killings and blockades,” said Talat, waiting to vote in the regional capital of Erbil, as a group of smiling women, in colorful Kurdish dress, emerged from the school showing their fingers stained with ink, a sign that they voted.At Sheikh Amir village, near the Peshmerga front lines west of Erbil, long lines of Kurdish fighters waited to vote outside a former school. Most emerged smiling, holding up ink-marked fingers.In Baghdad, lawyer Adil Salman said the referendum resulted from the weakness of the Iraqi government. “The scenario we’re seeing now is of state disintegration,” he said.The Kurds also say the vote acknowledges their contribution in confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq.But with 30 million ethnic Kurds scattered over international borders across the region, Tehran and Ankara fear the spread of separatism to their own Kurdish populations.President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey could cut off the pipeline that carries oil from northern Iraq to the outside world, piling more pressure on the Kurds.“After this, let’s see through which channels the northern Iraqi regional government will send its oil, or where it will sell it,” Erdogan said in Istanbul. “We have the tap. The moment we close the tap, then it’s done.”The U.S. State Department warned the Kurds last week that “holding the referendum in disputed areas is particularly provocative and destabilizing.”The referendum is taking place not only in the Kurdish autonomous region of Iraq, but also in areas in the north of the country where Kurdish forces have advanced against Islamic State. These areas also have large non-Kurdish populations.Turkey said it did not recognize the referendum and would view its outcome as null and void, adding that the Iraqi Kurdish government was threatening the peace and stability of Iraq and the whole region.Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said his government was evaluating possible punitive steps regarding its border with northern Iraq and air space in response to the vote.Ankara would make decisions in more direct talks with the Iraqi central government after the referendum and economic, political, diplomatic and military steps were being discussed, he told Turkish broadcasters.Ankara’s forces are again fighting a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey following the collapse of a peace process.FLIGHT BANIran announced a ban on direct flights to and from Kurdistan on Sunday, while Baghdad asked foreign countries to stop direct oil trading with the Kurdish region and demanded that the KRG hands over control of its international airports and border posts with Iran, Turkey and Syria.Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top military adviser to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, said Iran regarded the referendum as “treason” against the Iraqi Kurds.“Iran has blocked air traffic to this region but we are hopeful that the four neighboring countries will block the land borders with Iraq too,” he was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.Tehran supports Shi’ite groups who have been ruling or holding security and government positions in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.Syria, embroiled in a devastating civil war and whose Kurds are pressing ahead with their own self-determination, rejected the referendum.Iraqi Kurdish prime Minister Nechirvan Barxani said he hoped to maintain good relations with Turkey and the referendum was not a threat to Ankara.“The referendum does not mean independence will happen tomorrow, nor are we redrawing borders,” he told a news conference in Erbil. “If the ‘Yes’ vote wins, we will resolve our issues with Baghdad peacefully,” he said.OPPOSITIONOpposition to the vote simmered among non-Kurdish populations in areas disputed by the KRG and Baghdad, and mainly the multi-ethnic oil-rich region of Kirkuk.“Iraq is against the Kurds, so are the Turks, the Iranians, the whole Arab region and Europe. They are going to live in a cage,” said Mohammed Mahdi al-Bayati, a Shi’ite Turkmen and a local leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation paramilitary group in Tuz Khurmato, south of Kirkuk.In Sulaimaniya, a bastion for political groups opposed to Barzani, queues at polling stations were shorter than those in Erbil. There were fewer billboards celebrating the referendum, reflecting resentment that a yes vote could be seen as a plebiscite for the Kurdish leader.“I will not vote, the referendum is not good, and it could be dangerous because of the threat from Turkey and Iran,” said a shop owner in Sulaimaniya, Ali Ahmed.After World War One, Britain and France carved up the Ottoman empire, leaving the Kurds scattered mainly over four countries: Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria.All of them suffered persecution and were often denied the right to speak their language. Those in Iraq were uprooted under Saddam and suffered an attack using chemical weapons.POLLING STATIONSPolling stations opened at 8:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) and should close at 6:00 p.m. final results were expected within 72 hours.Voting is open to all registered residents, Kurds and non-Kurds, in the Kurdish-held areas of northern Iraq aged 18 and over, according to the referendum commission.There are about 5.2 million eligible voters, including those living abroad and who began voting two days ago.Voters should tick yes or no on the ballot asking them just one question in Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic and Assyrian: “do you want the Kurdistan Region and Kurdistani areas outside the (Kurdistan) Region to become an independent country?”(Writing by Maher Chmaytelli; Additional reporting by Raya Jalabi, Ahmed Jadallah, Ahmed Rasheed and Marius Bosch; Editing by David Stamp and Giles Elgood)"

No riots, no fires, no major injuries, no Black Bloc militancy. All to protect the right of an Ann Coulter imitator to press the buttons of the left, which he had and has every right to do. Without the threat of the militant faction of Antifa, security would’ve cost next to nothing. Watching the whole thing from the western perimeter of Sproul, as I did, it looked sort of like a pricey film shoot; two dozen extras (on an otherwise empty set) surrounding the main actor. “Bye Bye Birdie” came to mind. Something high schoolish. Milo looked like an actor playing a candidate for student council president, or some such. Nobody in my area could hear him, but we could see him wave a flag, hold up irreverent signs, sign autographs, self-consciously mug for cameras. And, yes, his exit from the event was fraught with risk, as he had to walk across campus ― swarmed by activists but protected by police ― to get to his car, parked near the campus police headquarters. As some have noted, Free Speech Week, which this event was supposed to have been a part of, lasted only 20 nervous minutes."

(Wearing all that armor in hot weather in a potentially hostile environment and still keeping your cool is quite a feat for anyone in any profession.)And the expensive security ― nearly a million bucks ― worked. No riots, no fires, no major injuries, no Black Bloc militancy. All to protect the right of an Ann Coulter imitator to press the buttons of the left, which he had and has every right to do. Without the threat of the militant faction of Antifa, security would’ve cost next to nothing. Watching the whole thing from the western perimeter of Sproul, as I did, it looked sort of like a pricey film shoot; two dozen extras (on an otherwise empty set) surrounding the main actor. “Bye Bye Birdie” came to mind. Something high schoolish. Milo looked like an actor playing a candidate for student council president, or some such. Nobody in my area could hear him, but we could see him wave a flag, hold up irreverent signs, sign autographs, self-consciously mug for cameras. And, yes, his exit from the event was fraught with risk, as he had to walk across campus ― swarmed by activists but protected by police ― to get to his car, parked near the campus police headquarters. As some have noted, Free Speech Week, which this event was supposed to have been a part of, lasted only 20 nervous minutes."

It is also certain the vote will not immediately change the legal status of the Iraqi Kurdish region from the semi-autonomy it has enjoyed since 1991. But the possible overreaction of Baghdad and its neighbors to the vote has injected fear and uncertainty about what happens after Monday.Longtime Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani has made clear a vote for sovereignty doesn’t mean an automatic declaration of independence. Instead Barzani said he’ll use the referendum results as leverage in negotiations with the central government in Baghdad for a peaceful transition to Kurdish statehood.Nevertheless, Baghdad, Ankara and Tehran, all with restive Kurdish populations, issued threats if the vote went ahead. Iran closed its airspace to the landlocked Iraqi Kurdish region, and Turkey and Baghdad may follow suit. Turkey threatened to close the border with Iraqi Kurdistan, through which the Kurds sell 550,000 barrels of oil a day, illegally according to Baghdad, and depend on more than a billion dollars a years in food and other imports.The Iraqi Supreme Court has declared the referendum unconstitutional. Earlier this month Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi warned he would send tanks to Erbil, a threat he later withdrew. The Turkish parliament renewed a mandate for Turkish troops, which have been deployed on the borer, to enter Iraq.Military intervention would be an extraordinary step, however. The United States, a close ally of the Iraqi Kurds, has strongly opposed the referendum, and said it would withdraw support for Erbil-Baghdad talks, but has signaled no support for a military response.Violence is most possible in the city of Kirkuk, disputed between Kurds and Arabs, with a large Turkmen population. Shia militias have threatened to attack Kirkuk if the Kurds leave the Iraqi union.Turkey Threatens Military ActionIn his address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to close the border with Iraqi Kurdistan. “We call on Iraqi Kurdish regional government to abort their referendum,” Erdogan said. “Ignoring Turkey can deprive the KRG [Kurdish Regional Government] of the opportunities they currently enjoy.“ Such a move would anger Turkish businesses dependent on trade with the Iraqi Kurds, however.On Friday, the Turkish national security council issued a direct threat to Erbil. “The illegitimacy of the referendum announced by the KRG... directly threatens Turkey’s national security... a grave mistake that threatens Iraq’s political unity and territorial integrity as well as peace, security and stability of the region,” it said in a statement.On Saturday, the Turkish parliament extended a mandate for Turkish troop deployments to Syria and Iraq. The Turkish military has been conducting exercises near the Iraq border.Erkan Akcay, a Turkish MP, said, “With this motion we say categorically that we’re not joking about suddenly coming at night, or not playing games, and we can afford anything at all for the survival of Turkey.” He added: “The pirate referendum which is illegal and unacceptable should be cancelled before it is too late.”On Monday Iraq and Turkey announced joint drills on the Turkish border with the Iraqi Kurdish region. Erdogan said, ""Our military is not (at the border) for nothing. We could arrive suddenly one night.""Baghdad IncensedAt the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Eshaiker al-Jaafari said, “We reject the referendum which is trying to force Iraq to make decisions to keep unity.”The disputes between Erbil and Baghdad are complex, but the two biggest problems are oil and disputed territories. Baghdad has withheld federal money from Erbil because it is independently selling oil at a discount through Turkey rather than through the central government.The even bigger concerns are territories that both Baghdad and Erbil claim as theirs, especially the disputed city of Kirkuk. Perhaps the most brazen aspect of Barzani’s referendum is that he extended it to the areas under dispute.Kirkuk has a complicated demographic history, allowing Kurds, Turkmen and Arabs to claim it as their own. The al-Tikriti family was the main Arab family in Kirkuk in the Seventeenth Century. A Kurdish tribe made it their capital in the Eighteenth Century. Turkmen have been present since the Eleventh Century, and became the majority as the Ottomans moved in more Turkmen in the early Twentieth Century.By the Treaty of Ankara, registered with the League of Nations in 1926, Kirkuk became a part of the Kingdom of Iraq. Until the 1930s, Kirkuk was a largely Turkmen town, but after oil was discovered there was an influx of Arab and Kurdish workers. According to the 1957 census, the last one taken, Kirkuk city was 37,63 percent Iraqi Turkmen; 33.26 percent Kurdish; with Arabs and Assyrians making up less than 23 percent of its population.A short-lived 1970 autonomy agreement with the Kurds was ended in 1974 when a new law excluded Kurdish enclaves from oil-rich areas and the city’s boundaries were redrawn to create an Arab majority. From 1991 – the time of the first Gulf War – to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, about 500,000 Kurds were expelled from Kirkuk and surrounding towns, according to Human Rights Watch. Arab families were settled in their place.After the 2003 invasion, thousands of displaced Kurds moved back into Kirkuk. In 2014, when ISIS attacked the city and Iraqi National Army troops fled, the Kurdish peshmerga took control.There has been no census taken since 1957, creating confusion about the city’s current demography. A planned referendum in 2007 for the people of Kirkuk to decide whether they wanted to belong to Baghdad or Erbil has never been held.Barzani’s decision to include Kirkuk and other disputed areas in the referendum has incensed Baghdad. Last week, the central government dismissed the Kurdish governor of Kirkuk governorate, but he refused to step down.Iran’s InterestsTurkmen, who were once the majority, are vehemently opposed to Kurdish independence and are expected to boycott the vote. The leader of a Shia militia warned earlier this month that his group had a green light from its backers in Teheran to attack Kirkuk.The Imam Ali Division’s spokesman Ayoub Faleh said the city would be attacked if it became part of a Kurdish state. “Kirkuk belongs to Iraq,” Faleh said. “We would by no means give up on Kirkuk even if this were to cause major bloodshed.”Hadi al-Amiri, secretary-general of the Badr Organization, an Iraqi party close to Iran, said the organization would also fight. “We will resort to arms if we [as Iraqis] establish a federal system on an ethnic or sectarian basis,” Amiri said in a Sept. 4 interview with the Kurdish channel Rudaw.Ali Shamkhani, the head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said this month there would be “implications” if the Kurds leave Iraq.Russia has maintained a low public profile on the Iraqi Kurdish question. Russians officials have said they prefer Iraq to remain united but that independence was a legitimate aspiration. As the Kurds will not declare independence immediately, the attention being focused on it by the U.S., Turkey, Iran and Baghdad has only ratcheted up tensions. But will it lead to military conflict?Chances of Military InterventionThe foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq and Iran met last week n New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said they would coordinate their response to the referendum.Turkey and Iran’s greatest concern is the effect the referendum may have on its own Kurdish populations. For more than a year Turkey has been engaged in renewed warfare against Turkish Kurdish rebels. Iran periodically crushes uprisings in its Kurdish areas. Neither country would gain from diverting resources to Iraqi Kurdistan away from their own Kurdish populations.Barzani said at a press conference on Sunday that Iraqi Kurds “support peaceful solution in those countries but we do not support violence to settle the Kurdish question in those countries.”Though I’ve heard fear here of Iranian military intervention, such a move would hand a perfect casus belli to the United States and Israel to attack Iran, something Teheran certainly does not want to provoke.A joint military operation of Turkey, Iran and the Iraqi National Army might gain some victories, though the peshmerga are hardened fighters, who would be motivated by self-defense. Also political will and resources would surely be tested in all three capitals if a long-term occupation were attempted against a Kurdish insurgency.Turkey this week returned troops to Syria to put down Syrian Kurdish aspirations there. As the irredentist Turkish President Erdogan himself has questioned the post-World I settlement that gave Iraq the Ottoman’s Mosul Vilayet, which included Kurdish areas and Kirkuk, military adventurism on his part cannot be ruled out.But military intervention is unrealistic. The Prime Minister of the Kurdish region, Nechirvan Barzani, said last week: “I do not see any military attack at all on the Kurdistan Region. It is impossible to happen. Military threats against what? Against the referendum? I do not foresee that at all. Even if they take other measures, as allegedly they are going to do, but military option is impossible.”“Turkey is free to do whatever it wants to do within its own boundaries. So is Iran,” said Barzani, a nephew of the president. “But if it is expected that they will come and use military means against a referendum being held in Kurdistan – it is impossible. They will not do such things, because it is not in their interest.”What Makes a State?Do the Iraqi Kurds have a legal argument for statehood? The Montevideo Convention of 1933 laid out the requirements for statehood in customary international law. “The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.” “The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states,” the Convention says. The Kurds of Iraq qualify on all four points.But there is another theory of statehood going back to the Fourteenth Century and affirmed by the 1815 Congress of Vienna, namely that a sovereign state depends on recognition by other states. So far only one nation has declared it would recognize Kurdish independence from Iraq: Israel.“(Israel) supports the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to achieve their own state,” said Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sept. 13. The motive can be seen in Israel’s longstanding defensive position to weaken Arab states surrounding them. In a Kurdish State Israel would be able to set up an embassy and legally operate from there. Israel has had ties with the Iraqi Kurds since the 1960s and as Sy Hersh pointed out in 2004, Israel launched missions from Iraqi Kurdistan to stir up Kurds in both Iran and Syria. ( I’ve learned from a source close to Barzani that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates privately support the referendum, but neither country has said so publicly.)The Palestinians meet the same legal requirements of a state and in addition have more than 130 nations recognizing Palestinian statehood. The U.N. in 2012 granted Palestine Observer State status. Like the Kurds, however, the Palestinians face political and not legal obstacles. The opposition of Israel, which occupies its lands, and the United States, has so far made Palestinian statehood politically impossible.Dream of Long-Suffering KurdsThe borders drawn by the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, divided Kurds inside the borders of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. In the 1920 Treaty of Sevres between Britain and France and the defeated Ottomans, the Kurds were promised a future state in northern Iraq. Based on that, in 1922 Sheikh Mahmud Barzinji declared a Kurdish Kingdom, but it was crushed by two years of British aerial bombardment.During those two years, in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne Britain and France withdrew their promise to the Kurds and turned Kurdish areas over to Baghdad. Except for Barzinji’s short-lived Kurdish Kingdom and the Mahabad Republic in northern Iran in 1946, which lasted only a year before the Iranian government executed its leaders, Kurds have never had their own state.The 1958 Iraqi Constitution declared that “the Arabs and Kurds are associated in this nation.” But that ended five years later when the Baath Party came to power. To weaken the Baath’s links with Moscow, the U.S., Israel and Iran supplied Iraqi Kurds to rebel against Baghdad in 1972. This lasted for three years until Iran and Iraq settled their differences in the Algiers agreement, backed by Henry Kissinger, then Secretary of State. That suddenly cut off Iran’s support for the Iraqi Kurds, and allowed years of repression from Baghdad to culminate in the massacre by Saddam Hussein of as many as 5,000 Kurdish civilians with poison gas in Halabja in 1988.Kurdish uprisings in the neighboring nations have been likewise crushed over the decades. Turkey has fought a 30-year war against a Kurdish insurgency demanding independence. Iran has periodically cracked down on its Kurdish population.In 2004, the Syrian government put down Kurdish protests. Syrian Kurds have gained a measure autonomy from Damascus since joining the fight against ISIS, but aspirations for a Syrian autonomous state in a proposed Syrian federation still faces government opposition and will likely be resolved one way or the other once the six-year-old Syrian war ends.Iraqi Kurdish AutonomySince the U.S. attack on Iraq in 1991, the Kurdish population of roughly 8.4 million in the north has enjoyed a large measure of autonomy from Baghdad. At the end of the first Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush called for the Shia in the south and the Kurds of the north to rebel against Saddam Hussein. They did but Bush did not back up his words with military support, and both were slaughtered. Kurds rushed to the mountains towards Turkey, where they were trapped when Ankara closed the border. The U.S. then led a no-fly zone in the north and south, which protected the Kurds and gave them a measure of autonomy from Baghdad.The Kurdish Regional Government now has its own flag, its own government ministries, its own army, its own parliament (which met for the first time in two years last week to approve the referendum), and issues its own visas to foreign visitors. But Kurds here still carry Iraqi passports and deal in Iraqi dinars and U.S. dollars. The fight against ISIS and the drop in oil prices hit this region hard, with government workers going months without being paid.Economic infrastructure for a modern state is lacking. There is no rail service and the first stretch of a highway was opened only this year within the city of Erbil. It does not link with other Kurdish cities. There is no national Kurdish museum in Erbil.In 2005, the Kurds held a referendum, which passed with 98.8 percent favoring independence from Iraq. Kirkuk also voted 98.8 percent in favor. Nothing came of the referendum however.In January 2016 Barzani, who was born in 1946 in the short-lived Mahabad Republic, declared that the Sykes-Picot era was over and called for a referendum, which he postponed until ISIS was defeated. Mosul was liberated this summer, opening the way for the vote.Kurds have suffered for decades under British and then Arab rule. But given its relative stability with semi-autonomy and the negative consequences that can come from Monday’s vote, there appears to be little to be materially gained from the referendum.But the Kurdish decision is beyond the realm of pragmatism. It may seem a flight of dangerous romanticism to outsiders. But to the long-suffering Kurds, who have been mistreated by their neighbors for decades, if not centuries, there appears to be no choice.“We are ready to pay any price for our independence,” Barzani told a press conference on Sunday.

He tweets or says something outrageous at a time when the leadership of the president of the United States is needed the most. At a time when more than 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico are dealing with the catastrophic aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the Russia scandal continues to burn embers and a war of words continue to escalate with North Korea, what does Trump do?He calls black players protest police brutality names and rescinds an invitation to NBA player Stephen Curry after he refuses the invitation to the White House for winning the NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors.And he got what he wanted, a firestorm of response. He is apt at the politics of division, using them as a diversion from the larger picture. He is attempting to hijack what was a statement against racial injustice in America and dilute the issue to make it solely about the American flag and the national anthem.It is also apparent that Trump has no respect for the Constitution and the First Amendment rights protected within it. He has brought new meaning to the term “bully pulpit” as he continues to punch private citizens, this time by calling for black athletes who are exercising their freedom of speech to be fired.Trump’s response to these protests are in stark contrast to President Obama’s, who in a 2016 presidential town hall was questioned about football players taking a knee in protest and used the opportunity to call for dialogue and understanding. “Out of these controversies, we start a conversation,” Obama said. “I want everybody to listen to each other.”In 2016, ex-San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the #TakeAKnee protests when he refused to stand for the national anthem as a way of calling attention to police brutality and racial inequality in America. He quickly became a national pariah to conservatives and the media. ESPN hosts regularly blasted him and news channels would play clips of angry football fans yelling at the camera in anger over Kaepernick taking a knee during the anthem.Kaepernick is now a free agent, with some believing that his protests are the reason as to why he remains unsigned for the 2017 season.The NFL has always had a traditional American character. It has been an official sponsor of the U.S. military for years, acting as an effective recruiter for the pentagon. Its demographics consist of a fan base that is roughly 83 percent white, 64 percent male, 51 percent 45 years or older, only 32 percent made less than $60,000 a year, with registered Republicans 21 percent more likely to be NFL fans than registered Democrats.Considering all that, it was surprising to see the #TakeAKnee protests went viral on Sunday, as dozens of players, and even team owners, knelt or stood with arms locked together in solidarity as a response to Donald Trump’s attacks against black athletes. The Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room during the anthem.Peaceful protests, such as #TakeAKnee and #BlackLivesMatter, are considered controversial to some as they happen. That is the history of race in this country. But these efforts are justified and effective in calling attention to injustice. Protests, even those that seem to be obviously just in hindsight, are rarely popular as they are going on.During the Civil Rights Movement, for example, 61 percent of Americans approved of the 1961 Freedom Riders sit-ins and 57 percent thought that they hurt chances of desegregation, vs. 22 percent who approved and 28 percent who thought they helped. Meanwhile, 6 in 10 Americans had an unfavorable opinion of the historic March on Washington, compared to 23 percent who found it favorable. A poll conducted in 1966 found that 85 percent of white respondents thought that “demonstrations by negroes” hurt the advancement for civil rights compared to 15 percent who thought they helped.It is unfortunate that the current president is attempting to obfuscate the issue of racial inequality in America. His sympathy towards white supremacists is well documented and he will surely continue to divide the American public in an effort to score cheap political points. However, racial inequity in this country has been around before Trump and will continue beyond his presidency. The actions of people, such as Colin Kaepernick, help to highlight these injustices to the general public.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."
60,BUSINESS,You’re Hired! Change The Process To Fill The Gender Gap So Women In Tech Win,"Michele Weldon, ContributorAuthor, Journalist, Emerita Faculty at Northwestern University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/youre-hired-change-the-process-to-fill-the-gender_us_59c8ff64e4b0f2df5e83b000,"The women in tech pipeline problem starts not with whether or not a male or female candidate is hired, but how a candidate",2017-09-25,<p>Maia Bittner has a solution to filling the gender gap in tech: new hiring practices.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c8ffbf1a00007400f085a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The women in tech pipeline problem starts not with whether or not a male or female candidate is hired, but how a candidate is hired.Maia Bittner, tech startup investor, advisor, engineer, and Pinch co-founder, who previously launched Rocksbox, a startup that raised $12.3 million, says the problem is the hiring process itself favors men.“Often women do not come across in a way that gets them hired. I needed to change the interviews and focus on resourcefulness,” says Bittner, a 2011 graduate of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, an entrepreneurship-focused startup engineering college with a degree in Cognitive Science.Recently “three female former employees of Alphabet’s Google filed a lawsuit accusing the tech company of discriminating against women in pay and promotions,” according to Fortune.“The plaintiffs are a former Google software engineer, a former communications specialist and a former manager who worked in various roles at the Mountain View, Calif.-based company. They claim Google pays women in California less than men who perform similar work, and assigns female workers jobs that are less likely to lead to promotions.”Other recent headlines about discrimination and harassment in tech at Uber, SoFi, Tesla, Greylock, Binary Capital, Ignition Partners, Google and more, point to an imbalance in tech.“The soul-searching isn’t limited to firms that were engaged in litigation,” writes Maya Kasoff in Vanity Fair. ”Even tech leaders who haven’t been accused of sordid harassment are grappling publicly with their complicity in an industry culture that has too often treated women as sex objects instead of equals. Still, it says much about Silicon Valley that so much of its self-reflection has been extracted at knifepoint.In a recent interview with Jessica Guyunn in USA Today, on the release of her new book, Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change, author Ellen Pao, chief diversity officer for Kapor Center for Social Impact, a venture partner at Kapor Capital and co-founder of the nonprofit Project Include, says:There is a belief in tech that not everybody is equal. You hear that when you hear people talk about women being biologically less oriented or less skilled at engineering. You hear that when you hear people talking about lowering the bar to bring in women and people of color. It’s a view that now has become less popular because people are seeing the research. They are seeing the studies that show that diversity on teams improves performance. They are seeing the problems with products that are built by a small homogeneous group of people in failing to address a wider audience.That inequality may well start in the interview process.“In the traditional interview, men are faster and more confident,” says Bittner, a Washington state native who made her first HTML webpage in 9th grade. “But that doesn’t make a good engineer in the workforce. They don’t always have the right answers immediately.”So the hiring model she initiated at Rocksbox, a subscription service she launched in 2012 for wearing design jewelry on loan, is to “have a candidate sit and work with a lead engineer on a problem together. You can ask questions and they will work together.”Bittner says she hired 10 engineers this way, five of whom are women.This “boot camp model” of the candidate working on a project with a team engineer for about two weeks – paid ― reveals if the candidate is a good fit. And not if the person interviews well.“I don’t care if they know the algorithm off the top of the heads. I wanted to measure resourcefulness,” says Bittner, who worked as an intern in 2007 in Silicon Valley on a startup.Working with a candidate’s schedule, Bittner says if she is employed, the candidate can work after hours or weekends on a project. At Pinch, in development since May 2016 and launching as an app nationwide this fall, Bittner has hired four engineers this way.“A lot of people are underestimated and we have not evaluated them accurately,” says Bittner. “Our way is more instructive for the candidate and gives a much more accurate view” of what to expect, she says.“A small percentage of engineers are women, and even if only 20 percent are women, at a big company like Google, you see a lot of women engineers. But for people who work in a 10-person company, odds are you agree the only woman engineer and the only woman at the company. They feel like they are the only ones,” Bittner says. “In the early stages, I never knew there were other people like me.”Pinch is a startup she founded with fellow Olin alum Michael Ducker and not under consideration in a credit rating. “The idea is it can get you out of a pinch.”The app offers renters the best way to pay rent—automatically—and reports each payment to the credit bureau, a large component for many people in a “pinch” whose rent payment is their greatest expense.“We were interested in financial stability,” Bittner says, and Pinch started as an insurance company, following a 2011 accident when she was hit by a car as a pedestrian.“I had this horrible insurance experience and $100,000 in medical bills,” she says, which were finally paid by her father’s car insurance policy. As it turns out, if you are a pedestrian hit by a car, your auto insurance covers it.After investigating the possibilities of doing insurance on a loan, Bittner and Ducker decided “the insurance part didn’t make sense.”Bittner is an early-stage startup investor with  Parcel B. Her passion and expertise is with the “zero to one” stage of a company ― the composition of skills needed to get a new project off the ground. She has a passion for meeting founders to talk through new ideas and how to build successful companies.Though she has been involved in tech full time for less than a decade, Bittner is doing all she can to make a difference for women engineers and entrepreneurs. She hosts a quarterly brunch at her home called Series XX for about 20 women in startups to connect with other women, share advice, and build a community.Bittner is also an early-stage investor with Parcel B, named for the parcel of undeveloped land at her alma mater, Olin.With all these initiatives, Bittner says in her time in tech she has seen changes. “You see groups demanding people be held accountable for they treat women, pay, diversity numbers—it is all much more forceful,” she says. “You also see more junior women see that tech is more attractive as a career choice.”As for her number one piece of advice for a woman in tech at a start-up as an engineer or founder, “Have someone you can call on a programming issue, It’s a simple thing that can have you stuck for weeks.”She also advises young women to call out sexist remarks and silencing behaviors. Working on Rocksbox, Bittner says in the funding stage she was asked if we were going to have kids. “I have a lot of guy friends and no one ever asked them if they would be having kids,” Bittner says.As for getting interrupted in a meeting, Bittner acknowledges that as someone who has successfully founded two start-ups, she has more power than many women early in their careers.“When I get interrupted, I point to the guy and say, ‘Do not interrupt me.’”This ran originally in Take The Lead.

When I was about 18 years old, I got into a fight with another young woman. After the fight, her father pressed charges against me and I was ultimately convicted of assault at 19 and sentenced to five years of probation. After successfully completing two years of my sentence, a court set aside my conviction and dismissed the indictment against me. I took to heart a statement in the court’s order that thereafter I would be “released from all penalties and disabilities” stemming from my conviction.For decades, that incident was merely a footnote in my life. I went on to work for the city of Dallas, including a stint in the Marshal’s office, and retired after 28 years. I also worked for several years as a home health aide. All the while, I spent countless hours volunteering at the church my father founded, where I cooked in the kitchen, helped run a clothing donation program, and prepared lunches for kids during the summer.But in 2013, the past I thought I had put behind me — a past the court released me from — reared its ugly head. Looking for ways to supplement my income in retirement and continue to help children, I took a job as a crossing guard for Dallas County Schools. Just eight days after starting, my supervisor came to see me at my post and told me that I needed to contact human resources. When I did, I was informed that there was something on my record that made me ineligible to work for the school system and I was fired.I was shocked. After already working 28 years for the city of Dallas, I couldn’t imagine what on my record could prevent me from becoming a crossing guard. Then I realized that it was my decades-old conviction. Conversations with school officials confirmed that, at age 57, I was being denied a job for a mistake I made when I was barely 18.Unfortunately, stories like mine are commonplace in Texas, where millions of people from all backgrounds will see an arrest or conviction in their lifetime. Yet certain Texas officials don’t want to help people like me, who have made mistakes and want to move on from them, to get jobs. Instead, they want to give Texas employers the power to deny jobs to people in my situation.In 2012, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adopted a guidance for how to consider criminal records in the hiring process. It advises employers to consider an applicant’s offense, how long ago the offense occurred, and whether the offense has any relationship to the job sought. The guidance also advises employers to give job applicants with records a chance to explain their past.Texas contends that this guidance is illegal and, in 2014, the state filed a lawsuit against the EEOC, asking a federal court to declare that various state agencies and other Texas employers have the authority to categorically deny jobs to applicants based on criminal convictions.My experience with Dallas County Schools shows why job applicants and employees with records need employers to use the guidance. Because, when employers adopt broad bans on hiring employees with convictions, it unjustly harms people like me — people with very old criminal records that aren’t relevant to the job at hand, and who are willing and able to perform the job. These policies are especially unfair when they prevent applicants from being able to explain their pasts. When I applied to work for the city of Dallas, for instance, I was given a chance to explain my record, which is consistent with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s guidance. But when I was dismissed from Dallas County Schools, I had no meaningful opportunity to clarify the decades-old incident or describe the path I’ve walked in the many decades since.Perhaps that is the most hurtful part of the blanket prohibitions that Texas is seeking: they’re not only unjust; they’re dehumanizing. Work confers a sense of purpose and dignity on a person. It enables us to provide for our families and feel integrated into our community and valued by society. Hiring bans have the opposite effect. These policies don’t just deny paychecks; they rob people of self-esteem. They tell people that they can never transcend the deeds of their past, no matter how distant or inconsequential.In many ways, I’ve been lucky. In 2014, I found a good job as a school cafeteria worker with the Dallas Independent School District, which recognized that my criminal record had no bearing on my fitness as an employee. But I am deeply concerned that if Texas wins its lawsuit, far too many people with similar backgrounds won’t be as fortunate and will lose out on opportunities to work. That’s why civil rights lawyers are seeking to join the case, on my behalf, to defend the guidance in federal court by presenting my story and those of other workers who’d be hurt if Texas wins.Our position is clear. Elected officials should not be using taxpayer dollars and time bringing lawsuits to make it harder for Texans to find work. Rather, they should be dedicated to making Texas a more inclusive and prosperous state for all who call it home. I know firsthand that giving people a chance to overcome their mistakes is an important step in that direction.This commentary originally appeared in The Marshall Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system.

The comedian and his wife, Brynn O’Malley, welcomed their first child ― a baby girl ― in July. “It’s life, man. It’s life. Crazy,” he told Entertainment Tonight when asked how he was adjusting to fatherhood. In a new interview with People, Moynihan spoke further about being a new dad. “I’m taking to it a lot,” he said. “I was much more terrified leading up to it, but it’s not as scary as I thought it would be.” He added that the baby was sleeping pretty well. “We got a good kid.” The hosts asked Moynihan if it was more exhausting to have a baby or to be a “Saturday Night Live” cast member“It’s the same thing,” he joked. “Nine months of torture, and then 18 years of having anxiety about [everything].” Anxiety aside, Moynihan seems ready to raise a strong, confident daughter. He announced his wife was expecting a baby girl back in June with a sweet Wonder Woman tribute on Instagram.Addressing “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenks in his caption, he wrote, “Thanks for making it easier to be a Dad. What an amazing, beautiful movie. Thanks to you and @gal_gadot.”"

She followed with cult favorite Adventures in Babysitting and box office smash Cocktail, opposite Tom Cruise. Being cast against public perception in Mike Figgis’ unexpected 1995 hit Leaving Las Vegas proved a tipping point for Shue. As a prostitute in a doomed relationship with a suicidal alcoholic (played by Nicolas Cage), she earned a “Best Actress” nomination at the 1996 Academy Awards. Though Susan Sarandon picked up the trophy for Dead Man Walking (with Cage winning “Best Actor” for Leaving Las Vegas), it seemed Shue was ready to embark on a career as a serious dramatic actress. According to the Delaware native, that didn’t happen quite as anticipated. “I kind of scrounged around and kept working,” Shue told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBT Podcast.In the meantime, Shue started a family with husband and documentarian Davis Guggenheim. Together they have three children, including teen daughters. Despite quality roles being scarce for the better part of a decade, “the balance was right,” the Oscar nominee stated.“I really love being a Mom, and I would have hated so much to miss out on any of their moments,” said Shue of lulls in her Hollywood career. “I’m really grateful I could just plug along and barely stay in [acting].”Pressure to contribute financially to the household — “I was putting that burden on my husband too much,” Shue admitted, “It was pretty unfair” — eventually prompted her to find “something [she] could both make a living at and where [she] really respected the people involved.” An ongoing role on televised drama Crime Scene Investigation: CSI did both.“I adore Ted Danson,” Shue gushed about her costar and CSI series lead. “The cast members in that show are just top-notch, and the crew, the producers are just really, really hard-working, lovely, lovely people.”After more than three seasons on the ratings powerhouse, Shue moved on. On Sept. 22, she returned to select Silver Screens with a film she places next to Leaving Las Vegas in personal significance — Battle of the Sexes.The historical bio-pic recounts the monumental 1973 tennis match between the world’s female best Billie Jean King and former great and self-declared “Male Chauvenist Pig” Bobby Riggs. It opens nationwide Sept. 29. Battle of the Sexes explores more than simply the tumultuous social climate for women at the time. King, played by Oscar-winner Emma Stone, leads a charge for gender pay equality in the sport as the production simultaneously delves into the private lives of all involved.“People don’t realize how rare it is to be in movies you really care about and you’re proud to be in,” said Shue of the role as Riggs’ wife Priscilla, as reported in a previous article. “I’m grateful I got to be in another film that means as much to me” as Leaving Las Vegas.WATCH: Battle of the Sexes TrailerA key component of the film, of course, is King’s struggle with her own sexuality. As Bobby (Steve Carell) and Priscilla’s marriage crumbles amid his gambling addiction and push to remain relevant as a storied pro career fades in the rear view, Billie Jean is coming to terms with her lesbian identity — despite being married at the time herself.However, Shue opines the film has “evolved past” the “pigeonhole” of being strictly a “movie about gay people.” Though King has grown into an icon for both feminism and the LGBTQ community, like the tennis legend herself, the film’s message is far more “universal” than just her lesbian identity.“I don’t see her that way — at all — zero part of me sees her that way,” Shue said of King. “I know my daughter doesn’t.” To that end, for Shue, a testament to the film’s power came after attending its premiere with her children. Her 16-year-old daughter, the actress said, “became very emotional” at the movie’s climactic end. Though self-proclaimed “tennis fanatic” Shue recalls “The Battle of the Sexes” and King, her daughter has no connection to either beyond the film. Yet she was deeply impacted by a scene showing Stone sobbing privately in the spectacle’s aftermath.“She said, ‘I feel like she is crying for all of us, whenever we feel less than,’” Shue recalled. “Here I am, a woman who is pretty evolved and relatively brave — could be more brave when it comes to speaking out,” she shared. “And here my daughter, who I have hopefully raised as a powerful woman as well, knows inside there might be something ‘less than’ in her...just because she’s a girl.” Shue sighed audibly thinking about the messages society sends each of us, whether based on gender, sexuality or more. “We think we’re stupid or we’re overweight or...” she trails off. “There’s a million ways people feel ‘less than.’”Like Battle of the Sexes, though, Shue is optimistic that — while reality lags behind the ideal — progress is being made.“I think our younger generation is incredibly more evolved even than my generation and the generation before,” she stated.“I know in my heart, things are changing for the better,” Shue concluded. “It’s just so slow and annoying that there are still people out there who are small-minded and fearful and take their judgments out on other people because they really don’t like themselves.”Battle of the Sexes starring Emma Stone, Steve Carell, Elisabeth Shue, Bill Pullman and Sarah Silverman opens nationwide Sept. 22.Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.LISTEN: Elisabeth Shue discusses Battle of the Sexes, Ross Mathews talks RuPaul’s Drag Race on Party Foul Radio."
64,POLITICS,When Will The Economy Start Caring About Home-Care Work?,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-will-the-economy-start-caring-about-home-care_us_59c941ebe4b0b7022a646ca4,"The workers’ complaints centered on low wages and a lack of training, among other issues.",2017-09-25,<p>A home-care worker in Miami helps her client get dressed.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c942231a00002250f0869d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Annie LowreyFor six weeks, LaTanya Thomas, a personal-care assistant in Minneapolis, worked without pay, helping to clean, dress and feed her client. She and her colleagues asked their boss where their paychecks were. They spoke with the bank. They accepted five- or 10-dollar bills as a little something to tide them over, she said, rolling their eyes when their boss promised that their checks would be cleared by Monday and when she told them to go sign up for food stamps. They threatened to quit. Eventually, some of them did, and eventually, the company went bankrupt. (Its lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.)“I hung in there because of the client I was taking care of,” Thomas told me. “His other [personal-care assistants] had quit because they couldn’t work without pay. But he was on a special program, and I was the only one left who could take care of him.” That decision ultimately cost her $4,000 in lost wages, she estimated.Home-health and personal-care work is one of the country’s fastest-growing occupational sectors. But it is one marked by low pay and meager benefits, a problem that might become more urgent as the U.S.’s population continues to age. On top of that, care workers face high rates of wage theft, tax and benefits misclassification, and employer fraud, according to a new report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), a think tank and advocacy organization.RELATED: The Forgotten ProvidersNELP surveyed more than 3,000 personal-care and home-health workers, from nearly every U.S. state, asking questions about their pay schedules and relationship with their employers. A majority of respondents said that they often worked after-hours, without pay. Two in five said they never received overtime payments, even when they worked more than 40 hours per week. Four in five said they did not have a paid sick-day benefit. A quarter were potentially misclassified as independent contractors.“There were parts that were not particularly shocking, about poor working conditions, low wages, and the challenges these workers face every day just to stay in this field,” Caitlin Connolly, one of the report’s authors, said. “For me, the more startling pieces were in terms of the stark differences in insurance coverage, paid time off, retirement coverage, and training opportunities.”Thomas, for instance, alleged two incidents of wage theft during her time as a personal-care assistant. “People in this occupation do not even know it’s wage theft,” she told me. “One lady was working overtime, and they cut her regular per-hour pay. I said, ‘That’s wage theft!’ There’s no way they can cut your regular pay so they aren’t getting you a real time-and-a-half.”RELATED: ‘Let Us Give Our Families the Care We Give Your Families’The workers’ complaints centered on low wages and a lack of training, among other issues. In the NELP’s study, most respondents reported making between $7.25 an hour, the federal minimum wage, and $15 an hour. Four in five said they got fewer hours than they requested, too. Given those pay rates, about half of personal-care workers rely on programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program — itself often difficult to get and penurious with benefits — to get by.Thomas and other respondents said that personal relationships with their clients kept them on the job, despite the low wages, difficult working conditions, and fraud. “I’ve worked with a 97-year-old woman for the past two years. I try to treat her with so much tender loving care and she always reminds me of how much she loves me,” one worker said in the report. “I help to lift up her spirits. Home care is not just about going by the care plan. It doesn’t say ‘Comfort her’ or ‘Make her feel like she’s a part of society.’”RELATED: Who Will Care for America’s Seniors?Improving training programs for personal-care workers might help both with the quality of the work and the quality of client life, the report indicated. The vast majority of workers said they wanted more training to improve their skills and better serve their clients. That might help with the country’s health-care cost crisis, as well. “Many acute, long-term illnesses can be cared for in the home. This was never really a babysitting job,” said Anastasia Christman, a senior policy analyst at NELP. “These workers see it as, and want to become, more specialized, to provide people with the best service for specific conditions and letting them remain in the home.” Connolly added: “I don’t want to over-medicalize the profession, but there are untapped opportunities there.”Even absent that upskilling of the workforce, the report stressed the need for bolstering workplace protections, improving pay rates, boosting unionization rates, addressing labor misclassification and putting in place more stringent rules on time off and benefits to aid all workers. And labor experts and state officials have long advocated for more oversight of firms supplying home-care workers, which are often subject to far less scrutiny than nursing homes and medical facilities. “If you train people well in the job, they’ll do well,” Thomas said. “If you pay people right, they’ll continue to work.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Why Happy People Cheat, The First White President"

While the wording of the order left little clarity about how the controversial law would be enforced while litigation plays out, Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez abandoned the state’s most contentious “sanctuary” policy.Since Feb. 1, Hernandez had declined to honor requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented immigrants on the federal government’s behalf unless the suspect was charged with or convicted of one of a short list of violent crimes, including murder and human trafficking. But hours after Monday’s ruling, Hernandez met with county attorneys and decided to rescind the policy. The Travis County Sheriff’s Office will now honor all such requests from ICE, known as “detainers,” spokeswoman Kristen Dark said. “As I have maintained throughout this process, I have not violated federal or state law, nor do I intend,” Hernandez said in a statement. “Our policy has been updated to comply with the findings of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.” Senate Bill 4 forbids local governments from using so-called sanctuary policies to limit the cooperation between local law enforcement officers and federal immigration authorities. The law, as passed by the Texas Legislature in May, requires local officials to honor all requests from federal authorities to hold undocumented immigrants in local jails on their behalf, including those who would otherwise be freed because their charges were dropped or a judge allowed them to be released on bond. SB 4 makes it possible for the state to jail local officials who pass sanctuary policies for up to a year and allows police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop for any reason.Several jurisdictions ― including the South Texas town of El Cenizo; the capital, Austin; and Houston, the state’s largest city ― are challenging SB 4’s constitutionality.  U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia slapped a preliminary injunction on several provisions of SB 4 last month, keeping most of it from going into effect. But Monday’s unanimous ruling by the three 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges reversed two parts of Garcia’s injunction. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated Monday’s ruling, issuing a statement saying it would “allow Texas to strengthen public safety.” “Enforcing immigration law helps prevent dangerous criminals from being released into Texas communities,” Paxton’s statement reads. “I am confident Senate Bill 4 will be found constitutional and ultimately upheld.” Most notably, the panel’s ruling Monday reinstates the part of the law that requires local jails to honor all requests, known as “detainers,” from federal immigration authorities to hold undocumented immigrants who would otherwise be free to go.  But the language left it unclear how the judges expected local jurisdictions to respond in practice. The panel’s decision says SB 4’s requirement to honor detainers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “does not require detention pursuant to every ICE detainer request; rather, the ‘comply with, honor, and fulfill’ provision mandates that local agencies cooperate according to existing ICE detainer practice and law.”ICE detainers, however, are only requests. Several federal judges have found that holding someone on an ICE detainer who would otherwise qualify for release violates the Fourth Amendment protection against arrest without probable cause. And the part of the law that would punish officials who pass policies limiting detainers remains blocked. The only Texas jurisdiction with a blanket policy denying some classes of ICE detainers is Travis County, which includes Austin. The Travis County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the ambiguous wording of the ruling means it may have little effect in practice, according to Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the groups suing to overturn the law. “As best I can tell right now, it has a very limited effect,” Saenz told HuffPost. “It’s worded in such a way that I don’t see it makes much of a change.… But it is a very cryptic decision, which unfortunately means that local jurisdictions are going to be making their own decisions about what it means.”Efrén Olivares, the racial and economic justice program director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, also finds the ruling on detainers unclear. “The way I read that sentence in the order makes it sound as if detainers are voluntary under federal law, but they are mandatory under state law,” Efrén told HuffPost. “We won’t know until that issue is litigated.”Monday’s ruling largely upheld the rest of García’s injunction on SB 4. A separate panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hold another hearing Nov. 6 to decide whether to keep the law partially blocked while the case winds its way through the federal courts.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Saenz’s title at MALDEF. He is president and general counsel, not executive director."

And because of the ongoing rotation of ominous headlines, some might feel the unwanted side-effects of these domestic hardships has resulted in a narrowing awareness of global crises.However, one headline couldn’t be ignored: Leading Russian Daily Says Chechen Authorities Arresting, Killing Homosexuals. As reported by RFE/RL, the persecution and killing of LGBTQ+ Chechen people is ongoing. Lost amidst the alleged presidential scandals, tweets, and attempted reforms on our own turf, it might be assumed that queer Chechens have seen relief. Instead, it’s stories like these that remind the world that Chechnya still faces what many, ourselves included, consider to be genocide. And it’s only getting worse.The Russian region’s leader Ramzan Kadyrov denies these claims, stating that Chechnya doesn’t have “those kinds of people.” Implying that gays simply don’t exist, Kadyrov asks that if they do [have LGBTQ+ Chechens in their midst], that they be taken far away. The leader believes the removal — ergo murder of their LGBTQ+ citizens — to be an effort to “purify” their blood. “If there are any here, take them.”But the government’s message about ‘purification’ is more literal than symbolic: Families are encouraged to murder their own LGBTQ+ relatives. Journalist Elena Milashina recently told the New Yorker: “We know of six cases in which families were told by the authorities to kill male relatives who were said to be gay. Of those, at least three, maybe four, such killings actually took place.”Voices 4 Chechnya founder and LGBTQ+ activist Adam Eli had to do something. “Growing up, discussions of anti-Semitism, the Holocaust and the plight of the Soviet Jews played a large role in my education and community,” Eli says. “Earlier this year when news broke of the horrors in Chechnya an internal alarm went off. I know my history, and when people are being rounded up, tortured, and murdered for who they are, you must act.”The group quickly emerged as an open invitation, asking anyone to join with or without activism experience. Since its inception, V4C has partnered with RUSA LGBT, a stateside network of Russian-speaking LGBTQ+ individuals that provides community and support for those arriving from Russia, and was accepted to Out In Tech’s annual Digital Corps event that took place on September 23rd. RUSA LGBT co-president Lyosha Gorshkov was born in Russia and lived there until he was 29. “As a kid there was no information [on being gay], and it was treated like it was a disease,” he says. Through working as an activist in the United States, he has made strides in keeping in touch with those abroad and met Chechens who have lost friends to the crisis. “We need to recognize that this is not just an LGBTQ+ issue. Tomorrow, it could be any ethnic minority; it could, again, be Jewish people.”As a group, most members have full-time jobs outside of activism, spending their spare time devoting their talents to the cause. V4C’s members have built a community of friends brought together by a common goal: helping innocent people living in a world much different than their own. And, to keep the temperature of their meetings at a happy medium between their inspiring work and the reality that their efforts will be hard fought, each meeting is ended with a round of ‘slays,’ in which affirmations about what they’ve accomplished are shared.On October 14th, 2017, Voices 4 Chechnya will march from The Stonewall Inn to Trump Tower UN Plaza to demand humanitarian parole visas and raise money for the resettlement of LGBTQ+ Chechen victims. The group is excited to invite everyone to join in on standing up against hate and refusing to let history repeat itself. There is a place for everyone in this march.Together, V4C believes that everyone, no matter who they are or whom they love, is entitled to live without fear. The community has come too far to stand by as the Chechen Republic orders and encourages the capture, torture, and death of its own LGBTQ+ people. In Gorshkov’s words, “Don’t just talk about human rights, fight for human rights.” "

On Sunday evening, Republican senators circulated a new version of their much-disputed legislation to repeal “Obamacare.” Like the initial draft of the bill first introduced by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in late July, the new proposal would decimate existing federal health programs, reduce government spending, and potentially leave millions of Americans without insurance.The new bill, dubbed Graham-Cassidy, would also include an aggressive assault on protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as well as provide a cushion to offset the impact of funding cuts in several states.“It was a tremendous relief that Congress was working in an open, bipartisan way to improve our health care system,” wrote the faith leaders in their letter, referencing efforts by Republicans and Democrats over the last month to collaborate on a plan.“But now, we are outraged that Congress would abandon these efforts for another partisan attempt that would take healthcare away from millions of our people.”The letter garnered signatures from faith leaders in all 50 states. African Methodist Episcopal, Baha’i, Baptist, Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, Presbyterian, Sikh, Episcopal, Unitarian Universalist, and myriad other faith traditions are represented in the letter.In addition to the elements of the new bill that would cut federal health care spending and gut Medicare, the faith leaders also urged Congress to act on two existing health care programs that are up for extension.The Children’s Health Insurance Program and Disproportionate Share Hospitals are both up for renewal on Sept. 30 ― a deadline some fear Congress might miss in the focus on passing the Graham-Cassidy bill. CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to children whose families earn above the income bracket that would make them eligible for Medicaid. DSH offers funds to hospitals with a large share of uninsured and Medicare-insured patients. Hospitals in rural areas would be particularly affected if DSH is not renewed.Republicans hold 52 seats in the Senate and must win over their colleagues before Saturday, when they will lose parliamentary authority to pass a repeal with 50 votes instead of the usual 60. GOP Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have indicated they may vote against the bill.“To allow Graham-Cassidy to pass the Senate – and to allow the CHIP and DSH programs to lapse – is to allow the health of America’s most vulnerable people to face unnecessary and immoral obstacles,” wrote the faith leaders.Several of the signers delivered the letter in person to the Senate ahead of Monday’s finance committee meeting, which drew hundreds of protestors to Capitol Hill. Additional faith leaders lined up outside the hearing in the hope of getting a seat inside, waiting in silent vigil with their religious texts open on their laps, according to a release.“Once again, a group of white, male Senators have crafted a plan that is out of touch with the realities of millions of ordinary families and fails the moral tests of our faith,” said Sister Simone Campbell, of NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, in a statement.The activist nun called the proposal “immoral” and “reckless” and said it would likely most impact “people struggling to get by, the sick, and the elderly—the very people Jesus teaches us to put first.”"

Kate Brown (D) announced Monday that she’s running for reelection and, without naming names, vowed to fight President Donald Trump if he tries to strip away rights from her constituents.“While Washington, D.C. falls apart, Oregonians are coming together,” Brown said in a new campaign video, which opens with dark imagery and flashes Trump’s face. “As your governor, it’s my job to make things better, to stand up to anyone who would take our rights away.”Here’s the video:Brown, who became governor in 2015 with five days notice after the previous governor resigned amid scandal, has emerged as one of the most progressive governors in the nation. She’s overseen a historic minimum wage hike, enacted one of the nation’s strongest mandatory paid sick leave laws, and signed bills requiring background checks on private gun sales, phasing out coal-fired power plants and instating a first-in-the-nation law that registers residents to vote when they get a driver’s license.She’s also specifically taken action to counter Trump’s policies. When the president issued an executive order in January banning people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the country, Brown issued her own executive order forbidding all state agencies from helping federal immigration officials apprehend undocumented immigrants. She also barred state agencies from using public money to create a religious registry.More recently, as Trump and Republicans in Congress have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Brown worked with her state legislature to pass a law that expands health care coverage to just about everyone in Oregon, regardless of income level, citizenship status or gender identity. They passed another law ensuring that not a single child goes without coverage. Once the laws are fully implemented, 95 percent of adults and 100 percent of kids will be covered.“These conversations around the Affordable Care Act, I was committed to expanding access to health care and not going backwards,” Brown told HuffPost in an August interview. “What is happening federally makes me want to fight, fight, fight.”Her election isn’t until 2018, but she’s already got a well-funded Republican challenger vying for her seat.

71,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Message To NFL Players: Shut Up And Play,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dixie-chicks-nfl-protest_us_59c93c54e4b06ddf45fa24b0,Remember what the Dixie Chicks went through during the Bush administration?,2017-09-25,"Buffalo Bills players knelt during the national anthem before their game against the Denver Broncos on Sunday, Sept. 24. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c93cd01a00002650f08680.jpeg?cache=Vxf7Sdy6TT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump spent the weekend going after NFL players who silently protest racial discrimination during the national anthem, calling them sons of bitches who should be taken off the field and fired. His message was that once they put on their uniform, they lose their First Amendment rights. While plenty of people ― including the vast majority of NFL team coaches and owners ― condemned Trump’s remarks, others supported him. Players “have the right to have the First Amendment off the field,” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” He also defended Trump’s use of the term “son of a bitch” to refer to the protesting NFL players, saying, “I think the president can use whatever language he wants to use.”In Indianapolis and Boston, fans booed players who took a knee during the anthem Sunday. And in Buffalo, a longtime employee at the Buffalo Bills’ stadium quit his job out of disgust over players kneeling while the anthem played. “I believe people have the right to protest; I just don’t believe that’s the proper venue for it,” said Erich Nikischer, who vowed never to step foot in the stadium or watch another NFL game ever again until the protests are over. The basic reasoning from Trump and his backers is that these athletes are here to amuse and entertain the public, and they should keep their opinions to themselves.In other words, shut up and play.While Trump has ignited this most recent controversy, the idea that celebrities should grin and bear it is not new.On March 10, 2003, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, Natalie Maines ― the lead singer for the Dixie Chicks ― told a crowd at their concert in London, “Just so you know, we’re on the good side with y’all. We do not want this war, this violence, and we’re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.”That comment ignited a firestorm of criticism once it was picked up by U.S. media. The Dixie Chicks were a hugely successful country music group ― the top-selling female band of all time ― with many fans who were conservative politically. The group received death threats and people pressured country music radio stations to stop playing their songs. Supporters of then-President George W. Bush called Maines a traitor and suggested strapping her to a bomb and dropping her over Baghdad ― all in the name of patriotism and supporting the United States of America. The fallout from the incident was covered in the 2006 documentary called “Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing,” with the title taken from a man who wrote to them and told them to do just that. “Freedom of speech is fine, but by God ... you don’t do it en masse publicly,” one man featured in the film says. Maines’ representative declined an interview request for this piece. The Dixie Chicks’ first album following the controversy was Taking the Long Way, released in 2006. It addressed all they had gone through in the previous three years, including a song with the lyrics, “And how in the world can the words that I said/ Send somebody so over the edge/ That they’d write me a letter sayin’ that I better/ Shut up and sing or my life will be over?”The album was a hit critically, but it received little playtime on country music radio stations. The current NFL protests were started last year by then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee during the national anthem to bring attention to police brutality and racial discrimination. Kaepernick now is unemployed, with teams afraid to hire him and suffer backlash because of his political opinions. Unlike Trump, Bush responded to the Dixie Chicks by saying that the group members were free to speak their mind.″They can say what they want to say,” he said in 2003. “And just because ― they shouldn’t have their feelings hurt just because some people don’t want to buy their records when they speak out. You know, freedom is a two-way street. But I have ― don’t really care what the Dixie Chicks said. I want to do what I think is right for the American people, and if some singers or Hollywood stars feel like speaking out, that’s fine. That’s the great thing about America. It stands in stark contrast to Iraq, by the way.”Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."

Conservative Daily, a page run by the Independent Journal Review, was up 96 percent. Fox News had an 85 percent boost. And Breitbart, which is run by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and whose audience is often seen as representative of Trump’s base, experienced a 132 percent increase in Facebook engagement on Saturday and Sunday — and published the top post on the social network by any major American publisher.The data strongly suggest that the president’s comments on Friday and tweets on Saturday and Sunday fired up his base. Facebook pages typically see higher engagement when their fans are excited about an issue.Breitbart’s top-on-Facebook post was a simple graphic that scorned the protesting NFL players as “anti-American degenerates”:Nearly half a million people had shared that post by noon on Monday. Meanwhile, outlets that present themselves as centrist or left-leaning experienced mostly modest gains by comparison. One major TV network even saw a decline.ThinkProgress, a news site owned by the liberal Center for American Progress, topped that list, with a 53 percent gain in interactions over the weekend. The Washington Post, CNN and The New York Times were up 38 percent, 18 percent and 15 percent, respectively. CBS News saw a 13 percent decline in interactions. Vox, which skews left in its coverage, was down 38 percent.The August-September average covered the period from Aug. 5 to Sept. 24 and included the weekend of Aug. 12-13, when neo-Nazis and white nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a counter-protester and sparking a national discussion about race.The Facebook interaction data from the weekend of the Charlottesville protests are a near mirror-image of the data from this past weekend.That weekend, BuzzFeed News, Vox and NBC News saw the biggest gains, each well over 100 percent. But Conservative Daily and Breitbart saw large declines — 61 percent and 39 percent, respectivelyHuffPost obtained the data through CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned service that provides Facebook analytics and discovery tools to newsrooms. CrowdTangle defines interactions as the sum total of reactions to, comments on and shares of a post.Data for the first 12 hours of Monday suggest this weekend’s trend will continue into the week, with Fox News and Breitbart topping the interactions list for all major publishers."

Minhaj was in Mumbai on Friday to accept the publication’s International Man of the Year award. On stage, he spoke about how his identity as an Indian American has uniquely prepared him to be a correspondent on the “Daily Show” in the age of Trump. “One of the things we’re struggling with right now with our president is, how do you negotiate with him? Democrats want to resist him, Republicans try to coax him,” Minhaj said, in an acceptance speech uploaded to GQ India’s Facebook page. Minhaj then talked about how he’s had experience dealing with another class of individuals we Indians know all too well. People who are sometimes strict, self-important, and can get too big for their britches ― the stereotypical Indian uncle.“Donald Trump is not a 71-year-old white man. He is an Indian uncle,” Minhaj said. “He wears suits that don’t fit, he can’t speak English properly. He works with his idiotic sons, he hates women but loves his daughter,” Minhaj joked. “He makes up words when he gets angry. He is an Indian uncle.”Minhaj then offered some pointers on how to deal with men like that ― nod, agree, and then go negotiate with the real power of the house, the Indian aunty. The comedian said that in this case, that means General John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, who was hired to bring order to the president’s chaotic White House. “Every single press conference, General Kelly is shaking his head the same way every Indian aunty shakes her head at every Indian uncle,” Minhaj said.Watch Hasan Minhaj’s acceptance speech above.

In the wake of the disaster, it took Zirkelbach nearly a full day to reach the low-lying string of islands jutting into the Gulf of Mexico.Zirkelbach didn’t even pull over for a break. She had 44 ill and recovering turtles to return to. When she arrived, Marathon looked like a “war zone.”“It was very scary,” she told HuffPost.Zirkelbach is the manager of The Turtle Hospital in Marathon, the world’s first licensed veterinarian hospital dedicated entirely to serving turtles. Since 1986, the nonprofit has been rescuing, rehabilitating and releasing sea turtles ― five species of which are found along the coast of the Sunshine State ― back into their natural habitats. It has three “turtle ambulances” that it dispatches to pick up creatures in distress, and rescues over 100 turtles a year.More than 50 percent of juvenile sea turtles in developed islands around the equator suffer from a virus called Fibropapilloma, which causes debilitating tumors. Turtles with the condition often succumb to starvation, boat collisions or shark attacks from impaired vision. The Turtle Hospital is one of only four facilities in Florida that treats the issue.While the facility has dealt with a number of storms, no two are alike. Irma, which struck the Keys as a Category 4 on Sept. 10, destroyed homes, temporarily knocked out power and cell service, and killed at least 14 people. Fortunately, The Turtle Hospital was ready ― and managed to save all its turtles.Staffers couldn’t anticipate every challenge the storm brought, but part of preparation is learning from past disasters.“It’s always a concern,” Zirkelbach said of hurricanes in the area. “There’s nothing we can do to prevent them. But we do everything we can to be prepared.”When Hurricane Wilma hit in 2005, wreaking $22.3 billion in damage on Florida, the Turtle Hospital’s disaster systems weren’t nearly as sophisticated as they are now. Turtles were kept in a tidal pool, which overflowed, and a number of the turtles floated out. Wilma flooded the hospital and the organization’s adjacent motel, which was a money-maker for the nonprofit at the time. The motel was shut down following the storm. The hospital also lost quite a bit of expensive medical equipment.After that, the organization received a grant from petroleum company BP distributed by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. It used those funds to improve its hurricane readiness and purchased two 30,000-gallon hurricane tanks.As Hurricane Irma made its way to the Keys earlier this month, staff members at the Turtle Hospital focused their efforts on relocating the turtles from their usual tanks to the more protected ones. Most went into the hurricane tanks, which are located outside on higher ground. The very sick turtles (two are nourished with feeding tubes) went into tanks indoors.The staff also stocked up on food and medical supplies and ensured that their two generators were ready to go.Once all of the turtles were secure, the staff evacuated, other than Richie Moretti, founder and director of the hospital, and Tom Luebke, an engineer at the facility.They remained even when authorities ordered everyone in the Florida Keys to leave. Even Marathon’s fire department and emergency personnel went to the Upper Keys, closer to the mainland.Fortunately for the hospital, its location on the bay side of the island spared it from the intense wreckage other structures suffered. During the storm, the facility lost power and relied on its generators.Moretti and Luebke returned from their homes to the hospital a day after the storm hit, when the roaring winds had died down a bit. They had a satellite phone, but it didn’t work. For a day and a half, the facility had no communication with the outside world.“Nobody heard from anybody,” Zirkelbach said. “We didn’t know if the turtles had survived.” Moretti and Luebke were able to offer up just the basic care ― feeding and medicating the turtles, and draining the smaller tanks home to the very sick turtles. At one point, a few freezers and refrigerators broke down, putting about 300 pounds of live turtle food in peril. The staff quickly stashed the squid and shrimp in other working refrigerators in the facility, which was critical considering the entire area is still running low on supplies.Home Depot, for example, reopened last week, but its suppliers still aren’t coming into the area, Zirkelbach said, and customers there can only purchase 20 items. The local Publix supermarket initially only allowed five customers in at a time.The Turtle Hospital is getting help from its friends across the state. The Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Tampa, for example, flew in with supplies for the Turtle Hospital and other neighboring animal groups.The Turtle Hospital hopes to be fully up and running by Oct. 1. In the meantime, the staff has already resumed rescue and rehabilitation efforts. The turtles are getting back to being pampered, and are reveling in their regular baths.Since the storm hit, the hospital has rescued three turtles. The first, a hatchling, was aptly named “Irma.”Zirkelbach is eager to get out of recovery mode and continue to treat the overwhelming number of sick turtles in the area.Once the hospital reopens, it will also schedule its tours for the public again, as education and raising awareness are a critical component of the nonprofit’s work. As for future hurricanes, Zirkelbach feels confident and prepared. “We’re still here,” Zirkelbach said. “Part of living in paradise is keeping an eye on the storm.”"

The two parties now govern Germany in an unwieldy “grand coalition.”The anti-immigrant AfD, whose leaders have called for Germany’s World War Two army to be honored, rose two points to 13 percent in the latest poll, putting it on course to be the third-largest party.“I hope that our democracy can deal with a party that has said, in my view, intolerable things in the media,” said Kathrin Zimmermann, voting in Berlin. “I hope the right-wing pressure doesn’t get too strong.”Should she win a fourth term, Merkel will join Helmut Kohl, her mentor who reunified Germany, and Konrad Adenauer, who led Germany’s rebirth after World War Two, as the only post-war chancellors to win four national elections.The AfD’s expected entry into the national parliament could signal a break from the steady, consensus-based approach that has marked the post-war period.Coalition-building after the election could be very lengthy as potential partners are unsure whether they really want to share power with Merkel. All major parties refuse to work with the AfD.Electoral arithmetic might push Merkel to renew her grand coalition with the SPD, or she might opt for a three-way alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens.Voting opened at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and will continue until 6 p.m. (1600 GMT), when exit polls will give a first indication of the outcome.(Additional reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Keith Weir)"

81,WORLD NEWS,Germany's Far-Right Enters Parliament For First Time Since WW2,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/germany-far-right-afd-election_us_59c7c14ce4b0cdc77331de06,"The success of the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant AfD party marks a major shift.",2017-09-24,A woman with a headscarf walks past an election campaign poster of the anti-immigration party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c809e21900009b55565636.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Germany’s national election on Sunday handed a far-right nationalist party seats in parliament for the first time since World War II, marking a major shift in the country’s politics as formerly fringe views enter the mainstream.Provisional results show the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, taking around 12.6 percent of the vote and placing third among all parties. The result is a huge victory for the AfD, which was founded in 2013 by anti-eurozone economists but saw a rapid rise in recent years as it embraced an anti-Islam, anti-immigrant platform.“We will take back our country and our people,” Alexander Gauland, one of the AfD’s leading candidates, told a crowd of supporters after exit polls came in. The AfD’s election success is an unsettling development for Germany, which has for decades rejected far-right political movements and held a longstanding discomfort of fervent nationalism. But amid both growing anti-immigration sentiment and a larger fracturing of established party systems in many European nations, modern German politics has shown it’s also not immune to radical right-wing populism.Much of the AfD’s campaign focused on opposing immigration, Islam and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to allow over one million asylum seekers into the country during the peak of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2015. Controversial AfD posters filled German streets with anti-Muslim messages and ethnonationalist sentiment, while an online campaign ad blamed Merkel’s policies for terror attacks on European soil.In a press conference held the week of the election, the AfD’s lead candidates Gauland and Alice Weidel claimed that Islam was a political ideology not a religion and held no place in Germany.The AfD also pushed the boundaries of publicly acceptable views around the country’s history. Candidates including 76-year-old Gauland called for the country to abandon aspects of its continued atonement for its Nazi past, even saying that Germans had a right to be proud of the “achievements” of common soldiers during both world wars.A leaked email reportedly from Weidel claimed that Germany was “overrun” by Arabs and other minorities, while the government was a puppet of the countries that won the Second World War. But the AfD’s rhetoric also mimicked other far-right populist parties in Europe, attempting to appeal to mainstream voters and shift public perception that it’s too radical to support. The party denies its views are racist or that it holds any sympathy for Nazism, instead presenting its attacks on multiculturalism and Islam as merely wanting to preserve national identity and culture.Often more extreme sentiment slipped through their messaging, however, including earlier this year when one candidate slammed the country for its public remembrance of Nazi crimes, saying Berlin’s Holocaust memorial is “a monument of shame in the heart of the capital.”Other parties widely condemned the AfD for its rhetoric and radical views during the campaign. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel likened the party to Nazis, and officials ruled out including the party in any coalition government.Condemnations from establishment politicians did little to dissuade AfD voters, however, whose grievances against the status quo helped push the party into parliament. Exit polls showed that a large part of the AfD’s support came from eastern Germany where the economy has lagged behind the rest of the country, while the party’s support skewed heavily towards men.Although the AfD saw the biggest increase in seats during Sunday’s election, several other smaller parties also capitalized on dissatisfaction with Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and its coalition partner the Social Democratic Party. The environmental Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, for instance, also gained seats as the two largest parties fell in support from last election.The results were similar to other European elections this year, such as France and the Netherlands, where traditional voting blocs shifted and establishment parties suffered losses.In those elections, far-right parties also received historic levels of support even as they failed to actually form governments. But in Germany, where the country’s Nazi past previously made support for the far-right taboo, the success of the AfD has special resonance.The majority of the country will hardly welcome the far-right’s presence, however, and within hours of the exit polls release hundreds gathered in protest outside the AfD election night headquarters in Berlin. Head of the Social Democratic Party Martin Schulz said after the vote that as leader of the party that stood up to Adolf Hitler, he believes that the AfD should be thrown out of parliament. "
