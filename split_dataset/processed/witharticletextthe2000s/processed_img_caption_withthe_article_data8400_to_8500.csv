But what had been perhaps overlooked until recently was how the space race was yet another field where our country slowly, often painfully, made the transition from the era of prejudice to one where we care more about a person’s talents and choices than skin color.This week, while taking my family to the NASA facility at Cape Canaveral, I’ve also kept up with my online college course that I’m teaching. My class, which is diverse in race and gender, is also diverse in opinion, ranging from liberal to conservative. Yet they all seem unified in attacking racism in our discussions and chats on the melting pot. Their only difference seems to be how far we’ve come, or need to go.I’ve been to just about every space facility in America, from California, New Mexico and Texas to Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. In each of these, I’ve focused on the space adventure, the science, the spirit of the pioneer that fits with the American identity, and of course the space race, but rarely how space and race intersected.It was a diverse crowd at the Kennedy Space Center, seeing a diverse array of today’s astronauts and engineers, as well as NASA staff. That was a probably a different story at the time of the early space program, as depicted in the film “Hidden Figures,” a story beloved by my sister-in-law, a scientist herself and leader of a Girl Scout Troop that she took to see the film in the theaters earlier this year in Georgia.The 1950s and 1960s were, indeed, a civil rights battleground. But there was something that scared Americans even more than integration: Sputnik and the Soviet Union. Fears of domination by Communism led to a lot of changes. No longer could we “afford” the discrimination that had occurred in the past. Just as we needed an integrated military based on respect whites had developed for black soldiers, we also needed all hands on deck to face a common foe. What you know became more vital than what you looked like.It wasn’t just the female mathematicians from “Hidden Figures” that played a role. One of my students was proud to say he was from Ronald McNair High School, named for one of the astronauts who gave his life in the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster. The videos weren’t the only ones to display diversity. You could see it among the employees as well, and the visitors that day. Workers informed me that attendance and enthusiasm was up at NASA. As I write this, our kids are watching old episodes of Star Trek for the first time, a show that broke so many barriers on TV.Two African-American staffers told me with great excitement about the visitors from the Hidden Figures movie, as well as actor John Travolta and Vice-President Mike Pence. And one gushed about the visiting astronaut, Ed Gibson, who stayed on Skylab for 84 days. “He’s a real treasure!” she smiled.“We discovered so much about things,” the genial Gibson, a white astronaut, told me later in the day. “We learned so much about living in space, weightlessness, and about the Sun.”Yet we still live in an area of prejudices. One elderly person at our lunch table responded to a comment I made about our college’s desegregation years ago and growth in our African-American student population by saying “Well, maybe that will keep them out of trouble.”As a country, we also learned to unite for a common purpose, putting prejudices and petty jealousies aside. As I saw the large enthusiastic crowds at the Kennedy Space Center, it showed that in America, we are capable of accomplishing so much, when we truly come together as one nation.John A.

It landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone just hours after Tokyo announced it would increase its sanctions on the North.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said this latest launch “clearly shows the threat to our nation’s safety is severe and real,” and means that increasing pressure on the hermit nation is unavoidable.The launch had been expected, and the missile traveled for about 1,000 kilometers, or 620 miles, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis announced Friday afternoon.The ICBM flew for about 45 minutes with no immediate reports of damage, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, noting Japan would remain in touch with its American and South Korean allies on the issue. It could have reached an altitude of more than 3,000 kilometers, or around 1,864 miles, added public broadcaster NHK, citing a Japanese defense official.U.S. President Donald Trump condemned North Korea’s “reckless and dangerous” launch. “By threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people,” he said in a statement. “The United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region.”The move is the latest military provocation from the regime of Kim Jong Un, who has conducted a spate of missile tests since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump in January. Earlier this month around America’s Fourth of July holiday, North Korea fired its first successful ICBM, a weapon experts say may be capable of reaching Alaska.Intelligence agencies said this week they expect Kim to have a successful ICBM that’s able to reach most of the U.S. within a year, far shorter than the four-year timeline they had originally expected. The New York Times reports the new, expedited calendar comes as officials realize the extent to which Kim wants such weaponry, which could eventually be fitted with a nuclear weapon.Some had speculated that the North could conduct another test launch around the July 27 anniversary of the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War, although both the Pentagon and South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said there was no indication of an imminent test later in the month. The country had appeared to be transporting vehicles carrying ICBM equipment earlier this month. South Korea took steps to propose holding military and humanitarian talks with the North early in July, the first such plans since 2014. However, the North did not respond to the invitation.North Korean state media recently took aim at Trump, however, and called on the U.S. to “withdraw the anachronistic hostile police toward North Korea and kneel and apologize to its army and people.”However, CIA Director Mike Pompeo alluded last week that no such thing would happen any time soon, saying it would “be a great thing to denuclearize the peninsula, to get those weapons off of that, but the thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over them today.”“As for the regime, I am hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system,” Pompeo said during a panel moderated by Times columnist Bret Stephens. “The North Korean people I’m sure are lovely people and would love to see him go.”This article has been updated with new details, including comment from the Pentagon, Abe and Suga.Read more:What You Need To Know About North Korea’s Nuclear ProgramNorth Korea Just Launched An ICBM.

2,WORLD NEWS,Venezuela's Crisis Approaches A Tipping Point As Protests Spread To Government Strongholds,"Juan Victor Fajardo, HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/venezuela-protests-tipping-point_us_597b7f31e4b02a8434b653a0,"As an important vote looms, protests are now moving beyond the capital’s affluent neighborhoods.",2017-07-28,A group of protestors drag a tree trunk toward a barricade in Caracas' eastern neighborhood of Caurimare on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597b8448210000a31afc92bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CARACAS, Venezuela ― When Venezuelans go to the polls on Sunday to elect a National Constituent Assembly, they will do so after months of protests against the government of President Nicolás Maduro in the eastern neighborhoods of Caracas. In the past week, these parts of the capital have once more become the center of opposition efforts to block Maduro’s plans ― this time his attempts to modify the constitution and solidify his grip on power.On Wednesday and Thursday, the vast majority of businesses in eastern Caracas observed a two-day strike and remained closed to the public. Protesters also blocked roads in the city’s east with tree trunks, strands of wire, trash bags and construction materials. With transportation workers off the job, disoriented drivers and stray motorcycles struggled to dodge makeshift barricades on the deserted streets. Other than groups of neighbors who stood next to the rubble, the eastern streets of the city were utterly empty.But while the unrest in these parts of the capital came as no surprise, a dramatic change has occurred across town that signals a fundamental shift in the months-long political stalemate between government and opposition.For the first time, protests led by university students, local activists and common citizens, which had once been contained within the bounds of the capital’s affluent eastern neighborhoods, have started to spread to government strongholds in western parts of the city. The geographic expansion of the protests over the past few weeks reveals the conflict may be reaching a tipping point.Throughout most of July, anti-government demonstrations have taken place in neighborhoods like La Candelaria, El Valle, La Vega and El Paraiso ― iconic middle- and working-class areas in the west of the city that were once loyal to Hugo Chavez’s regime. During the strike this week, most commercial shops in the west joined the protest, although bakeries, banks, grocery stores and the subway remained open. Traffic in the blocks surrounding the presidential palace, the ultimate symbol of Maduro’s power in Caracas, was as scarce as during national holidays.The west is “the last bastion of the government,” social activist Roberto Patiño explained this week. “The west is the capital. It is the seat of the branches of government. It is extremely risky, from the government’s perspective, for protests to take place in that zone.” Sunday’s vote is the culmination of a months-long confrontation between Maduro and the opposition that has so far claimed the lives of more than 130 people.Once elected, the new National Constituent Assembly will be an omnipotent body that will be tasked with writing a new constitution. Maduro’s critics fear the main goal of this effort is to modify the structure of the state to expand his powers and help him stay in office. They also fear threats of a recent plan to incarcerate public officials and members of the opposition through the assembly. The main critique, however, is that Maduro intends to push through his proposal without the approval of Venezuelan voters. According to the opposition, more than 7.5 million people participated in a symbolic referendum on July 16 that aimed to measure the discontent of the local population. The results indicate that virtually all voters disapproved of the National Constituent Assembly. Recent polls suggest that more than 74 percent of the country disapproves of Maduro’s mandate overall. Despite domestic and international pressure to call off the vote, Maduro has indicated the election will proceed as planned. The administration doubled down on dissent leading up to the weekend and issued a ban on protests until the vote concludes. At least five people were killed and more than 100 protesters detained in clashes during the two-day strike.For the past four months, the strength and intensity of anti-government protests has varied across Caracas along the city’s geographical lines.“There used to be a sort of Berlin Wall near the neighborhood of Chacaito,” said Victor Amaya, a journalist for several local publications. “That wall then retreated to Plaza Venezuela and then it stayed there,” he said, in reference to parts of Caracas on the border between east and west. “I don’t think it has been entirely lifted.”“If an anti-government march tries to cross the city from east to the west” Amaya added, “it will simply not make it. The difference now is that we have more of a curtain that moves, that sways.” According to Patiño, the social activist, the new forms of protest that have emerged from the crisis have helped mobilize more people. “The largest recorded protest so far was the Popular Consult on July 16,” he says. “More than 400,000 people voted in the municipality of Libertador. That tells you that the east-west divide is farce and that everyone is protesting.”Patiño said several elements have caused the expansion of the protests.“Thousands of people have protested in places where fear has historically had an overpowering influence,” Patiño explained. “A first element is the middle class of the Libertador municipality, which has massively joined the protests.” As the only administrative division in the country’s Capital District, the municipality of Libertador houses the seat of government and is led by mayor Jorge Rodriguez, who is a prominent figurehead of the Maduro administration. “A second element is the emergence of social protests,” said Patiño. As Venezuela’s economy continues it’s out-of-control downward spiral, not all of the protests in government strongholds are related to the political process. Instead, protesters demand food, cooking gas and medicine. Víctor Álvarez, an award-winning economist and former member of Hugo Chávez’s cabinet, echoes that view and says protests in these areas respond to a systemic failure in Maduro’s economic policies. “The fact that these sectors are currently spaces for sustained conflict is a consequence of an exhausted socialist model based on government spending of the national income from oil,” he explained.“When oil prices were high,” Álvarez said, “the government could finance a series of social programs that satisfied the basic needs of these sectors. In 2013, we saw the first symptoms of economic deceleration and then the stagnation of all economic activity. These sectors are starting to resent that the benefits and gratuities they received are now debilitated, that the quality of life they enjoyed under Chávez is beginning to disappear under Maduro.” Recent polls suggest that nine out of 10 Venezuelan households can’t afford to buy food with their family income. As of last year, nearly 82 percent of Venezuelans lived in a state of poverty. According to the Federation of Venezuelan Pharmacists, the shortage of medicine in the country reaches 85 percent of the market. In Catia, a low-income neighborhood home to 400,000 people in the western end of Caracas, these hardships color daily life. Local residents have become accustomed to standing in line on the sidewalk to buy a loaf of regulated bread or a bag of imported goods the government sells in the area. For more than a week, military officials have occupied schools and institutions, like the Arnoldo Gabaldón Elementary school near Catia, to serve as polling centers on Sunday. Staff at that school has been denied access to the building until after the elections.“Catia was one of the remaining bastions of the government, but the situation has forced people to manifest their discontent,” said Dr. Ángel Páez during a break from his midday shift at a local medical dispensary on Wednesday. “I suspect that voter turnout in this area will be low on Sunday.” In addition to the protests, the growing discontent with Maduro in these neighborhoods has been visible at the polls. During the parliamentary elections in 2015, the opposition won three out of four seats in Catia and obtained 62 percent of the seats in congress. “Part of the Chavista block is against the Constituent Assembly because of the way in which it was convened,” explained Álvarez, in reference to Maduro’s attempt to summon the assembly without public approval. “This is Maduro’s great treason.”Near the dispensary where Páez works, the day of the symbolic referendum ended in tragedy. Xiomara Escot, a 61-year-old nurse, was killed by an armed group of government loyalists who shot her as she waited in line to cast her ballot. These violent groups of militants, also known as colectivos, have recently stepped up their attacks in Catia and across the country to intimidate protesters. “People fear the colectivos,” Páez said, “but in spite of that fear, that day they joined the protest.” "

That tells you that the east-west divide is farce and that everyone is protesting.”Patiño said several elements have caused the expansion of the protests.“Thousands of people have protested in places where fear has historically had an overpowering influence,” Patiño explained. “A first element is the middle class of the Libertador municipality, which has massively joined the protests.” As the only administrative division in the country’s Capital District, the municipality of Libertador houses the seat of government and is led by mayor Jorge Rodriguez, who is a prominent figurehead of the Maduro administration. “A second element is the emergence of social protests,” said Patiño. As Venezuela’s economy continues it’s out-of-control downward spiral, not all of the protests in government strongholds are related to the political process. Instead, protesters demand food, cooking gas and medicine. Víctor Álvarez, an award-winning economist and former member of Hugo Chávez’s cabinet, echoes that view and says protests in these areas respond to a systemic failure in Maduro’s economic policies. “The fact that these sectors are currently spaces for sustained conflict is a consequence of an exhausted socialist model based on government spending of the national income from oil,” he explained.“When oil prices were high,” Álvarez said, “the government could finance a series of social programs that satisfied the basic needs of these sectors. In 2013, we saw the first symptoms of economic deceleration and then the stagnation of all economic activity. These sectors are starting to resent that the benefits and gratuities they received are now debilitated, that the quality of life they enjoyed under Chávez is beginning to disappear under Maduro.” Recent polls suggest that nine out of 10 Venezuelan households can’t afford to buy food with their family income. As of last year, nearly 82 percent of Venezuelans lived in a state of poverty. According to the Federation of Venezuelan Pharmacists, the shortage of medicine in the country reaches 85 percent of the market. In Catia, a low-income neighborhood home to 400,000 people in the western end of Caracas, these hardships color daily life. Local residents have become accustomed to standing in line on the sidewalk to buy a loaf of regulated bread or a bag of imported goods the government sells in the area. For more than a week, military officials have occupied schools and institutions, like the Arnoldo Gabaldón Elementary school near Catia, to serve as polling centers on Sunday. Staff at that school has been denied access to the building until after the elections.“Catia was one of the remaining bastions of the government, but the situation has forced people to manifest their discontent,” said Dr. Ángel Páez during a break from his midday shift at a local medical dispensary on Wednesday. “I suspect that voter turnout in this area will be low on Sunday.” In addition to the protests, the growing discontent with Maduro in these neighborhoods has been visible at the polls. During the parliamentary elections in 2015, the opposition won three out of four seats in Catia and obtained 62 percent of the seats in congress. “Part of the Chavista block is against the Constituent Assembly because of the way in which it was convened,” explained Álvarez, in reference to Maduro’s attempt to summon the assembly without public approval. “This is Maduro’s great treason.”Near the dispensary where Páez works, the day of the symbolic referendum ended in tragedy. Xiomara Escot, a 61-year-old nurse, was killed by an armed group of government loyalists who shot her as she waited in line to cast her ballot. These violent groups of militants, also known as colectivos, have recently stepped up their attacks in Catia and across the country to intimidate protesters. “People fear the colectivos,” Páez said, “but in spite of that fear, that day they joined the protest.” "
5,POLITICS,Don’t Dawdle On Economic And National Security,"Leo W. Gerard , ContributorInternational President United Steelworkers union",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-dawdle-on-economic-and-national-security_us_597b5ad8e4b06b305561cfed,International trade law must be enforced now.,2017-07-28,<p><strong><em>American steel mill worker</em></strong></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597b5bb71500002a008b4075.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The future of the American steel and aluminum industries is not a matter for dithering. Each mill and smelter that remains operating is too vital. Each is too crucial to the economic viability of a corporation, a community, and thousands of workers and their families. Each also is too essential to national security, which relies on American-produced metals for critical infrastructure, from bridge construction to the electrical grid, and for munitions, from fighter jets to bullet-proof vests.There is no more time for waiting. International trade law must be enforced now. Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump pledged his support to workers and these industries. And he followed through by launching within three months of taking office as president special investigations into the effects of steel and aluminum imports on national security. Such inquiries may take as long as a year to conclude, but the administration expedited the process. Until it didn’t. Now steel and aluminum corporations, their communities and their workers are being told to wait. It’s a delay that could kill more American mills and smelters. The nation lost nine aluminum smelters over the past six years, leaving only five in the entire country, and most of them are now operating at reduced levels. Beginning in January 2015, steel companies laid off 14,000 workers as they closed mills and sections of mills. For example, Allegheny Technologies shuttered a plant that made grain oriented electrical steel in 2016, leaving only one U.S. company, AK Steel, now producing this component critical to electricity transmission.As mills and smelters disappear, the military is further restricted in its ability to secure domestically produced essential metals in time of crisis. The primary culprit in this scary scenario is overcapacity and overproduction in China, which overwhelms the world market with illegally subsidized, grossly underpriced aluminum and steel.China has promised repeatedly to solve this problem. On Thursday it pledged again, this time contending it wanted to work globally to deal with the issue of aluminum overcapacity – a problem Beijing created. Over the past six years, using massive government subsidies, China quickly ramped up capacity to become the largest aluminum producer in the world. China can’t be trusted on this because it never keeps its promises. It has never cut its steelmaking capacity after announcing again and again that it would. In negotiations last week, Trump cabinet members could not even get a specific commitment out of China to do it. There’s no evidence China will stop overproducing steel or aluminum now. Waiting is useless. And destructive to American manufacturing. The American steel and aluminum industries have fought back, filing and winning dozens of trade cases against imports of specific products. But the resulting tariffs and other penalties imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) didn’t solve the problem. Instead of paying U.S. tariffs, China shipped its government-supported excess of these products to other countries, artificially suppressing world prices and warping what is supposed to be a free market.Also, this traditional process for seeking relief from unfair trade takes too long. More than a year may elapse before companies and workers get a final decision. And that will be for just one product, like aluminum extrusions, aluminum foil, welded stainless steel pressure pipe or corrosion-resistant steel, to name a tiny number of cases from recent years. That’s part of what made the special investigations into steel and aluminum imports so attractive. If the U.S. Commerce Department determined under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that imports of steel and aluminum jeopardized national security, then the president could impose penalties broadly to ensure the country could meet its own needs. The effort might also spur allies to join the United States in finally pressuring China sufficiently to actually reduce capacity.Although Section 232 allows for nine months of investigation, after which the President would have three months to determine a remedy, the administration promised quick action when it announced the inquiries in April. The steel report was to be completed by June 30, with a speedy decision by the president after that. That suggested the administration understood this was urgent.But June 30 came and went. Now there’s an official delay. The administration told the Wall Street Journal that the steel investigation is on hold until after health care reform, tax changes and infrastructure spending are accomplished. “We don’t want to do it at this moment,” the president said Tuesday of the steel case. That’s devastating. Especially because steel imports have jumped 22 percent since Jan. 1, placing additional pressure on the American industry. The delay occurs as efforts are made by a new company to reopen at least one potline at an aluminum smelter in New Madrid, Mo., that the now-bankrupt Noranda company idled last year. Postponing the Section 232 decision makes for uncertainty for these investors. It also occurs as a Chinese company is trying to buy Aleris, an Ohio-based manufacturer that supplies aluminum for use in vital infrastructure and military applications. That Asian firm, China Zhongwang, is accused of dodging tariffs and is under civil and criminal investigation for possible smuggling, conspiracy and wire fraud by the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security and Commerce Department. Maybe the Aleris smelters would keep operating if China Zhongwang bought them, but at what risk to national security?The delay occurs as companies that buy steel fear monger that tariffs or quotas would raise prices. An expert, Stephen Koplan, chairman of the U.S. ITC under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, says that’s hogwash. “Predictions of disaster were wrong 15 years ago when I chaired the ITC, and they are wrong again today,” he wrote in an op-ed in The Hill newspaper this week.When President George W. Bush imposed tariffs and quotas on steel imports under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, there was no price shock afterward, according to a study by the nonpartisan U.S. ITC. Here is what Koplan, who also served as an attorney at the Small Business Administration, wrote:“Downstream industries were not devastated by higher steel prices. Nor was the U.S. economy thrown into depression. The U.S. steel industry, however, earned a much-needed relief as the result of action taken by the president that allowed it to restructure and reinvest for the long term. In other words, the Section 201 measures worked as intended.“We are facing similar challenges again today. . .Now, however, U.S. national security is at great risk if firm action is not taken immediately. The U.S. primary aluminum industry is on the verge of disappearing entirely, and the U.S. steel industry is not far behind.”AK Steel Corp. CEO Roger Newport agreed with Koplan’s assessment that this is not a time for dawdling, telling the Commerce Department in his testimony on the steel case:“High-end electrical steel is an incredibly difficult product to manufacture, as it requires a significant amount of dedicated, capital equipment and a sophisticated, well-trained workforce. Therefore, if AK Steel were to exit the market, there would be no operational electrical steel manufacturing equipment in the United States, the specialized labor and related expertise in operations would be lost, and many of AK Steel’s talented operators and researchers would either relocate to other businesses, industries and/or foreign countries, or become unemployed.” Workers’ and companies’ economic security is at risk. The nation’s security is at risk. Resolution of these cases should be speeded, not delayed. "
6,POLITICS,Exxon Mobil Isn’t Particularly Worried About Trump's Qatar Crisis,Alexander C. Kaufman and Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-trump-qatar_us_597b5344e4b02a8434b61010,The president keeps inflaming the diplomatic crisis between Qatar and four Arab states. But it's not hurting the oil and gas giant.,2017-07-28,"Darren Woods, chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil, attends a news conference at the New York Stock Exchange.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597b5a18210000a31afc9214.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exxon Mobil Corp. isn’t sweating the diplomatic crisis simmering in Qatar.  The oil and gas giant’s profits doubled to $3.35 billion compared to this quarter last year, the company said Friday. That’s despite the weeks-long spat between the tiny Gulf Arab nation ― which Exxon Mobil helped build into the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) ― and its neighbors Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. “Simply put, we’ve not experienced any impacts to LNG production or exports,” Jeff Woodbury, Exxon Mobil’s investor relations chief, said during a quarterly earnings call on Friday morning. “We are very proud of the contributions we’ve made in supporting Qatar’s evolution as the world’s largest supplier of LNG.”Qatar is an important U.S. partner in the region and host to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. That base is the hub of the ongoing battle against the self-proclaimed Islamic State.But President Donald Trump ― despite efforts by his own State and Defense Departments to diffuse the crisis with Qatar’s U.S.-aligned neighbors ― has repeatedly attacked the country in public.Since its neighbors began their blockade on June 5, Qatar has only become more keen to maintain its status as the world’s top source of natural gas. Earlier this month, the country announced that it would boost gas production ― a sign that it wants to sustain its energy market share and challenge rival producers.Long overshadowed by Saudi Arabia, the region’s political and oil-fueled economic juggernaut, Qatar has in recent years used natural gas revenues to bolster its influence and independence on the world stage.The country has sought to become a sort of Switzerland, open to dialogue with players of all stripes, including Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, and supporters of political Islam, who other regional governments see as a threat but Qatar says should be accommodated lest they turn to militancy. It’s poured money into support for activists ― and in some cases armed groups ― abroad, and into a widely popular news network, Al Jazeera, that has subsidiaries broadcasting in Arabic, English and other languages.The blockade is seen by many observers as an attempt to punish Qatar for flexing its muscles abroad and force it to realign with Saudi-led regional foreign policy. Still, business as usual is the chief message from Qatari officials, who hope to highlight that their economic ties to the outside world and their security contributions remain consistent. Exxon Mobil’s relationship to the country is heightened by the fact that current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson used to be the company’s chief executive. Tillerson has led efforts to mediate the crisis by diplomatically engaging with all the governments involved, and underscored that Washington does not intend to sever its strategically important links to Qatar. But Trump’s statements on the matter have undercut his work: the president has repeatedly condemned Qatar and appeared uninterested in encouraging Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others to back down. Some reports suggest that Tillerson has become so frustrated he is considering leaving his post, although he subsequently said that he had no intention of resigning. For its part, Exxon Mobil seems to be taking the longer view. Woodbury said Friday the company was open to “future investments” in Qatar, adding it would continue to back the monarchy.“I’d put it this way: Qatar is a very important partnership for us,” Woodbury said. “We’ll continue to support Qatar.” "
7,THE WORLDPOST,"These Days, All Roads Lead To Beijing","Peter Frankopan, ContributorDirector, Oxford University Center for Byzantine Research",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-silk-road_us_5978d667e4b0a8a40e84cec7,The success of the new Silk Roads depends on delivering win-win scenarios.,2017-07-28,"Tourists ride camels in the Mingsha Shan desert, part of the ancient Silk Roads, during the Silk Road International Cultural Expo in Dunhuang City. Sept. 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5978e56a1500007d208b3b8f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"When Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, at the beginning of September 2013, few thought it was anything but another ordinary visit. Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, had been to the Kazakh capital several times and usually talked about how he welcomed good relations with one of China’s neighbors to the west. But when Xi began his speech, it was obvious that something new was afoot. The Chinese president was offering more than the usual banal platitudes. He was talking about the future, and he was talking about a plan.For more than 2,000 years, he said, the peoples who live in the heart of Asia had been able to coexist, cooperate and flourish despite “differences in race, belief and cultural background.” It was a “foreign policy priority,” he went on, “for China to develop friendly cooperative relations with the Central Asian countries.” The time had come, he said, to make economic ties closer, improve communication, encourage trade and enhance monetary circulation. The time had come, he said, for a “Silk Road Economic Belt” to be built. The time had come to breathe new life back into the old Silk Roads, a series of trade routes that once connected Asia, Africa and Europe.Cynics listening to the speech would have been forgiven for thinking this was wishful thinking. Ever since the fall of the Iron Curtain, there had been talk of old connections rebooting and new Silk Roads surging to life. Indeed, just two years before Xi’s speech, Hillary Clinton, then U.S. secretary of state, gave an upbeat talk in Chennai, on the southeastern coast of India, in which she outlined her hopes for the future. “Turkmen gas fields could help meet both Pakistan and India’s growing energy needs,” she said, “and provide significant transit revenues for both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Tajik cotton could be turned into Indian linens. Furniture and fruit from Afghanistan could find its way to the markets of Astana or Mumbai and beyond.”It all sounded positive and exciting. The problem was that nothing ever came of it. As a senior official at the Asian Development Bank pointed out in 2011, it was all very well talking of massive infrastructure projects like roads, energy plants and pipelines. But “unless the job is funded, it ain’t going to happen.” Anyone can have a vision. What matters is turning it into reality. When historians look back at the first two decades of the 21 century, it is unlikely that many will focus their attention on the failure of the U.S. to follow up on the project outlined by Clinton.It will be another matter when it comes to tracking what happened after Xi left Astana. Barely two months later, in November 2013, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promised to take matters forward. “We will set up development-oriented financial institution,” the announcement stated, “accelerate the construction of infrastructure connecting China with neighboring countries and regions, and work hard to build a Silk Road Economic Belt and a Maritime Silk Road to form a new pattern of all-round opportunities.”Since then, nearly $1 trillion has been earmarked for projects that form part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The scale of proposed investment is breathtaking, comparable only to the rebuilding of Western Europe after World War II when the Marshall Plan provided capital, expertise and energy to pull half a continent devastated by fighting and suffering off its knees.The Belt and Road Initiative promises to do more. Tens of billions of dollars have been pumped into the Silk Road Fund and a handful of policy and development banks to push ahead with major investments in Asia, Africa and Europe across multiple sectors. In June, Commerce Minister Zhong Shen said terms had been agreed upon for at least 24 new deals in Kazakhstan alone, with a value of more than $8 billion that included investment in energy, mining, the chemical industry, mechanical manufacturing, agriculture and digital exchange.Then there is the $55 billion that is due to be invested in Pakistan, of which around two-thirds is to be spent on building 21 power plants that will transform the energy security of a country where outages and blackouts interrupt the work day, reduce productivity and affect family life. Some experts believe Chinese investment might account for 20 percent of the Pakistan’s GDP over the next five years and boost growth by as much as 3 percent per year — an astonishing indication of the potential power of the shot in the arm that might be produced by the re-galvanization of the Silk Roads.Given the context of forging present and future connections across continents, it is not surprising that much attention is being paid to the past. Precedents and parallels are important in providing intellectual credibility and framing the overarching vision of what is at stake. As Xi put it at a major forum in Beijing in May, the “ancient silk routes embody the spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit.”It is not surprising, of course, that the emphasis should be placed on the positive exchanges that were enabled and facilitated along the Silk Roads, rather than pointing out that disease, environmental change and violence also sometimes coursed along the arteries connecting east with west. Nevertheless, it is striking to note that while the rhythms along the Silk Roads were not always smooth, they compare favorably when set alongside those of Europe, whose history was shaped by almost never-ending confrontation and warfare. The Silk Roads of the past were an abstract series of connections. There was no one single route or road connecting China across the center of Asia to the Mediterranean but rather a criss-crossing spider’s web that linked oasis to oasis, village to village, town to town. Most of the interaction along the Silk Roads was local in nature and involved petty transactions. Movement of high-value, high-status items — silks and other textiles, ceramics, spices, fruit, precious metals and jewels — was smaller in quantity but caught the eye of commentators as well as consumers.People in the past were as curious about the world as we are today and were keen to try new tastes, consider new fashions and learn about new ideas. What has changed, of course, is the speed at which we are connected in the modern world: news and information moves more or less instantaneously from one side of the world to another, while we are able to travel thousands of miles quicker and more cheaply than any generation in history before us.The Belt and Road Initiative therefore fits in alongside the paradigm of the old Silk Roads insofar as there is little congruity to which regions, countries and places fall within the geographic parameters of the scheme and which do not. In fact, some 60 countries stretching across Asia into Europe and Africa are part of the initiative, representing some 60 percent of the world’s population.As Chinese state media has noted, while the leadership used to talk in terms of China playing an important role in the international community, the language has recently changed to talking of China as a “guide” for others and to Xi as a leader of the “new world order.” Nowhere is this change better illustrated than in the video above, released to mark the Belt and Road Initiative forum in Beijing in May. “Why is there conflict and war? Why is there prejudice and famine? What’s wrong with the world?” sings a mournful cartoon character. “What can we do?” runs the refrain. The answer, set out to comfort those worried by pollution, inequality, warfare and change, is clear: “China has a solution.”That solution involves building a shared future for mankind — something Xi articulated in the spring of 2017 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he talked of economic and environmental sustainability and of the importance of cooperation. “When encountering difficulties,” he said, “we should not complain about ourselves, blame others, lose confidence or run away from responsibilities. Instead we should join hands and rise to the challenges.”Few had any doubts who or what he had in mind when he said that or when he warned of the dangers of trade barriers being put up. U.S. President Donald Trump had talked regularly of imposing tariffs on trade with Beijing. Xi was pre-empting potential moves from a new White House administration, noting at Davos that “pursuing protection is like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain might be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air.” Troubles in developed economies had been caused by the “excessive chase of profit by financial capital and a great failure of financial regulation,” he said.One of the key elements behind this massive investment is the preparation for China’s medium to long-term future. With energy needs expected to triple by 2030, securing oil and gas to fuel economic and industrial growth has been a priority. This is one reason why funding has been made available for pipeline construction but also for forward purchases of oil like the massive deal with Russia’s Rosneft, purportedly worth $270 billion.Wider commercial and strategic aims are also part of the story. Connected by new roads that run through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor up into western China, the Pakistani port city of Gwadar offers opportunities and options for both trade and security. Sending goods overland to Gwadar and onward significantly reduces the cost and time compared to shipping them from ports on the Pacific coast. Doing so provides an alternative to the anxieties over territorial issues in the South China Sea but also reduces the risks of passage through the pinch point of the Strait of Malacca, which handles almost all China’s maritime traffic. It also offers access to the Indian Ocean and the Gulf for Chinese navy ships, which are stationed and serviced out of Gwadar, ostensibly to provide protection for trade routes.There is growing realization in Beijing that while it may be going too far to claim that China’s future depends on its neighbors, working to upgrade and improve the neighborhood is good for everyone. There are, of course, many reasons to do so. Leadership roles require the assumption of responsibilities— one reason why Chinese diplomats are increasingly active in shuttle diplomacy between Afghanistan and Pakistan, urging both nations to form a bilateral “crisis-management mechanism” to patch up a relationship that is often rather sketchy.There is more to this than playing a role, though. Chinese troops have reportedly been operating either just inside Afghanistan, in the Wakhan Corridor, or close to the border the two countries share, which is just under 50 miles long. Several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang by Muslim extremists have raised fears of contagion of militant ideas and activities — leading to a heavy crackdown on the Uighur population in western China that has included putting soldiers on the streets and banning some Muslim names and the sporting of beards.The attention being paid by Beijing to states beyond its western border has of course had the effect of raising the profile and importance of the provinces in western China itself, which have become among the fastest growing in the country. The Belt and Road Initiative has helped fuel a growth spurt in regions that were falling behind the prime strip along the Pacific coast. One expected side effect of the investment abroad is a rebalancing of China’s own demographic and socioeconomic profile, spread more evenly around the country.That virtuous circle also lies behind some of the drive to provide credit lines and expertise for projects across Asia and beyond. They offer outlets for excess capacity at a time when China’s industrial growth is slowing down and the economy is shifting toward services. Improving links, making border controls quicker and more efficient, and agreeing on common standards to enable optimal velocity of exchange opens up potentially lucrative — and huge — markets for Chinese manufacturers and businesses.Only about 6 percent of households in India have a computer, for example, and less than a third have a refrigerator. Countries like Pakistan (population 190 million), Bangladesh (160 million) and India (1.3 billion) are potential gold mines, especially if new infrastructure provides reliable energy and enables improvements in roads, railways, ports and digital networks. Xi talks about the new Silk Roads being a “win-win” situation. He might even be right.But he might not be. These are still early days. Given the scale and breadth of what has been envisaged, it is important to recognize that plans will change and reshape over time. Some projects will inevitably work out better than others; some will be more complicated, more troublesome and less rewarding than others. The success of the initiative will depend not only on how lessons are learned from when things go wrong but which lessons are learned: bad experiences can sometimes increase resolve and improve decision-making in subsequent projects. But they can also be off-putting and close doors entirely. And what sounds exciting to Chinese ears often sounds positively threatening to others. The high visibility of Silk Roads investments has sharpened antagonisms in some quarters. New Delhi has reacted badly to announcements from Beijing about the new Silk Roads, partly due to hurt pride and a sense of being outmaneuvered by a rival. At stake is the long and difficult relationship that India has had with China going back centuries. Competition and animosities still run high, fueled by a long-standing, unresolved border dispute.Alarm bells have also gone off, however, because of the proposed investments into Pakistan, an even greater rival to India than China, where upgrades to the army and economy have led to howls of complaint. The Indian government conspicuously avoided the Beijing forum in May, refusing to send an official delegation and instead issuing a sour statement about all that is wrong about the Belt and Road Initiative. “We are of firm belief that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognized international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality,” read a statement issued by India’s Foreign Ministry. The statement said the Belt and Road Initiative would lead, among other problems, to an “unsustainable debt burden” for countries involved in Beijing’s plans.Not to be outdone, India has been working on its own versions of the initiative, spawning multiple schemes to collaborate on projects with Bangladesh, Burma and Thailand — the “Act East” policy, the Trilateral Highway project and the “Neighborhood First” scheme. India has also developed a “Go West” strategy that is centered on creating a port facility at Chabahar in southeastern Iran, to mirror and rival Pakistan’s Gwadar Port.Robust rhetoric gives the impression that direct confrontation between India and China may not be far away. Memories of the war between the two countries in 1962 still loom large half a century later ― in recent months, a stand-off on the Dolam Plateau has caused military activities to rise sharply and stoke tensions that already run high. The Indian defense minister angrily noted this month that “the India of 2017 is different from the India of 1962,” General Bipin Rawat, the chief of staff of the Indian Army, stated that India “is fully ready for a two-and-a-half front war” — presumably meaning being able to fight China, Pakistan and dissidents in India simultaneously.Although bluster like this can have consequences, it is also dangerous to let overenthusiastic declarations and denunciations take center stage. After all, there is no reason why India’s own version of the Belt and Road Initiative cannot succeed just as China’s can. And there’s no reason why the two cannot complement each other. Indeed, the fact that attention in Delhi has turned to how to best understand and react to activity led by Beijing should be welcomed and seen as part of a new Asian age where old connections are remade, new ties are forged and mutual opportunities are explored.The development of the Belt and Road Initiative and the responses in India are being watched carefully in Moscow. Russia has been careful to offer warm words of encouragement, with President Vladimir Putin noting that he had “no doubt that we will work together … [to] benefit both the Chinese and the Russian peoples,” welcoming “a new stage of cooperation in Eurasia.” But Russia has also been keeping its options open. The Kremlin has been conducting vigorous and regular diplomatic activity in the Gulf, the Middle East and Central Asia — and also with India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was welcomed to St. Petersburg this summer “to discuss a wide range of issues related to strengthening the privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India.” Putin is not just watching from the sidelines — he is thinking about how to best participate during a time of transition.Hopes are partly set on the Eurasian Economic Union, a free trade area set within a wider vision of joint investment, intelligence sharing and mutual interests. This body, made up of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, overlaps with the Belt and Road Initiative — at least according to Putin. Rather than compete with China’s plans, he has said, “the main thing we should do is combine our efforts” — suggesting that the EEU is Russia’s own version of how to improve connections across the heart of Asia.Countries from the Pacific through the Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean recognize the potential possibilities of the Silk Roads. But many also have limited choices. “Other countries have lots of ideas but no money,” said Hun Sen, the prime minister of Cambodia. “But for China, when it comes with an idea, it also comes with the money.” The lure of possible investment is not welcomed by all, as angry demonstrations in Kazakhstan in 2016 over the possibility of opening up land for Chinese buyers proved. Many in Pakistan are wary about potential suffocation by Chinese investment, both because of its sheer scale and firepower, but also because they worry that they’ll lose control of the entire supply chain, with Chinese farmers using Chinese pesticides and fertilizers to grow crops that are gathered by Chinese workers, transported on Chinese vehicles and sold to consumers in China.Adding to these problems is the asymmetry of the Belt and Road Initiative. While China is keen to open up new markets abroad, it is not opening up its own domestic market. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is one leader who has been vocal about the need to “increase opportunities for Kenyan goods to penetrate the Chinese markets.” “If [China’s] win-win strategy is going to work, it must mean that, just as Africa opens up to China, China must also open up to Africa,” he said.This proved a sticking point at the Beijing forum this year, where representatives of the European Union refused to sign a joint statement about the wonders of the Belt and Road Initiative. The EU was not able “to confirm our joint commitment to international trade rules and to a level playing field for all companies,” according to Daniel Rosario, the EU spokesman for trade. As a statement issued by the French embassy in Beijing noted tartly, the initiative’s success depends on “open, rules-based public tenders and reciprocal market access.” We are living in a time of change in a world where power, wealth and expectations about what tomorrow will bring are in flux. Eight hundred years ago, a similar massive shift in the center of gravity took place when Genghis Khan and his heirs built the land empire connecting the Pacific coast of China with the Mediterranean. The initial, sudden wave of conquest gave way to peace and to what is sometimes called the Pax Mongolica — the Mongol peace — a long period of stability, rising prosperity and cooperation. The Mongols paid the price for not commissioning historians to preserve their legacy. Today they are synonymous with violence rather than tolerance, with crude use of force rather than sophistication and with haphazard destruction rather than careful planning.Once upon a time, all roads led to Rome, as the saying goes. These days, all roads lead to Beijing. In the coming years, much will depend on how well China executes its plans for the future and how well it can choose projects that really deliver a win-win scenario not just for business tycoons and political leaders but for local populations. Much will also depend on the ability to explain what is going on and to not seek the best bargain but rather the best long-term deal. Perhaps most important of all, it depends on being able to win goodwill through building relationships that are ultimately based not on commercial and economic interests but on mutual respect. History teaches us that the cornerstone for this geopolitical alchemy lies in education. Learning about each other’s histories — about what has mattered in the past and what matters in the future, and being able to understand grievances, slights and petty rivalries — is what will ultimately decide how successful the Belt and Road Initiative will be in the long term."

Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, had been to the Kazakh capital several times and usually talked about how he welcomed good relations with one of China’s neighbors to the west. But when Xi began his speech, it was obvious that something new was afoot. The Chinese president was offering more than the usual banal platitudes. He was talking about the future, and he was talking about a plan.For more than 2,000 years, he said, the peoples who live in the heart of Asia had been able to coexist, cooperate and flourish despite “differences in race, belief and cultural background.” It was a “foreign policy priority,” he went on, “for China to develop friendly cooperative relations with the Central Asian countries.” The time had come, he said, to make economic ties closer, improve communication, encourage trade and enhance monetary circulation. The time had come, he said, for a “Silk Road Economic Belt” to be built. The time had come to breathe new life back into the old Silk Roads, a series of trade routes that once connected Asia, Africa and Europe.Cynics listening to the speech would have been forgiven for thinking this was wishful thinking. Ever since the fall of the Iron Curtain, there had been talk of old connections rebooting and new Silk Roads surging to life. Indeed, just two years before Xi’s speech, Hillary Clinton, then U.S. secretary of state, gave an upbeat talk in Chennai, on the southeastern coast of India, in which she outlined her hopes for the future. “Turkmen gas fields could help meet both Pakistan and India’s growing energy needs,” she said, “and provide significant transit revenues for both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Tajik cotton could be turned into Indian linens. Furniture and fruit from Afghanistan could find its way to the markets of Astana or Mumbai and beyond.”It all sounded positive and exciting. The problem was that nothing ever came of it. As a senior official at the Asian Development Bank pointed out in 2011, it was all very well talking of massive infrastructure projects like roads, energy plants and pipelines. But “unless the job is funded, it ain’t going to happen.” Anyone can have a vision. What matters is turning it into reality. When historians look back at the first two decades of the 21 century, it is unlikely that many will focus their attention on the failure of the U.S. to follow up on the project outlined by Clinton.It will be another matter when it comes to tracking what happened after Xi left Astana. Barely two months later, in November 2013, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promised to take matters forward. “We will set up development-oriented financial institution,” the announcement stated, “accelerate the construction of infrastructure connecting China with neighboring countries and regions, and work hard to build a Silk Road Economic Belt and a Maritime Silk Road to form a new pattern of all-round opportunities.”Since then, nearly $1 trillion has been earmarked for projects that form part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The scale of proposed investment is breathtaking, comparable only to the rebuilding of Western Europe after World War II when the Marshall Plan provided capital, expertise and energy to pull half a continent devastated by fighting and suffering off its knees.The Belt and Road Initiative promises to do more. Tens of billions of dollars have been pumped into the Silk Road Fund and a handful of policy and development banks to push ahead with major investments in Asia, Africa and Europe across multiple sectors. In June, Commerce Minister Zhong Shen said terms had been agreed upon for at least 24 new deals in Kazakhstan alone, with a value of more than $8 billion that included investment in energy, mining, the chemical industry, mechanical manufacturing, agriculture and digital exchange.Then there is the $55 billion that is due to be invested in Pakistan, of which around two-thirds is to be spent on building 21 power plants that will transform the energy security of a country where outages and blackouts interrupt the work day, reduce productivity and affect family life. Some experts believe Chinese investment might account for 20 percent of the Pakistan’s GDP over the next five years and boost growth by as much as 3 percent per year — an astonishing indication of the potential power of the shot in the arm that might be produced by the re-galvanization of the Silk Roads.Given the context of forging present and future connections across continents, it is not surprising that much attention is being paid to the past. Precedents and parallels are important in providing intellectual credibility and framing the overarching vision of what is at stake. As Xi put it at a major forum in Beijing in May, the “ancient silk routes embody the spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit.”It is not surprising, of course, that the emphasis should be placed on the positive exchanges that were enabled and facilitated along the Silk Roads, rather than pointing out that disease, environmental change and violence also sometimes coursed along the arteries connecting east with west. Nevertheless, it is striking to note that while the rhythms along the Silk Roads were not always smooth, they compare favorably when set alongside those of Europe, whose history was shaped by almost never-ending confrontation and warfare. The Silk Roads of the past were an abstract series of connections. There was no one single route or road connecting China across the center of Asia to the Mediterranean but rather a criss-crossing spider’s web that linked oasis to oasis, village to village, town to town. Most of the interaction along the Silk Roads was local in nature and involved petty transactions. Movement of high-value, high-status items — silks and other textiles, ceramics, spices, fruit, precious metals and jewels — was smaller in quantity but caught the eye of commentators as well as consumers.People in the past were as curious about the world as we are today and were keen to try new tastes, consider new fashions and learn about new ideas. What has changed, of course, is the speed at which we are connected in the modern world: news and information moves more or less instantaneously from one side of the world to another, while we are able to travel thousands of miles quicker and more cheaply than any generation in history before us.The Belt and Road Initiative therefore fits in alongside the paradigm of the old Silk Roads insofar as there is little congruity to which regions, countries and places fall within the geographic parameters of the scheme and which do not. In fact, some 60 countries stretching across Asia into Europe and Africa are part of the initiative, representing some 60 percent of the world’s population.As Chinese state media has noted, while the leadership used to talk in terms of China playing an important role in the international community, the language has recently changed to talking of China as a “guide” for others and to Xi as a leader of the “new world order.” Nowhere is this change better illustrated than in the video above, released to mark the Belt and Road Initiative forum in Beijing in May. “Why is there conflict and war? Why is there prejudice and famine? What’s wrong with the world?” sings a mournful cartoon character. “What can we do?” runs the refrain. The answer, set out to comfort those worried by pollution, inequality, warfare and change, is clear: “China has a solution.”That solution involves building a shared future for mankind — something Xi articulated in the spring of 2017 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he talked of economic and environmental sustainability and of the importance of cooperation. “When encountering difficulties,” he said, “we should not complain about ourselves, blame others, lose confidence or run away from responsibilities. Instead we should join hands and rise to the challenges.”Few had any doubts who or what he had in mind when he said that or when he warned of the dangers of trade barriers being put up. U.S. President Donald Trump had talked regularly of imposing tariffs on trade with Beijing. Xi was pre-empting potential moves from a new White House administration, noting at Davos that “pursuing protection is like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain might be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air.” Troubles in developed economies had been caused by the “excessive chase of profit by financial capital and a great failure of financial regulation,” he said.One of the key elements behind this massive investment is the preparation for China’s medium to long-term future. With energy needs expected to triple by 2030, securing oil and gas to fuel economic and industrial growth has been a priority. This is one reason why funding has been made available for pipeline construction but also for forward purchases of oil like the massive deal with Russia’s Rosneft, purportedly worth $270 billion.Wider commercial and strategic aims are also part of the story. Connected by new roads that run through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor up into western China, the Pakistani port city of Gwadar offers opportunities and options for both trade and security. Sending goods overland to Gwadar and onward significantly reduces the cost and time compared to shipping them from ports on the Pacific coast. Doing so provides an alternative to the anxieties over territorial issues in the South China Sea but also reduces the risks of passage through the pinch point of the Strait of Malacca, which handles almost all China’s maritime traffic. It also offers access to the Indian Ocean and the Gulf for Chinese navy ships, which are stationed and serviced out of Gwadar, ostensibly to provide protection for trade routes.There is growing realization in Beijing that while it may be going too far to claim that China’s future depends on its neighbors, working to upgrade and improve the neighborhood is good for everyone. There are, of course, many reasons to do so. Leadership roles require the assumption of responsibilities— one reason why Chinese diplomats are increasingly active in shuttle diplomacy between Afghanistan and Pakistan, urging both nations to form a bilateral “crisis-management mechanism” to patch up a relationship that is often rather sketchy.There is more to this than playing a role, though. Chinese troops have reportedly been operating either just inside Afghanistan, in the Wakhan Corridor, or close to the border the two countries share, which is just under 50 miles long. Several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang by Muslim extremists have raised fears of contagion of militant ideas and activities — leading to a heavy crackdown on the Uighur population in western China that has included putting soldiers on the streets and banning some Muslim names and the sporting of beards.The attention being paid by Beijing to states beyond its western border has of course had the effect of raising the profile and importance of the provinces in western China itself, which have become among the fastest growing in the country. The Belt and Road Initiative has helped fuel a growth spurt in regions that were falling behind the prime strip along the Pacific coast. One expected side effect of the investment abroad is a rebalancing of China’s own demographic and socioeconomic profile, spread more evenly around the country.That virtuous circle also lies behind some of the drive to provide credit lines and expertise for projects across Asia and beyond. They offer outlets for excess capacity at a time when China’s industrial growth is slowing down and the economy is shifting toward services. Improving links, making border controls quicker and more efficient, and agreeing on common standards to enable optimal velocity of exchange opens up potentially lucrative — and huge — markets for Chinese manufacturers and businesses.Only about 6 percent of households in India have a computer, for example, and less than a third have a refrigerator. Countries like Pakistan (population 190 million), Bangladesh (160 million) and India (1.3 billion) are potential gold mines, especially if new infrastructure provides reliable energy and enables improvements in roads, railways, ports and digital networks. Xi talks about the new Silk Roads being a “win-win” situation. He might even be right.But he might not be. These are still early days. Given the scale and breadth of what has been envisaged, it is important to recognize that plans will change and reshape over time. Some projects will inevitably work out better than others; some will be more complicated, more troublesome and less rewarding than others. The success of the initiative will depend not only on how lessons are learned from when things go wrong but which lessons are learned: bad experiences can sometimes increase resolve and improve decision-making in subsequent projects. But they can also be off-putting and close doors entirely. And what sounds exciting to Chinese ears often sounds positively threatening to others. The high visibility of Silk Roads investments has sharpened antagonisms in some quarters. New Delhi has reacted badly to announcements from Beijing about the new Silk Roads, partly due to hurt pride and a sense of being outmaneuvered by a rival. At stake is the long and difficult relationship that India has had with China going back centuries. Competition and animosities still run high, fueled by a long-standing, unresolved border dispute.Alarm bells have also gone off, however, because of the proposed investments into Pakistan, an even greater rival to India than China, where upgrades to the army and economy have led to howls of complaint. The Indian government conspicuously avoided the Beijing forum in May, refusing to send an official delegation and instead issuing a sour statement about all that is wrong about the Belt and Road Initiative. “We are of firm belief that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognized international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality,” read a statement issued by India’s Foreign Ministry. The statement said the Belt and Road Initiative would lead, among other problems, to an “unsustainable debt burden” for countries involved in Beijing’s plans.Not to be outdone, India has been working on its own versions of the initiative, spawning multiple schemes to collaborate on projects with Bangladesh, Burma and Thailand — the “Act East” policy, the Trilateral Highway project and the “Neighborhood First” scheme. India has also developed a “Go West” strategy that is centered on creating a port facility at Chabahar in southeastern Iran, to mirror and rival Pakistan’s Gwadar Port.Robust rhetoric gives the impression that direct confrontation between India and China may not be far away. Memories of the war between the two countries in 1962 still loom large half a century later ― in recent months, a stand-off on the Dolam Plateau has caused military activities to rise sharply and stoke tensions that already run high. The Indian defense minister angrily noted this month that “the India of 2017 is different from the India of 1962,” General Bipin Rawat, the chief of staff of the Indian Army, stated that India “is fully ready for a two-and-a-half front war” — presumably meaning being able to fight China, Pakistan and dissidents in India simultaneously.Although bluster like this can have consequences, it is also dangerous to let overenthusiastic declarations and denunciations take center stage. After all, there is no reason why India’s own version of the Belt and Road Initiative cannot succeed just as China’s can. And there’s no reason why the two cannot complement each other. Indeed, the fact that attention in Delhi has turned to how to best understand and react to activity led by Beijing should be welcomed and seen as part of a new Asian age where old connections are remade, new ties are forged and mutual opportunities are explored.The development of the Belt and Road Initiative and the responses in India are being watched carefully in Moscow. Russia has been careful to offer warm words of encouragement, with President Vladimir Putin noting that he had “no doubt that we will work together … [to] benefit both the Chinese and the Russian peoples,” welcoming “a new stage of cooperation in Eurasia.” But Russia has also been keeping its options open. The Kremlin has been conducting vigorous and regular diplomatic activity in the Gulf, the Middle East and Central Asia — and also with India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was welcomed to St. Petersburg this summer “to discuss a wide range of issues related to strengthening the privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India.” Putin is not just watching from the sidelines — he is thinking about how to best participate during a time of transition.Hopes are partly set on the Eurasian Economic Union, a free trade area set within a wider vision of joint investment, intelligence sharing and mutual interests. This body, made up of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, overlaps with the Belt and Road Initiative — at least according to Putin. Rather than compete with China’s plans, he has said, “the main thing we should do is combine our efforts” — suggesting that the EEU is Russia’s own version of how to improve connections across the heart of Asia.Countries from the Pacific through the Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean recognize the potential possibilities of the Silk Roads. But many also have limited choices. “Other countries have lots of ideas but no money,” said Hun Sen, the prime minister of Cambodia. “But for China, when it comes with an idea, it also comes with the money.” The lure of possible investment is not welcomed by all, as angry demonstrations in Kazakhstan in 2016 over the possibility of opening up land for Chinese buyers proved. Many in Pakistan are wary about potential suffocation by Chinese investment, both because of its sheer scale and firepower, but also because they worry that they’ll lose control of the entire supply chain, with Chinese farmers using Chinese pesticides and fertilizers to grow crops that are gathered by Chinese workers, transported on Chinese vehicles and sold to consumers in China.Adding to these problems is the asymmetry of the Belt and Road Initiative. While China is keen to open up new markets abroad, it is not opening up its own domestic market. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is one leader who has been vocal about the need to “increase opportunities for Kenyan goods to penetrate the Chinese markets.” “If [China’s] win-win strategy is going to work, it must mean that, just as Africa opens up to China, China must also open up to Africa,” he said.This proved a sticking point at the Beijing forum this year, where representatives of the European Union refused to sign a joint statement about the wonders of the Belt and Road Initiative. The EU was not able “to confirm our joint commitment to international trade rules and to a level playing field for all companies,” according to Daniel Rosario, the EU spokesman for trade. As a statement issued by the French embassy in Beijing noted tartly, the initiative’s success depends on “open, rules-based public tenders and reciprocal market access.” We are living in a time of change in a world where power, wealth and expectations about what tomorrow will bring are in flux. Eight hundred years ago, a similar massive shift in the center of gravity took place when Genghis Khan and his heirs built the land empire connecting the Pacific coast of China with the Mediterranean. The initial, sudden wave of conquest gave way to peace and to what is sometimes called the Pax Mongolica — the Mongol peace — a long period of stability, rising prosperity and cooperation. The Mongols paid the price for not commissioning historians to preserve their legacy. Today they are synonymous with violence rather than tolerance, with crude use of force rather than sophistication and with haphazard destruction rather than careful planning.Once upon a time, all roads led to Rome, as the saying goes. These days, all roads lead to Beijing. In the coming years, much will depend on how well China executes its plans for the future and how well it can choose projects that really deliver a win-win scenario not just for business tycoons and political leaders but for local populations. Much will also depend on the ability to explain what is going on and to not seek the best bargain but rather the best long-term deal. Perhaps most important of all, it depends on being able to win goodwill through building relationships that are ultimately based not on commercial and economic interests but on mutual respect.

Learning about each other’s histories — about what has mattered in the past and what matters in the future, and being able to understand grievances, slights and petty rivalries — is what will ultimately decide how successful the Belt and Road Initiative will be in the long term."

The Indian defense minister angrily noted this month that “the India of 2017 is different from the India of 1962,” General Bipin Rawat, the chief of staff of the Indian Army, stated that India “is fully ready for a two-and-a-half front war” — presumably meaning being able to fight China, Pakistan and dissidents in India simultaneously.Although bluster like this can have consequences, it is also dangerous to let overenthusiastic declarations and denunciations take center stage. After all, there is no reason why India’s own version of the Belt and Road Initiative cannot succeed just as China’s can. And there’s no reason why the two cannot complement each other. Indeed, the fact that attention in Delhi has turned to how to best understand and react to activity led by Beijing should be welcomed and seen as part of a new Asian age where old connections are remade, new ties are forged and mutual opportunities are explored.The development of the Belt and Road Initiative and the responses in India are being watched carefully in Moscow. Russia has been careful to offer warm words of encouragement, with President Vladimir Putin noting that he had “no doubt that we will work together … [to] benefit both the Chinese and the Russian peoples,” welcoming “a new stage of cooperation in Eurasia.” But Russia has also been keeping its options open. The Kremlin has been conducting vigorous and regular diplomatic activity in the Gulf, the Middle East and Central Asia — and also with India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was welcomed to St. Petersburg this summer “to discuss a wide range of issues related to strengthening the privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India.” Putin is not just watching from the sidelines — he is thinking about how to best participate during a time of transition.Hopes are partly set on the Eurasian Economic Union, a free trade area set within a wider vision of joint investment, intelligence sharing and mutual interests. This body, made up of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, overlaps with the Belt and Road Initiative — at least according to Putin. Rather than compete with China’s plans, he has said, “the main thing we should do is combine our efforts” — suggesting that the EEU is Russia’s own version of how to improve connections across the heart of Asia.Countries from the Pacific through the Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean recognize the potential possibilities of the Silk Roads. But many also have limited choices. “Other countries have lots of ideas but no money,” said Hun Sen, the prime minister of Cambodia. “But for China, when it comes with an idea, it also comes with the money.” The lure of possible investment is not welcomed by all, as angry demonstrations in Kazakhstan in 2016 over the possibility of opening up land for Chinese buyers proved. Many in Pakistan are wary about potential suffocation by Chinese investment, both because of its sheer scale and firepower, but also because they worry that they’ll lose control of the entire supply chain, with Chinese farmers using Chinese pesticides and fertilizers to grow crops that are gathered by Chinese workers, transported on Chinese vehicles and sold to consumers in China.Adding to these problems is the asymmetry of the Belt and Road Initiative. While China is keen to open up new markets abroad, it is not opening up its own domestic market. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is one leader who has been vocal about the need to “increase opportunities for Kenyan goods to penetrate the Chinese markets.” “If [China’s] win-win strategy is going to work, it must mean that, just as Africa opens up to China, China must also open up to Africa,” he said.This proved a sticking point at the Beijing forum this year, where representatives of the European Union refused to sign a joint statement about the wonders of the Belt and Road Initiative. The EU was not able “to confirm our joint commitment to international trade rules and to a level playing field for all companies,” according to Daniel Rosario, the EU spokesman for trade. As a statement issued by the French embassy in Beijing noted tartly, the initiative’s success depends on “open, rules-based public tenders and reciprocal market access.” We are living in a time of change in a world where power, wealth and expectations about what tomorrow will bring are in flux. Eight hundred years ago, a similar massive shift in the center of gravity took place when Genghis Khan and his heirs built the land empire connecting the Pacific coast of China with the Mediterranean. The initial, sudden wave of conquest gave way to peace and to what is sometimes called the Pax Mongolica — the Mongol peace — a long period of stability, rising prosperity and cooperation. The Mongols paid the price for not commissioning historians to preserve their legacy. Today they are synonymous with violence rather than tolerance, with crude use of force rather than sophistication and with haphazard destruction rather than careful planning.Once upon a time, all roads led to Rome, as the saying goes. These days, all roads lead to Beijing. In the coming years, much will depend on how well China executes its plans for the future and how well it can choose projects that really deliver a win-win scenario not just for business tycoons and political leaders but for local populations. Much will also depend on the ability to explain what is going on and to not seek the best bargain but rather the best long-term deal. Perhaps most important of all, it depends on being able to win goodwill through building relationships that are ultimately based not on commercial and economic interests but on mutual respect. History teaches us that the cornerstone for this geopolitical alchemy lies in education. Learning about each other’s histories — about what has mattered in the past and what matters in the future, and being able to understand grievances, slights and petty rivalries — is what will ultimately decide how successful the Belt and Road Initiative will be in the long term."
10,POLITICS,What The Hell Was Dean Heller Thinking?,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dean-heller-health-care_us_597b57c4e4b02a4ebb752633,He hemmed and hawed on health care. He also may have sealed his re-election fate.,2017-07-28,Sen. Dean Heller was all over the place in regard to health care legislation the past few weeks.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597b780c1500007d208b40e6.jpeg?cache=MflMVS6QHw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Dean Heller blew it.It’s hard to imagine a more terrible way for a moderate like the Nevada Republican to handle an extremely unpopular piece of legislation like the Senate health care bill, which went down in flames early Friday.At just about every turn over the past few weeks, the vulnerable senator who faces re-election next year danced haphazardly from one position to the other and everywhere in between. By enthusiastically embracing criticisms of the bill while simultaneously voting to advance it several times, Heller may have seriously damaged his reputation among liberals and conservatives.Unlike other GOP senators who expressed concern about repealing too much of Obamacare, such as Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Heller had put on a show back home. In a widely televised June press conference alongside popular Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), Heller sharply criticized an initial version of the Senate GOP health care bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act.“I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,” he said.To his credit, Heller joined nine other Republicans in voting down that bill on Tuesday. But when Republicans drew up a more narrowly tailored version of the legislation, known as the Health Care Freedom Act, Heller was all over the place.“Overall I think I’d support it,” he said Wednesday morning, before shifting gears the next day to “undecided.”In the end, Heller on Friday morning voted for a bill that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would have left 16 million fewer Americans with health coverage and raised premiums by 20 percent over the next 10 years. He also broke with Sandoval and nine other governors who declared their opposition to the bill just hours before the vote.Some of Heller’s legislative maneuvering designed to insulate him from criticism back home also backfired. A symbolic amendment he introduced that expressed the Senate’s support for Medicaid, while also repealing Obamacare, was voted down 10-90 ― the only such bipartisan vote on a health care measure all week.It was not legally binding and hence little more than a messaging tactic. Heller’s office made sure to tout the measure in a press release titled, “Heller on Senate Floor: Health Care Reform Cannot be Balanced on the Backs of Nevada’s Low-Income Families.”In deciding how to vote on the health care bill, Heller arguably faced a more difficult political calculus than other GOP moderates, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Unlike the others, Heller is likely to face a strong primary challenge from his right. And he has already been threatened by ads from a group supportive of President Donald Trump.Meanwhile, Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who’s running for Heller’s seat, wasted no time ripping into him for his vote on Friday.“No politician from our state has ever been more dishonest about their intentions, more misleading about their position or more disingenuous to their constituents,” Rosen said in a statement. “This was the biggest broken political promise in modern Nevada history.”"
11,QUEER VOICES,Here's Why Flying The Rainbow Flag At Sports Events Is Necessary,"Katelyn Best, Outsports",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/outsports-flying-rainbow-flag_us_5978c950e4b0e201d57a83aa,How one queer journalist and fan found belonging in soccer.,2017-07-28,A rainbow flag at a Portland Timbers game in June.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5978ca6f1a00009bc1dc0aad.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This article originally appeared on OutsportsThe sports commentator/radio shock jock Dino Costa was hired earlier this summer by KXTG: The Game in Portland, my adopted home. Costa is well-known for his unshakeable, 1950s-era belief that women don’t belong in sports radio. And as if choosing one absurd hill to die on wasn’t enough, shortly after he arrived in Portland, he chose to take to the airwaves and say this:“Why is it people feel the need to show up at Timbers games... and wave a flag that identifies their sexuality?... The homosexual and lesbian community throughout the world wants to be accepted as normal, as just like everybody else... Then why the need to show up at Providence Park or any stadium, ballpark, or arena anywhere in the country and wave the—what do they call it? Gay pride flag. Why? What is up with that?... I’ve been to two Timbers games, and at both Timbers games, plenty of those flags were being waved. Why? Why aren’t you waving a Timbers flag?... What is the purpose of this? To show up at a game to wave a flag to let people know you live an alternative lifestyle? Is that what this is about?... If there was a heterosexual flag and I showed up at Providence Park and waved my heterosexual flag... Would anybody look at me sideways? Cross-eyed? I don’t get it. I just don’t get it.”This rant, to say nothing of Costa’s other bad opinions, was the subject of a lot of discussion among Timbers supporters. To the large contingent of queer soccer fans in Portland, this feels like a special kind of assault. Costa isn’t from here, he doesn’t know the first thing about the soccer community here, and yet he’s been granted a citywide platform from which to broadcast his views.It’s a mistake, though, to forget how many people, even in Portland, agree with him. It remains important to combat this narrative whenever we see it. To that end, I want to tell you about how much those rainbow flags have meant to me in my time in Portland.Before I say anything about myself, I want to point out what should be an obvious truth, but somehow isn’t anymore, which is that Pride was born during a time when LGBTQ people were almost universally subjected to physical danger simply for living their lives. Pride happened because of police beatings, and hate crimes, and conversion therapy, and sodomy laws, and the Reagan administration laughing about the AIDS epidemic. I could go on. We are better off today, at least in pockets of the world — personally, I’m extremely fortunate to have never been subjected to that kind of persecution — only because queer people took to the streets and demanded visibility and safety. That’s why we get special flags. On to my story:I’ve lived in western Oregon my whole life. It’s a pretty tolerant place, when it comes to queer folks (heads up: “queer” is the term I’m going to use instead of “homosexual and lesbian”—which happens to be a tautology, but no worries). I went to a small college in Portland where, as a friend of mine once said to the parent of a prospective student, being gay is “so fine we don’t even talk about it.”In some sense, that’s good. I think, in a perfect world, it might be what we’d want — to be seen everywhere, as Costa says, as “normal, as just like everybody else.” Being queer would be so accepted and commonplace we wouldn’t have to come out of the closet, because there wouldn’t be a closet.But we don’t live in that perfect world. In our world, by the time I got to college, I’d already spent 18 years internalizing the message that there was something wrong with who I was because I didn’t like wearing dresses and most of my friends were boys and I’d been getting girl crushes since age 4. That I learned these were things to hate about myself in spite of my parents having gay friends and family members, and my high school being the kind of place that staged productions of The Laramie Project and Rent, should say a lot about how deeply damaging it is to grow up in a community that does openly reject people like you.I spent my college years with one foot in the closet. I didn’t lie about being queer, but I wasn’t forthcoming about it, either. Around masculine-presenting women, I would have quiet internal freak-outs. I tried to maintain a veneer of “normal” gender presentation, accepting who I was only grudgingly. Just because I liked girls didn’t mean I was that kind of gay (besides, sometimes I liked boys, too, so I barely even counted as queer!). This was just one thing about me. It wasn’t who I was.I was out of college before I figured out that to accept myself, I was going to have to accept that no, I’m not just like everybody else. More important, this is who I am — or at least a really big, really central part of who I am. I learned that it’s impossible not to hate yourself if you’re constantly trying to minimize part of your identity.And learning to accept yourself isn’t the type of thing you can do passively. You have to learn to be proud of it. You have to genuinely feel, deep in your guts, that the ways you’re different from most people aren’t just OK, but cool and good, and that for you, it’s better to be queer than not. That’s how you start to undo decades of internalized bullshit about the way you’re supposed to feel and talk and move through the world.All queer people — every single last one of us, whether we come from San Francisco or Arkansas or Chechnya — we all have that internalized bullshit. It comes in varying degrees, certainly, and I don’t want to minimize the real-life danger and discrimination many LGBTQ people still face every day. But self-loathing is as universal an experience for queers as being on the receiving end of sexual harassment is for women.I have a lot of people to thank for the long, still-ongoing process of learning to believe I’m good the way I am. A lot of it, though, has been soccer.Unlike most sports fandoms anywhere in the world, the soccer scene in Portland is gay as hell. The Timbers were the first major professional sports team in the US to officially endorse gay marriage.Portland was a hotbed of women’s soccer weirdos, who cheered the University of Portland Pilots to two national championships long before the Thorns, our beloved NWSL team, were a thing (and if you got worked up about the number of rainbows in the crowd at a Timbers game, you don’t want to be around when the Thorns are playing).And it was that culture of acceptance that hooked me.The day I fell hopelessly in love with Portland soccer was one fall — I would have been 22 — when I was watching an Oregon Ducks football game at a sports bar in Portland. I grew up in Eugene, with Ducks fandom as a birthright. As if to tell me I didn’t belong there, this bald-headed beefcake at the bar that day kept throwing around the word “faggot,” as deftly as Marcus Mariota was throwing touchdown passes on the projector screen in front of us.It wasn’t directed at me, of course. But any time I hear language like that, this is the message: Your right to feel safe is less important than my right to act like a bloviating ass. You don’t matter. If this hurts or scares you, you should hide.A friend was watching a Thorns game (in fact, it was the 2013 NWSL championship) at a different bar, so midway through the Ducks game, I went to hang out with him. The bar was packed from wall to wall with people in Thorns and Timbers jerseys, scarves draped around every neck, many of them adorned with rainbows.Any time I see a room full of sports fans wearing rainbows, this is the message: You’re welcome here. I see you. You matter.What I felt in that moment, much like falling in love with a person, wasn’t any big, dramatic revelation. It was a quiet realization: “Oh. This is for me.” (A big, dramatic revelation of a different kind came in the 40th minute, when Tobin Heath did this).People had packed this place to watch a women’s soccer team — our women’s soccer team — fight for a title, and be as gay as they wanted to while doing it. Nobody had to check their identity at the door.In the college football scene I’d just left, and in most mainstream sports fandoms, the message, at best, is that it’s OK to be gay as long as you shut up about it.And that begrudging tolerance is Costa’s attitude. When he says “the homosexual and lesbian community throughout the world wants to be accepted as normal, as just like everybody else,” he’s not saying that because people from my community have told him that. It’s an assumption he’s making. Why wouldn’t we want to blend in with everybody else?But the fact is, that’s not what we want. That’s what he wants. He can tolerate the thought of people living an “alternative lifestyle” as long as we act “normal” while we do it.There is simply no way to undo the self-loathing I talked about earlier while maintaining a belief that it’s important to act “normal,” or trying not to rub gayness in straight people’s faces.That’s why soccer in Portland has been a home for me. The Thorns community, in particular, is the first space I’d ever been part of where being queer and a woman isn’t merely allowed, but cool and good. It’s hard to overstate how important that is. Community has long been literally vital for LGBTQ people, and if that’s somewhat less true in Portland in 2017 than it was in New York in 1969, it’s precisely because queer communities have existed for long enough.You will hear beautiful stories, if you talk to people in the North End, about folks finding their second families there. I don’t have one of those stories, but over the last few years, as I’ve gotten deeper and deeper into covering the Thorns as a reporter, I’ve become part of that community, in a small way. That I belong there is never in question. As other queer and female sports reporters know too well, that’s a rare, special thing in sports.I’ve felt a variety of emotions in Providence Park: the giddy joy of watching the Timbers dismantle Seattle, the agony of the Thorns falling to Western New York in last year’s NWSL semifinal. As long as I live, I’ll never forget witnessing the act of God that caused Saad Abdul-Salaam’s penalty kick to bounce off both goalposts in the 2015 MLS playoffs. I think the only time I’ve ever been close to actual tears, though, was when supporters unveiled this tifo at a 2016 Thorns game:"

Lighting up a cigarette mid-flight seems,2017-07-27,"<p><strong>We should be proud of our efforts in Australia, but we can’t become complacent as Big Tobacco continues to sell trillions of cigarettes globally, and other industries adopt their tactics, writes Alessandro Demaio… </strong> </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5975b4601a00001b00dc02e2.jpg?ops=crop_0_25_2048_1154%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"ONE could easily be mistaken for thinking the war on tobacco is coming to a close. Lighting up a cigarette mid-flight seems absurd to us now, but was common practice just a decade or two ago. We enjoy restaurant meals and afternoon coffees without the stench of toxic smoke and we can share a night out without having to wash our clothes, or endure a husky, sore throat the following morning.Australia now has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, with 14.7% of adults aged 18 years and over smoking daily, down from 16.1% in 2011-12. Australian federal, state and territory governments have made a commitment to further reduce the smoking rate to 10% by 2018.At the global level, there is good news too. According to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) this week, 63% of the global population are now covered by policies such as strong tobacco warning labels and smoke-free public places – a quadrupling in coverage since 2007 alone. In the 7 years to 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because of anti-smoking measures driven through the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); this framework itself represents an incredible achievement from the global community.However, this same week, sobering new evidence emerged reminding us that a sense of accomplishment, or worse, completion, couldn’t be further from the truth, and that risks from public health complacency could be enormous and deadly. Leaked internal documents from the tobacco giant, Philip Morris, offered additional insights into the appalling and progressively complex tactics used by industry to protect profits over population health; increasingly focused on the world’s poorest nations, coordinated and effective beyond imagination, and ruthlessly deadly in nature. Never before seen papers showed deliberate and calculated strategies to obstruct progress on health policies worldwide. Efforts included holding simultaneous and secretive industry meetings alongside major global health and WHO-led conventions in Moscow and New Delhi, with the sole purpose to obstruct progress towards further achievement of tobacco control. A 2014 internal company presentation refers to these conventions as “regulatory runaway trains” driven by “anti-tobacco extremists”. It details intricate plans to counter plain packaging programs: an evidence-based and WHO-endorsed strategy for reducing tobacco deaths. Industry “roadblocks” (their term), for example, by challenging such policies as unconstitutional and a breach of trade agreements and copyrights, were cited as “important solutions” to delay health policies. Such scare and delay tactics are effective; the Philip Morris litigation against Australia’s plain packaging laws saw New Zealand delay the adoption of similar strategies in 2013. This intimidation approach is particularly effective when waged on poorer nations with less economic ability to defend public health efforts. These sorts of legislative challenges to tobacco control measures also work to deter efforts by other nations; this is known to industry and reflected in their business strategies. The 2014 Philip Morris meeting concluded with emails from company executives congratulating their team on efforts to dilute or block measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette-related deaths. Leaked papers also show that tobacco executives target health programs and policies at a country level. One method described complex efforts aimed at ensuring that tobacco policy decisions remained in the hands of Ministries of Finance and not Ministries of Health, as the former were perceived as more likely to prioritise revenue from tobacco sales over the resulting disease. Indeed, one written and systematic objective of the tobacco industry was “avoiding a declaration of health over trade”. Condemning evidence also emerged of Philip Morris’s actions in India, with a 2014 internal document explicitly highlighting the targeting of India’s youth as an opportunity to increase market share. The company has been linked to direct payments to tobacco shops to display advertising, and distributing free cigarettes at nightclubs and bars, both in direct conflict with national law. The threat to public health posed by predatory, pernicious and pervasive industry practices such as these cannot be overstated: it is a matter of life and death. In India alone, tobacco accounts for almost 1 million deaths per year and health expenditure on tobacco-related disease is estimated at $16 billion annually. To many of us in a range of public health areas, these newly leaked documents simply reconfirm long-held suspicions, and resonate a “groundhog day” phenomenon. They describe cold, calculated obstructions of public health efforts by strategic, powerful and unscrupulous industry executives. These are not desperate acts of a dying industry, in fact Philip Morris International’s share price has doubled since 2008 and no fewer people smoked daily in 2016 worldwide than they did 10 years earlier.Nor are these behaviours limited to the tobacco industry alone, with many of the same approaches now adopted by food, alcohol and soft drink producers alike. In 2016, the Global Energy Balance Network encouraged policy makers to emphasise exercise in the mitigation of obesity. As it turns out, the primary goal of this network was to shift health policy focus away from effective, nutrition-based interventions by using distraction tactics and dubious science. Later, it was revealed that this very platform was funded by Coca-Cola, with even its website registered to the soft-drink multinational. The examples are numerous and global.While cigarettes are the only product that when used exactly as designed will kill one in two of its users, the continuing power and influence of the global tobacco industry cannot be underestimated. Nor should the public health or medical communities expect the tactics to be any different as we strive to protect populations from other highly profitable health threats. If anything, as further progress is made, we should expect such tactics to become more desperate, depraved and deadly. And while we should be proud of the progress made to date, not for a moment should we think that the battle is even close to ending.

Just how Trump plans to enforce this ban, which may not even be legal, remains unclear. Still, the mayor of Austin, Texas is urging trans troops on active duty to apply for new jobs on his city’s police force if they find themselves discharged. Mayor Steve Adler, who is a Democrat, extended the offer in a series of tweets Wednesday afternoon. He reiterated the invitation in a Facebook post Wednesday. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who previously served as Austin’s police chief, followed suit with a similar offer on Twitter. Prospective applicants should note that the Austin Police Department has an openly transgender officer on its current roster. After being a member of the city’s police force for 10 years, Greg Abbink came out to his colleagues as trans in 2014, The Austin American-Statesman reported. Adler’s Facebook post has received a flurry of responses, the majority of them positive. “I appreciate that you are a man of conviction and you give voice to the voiceless,” one person wrote. Added another, “Thank you for continuing to represent the values of our great community so well.”Adler’s Communications Director Jason Stanford told HuffPost that the mayor’s pledge was a prime example of “how we do things in Austin.” “Please note that we have an out trans police officer here, a LGBTQ police support group with more than 100 officers, an LGBTQ liaison in the Mayor’s office and a new LGBTQ Quality of Life Commission,” he said, “and none of this has generated the slightest bit of controversy.” Meanwhile, Austin’s interim Police Chief Brian Manley was among a number of law enforcement officials to appear at the Texas State Capitol Tuesday to speak out against proposed legislation that would prohibit trans people from using restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. (The bill, SB 3, was passed by the Senate, but still needs state House approval and the governor’s signature to become law.)

I loved looking at all the old and historic guns at NRA headquarters because I was a gun-nut by the age of five, and I loved the FBI tour because the last stop was at the shooting range where one of the agents would fire a 45-caliber tommy gun and I could take home the empty brass.The funny thing about those childhood experiences, however, was they took place at a time when Americans had much more positive views on the importance of regulating guns than we have today. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the gun surveys conducted by Gallup, several of which started when I was a kid. For example, Gallup has been asking this question since 1959: “Do you think there should or should not be a law that would ban the possession of handguns, except by the police and other authorized persons?” In 1959 this question was answered affirmatively by 60 percent of the respondents; the last time this question was asked, in October, 2016, affirmative responses dropped to 23 percent.Here’s how the views on another hot-button gun issue have changed, the question being asked: “Would you vote for or against a law which would make it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess semi-automatic guns known as assault rifles?” In other words, how do Gallup respondents feel about an assault rifle ban? In 1996, the first time this question was asked, 57 percent said they favored such a ban, last year the pro-ban percentage was 36 percent.Finally, in 1993 Gallup asked respondents for the first time about whether guns made them safe: “Do you think having a gun in the house makes it a [safer place to be] or [a more dangerous place to be]?” The first time this question was asked in 1993, guns making a home safer got 42 percent of the responses, the last time it was asked in 2014, the ‘safe’ vote was up to 63 percent. Taking these three questions together, the pro-gun views on handgun ownership, assault weapons and guns for safety have all become more positive by at least half. It would be easy to put this shift down to one of two arguments: 1) the country is becoming more conservative; 2) the NRA is doing a great PR job about guns. Unfortunately, both arguments can easily be shot through (pardon the pun) with holes. The country is becoming so much more conservative over the time-period covered by these surveys that abortion is law of the land, ditto gay marriage even in the most pro-gun states. As for the vaunted NRA noise machine, the percentage of Gallup respondents who always agree with the NRA on gun issues has stayed exactly the same from 1996 to 2012 – a whole, big 6 percent.Our friend Mark Glaze was recently dragged over the coals by the NRA which discovered a survey that his ‘radical’ group, Guns Down, published after the shooting of Steve Scalise. The survey showed firm majorities for more gun control and less guns in circulation, so obviously any public opinion polling, including Gallup’ surveys, has to be treated with care. But the value of the Gallup polls is they ask the same questions year after year and no matter how you slice it or dice it, the message seems to be that Americans aren’t afraid of guns.Most people are a lot more afraid of things they believe guns can be used to protect them against – crime, terrorism, danger in a generic sense – I don’t know anyone who can’t tell me exactly where they were and what they were doing on the morning of September 11, 2001. And as long as we continue to believe that the world has become a more dangerous place, simply giving folks the results of a gun survey won’t persuade them to agree with what the survey says."

20,HEALTHY LIVING,"Guns, God, And Recovery: Red State Alaska Is Breaking Barriers For People Facing Addiction","Ryan Hampton, ContributorAuthor, recovery advocate, person in recovery from a substance...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/guns-god-and-recovery-in-red-state-alaska-is-breaking_us_59798eb1e4b06b305561ce20,Progressive cutting edge treatment programs and public policy for addiction and recovery on America’s frontier.,2017-07-27,"<p>Alaska Governor Bill Walker brought the recovery community to the table and got results. On Tuesday, they joined him for the signing of HB 159 - a law designed to fight the state’s opioid epidemic.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597990421a00009dc1dc0c63.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Full disclosure: I live in California. It’s one of the bluest states in the nation. There are over a dozen rehabs in driving distance of my house, all of them claiming to offer the best treatment and the highest recovery rates. I thought that was progressive. Then, my friend Terria Walters, a woman in long term recovery who’s the founder of Fallen Up Ministries, invited me to come visit her in Alaska: Sarah Palin’s backyard, and one of the reddest states in the nation.What I saw there completely changed my perspective on what’s really “cutting edge” in treatment and public policy for addiction and recovery. I saw joy. I saw recovery. I saw Americans, working hard to help each other. Most of all, I saw hope.Terria said that Alaska was tackling the opioid crisis head-on. “In big cities, you won’t see any of the same recovery resources you see here in Wasilla or the Mat-Su Valley,” she said. “We’re just a community here. We’re sick and tired of watching people die and decided to do something about it.”They may be ‘just a community,’ but they’ve taken strides that challenge many government agencies, hospitals, and treatment centers to match their progress. The results? More people with substance use disorder are finding lasting recovery, even in maximum security prisons and serving long sentences. Mat-Su Opioid Task Force is using Medicaid to treat people with substance use disorder and protecting this vulnerable population. With drug and alcohol now a leading cause of death for people under 50, and killing one American every four minutes, it’s a serious threat: shaming, silencing, and stigmatizing addiction doesn’t work. Alaska is taking this seriously, and they’re getting amazing results. How do they do it? By focusing on support, treatment, and early intervention. I got to spend time with Karl Soderstrom and Kerby Kraus, who run the peer-to-peer support group Fiend 2 Clean. Their organization uses “presumptive Medicaid” to connect ER patients who have overdosed with a peer recovery network, sober housing, and recovery support. Instead of giving patients Narcan and then putting them back on the street, doctors work with Fiend 2 Clean to help people with substance use disorder get out of the system and get sober for good. Another nonprofit, My House, offers support to homeless adolescents with drug and alcohol issues. Michelle Overstreet runs this incredible, forward-thinking group: she was actually recognized by Alaska Governor Bill Walker this week for her innovation. My House has a cool, steampunk boutique and a coffee shop in addition to housing and support for young people ages 14-24. It’s not a scary, institutional-looking place: Michelle says that making My House feel like home was key for young people, who are at risk and need more than just a hot meal and a cot.The same strategy works for people who are incarcerated, too. I visited two facilities: Anchorage Correctional Complex and Spring Creek Correctional Center. “We looked at the best practices guide and thought, best practices for who?” said Spring Creek Superintendent Bill Lapinskas. “What’s best for one person isn’t best for another one. We had to look closer and adapt.” Instead, he worked with inmates, mental health professionals, and recovery groups to make a new program that focuses on the individual’s needs. Mindfulness, yoga, classes in entrepreneurship, Bible study group, and more help people address their substance use issues. Just as important is a change in the way prison is used: instead of unremitting, dehumanizing punishment, these programs are designed to rehabilitate people and prepare them to stay healthy and sober when they reenter society. By treating people with substance use disorder as people, Alaska’s criminal justice system is breaking ground. Yet, its program is simple enough to be adapted to almost any facility. When will the rest of America catch up?My week in Alaska was incredible: inspiring and energizing. I was reminded once again of the hard work communities are doing to fight the opioid crisis. Grassroots, local, and state level changes are helping stem the tide of overdose deaths. Instead of looking the other way, or waiting for the federal government to take action, we are helping our neighbors. When we do that, we all benefit.Now that’s what I call progressive.Ryan Hampton is an outreach lead and recovery advocate at Facing Addiction, a leading nonprofit dedicated to ending the addiction crisis in the United States."

I was drawn by the title and looking further I read in their manifesto that they are seeking to “empower women writers to submit their work to literary magazines for publication”. My first question was, don’t we? Women? Submit? Why the need for such an initiative?Reading further, I found out that they launch submission parties, open to all women writers where they encourage women to submit and share information. And what triggered their first submission party was the response they got from editors they questioned about why female writers are underrepresented in prestigious literary journals. Editors claimed that women writers don’t submit as often as men do. Taking their word to heart, the co-founders of Women Who Submit decided to do something about it. So simple. To act instead of talk about it. And not allow for excuses.Once you realize that information is power, what’s left is a plan of how to share it. And Women Who Submit decided to reach out instead of keeping the information they possessed hidden. They meet up in private homes, build strong communities and share resources. They celebrate each other’s successes, soothe each other’s worries and give advice when things go wrong. Above all, they set goals and talk submission strategies. And judging from the way their meetings have multiplied and thrived, they are doing something right.Women Who Submit are not the only ones who have viewed the submission process as their own social action to tackle the silencing of women in the literary world. Because in the end, what’s left is whose story gets told. The only one heard is the only believed. The one making history.Other successful writers have also stepped forward to share their experiences in the submission process and to warn against mistakes women can avoid. Usually they all agree that what women should do is to both believe in themselves and reach out more.****Of course in some parts of the world the most urgent problem is neither to find time to write nor to get published in a prestigious literary magazine. Some time ago, I liked the Facebook page Bring Our Girls Back. The page was made in an effort to spread the word around that 230 school girls were kidnapped by the terrorist group Boko Haram in Nigeria in 2014 (Oh, my God! Has it been so long?). The creators of the page rightly thought that sometimes what such cases need is exposure. Only through exposure and pressure can authorities with limited resources be forced to prioritize certain cases. Because time passes and people forget. And we all live in our own little bubbles.Much has been said about the negative effects of social media, but they have also proven to be a valuable tool in terms of getting the word out and rallying people around a common cause. In the case of the kidnapped girls, the founders of the initiative reminded the rest of the world that something like that could happen to anyone. It could be your daughter, they so eloquently put it. Help. Share.And every time an update pops up online that many of the girls are still missing, three years after their kidnapping, I, at least, feel angrier and angrier. We know what happened and we know who did it. We have sent people to the moon and we have launched satellites to monitor everything. For God’s sake, what’s taking them so long?In the past days, supporters of the kidnapped girls were invited to the White House. That’s a sign of how much we can do if we stay united and look after each other. Because similar crimes take place too often around the earth and without exposure and a strong supportive system they don’t even make the morning news.****So, how can we help other women? A small step every day is all it takes. By reaching out and sharing. All of us have some knowledge to share. It is not only writing advice and acts of crime that require our immediate attention.I, for instance, work as a firefighter. When school girls come to visit the fire department, I show them around the Fire House: the bunks we sleep on, the kitchen we all sit and eat at, like a family. I encourage them to put my helmet on. I show them the uniform we wear; the uniform that protects us. I then hand them a hose to hold and let them figure out on their own how it works and if it is heavy or not (it isn’t). But most importantly, I talk to them excitedly about how they will feel when helping others.I tell them they can be anything they want in life. Anything.Previously published as ‘Reach Out.

22,POLITICS,Republicans' Risky New Idea: Vote For Awful Repeal Bill And Hope Others Fix It,Jennifer Bendery and Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-obamacare-repeal-skinny-bill_us_597a6d5ee4b0da64e8780029,"“Seriously, this is weapons grade bonkers.""",2017-07-27,Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) announces opposition to the so-called skinny repeal of Obamacare on Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597a701b1500007d208b3f3b.jpeg?cache=QSfqwn64qq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It’s increasingly clear that Senate Republicans don’t have, and never had, a plan for repealing the Affordable Care Act. But their strategy for getting some kind of health care reform package across the finish line is coming into focus: vote for a terrible bill that nobody likes, and hope that other Republicans will fix it later.That’s essentially what a handful of GOP senators proposed in a Thursday evening press conference. Appearing alongside Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Bill Cassidy (La.) and Ron Johnson (Wis.), Lindsey Graham (S.C) announced they all opposed the narrowly tailored repeal of Obamacare that’s on the table, dubbed the “skinny repeal.” But, he continued, if House GOP leaders can promise them they won’t just pass such a bill if the Senate sent it over and instead agree to go into a conference committee with the Senate to hammer out a better bill, then these senators, and perhaps others, would agree to vote for it.“Give us the assurance that whatever we pass tonight will go to conference,” Johnson said, criticizing the “skinny” package as not doing enough to fix the health care system.It’s a ridiculously huge gamble for Senate Republicans to think the House will simply go along with their wishes. Some House Republicans have already signaled they’d be fine with just passing the skinny bill, sending it to President Donald Trump to sign into law and calling it a day. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has never had a firm grip on his caucus, either, so his promises to Senate Republicans could ring hollow.Alternatively, if the House and Senate did go into a conference committee and failed to reach a consensus on a final bill, there’s the chance the House simply passes the skinny repeal bill the four senators denounced Thursday as a “disaster” and sends it to the president’s desk.If this bill did become law, it would knock 16 million people off of health insurance and drive up premiums by 20 percent, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.A Ryan spokeswoman did not give any immediate sign as to whether the House would oblige with such a guarantee, calling a conference committee “one option under consideration and something we’re taking steps to prepare for should we choose that route.”Ryan put out a statement later Thursday evening saying the House was “willing” to go into a conference committee to keep negotiating on a bill. But, notably, he did not rule out the possibility of the House bypassing the Senate and sending the skinny repeal bill to the president.“The House remains committed to finding a solution and working with our Senate colleagues, but the burden remains on the Senate to demonstrate that it is capable of passing something that keeps our promise, as the House has already done,” Ryan said. “We expect the Senate to act first on whatever the conference committee produces.”McCain described Ryan’s statement, which was silent on whether the speaker might take up and pass the Senate bill at some point in the future, as “not sufficient.”“I would like to have the kind of assurances he didn’t provide,” he told reporters Thursday evening. McCain said he needed to consult with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a fellow Republican, before deciding how he would vote on the bill.But after securing verbal assurances from Ryan in a phone call late Thursday evening, Johnson and Graham announced they would vote to pass the so-called skinny bill in the Senate.Johnson conceded the House could end up thwarting the plan he is advocating.“That’s entirely possible, but what we want is that chance to go to conference so we have the time to get the [CBO] scores,” Johnson said.Powerless in the minority, Democrats could do little but express their astonishment at the scheme.“Seriously, this is weapons grade bonkers. 3 Senators just announced they will vote for repeal only if assured it will never become law,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on Twitter.In the House, top Democrats warned not to trust that Republicans there would be willing to hash out a new bill. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) noted the House Rules Committee just passed something called Martial Law, which gives House Republicans total control to enact a Senate bill.“Senators are being told that they are voting for that bill to send it over here so it can go to conference and be perfected,” Hoyer said on the House floor. “There is a suspicion that I have … that there may be an intent to send the bill immediately… to the president, without 72 hours of consideration, without hearings, without scoring.”"

The group has pledged to increase financial stability of young Americans by addressing the student debt crisis and the changing nature of work.As a millennial who runs an organization dedicated to electing more young people to office, it’s encouraging to see politicians take our generation – and the challenges we face – seriously. The foundation is already working with businesses. It also needs to the input of young people who are already stepping up, running for office, and creating the new leadership we so desperately need.Like many Americans, millennials were demoralized by the 2016 elections, and on November 9th, it would have been easy for us to say, “screw it.” After all, the system has never really worked for us. We’re the first generation in modern memory to be economically worse off than our parents. For those of us who went to college, we’re paying off an average of $37,000 each in student loan debt – only to live at home and work unpaid internships in the hopes of someday finding a stable job. We’re putting off buying houses, getting married, and having children not only because we value our independence, but because we can’t afford these major milestones.Donald Trump’s win could have just set off another instance of millennial disengagement. After all, we came out of a bitter Democratic primary disenchanted, only to have Secretary Clinton win the popular vote but lose the election. We could have decided that electoral politics is just one more American institution that doesn’t work for us. But instead, we became more engaged than ever.We held one of the biggest marches in past 50 years. We are calling our representatives and senators at unprecedented rates. And now, we are running for office.I run an organization called LaunchProgress, which supports and funds young progressive candidates running for state and local office to build a progressive bench. This year, we received twice as many endorsement applications from millennial candidates than we have at any time in the past. Instead of stepping back, young people are stepping up. The candidates we’re working with are doing the hard work of knocking on doors, raising money, and talking to voters – even though many of them are still single, renting, and paying down student loans.Take, for example, Pierce Freelon, an artist and professor running for mayor of Durham. He’s in a band. He’s also running to protect affordable housing and defend Durham’s reputation as an inclusive city. Or Nada Al-Hanooti, who just graduated with a degree in Women’s and Gender Studies. At 26, this young Palestinian-American woman is running for City Council in her hometown of Dearborn, working to solve the problems of air pollution from the local steel plant and invest in public services. Or Aryeh Alex, an environmental organizer whose Ohio hometown has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic, and who is running to make sure his community gets the government services it needs.LaunchProgress is working with Pierce, Nada, and Aryeh to help them run, win, and make our country better.It’s encouraging to see House Democrats focus on millennials with the Future Forum Foundation. But young people are running because it’s become more and more clear to us that Boomers are not going to solve the major problems facing our community. We don’t need to wait our turn to start making the change we know our country needs."

The network said Thursday that it’s ordered 10 episodes of a half-hour show executive produced by Colbert, which remains untitled as of now. It sounds like the idea is to turn around episodes pretty quickly, so that the people involved in the show can play off of specific stories in the news, à la “South Park.”“I know a lot of people wanted to do this, and I’m honored that the Cartoon President invited our documentary crew into his private world,” Colbert said in a statement that has just a hint of sarcasm. “I’ve seen some of the footage, and I look forward to sharing the man behind the MAGA.” The show was inspired by an animated segment Colbert used to open his live coverage of the presidential election last November, which also aired on Showtime. The animated Trump has become something of a recurring character on “Late Show” since then. Here’s a bit more detail about how the show is going to go down, courtesy of Showtime:Premiering on SHOWTIME this fall, the fresh, cutting-edge comedy will present the truish adventures of Trump’s confidants and bon vivants – family, top associates, heads of government, golf pros and anyone else straying into his orbit – intrepidly exploring their histories and their psyches, revealing insights into what makes them so definitively Trumpian. It’s a workplace comedy where the office happens to be oval; it’s a character study in search of character, as seen through the eyes of an imaginary documentary crew. "

Joseph Dunford testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 13, 2017. (REUTERS/Aaron P.

His decision drew condemnation from rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties as politically motivated discrimination. But it was also praised by conservative activists and some of his fellow Republicans.The White House said Trump had “extensive discussions with his national security team,” and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president made the decision on Tuesday to go ahead.But one official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford, in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force, acknowledged that Trump’s announcement on Wednesday was “unexpected.”Trump cited “tremendous medical costs and disruption” as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual’s capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference.ORDERS VIA TWITTER?Trump’s tweets stoked alarm among some senior military officers and Pentagon civilians, who were caught off guard by it, three general officers in two services said early on Thursday.“I hope our commander in chief understands that we don’t transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can’t, either,” one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it’s even possible.”Trump’s threat to ban transgender service members unleashed a storm of legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue.Trump’s surprise tweets did not make clear when a ban reversing Obama’s policy to allow transgender people to openly serve would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say.“There’s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military,” said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal.It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to members of the reserve.Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters he was concerned about his status.“I try to be tough about it,” he said, but added: “It breaks your spirit down.”One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted.“We’re scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from,” the officer said by phone, speaking on condition of anonymity.“Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today’s military. Our service personnel today don’t give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts.”(Reporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; additional reporting by John Walcott, Letitia Stein, Daniel Trotta; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Jonathan Oatis)"

As a humanitarian aid worker on the ground in Mosul every day, my fear is that the international community will forget the immense human toll that the Islamic State and the conflict has had on Iraqi families. An even greater concern is that we will neglect our moral responsibility as human beings to help the people of Mosul start again. The devastation of Mosul is nearly total. The United Nations estimates that 5,500 buildings in the Old City alone are in need of repair. Aerial photographs of west Mosul are almost post-apocalyptic—think 1945 Dresden or Hiroshima. Entire neighborhoods have been leveled. Streets are deserted. There is no electricity or running water. It is impossible to imagine how anyone could—or would—return to their former homes in west Mosul without major investments in shelter and infrastructure. Security also remains an issue. Sporadic fighting continues in isolated pockets of the city, while residents fear sniper-fire and attacks could flare up around them again at any time. We hear daily from families who tell us they need the basics—food, water, shelter—but what they want most is security. So far, they don’t feel comfortable returning home. For now, that means the future of the more than 682,000 Iraqis currently displaced from their homes in the city is uncertain. Roughly half now live with family and friends. The rest remain in overcrowded displacement camps outside Mosul. We work in Jeda’a and Hammam al Alil displacement camps, which have been flooded with displaced families from west Mosul, providing primary health care, mental health and psychosocial support, gender-based violence prevention and response, and community health education. This work is needed just as much now as it was when the fighting raged because these services must be available to families as they navigate what comes next.The bleak reality of going back to west Mosul was summarized by 48-year-old Talal, who spoke for his family of seven: “The security situation there is far from being stable, destroyed infrastructure facilities, and no electricity or water, nothing to support our life.”Humanitarians also need access to west Mosul. Earlier this year, after the eastern half of the city was reclaimed by Iraqi Security Forces, International Medical Corps worked with eight primary health clinics to get once again operational and caring for families. We restocked their pharmacies, made infrastructure repairs (some of which included fixing damage left by mortars), provided doctors and nurses, and helped pay existing staff. We also trained doctors and nurses to identify, handle, and refer mental health issues and equipped 120 civilian volunteers in first aid. These are all tasks we are ready to do again, but with the security situation in west Mosul still tenuous, it remains uncertain when we will be able to deploy teams to begin this life-saving work. What is certain, however, is that we cannot afford to scale back now. To do so would be to turn our backs on families who have experienced incomprehensible suffering during three years of brutal ISIL rule, followed by months of grinding urban war, fought neighborhood-by-neighborhood, block-by-block in a battle that destroyed their homes and claimed so many of their loved ones forever. The battle for Mosul may have ended, but an unimaginably deep ocean of human suffering remains in its wake. It must be addressed."

The punishment was carried out on July 17 after her family handed the girl over.The case came to light when both families filed criminal charges with police accusing the other family’s son of rape.Questioning both sides in the cases, however, soon revealed the role of the informal village council, Younus said.“All the village council elders who ordered the revenge rape have been arrested,” he said.Both the victims and their mothers have been sent to a women’s protection center, he added.Pakistan has a centuries-old tradition of quick justice handed down by gatherings of local elders, known as jirgas or panchayats, seen by many villagers as preferable to the often-cumbersome and corrupt formal legal system.In most of the country, jirgas are tolerated but not recognized by the formal courts and police.The jirgas and the practice of “revenge rape” drew international attention in 2002 when a woman named Mukhtaran Mai was ordered gang-raped by a local council for a male relative’s alleged crime.Mai took the rare step of filing criminal charges against her attackers, and six men were convicted and sentenced to death later that year, though five of them were later freed on appeal.Mai went on to become a high-profile campaigner for women’s rights in Pakistan.“Another Tribe Court (panchayat) in south Punjab Multan and another girl was raped. We are still in 2002,” Mai said on her official Twitter account this week.Speaking to Reuters by telephone, Mai denounced the revenge rape.“If there were any justice in the panchayat, they should have shot the rapist. Why punish an innocent girl instead?”"

All 65 district spots were up for grabs and in the end the Democrats remained in the majority, securing three additional seats.Eighteen Democratic candidates in the Colorado elections received monetary support from Common Sense Values, an independent expenditure committee that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in elections. Of the candidates who were favored by this IE committee, nearly three-fourths of them won their respective elections.The Democratic candidates who received the most support were Rep. Jeff Bridges (more than $202,000); Rep. Thomas “Tony” Exum, Sr. (nearly $190,000); and Rep. Barbara Hall McLachlan (almost $160,000). They represent Colorado’s third, 17th and 59th districts, respectively.According to the Colorado state campaign finance disclosure website, the Common Sense Values IE committee was started in August 2016 and then terminated the following December after the election was over. In just a few short months, it raised nearly $2.6 million and spent the vast majority of that supporting or opposing candidates in the Colorado House elections, with the remainder going toward “consultant and professional services,” among other items.So how did the Common Sense Values IE committee raise more than $2.5 million in five months? Almost all of the money — $2,558,968.03 to be exact — came from its partner organization with the same name: Common Sense Values. But since the other group is a 527 “issue advocacy” organization it needed an IE committee to be able to advocate for or against political candidates. The two groups also used each other to pass funds back and forth.Although both the 527 organization and the IE committee were primarily state-focused during the 2016 election cycle, the IE committee did engage in limited federal activity. As a result, the IE committee did report some electioneering communications to the FEC.Brendan Fischer, director of federal and FEC reform for the Campaign Legal Center, said it looks like the Common Sense Values 527 organization set up the IE committee as an entity it could route its electioneering communications through. He added that although the Common Sense Values IE committee may sound like a super PAC, it did not appear to register with the FEC as such.Similar to its IE committee, the Common Sense Values 527 organization also terminated shortly after the 2016 election, although it was originally started in November 2014.Both the 527 organization and the IE committee had the same two registered agents: Ashley Stevens and Julie Wells. According to the Colorado registered agent search, Stevens is tied to a total of 18 different independent expenditure committees and 527 committees. Of these committees, only five remain active with Stevens as the registered agent. Wells has her name associated with more than 60 committees — all of them terminated, except one of which she is no longer the active agent.The same email and phone number are listed for both Stevens and Wells on federal and state documents for their committees. Neither Stevens nor Wells responded to requests for comment on their work as registered agents for the two Common Sense Values groups.Continuing down the money trail, it is not as clear-cut where the Common Sense Values 527 organization received its funds during the 2016 election cycle. Almost 180 different groups contributed to the organization, giving it a fundraising total of more than $3.1 million. The top five donors were Education Reform Now Advocacy ($455,000); the National Education Association (NEA) Advocacy Fund($255,000); the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ($200,000); the Service Employees International Union ($150,000); and America Votes($138,750).Two of these top contributors — Education Reform Now Advocacy and America Votes — are nonprofit 501(c) social welfare organizations, which means they do not have to disclose their donors to the public. These groups are not supposed to have politics as their primary purpose, but quite often spend heavily in elections at both the state and federal level. And because they do not have to disclose their donors, the money trail often dead ends here. There is very little way of knowing the identities of these donors, who — at least partially — supported the campaigns of several Democratic candidates running for seats in the Colorado House of Representatives.The identities of the original donors — whether they be individuals or corporations — are almost impossible to uncover. However, research conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics has added some clarity as to where organizations like America Votes receive their money. For example, a CRP analysis of tax filings from 2014, show that two of America Votes’ largest donors were the League of Conservation Voters and Patriot Majority USA, a non-disclosing group run by Democratic operatives that has spent millions in federal elections.Data from the Department of Labor also indicates unions heavily supported America Votes. In 2016, the nonprofit organization received almost $2.6 million from 13 different unions.The 990 form for America Votes for the 2015-16 fiscal year was the first piece to this dark money puzzle. The tax document showed America Votes gave grants to four different Colorado-based organizations, including Common Sense Values (the 527 organization). The $138,750 Common Sense Values reported it received from America Votes was through one of these grants. America Votes’ super PAC also gave Common Sense Values an additional $46,250.While America Votes is a national organization, it does have state-based affiliatesacross the country. Although Colorado is one of America Votes’ “core states,” it is still noteworthy that the national organization decided to devote so much attention to this one state, rather than any of their other 20 state affiliates. Following the money trail ultimately revealed the elections in Colorado as the likely reason committees based in the state were receiving extra attention from America Votes.In the 2015-16 fiscal year, America Votes spent more than $8.4 million. As a 501 (c)(4) organization, America Votes is not supposed to dedicate more than 49 percent of its expenditures to political spending. Sometimes these groups can get around this requirement by reporting certain spending as “educational.” The grants given to the four Colorado-based organizations were all marked as “general support” and also reported as political spending in the Schedule C of America First’s 990. In all, America Votes gave $333,750 in grants for the 2015-16 fiscal year, bringing its political expenditure total to $1,308,352 — well under the 49 percent limit for political spending.Put simply, the money funding these Colorado elections came from secret sources and changed hands many times before actually reaching the candidates. Nevertheless, the support seemed to help as 13 out of the 18 candidates who received money won their respective elections and now hold seats in Colorado’s House of Representatives. As for the true origins of this dark money, unless regulations around 501(c) groups change, we may never solve the donor mystery."
31,POLITICS,House GOP Tries To Slip Through 'Radical' Rollback Of Drinking Water Protections,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clean-water-rule-rollback_us_597a23fbe4b02a4ebb73e0f8,GOP lawmakers want to give Trump the power to scrap a rule safeguarding 1 in 3 Americans' water.,2017-07-27,The GOP-backed provision would let President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt circumvent the usual process to dump the Clean Water Rule.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597a256a1a00008381dc0dba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans in the House are considering a measure that would let the Trump administration bypass the usual steps to eliminate drinking water protections.A provision buried in a massive spending bill set to be debated this week would allow the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to ignore the requirement that they give meaningful consideration to public comments before rescinding the 2015 Waters of the United States Rule. That regulation, also known as the Clean Water Rule, extended federal protections to all “navigable” waterways that flow into larger bodies. The rule could affect the drinking water for some 117 million Americans.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February directing the EPA and Army officials to “review and reconsider” the rule. Last month, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt released a 42-page plan to dismantle the regulation. On Wednesday, the EPA and the Army published their proposal to undo the rule in the Federal Register, kicking off a 30-day comment period.The provision in the spending bill would also make it harder for a judge to block the administration’s repeal effort.“It’s radical,” said Madeleine Foote, a legislative representative for the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters. “It’s pretty much they just want to be able to repeal this rule with no consequences and no public backlash, making it really difficult to sue over.”Republicans have fiercely criticized the Clean Water Rule for expanding federal control over smaller waterways and potentially adding to the burdens of business owners, who have to obtain what the critics consider onerous permits before dumping pollution into streams and wetlands. (The regulation has not been implemented yet due to a federal court stay.) The rule clarified the reach of the 1972 Clean Water Act after Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 created confusion over which waterways the law applied to.Under the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, agencies must allow the public to comment on regulatory changes like undoing the Clean Water Rule. Under the Clean Water Act, those comments must be meaningfully considered by the agency. In this case, the administration set a 30-day window for public comments, despite the longstanding 60-day guideline outlined in a 1993 executive order.The Clean Water Rule itself took four years to craft, beginning in 2011. It involved 400 meetings with stakeholders and 200 days of public feedback, during which regulators received 1.1 million comments. The vast majority supported the Obama administration’s effort.“If this congressional provision goes through, the EPA wouldn’t even have to consider the comments it receives in that ridiculously short period of time,” Jon Devine, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told HuffPost on Thursday. “They could just blow it off.”Over the past few years, farmers and ranchers became the face of the Republican opposition to the Clean Water Rule, with the American Farm Bureau, the country’s largest agricultural lobby, out front.“I applaud the administration’s move to rescind this burdensome regulation that would create heavy compliance costs for Hoosier farmers and landowners,” Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said in a statement. “WOTUS [Waters of the United States] is a major overstep by the federal government, and I am pleased to see that the administration is acting to withdraw this rule.”But the rule has actually garnered strong support among small farmers, who depend on clean water for their crops and livestock. The Clean Water Act exempts farmers from obtaining permits to dump solid material, such as soil from a planted field, as well as potentially pesticide-laden runoff from irrigation and stormwater.Homebuilders, oil and gas drillers, manufacturers and miners, on the other hand, need permits to release their polluted runoff under the law. The Clean Water Rule raised hurdles for them.“The agricultural industry is not actually impacted by this at all,” Foote said. “But they make a better face for the campaign than an oil company.”So far opponents’ efforts to stop the rule change have proved unsuccessful. On Wednesday, the House rejected an amendment from Reps. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.) to strip the provision from the appropriations bill. A coalition of 20 environmental groups signed an open letter backing the Beyer-Esty amendment.“This thing is terrible enough on the substantive side, attacking drinking water protections for 1 in 3 Americans,” Devine said. “It’s also anti-democratic, bad government. It’s akin to pre-emptive pardon, which is kind of bouncing around Washington these days.”He added, “This is Congress telling the Trump administration, ‘Don’t let any pesky laws get in the way of your agenda.’”"

You must revamp from the ground up regardless of the pushback you’ll receive from the current “experts” that are making millions of dollars off the worst health crisis in the history of our great nation.We can never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN until we understand the truth about opioid addiction. The answers are available, but I fear the media’s fascination with Russia and your response to it, will only guarantee the failure of those of us who are in the trenches. Mr. President, it is clear that the current hysteria has become a laser guided missile aimed at taking you down. It appears that every journalist on the planet is striving to become the next Woodward and Bernstein and dethrone a sitting President.My advice. Forget about it! Move on. If you continue to tickle them with early morning tweets, you lose. Let the Russian investigation play out. You cannot control the frenzy. However, you can control your legacy. You do have the power to bring an end to the opioid crisis in AmericaMr. President, I am one of the lucky ones. I survived a 10-bag-a-day heroin habit to become a bestselling author, WGA screenwriter, and recipient of the prestigious du-Pont-Columbia Award for excellence in journalism.How did I do it?I combined the adage, “One Day at a Time,” education, exercise, meditation and God to accumulate three decades.Let me sum up exactly how I accomplished it.My sponsor gave me crystal clear words of wisdom that to this day still ring inside my head as soon as my feet hit the floor in the morning. Mike, a tough-guy Marine, said, “I don’t care if your ass falls off. You don’t use heroin today!”Now I have to admit when every fiber of every muscle is screaming for a blast of heroin, those words from my sponsor were not easy to swallow. Some days, “One Day at a Time” was too long. I had to survive “One Minute at a Time.” Not an easy task when you have not told the truth in years, and the number of friends you have has dwindled to zero.But America must know overcoming addiction is possible. I went to AA and NA meetings, and I reached out to my sponsor several times a day. Who by the way, made a point to tell me he wasn’t my friend. But rather, somebody, I could trust to lead my life toward recovery. Bottom line, “my ass fell off” many times during that first year, and I refused to use heroin to fix it.Please don’t forget us, President Trump. We need a new plan and we need to keep it simple. EDUCATIONIf I could advise anybody as to where the magic bullet was hiding, I’d point them toward their brain. You see, on heroin, your brain is broken. The wiring has all been short-circuited. But correct the wiring, and you’ll unleash a fury of energy and potential that you would have never imagined.And the good news, you don’t have to Einstein. You do not have to go to law school or medical school. I just signed up at a local community college, began writing for the college newspaper about my addiction, and one day the Boston Globe called me up and asked me if they could pay me 500 bucks to publish one of my stories.I was like, “What? You are kidding, right?” Bottomline, my ability to reason became clear when I opened my mind to new information. In fact, a whole new world exploded right in front of me. I could see things and understand clearly for the first time in ten years. Education made me feel alive again.EXERCISEI hated my sponsor because he was always right. One day early in recovery, he told me that I should meet him at the gym early every morning before the noontime meeting. My answer was simple, “Nah, I’m good. I have a plan, and I’m going to work it.”I remember he looked at me and laughed. It pissed me off. But then he asked, “How long have you been in charge of your own life? How long have you been making the decisions in your life?” Right about then, I wanted to punch him in the nose. “What do you mean? Forever, I’m in charge right now.” Well, he laughed again and said, “How has that been working out for you?”I met him at the gym the next morning and what I found out was priceless. I felt amazing after just a week. It gave me confidence and a boost of energy. It guided me through the depression of trying to deal with all the mistakes I had made as a heroin addict. So much so, exercise became as addictive as knowledge.MEDITATIONFirst, let me tell you that I believe in God. In fact, I never would have survived the streets if it was not for divine intervention. But don’t let that stop you from learning from me and devouring how I overcame heroin addiction. I just happened to have a personal experience that brought me to my knees.That said, I found meditation was an act of prayer. Every day, I would go off by myself and play soothing music as I tried to remove all the madness from my brain. And there was plenty of madness early on, from legal issues to family issues, my backyard was a minefield.The good news is anybody can learn to meditate. You don’t have to believe in God. The secret is practice. It is hard at first to shut down all the outside influences, fears, panic, guilt, doubt and shame. It takes some time to find total darkness in that soft, comfortable space within your brain.Mr. President, I beat heroin with a simple fail-safe, rock-solid plan, and nobody gave me a fighting chance. Everybody said I was either going to die on the streets or spend my life in jail. In fact, I even tried to kill myself and failed miserably. My road to recovery works, and it can work for others too! In closing, some people ask me how I can be so arrogant to suggest that struggling addicts can overcome by a simple plan like education, exercise, and meditation. My answer to them is simple, “I was a junkie. I beat heroin, and I have a distinct road map pointing to recovery for all to follow.” Ritchie Farrell is the author of I am a Heroin Addict.Follow Ritchie Farrell on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ritchiefarrell1Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

33,ENTERTAINMENT,Carly Rae Jepsen Doesn't Care If She Has The Song Of The Summer,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carly-rae-jepsen-doesnt-care-if-she-has-the-song-of-the-summer_us_5977818ce4b0e201d578acf6,"Even though ""Cut to the Feeling"" has zero competition.",2017-07-27,Carly Rae Jepsen performs at M&M’s Spotlight series pop up concert in Chicago. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597a24061a00009bc1dc0dae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember when Carly Rae Jepsen invented pop music?Don’t fact check us on that, but, for some, there’s a distinct before and after when it comes to Jepsen’s place in the pop goddess history books. Ever since the Canadian singer threw a wish in the well with “Call Me Maybe,” the world dialed back with rapt attention and a thirst for more perfectly crafted pop confections. Luckily, Jepsen did that and then some with the critically lauded “Emotion” in 2015, which showed the world she had much more to offer than just an irresistibly catchy chorus. The ’80s synth-inspired album landed Jepsen on a number of “Best Of” lists and in the hearts of fans, many of them LGBTQ listeners, who resonated with her stories of heartbreak and, yes, really, really, really liking someone. Sitting on a surplus of more than 200 unreleased “Emotion” bops, Jepsen wasn’t done just yet. The reception was so overwhelmingly positive that the 31-year-old released a Side B, featuring eight new songs cut from the original album. Then, she dropped the new single “Cut To The Feeling” in May, as part of the soundtrack to the animated film “Leap!,” becoming a de facto song of the summer contender. But when we spoke to Jepsen, who recently headlined a concert for “M&M’S Spotlight” series, it became clear that accolades and saving pop music from Ed Sheeran isn’t what drives her to create. It’s finding that musical “spark,” as she puts it, and sending the love she receives every night onstage right back to her her fans. I saw you perform at Terminal 5 in New York City last year and it was low-key the best night of my life. Mine too. I loved that show and that space. I wanted to take the big disco balls home with me. You wrote over 250 songs for “Emotion.” How did you even begin to shape the record from such a massive amount of work? You go crazy. You spend nights listening to your own music on repeat and then you go so nuts that your friends come over and help you. You all have wine and you make little voting charts and try to figure out what feels the best. Then you try to put them in order, but you realize you have too many songs that are energy level five and you need a couple twos, so you go back. I think there’s always a point where you have to be like OK that’s the decision and run with it or you go a little nuts. How did you come to the decision to release “Emotion: Side B?” Also, thank you. The B-sides was this far-off dream that maybe some day we’d be able to share more of them. When I went into the label with my plea before “Emotion” was released, I was like, “OK guys get this. How do you feel about a 40-song album?” They were like, “No, that’s crazy. We can’t do that. You’ve got eight songs.” Somehow we negotiated and I got more than that.Then fans kept asking in these meet-and-greet situations if I’d ever be into doing an “Emotion Side B” and the idea started taking more form. It didn’t take a lot of work to go back in and pick some ones that I wished I’d been able to share previously. I think I speak for many when I say we’d all happily listen to a Side C. Me too, but I don’t know if I’m gonna get away with it. Even with this next project, I’m already 50 songs deep and l’m already feeling that familiar longing of, “Oh, I wish there could be a way to share all of these.”You blessed us all with the new single “Cut To The Feeling” earlier this year. What was the genesis behind the song and why did you choose to release it now? It was written a while back and part of the attempt for the first album, “Emotion.” I always thought it was a little theatrical in the way that I loved, but would suit something more like this movie. There were two sessions. The first time we all got together, we were pretty close ― we had the chorus in the right place, but verses needed some work. I find that happens a lot when you get together for a session and things are going great, but you come back with some perspective and dig a little deeper. It was such a fun collaboration and I’m really glad that its found its little home. So can you describe the actual feeling you are are cutting to in the song? I think it’s cut the bullshit. It’s like I’m in and I want you to be just as in. Let’s stop playing games and just go for that euphoric high together because you can’t do it alone. What do you make of “Cut To The Feeling” being hailed as the song of the summer?Obviously, it’s really flattering to hear that, but the song of the summer idea has always seemed a little crazy to me because I think you can have whole soundtracks and many songs. The summer is supposed to be filled with tons of music. Summer in itself is such a feeling to capture in a song and I think I’m always trying to capture that feeling. Every year there is this rat race to declare one song the song of the summer. Do you get caught up in that at all? Oh, I always think that’s a dangerous trap to get into. I think it can be a really easy thing to slip into a formula and referencing songs that have worked before, especially in the Los Angeles writing scene. It takes all of the heart out. All of the fun out. There has to be an initial spark or inspiration that’s stemming from something actually authentic inside you, and then you can go into all the rules and think about it. I think its a much more exciting place to just be coming at music always from the need to write it versus the I’m going to sit down and mathematically work out how to make money off this approach. That’s just going to kill you.In a perfect world, “Cut To The Feeling” would remain on the top of the charts from here to eternity. Do you ever get frustrated with the commercial performance of a single or feel like your music is underrated? I think that there was a transition from the height of “Call Me Maybe” into new music afterward. It’s just a different reality as a human you experience, but I’ve actually learned to quite love and prefer the reality I’m in now. I’m not playing these massive stadiums with more Justin Bieber fans [than my own] and you kind of don’t know where your place is. We’ve been able to create this home within our touring family and the audiences that come who get it. It’s a little more intimate and less No. 1s, but I really don’t need those to be happy. What about can you tell me about the new music you’re working on? I’m writing so many songs, but I’m enjoying the process of it. I’ve worked with some people who I’ve admired for years, Patrick Burger among them. It’s been trudging on new ground for me. I’m not trying to make it exactly like I’ve done before and that’s always an exciting time for growth. Are there any particular genres or sounds that you’re playing with this time around? Your last album was so heavily inspired by ’80s pop music.I have this total attraction to almost subtle, I-can-clean-my-house-to-this music sort of disco right now. But wherever my goal and destination is isn’t always where I end up landing. Sometimes I’m like, “We’re going to make a song like this,” but on the way there I make a left turn and it turns into a mamba. I don’t always know where I’m going, but that’s a fun discovery for me. What is unique about your fans? I’ve appreciated how most of them seem more interested in uplifting you then tearing other artists down. I find that to be one of the biggest gifts of this thing that in a world where there’s a lot of name-calling and judgement flying around, but for some reason we’ve landed in a place where everyone is kind and loving. I find that so incredible and I don’t know where that came from or why, but I feel so lucky to have that surrounding us. Why do you think your music has resonated so heavily with the LGBTQ community? I don’t know for sure, but I feel very, very fortunate for it. There’s nothing like that feeling when I’m onstage, and you can’t really explain it. It just feels like such a lovely thing that I’m one little part of. I hope that in turn everyone feels my love straight back and appreciation for that. Your fans have bestowed nicknames upon you like Carly Slay Jepsen and Carly Rae Jesuspsen. Do you have any personal favorites? You are making me laugh with these. My sister is in college just recently and her nickname was Katie Rage Jepsen. I don’t know about my own, but I would say any time someone’s put effort into making a T-shirt or a sign with one of those on it, it makes me feel so overwhelmed with joy."

36,POLITICS,Republicans Say They Can Fix 'Skinny Repeal' Later. Don't Be So Sure.,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-skinny-repeal-health-care_us_59790bcde4b02a4ebb729ca7,"By the end of this week, it could be too late.",2017-07-26,"Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (second from left) said Wednesday that Senate Republicans' ""skinny repeal"" plan would be a vehicle to go to a conference committee with the House -- and then later said the House could just pass whatever plan the Senate agrees to.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59790e6e210000a31afc8dba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans are still figuring out just how skinny their Obamacare “skinny repeal” needs to be to secure 50 votes, but what remains unclear is what happens after that.Republicans are trying to build the most comprehensive health care bill possible that can still garner 50 votes, playing legislative hot potato with their long-promised repeal. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters Wednesday there are two schools of thought on how to do that: by stripping away portions from the original GOP replacement or by building it from the ground up.Whichever way they go about it, there seems to be very little that 50 Senate Republicans agree on, much less 50 Senate Republicans and 218 House Republicans.Senate GOP leadership has suggested numerous times that its scaled-down repeal bill would just be a vehicle so the chamber can move along to a conference committee with the House. Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said as much Wednesday afternoon, telling a small group of reporters that the skinny repeal probably wouldn’t touch Medicaid and that lawmakers would address Medicaid “when we conference with the House.”But about an hour later, Cornyn was raising the possibility that House lawmakers could just take whatever limited bill the Senate passes and send it to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.“There doesn’t need to be a conference,” Cornyn said. “There could be an informal conference. The House could take up the Senate bill and pass that, or they could amend it and send it back.”Forgiving for a moment that Cornyn is essentially just laying out the constitutional options that lawmakers have, if a conference committee ― or an informal conference committee ― got bogged down in negotiations, it’s not hard to imagine some Republicans just advocating that the House simply pass the skinny repeal and call it a day, or make only very small adjustments and have the scaled-down measure be the basis of the health care plan.House Republicans have previously voted on repealing the individual and employer mandates, as well as the medical devices tax ― the three main components of a skinny repeal at this point ― and even though House conservatives have staked out an early position against just taking that bill and calling it their Obamacare repeal, that position could change quickly.Senate GOP leaders are selling their small bill as a vehicle to come up with a larger plan, which is still the most likely scenario, but lawmakers are also ignoring obvious policy shortcomings because leadership has told them this won’t be the final bill. Conservatives are holding off on insisting that Medicaid changes be in the skinny repeal because leadership is telling them this measure is just advancing the process, while moderates from expansion states are hard-pressed to vote “no” because they’ve said all along that they just want to make sure Medicaid is preserved for their states. In this narrow bill, the expansion isn’t touched.Asked how Republicans are going to ever deal with those trickier issues on a repeal-and-replacement plan if they can’t deal with them now, Cornyn gave HuffPost one of his famous non-answers. “That’s what talking is for,” he said. “And working together and trying to figure out what’s possible.”But, if more talking isn’t a viable solution, could the skinny repeal be the endgame?Politically, Republicans just passing the scaled-down bill and giving Trump his Rose Garden signing ceremony could be disastrous. The Congressional Budget Office has previously said similar legislation would lead to 15 million fewer people with health insurance and premiums that are 20 percent higher. And that’s just in the first year. Removing the mandates from the current health care law could actually produce something resembling a death spiral ― a result of only the sickest people signing up for health insurance ― which Republicans (wrongly) say Obamacare is in now.After enacting such policy, Republicans would own the most troublesome part of Obamacare ― the insurance market ― while preserving a number of other components in the law that they wanted gone, namely, the Medicaid expansion, Obamacare taxes, and regulations they say are driving up costs.Those items are difficult to find consensus on, however, in part because many lawmakers think they’re working.Senate Republicans are being sold on the idea that they don’t need to evaluate the policy effects of their legislation because it’s only advancing the process. Already, 50 Republicans voted to do that when they agreed to the motion to proceed to debate on this bill.But a fair question to ask when you’re making policy is whether the bill you’re voting on is an improvement on current law. It’s hard to argue that just removing the mandates makes anything better.When HuffPost asked Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) whether the skinny repeal would be an improvement on Obamacare, he was waiting for the Senate subway doors to close. He stared at us, filibustered with a joke that we were holding up the doors, and then said, “It’s not a solution.”So why are Republicans treating the skinny repeal like it is one?Jonathan Cohn contributed to this report."

The 20-year-old American swimmer made history on Tuesday, snagging her 12th gold medal at the swimming world championships, the most achieved by any woman ever.Ledecky clinched the gold after annihilating the competition in the 1,500-meter freestyle ― an event she already holds the world record in ― at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. She bested runner-up, Spain’s Mireia Belmonte, by a staggering 19 seconds. Ledecky’s time, 15:31.82, was the fourth fastest in the event’s history. Ledecky’s win also made her the first three-peat winner in the event, reported CNN.Silver medalist Belmonte said she had gone into the race assuming she would not win it. “Katie Ledecky is on another planet so the goal of the race was to win the silver medal. For me, it is gold,” Belmonte told AFP.Images from the 1,500-meter race showed Ledecky far ahead of her rivals. When she won, the other competitors were so far behind, most weren’t even pictured on the screen.The gold medal was Ledecky’s third at this year’s world championships. She also came in first in the 400-meter free and the 4x100-meter free relay. Her time in the 400-meter free was a championship record.Ledecky’s medal tally is likely to grow before the conclusion of the championships. On Wednesday, she clinched the top semifinal time in the 200-meter freestyle. She is also slated to compete in the 800-meter free and the 800-meter free relay. Winning six golds at the championships would be a record-tying achievement for Ledecky, a record currently held by fellow Team USA swimmer Missy Franklin, AP reported. Prior to Tuesday, Franklin also held the record for most gold medals won at the world championships. Recovery from shoulder surgery kept Franklin from competing at the world championships this year.

38,POLITICS,The NAACP Has A Plan To Overhaul The Nation's Charter Schools,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/naacp-charter-schools_us_59777905e4b0c95f375f14e3,"After traveling the country, these are the group's recommendations.",2017-07-26,Former president and CEO of the NAACP Cornell Brooks listening to testimony during the second day of confirmation hearings on Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination to be U.S. attorney general.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5977b78c1500007d208b38ce.jpeg?cache=YaDa0n6wBW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A NAACP task force that spent several months traveling the country learning about charter schools released a report Wednesday with the group’s conclusions. The report comes less than a year after the civil rights organization controversially passed a resolution calling for a moratorium on the growth of charter schools last October. The report does not explicitly address how task force members feel about the October resolution, but instead provides ideas for how both charter schools and traditional schools should improve. The report calls on the NAACP to create a plan of action and a new coalition of groups to push back on charter schools’ perceived lack of accountability and transparency.The report notes that while charter schools were created to act as labs of innovation and share their best ideas with public schools, “this aspect of the promise never materialized.” Over 3 million children in the U.S., about a third of whom are black, currently attend charter schools. In its previous call for a moratorium on expansion of these schools, the NAACP expressed concerns that charters perpetuate segregation, subject students to overly harsh discipline practices, divert funding away from traditional public schools and face weak oversight. The new report does not back down from these assertions. At the same time, the report also levels judgment on the traditional public school system for its shortcomings. “We know more than ever that our resolution was in the right direction,” Alice Huffman, chair of the NAACP’s Task Force on Quality Education, told HuffPost in June. “I do think we need to talk about poor-performing public schools ― we came across a lot of that as well.” Indeed, some education leaders have said the NAACP should focus on fixing all failing schools, regardless of type. Education leaders of color have also taken pains to push back on the NAACP’s criticisms of charter schools. “Not only is the resolution’s mischaracterization of charter schools misinformed, but the proposed nationwide moratorium on new charter schools would ultimately reduce opportunities for Black students, many of whom come from low-income and working-class families,” said a September 2016 letter to the NAACP from black education leaders. During a time when the Trump administration is working to expand the number of charter schools in the name of civil rights, the symbolic importance of pushback from the nation’s oldest civil rights organization looms large. The report recommends the full elimination of for-profit charter schools. For-profit schools aren’t allowed in a number of states, but are prevalent in Michigan, the home state of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “The widespread findings of misconduct and poor student performance in for-profit charter schools, demands the elimination of these schools,” says the report.The report maintains that some charter schools serve students well, although quality is highly uneven based on location. At the same time, it says, “even the best charters are not a substitute for more stable, adequate and equitable investments in public education in communities that serve all children.” To rectify some of these issues, the report recommends states create tougher standards for authorizing and renewing charter schools, while monitoring whether such schools are taking pains to serve all students and not just pushing out the vulnerable ones. It also recommends states hold charter schools to the same level of fiscal transparency as they hold traditional public schools, and adopt a fairer way of funding the latter. That way, poor students of color will not constantly get the short end of the stick ― a common phenomenon around the country. “Charters won’t fix what’s wrong with public education,” task force member Gloria Sweet-Love previously told HuffPost.

Now, in its largest programming rollout since 2011, the organization is furthering its commitment to encouraging girls’ interest in science, technology, engineering and math by introducing even more badges that emphasize the fields.GSUSA released 23 new badges Tuesday in STEM and the outdoors, areas “girls are not typically encouraged to explore outside of Girl Scouting” according to a press release.“These areas have become more important than ever for girls to experience, so that they’re prepared to be engaged and successful in today’s workforce – especially since women continue to be unrepresented in these fields,“Andrea Bastiani Archibald, Chief Girl and Parent Expert for Girl Scouts of the USA, told HuffPost. The new offerings include badges in the fields of engineering, computer science, robotics and outdoor STEM, such as the Race Car Design Challenge badge, the the Programming Robots badge and the Eco Camper badge. The programming was created in collaboration with organizations like GoldieBlox, Code.org and Society of Women Engineers. Bastiani Archibald says many of the badges combine STEM and outdoor topics, such as the Troop Camping badge, which teaches both scientific concepts like meteorology and the leadership and teamwork skills required to navigate the wilderness. Girl Scouts decided to invest in these areas partly in response to the girls themselves. According to Bastiani Archibald, feedback from the scouts reflected a desire for more STEM and outdoors badges. With the new programs, GSUSA hopes to encourage that interest and help build confidence in these areas. “Girl Scouts knows the value of offering girls these kinds of opportunities in the all-girl space, especially at the youngest of ages. When girls are young, they are developing not only their interests, but their confidence and competence in areas where they may not have role models, and at the same time they’re confronting a culture sending them conflicting messages about what girls can do,” she said. According to data from the Girl Scout Research Institute, Girl Scouts are almost twice as likely as non–Girl Scouts to participate in STEM (60 percent versus 35 percent) and outdoor activities (76 percent versus 43 percent).

Though President Donald Trump cited “tremendous medical costs and disruption” for announcing the ban, the administration has yet to reveal who exactly the ban extends to or how a ban would affect those serving right now.What is clear is that all the transgender active duty and former military personnel HuffPost spoke to on Wednesday are heartbroken, empowered, confused and, as Celeste put it, “pissed off.”“It’s just a shot in the face,” she said. “A lot of us are scared and angry because we all signed up to do the same job. Who has the right to say you can’t fight for your country?”Whatever form an actual transgender ban may take, it’ll put heroes and patriots on the rocks. One of those heroes is Kristin Beck, a retired Navy SEAL whose 20 years of service included more than a dozen deployments, a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star, and time on the esteemed SEAL Team 6.She’s also openly trans, and proud of it. Beck told HuffPost that she wants to meet Trump face to face, because his idea of her community is warped.“If he’s basing all of his perception of transgender people on Caitlyn Jenner ― who is a millionaire and a TV star ― he’s not getting the right picture,” Beck said. “I work on a farm with chickens and horses. I grew up poor, on government cheese and powdered milk. I’m not pretty, I’m not a movie star, I’m a retired Navy SEAL. ... I fought for America. As a president, he should be fighting for and defending every American. I’m an American. Why not fight for me?”Last year, the Pentagon lifted its ban against transgender people serving in the U.S. armed forces. Beck said if Trump really believes that supporting the trans community is costly and disruptive, he’s in for a surprise when he tries to discharge thousands of military personnel.“Even if you’re talking expenses alone, this is an irresponsible move,” she said. “You just got rid of so many contracts with people who are serving honorably. Now think of the money spent with legal suits, paperwork, bureaucracy and time. You’re going to spend [millions of dollars] per person.”Several service members appeared to find hope in the fact that Trump has historically been unable to make good on many of his policies or promises.“They’re three tweets by the current president ― that’s all they are,” said 2nd Lt. Gabriella Madsen, an openly trans woman who has served 11 years in the Army. “Three tweets are not accompanied by policy. He does that kind of thing all the time. ... In the community, many of those on the still-active-duty side are telling people to calm down. It was only three tweets.”That sentiment was echoed by retired Air Force fighter pilot Shari Zabel, who said she was baffled by Trump’s readiness to backpedal on progress.“The leader of the free world is spouting the same words that were used for racism and slavery. ... It’s basically bald-faced discrimination,” she said. “This would be the first time that I can recall in our history that a reversal of a nondiscrimination policy has occurred in the military.”Many of those HuffPost spoke to said they were once not allowed to be open about their true selves in the military. After the military opened itself up to trans service members last year, everything changed. For people like Patricia King, who’s openly trans and serving as Army infantry, it’s unclear whether the trans community will have to go back to darker days.“We’re still trying to figure it out, there was a lot of ambiguity,” she said. “I will continue to show up to work and serve my country until I’m told that I can’t anymore. ...

That’s how much time passed after a Somali-American cop in Minneapolis fatally shot a white Australian woman named Justine Damond until Police Chief Janee Harteau resigned Friday. That’s a strikingly fast change in leadership compared with high-profile officer-involved deaths of black Americans.In Chicago, the mayor fired the police superintendent more than a year after Laquan McDonald was shot and killed by a police officer. In Ferguson, Missouri, the police chief resigned about seven months after Michael Brown was killed. And in Baltimore, it took almost three months after the death of Freddie Gray for the police commissioner to lose his job. For police chiefs — who are usually appointed, though some places elect them — staying on top is a constant political struggle. Top cops need support from three constituencies with different, and often competing, interests: the community, the police union and the mayor or city manager, said Phillip Atiba Goff, president of the Center for Policing Equity, a nonprofit that focuses on social justice and law enforcement. “You’ve got to have two of the three legs of the stool, and the rest is a balancing act,” Goff said. “So if you’ve got the union, you’ve got the mayor, you’re good. If you’ve got the mayor, you’ve got the people, you’re good. You’ve got the union and the people, you’re good. You almost never have all three on your side at the same time.”Police violence can undermine all three legs of a police chief’s support. It can enrage the community, make the mayor politically vulnerable and ― if the police chief doesn’t stand behind the cop ― infuriate the union, too.Harteau, the former Minneapolis police chief, didn’t have the support of the city’s police union, which celebrated her exit last week. The July 15 shooting put the other two legs of the stool at risk, too: It further strained public confidence in Harteau’s leadership and jeopardized her standing with Betsy Hodges, the mayor. Hodges “learned lessons” after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man who was fatally shot by Minneapolis police in 2015, and the protests over his death, she told activist Deray McKesson on his podcast “Pod Save the People” released Tuesday. “It’s not based on one incident; it’s based on the sum total of a whole bunch of things over time,” Hodges said of Harteau’s resignation. “Folks in the community were having questions about her leadership that had been percolating and growing over time.”Activists doubt that the death of yet another black person would have had the same swift result as the death of a white woman.In Minneapolis, “the system is moving very quickly to protect those it was created to serve,” because “not just black people are dying,” argued Kwame Rose, an activist who took part in the Baltimore Uprising, the 2015 protests following the death of Freddie Gray after a police van ride. The Damond shooting “reinforces why we have to say ‘Black lives matter’ in the first place,” said Mike Lowe, an activist in San Antonio. “The swiftness [of Harteau’s resignation] exposes that ‘All lives matter’ really, in fact, means ‘white lives.’ The chief stepping down simultaneously debunks the ‘Blue lives matter’ narrative, as support for a black cop is almost little to none.“When was the last time we saw a mayor request a chief of police to step down because of an officer-involved shooting?” Lowe said. “Anytime I say ‘Black lives matter,’ it’s an indictment to city leaders, judicial systems and media who blatantly fail to humanize our lives when we are killed at the hands of police, like Justine.”Goff knows how it looks. “The first time time we’ve got a high-profile white woman who is shot and killed, the chief is gone moments later.” But the situation in Minneapolis is “more complicated than that,” Goff argued. Vanita Gupta, the former chief of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama, agrees. Damond’s shooting “didn’t happen in a vacuum,” Gupta, who now heads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, an umbrella group of civil rights organizations, told HuffPost. “There are some folks who believe that because of the race of the victim that there might have been a swifter response. I just think it’s hard to disentangle” from other controversies facing the Minneapolis police, she said. These days, “public expectations are significantly higher,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. Wexler knows Harteau and the Minneapolis Police Department well, having worked on several reform-related projects in the region. “You can’t fire a police department. What you can do, and what mayors have wound up doing, is what is politically expedient, and that is getting rid of your chief.”Right now, the tenure of a police chief often lasts only a few years, but it can be hard to do substantial reforms over a short period of time, police experts say.  “Mayors can feel a lot of pressure to be seen as taking action in response to particular critical incidents,” Gupta said. Speaking generally, she added, “it’s a faster move to fire a chief than it is to get deeply engaged in systemic reform.”In other cities, there have been a number of problems prior to a resignation, but there appears to be a clear tie between resignations and a city facing national backlash. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the dismissal of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy in December 2015, about a week after video footage of an October 2014 shooting was publicized, and the officer was charged with murder. Emanuel said that McCarthy had become “a distraction,” an oft-cited reason for bringing on new leadership.In Ferguson, Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned in March 2015 only after a blistering Justice Department investigation into emails that revealed Jackson bragging about the amount of money he was able to raise for the city through tickets and the city’s municipal court, a common practice in St. Louis County municipalities that fueled much of the anger after Michael Brown’s death in August 2014.Whether a chief keeps his or her job after a high-profile police incident often depends on “what the chief’s relationship with the community is,” said Jonathan Smith, a former Justice Department Civil Rights Division official. “When the chief stands in front of the community and says, ‘We’re looking into this and this shouldn’t have happened,’ does the community trust them?” Harteau, who had served for five years, wasn’t seen as an old-school cop set in her ways but as a law enforcement leader with a serious interest in reforms including implicit bias and use-of-force training. She was the first female chief in Minneapolis, the first Native American police chief in the city and one of few openly gay police chiefs in the country. “I would put her in the category of a police chief who was embracing change, making change,” says Wexler.“Do I think that Minneapolis could’ve been doing more faster? I think that about almost every city in the United States,” Goff said. “Was she aligned with folks who were making serious progress and who were willing to take risks to do it? She absolutely was.”But “there’s a way in which police chiefs can become scapegoats for larger systemic problems,” Gupta said. “And the focus on the police chief and whether the police chief stays in the job or not is almost a secondary question to whether there are significant reform efforts underway.” Julia Craven contributed reporting.

Damond’s shooting “didn’t happen in a vacuum,” Gupta, who now heads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, an umbrella group of civil rights organizations, told HuffPost. “There are some folks who believe that because of the race of the victim that there might have been a swifter response. I just think it’s hard to disentangle” from other controversies facing the Minneapolis police, she said. These days, “public expectations are significantly higher,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. Wexler knows Harteau and the Minneapolis Police Department well, having worked on several reform-related projects in the region. “You can’t fire a police department. What you can do, and what mayors have wound up doing, is what is politically expedient, and that is getting rid of your chief.”Right now, the tenure of a police chief often lasts only a few years, but it can be hard to do substantial reforms over a short period of time, police experts say.  “Mayors can feel a lot of pressure to be seen as taking action in response to particular critical incidents,” Gupta said. Speaking generally, she added, “it’s a faster move to fire a chief than it is to get deeply engaged in systemic reform.”In other cities, there have been a number of problems prior to a resignation, but there appears to be a clear tie between resignations and a city facing national backlash. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the dismissal of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy in December 2015, about a week after video footage of an October 2014 shooting was publicized, and the officer was charged with murder. Emanuel said that McCarthy had become “a distraction,” an oft-cited reason for bringing on new leadership.In Ferguson, Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned in March 2015 only after a blistering Justice Department investigation into emails that revealed Jackson bragging about the amount of money he was able to raise for the city through tickets and the city’s municipal court, a common practice in St. Louis County municipalities that fueled much of the anger after Michael Brown’s death in August 2014.Whether a chief keeps his or her job after a high-profile police incident often depends on “what the chief’s relationship with the community is,” said Jonathan Smith, a former Justice Department Civil Rights Division official. “When the chief stands in front of the community and says, ‘We’re looking into this and this shouldn’t have happened,’ does the community trust them?” Harteau, who had served for five years, wasn’t seen as an old-school cop set in her ways but as a law enforcement leader with a serious interest in reforms including implicit bias and use-of-force training. She was the first female chief in Minneapolis, the first Native American police chief in the city and one of few openly gay police chiefs in the country. “I would put her in the category of a police chief who was embracing change, making change,” says Wexler.“Do I think that Minneapolis could’ve been doing more faster? I think that about almost every city in the United States,” Goff said. “Was she aligned with folks who were making serious progress and who were willing to take risks to do it? She absolutely was.”But “there’s a way in which police chiefs can become scapegoats for larger systemic problems,” Gupta said. “And the focus on the police chief and whether the police chief stays in the job or not is almost a secondary question to whether there are significant reform efforts underway.” Julia Craven contributed reporting.

Pell was not required to enter a plea, but his lawyer Robert Richter, QC, indicated to the court his client would plead not guilty to all charges.“For the avoidance of doubt and because of the interest I might indicate that Cardinal Pell will plead not guilty to all charges, and will maintain the presumed innocence that he has,” Richter said.Pell, the Vatican’s finance chief until he stepped away from the role after the charges were announced last month, was surrounded by a protective police escort as he arrived at court shortly before 9am. He was met by a heaving media pack, protesters and supporters.Wearing the black clothes and the collar of a priest, Pell did not answer questions hurled at him from the surrounding crowd as he arrived. Supporters and critics joined with the teeming mass of waiting local and international press to line up outside the court to gain access to the less-than 10 minute hearing.The former archbishop of Sydney and Melbourne was screened by security as he entered the building, and he was escorted through the courthouse foyer.A short time later the Cardinal entered Courtroom 2, a small court filled to standing-room-only with press and onlookers.Sitting behind his legal team, Pell remained silent through the short proceedings. He was clapped by supporters when he later left the courtroom, with some saying “bless you”.Because of the number of people taking an interest in the proceedings, the ordinarily perfunctory filing hearing was teleconferenced into a second courtroom.The details of the charges have not yet been made public. Pell, who returned to Australia from Rome earlier this month, strenuously maintains his innocence.Just ahead of Wednesday’s brief hearing, Ballarat sex abuse survivor Phil Nagle lined up outside the court.Nagle said he has no links to the Pell complainants, but wanted to show his support for them.“Very symbolic day today,” he told the HuffPost Australia.“Obviously the Cardinal is here just as another man before the court and not here as the third most powerful Catholic in the world.”One woman carried with her a picture of Mary and Baby Jesus she said was meant to symbolise her support for families who had been through abuse.Others brandished signs in support of the Cardinal, with one woman holding a sign saying “thank you for helping my family”.Magistrate Duncan Reynolds presided over the administrative hearing. It will return to court for mention on October 6."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597870ba1a00003300dc0979.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Following its neighbors across the English Channel, the United Kingdom has announced plans to ban the sale of new gas and diesel-powered cars in the nation from 2040.French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a similar plan earlier this month, as part of the country’s efforts to meet its targets under the Paris climate agreement. Now, U.K. Environment Minister Michael Gove has said that the government aims to have only zero-emission cars and vans on the road by 2050.Gove told BBC Radio Wednesday to achieve that, there should be “no new diesel or petrol vehicles,” starting in 2040. As the Guardian notes, the announcement is part of the British government’s new clean air plan ― a strategy aimed at reducing air pollution, specifically the pollutant nitrogen dioxide, which is also considered an indirect greenhouse gas.The ruling Conservative Party has been under pressure for months to produce a robust plan to tackle the mounting air pollution crisis in the U.K., which a government spokesman called this week the “biggest environmental risk to public health in the U.K.” The British High Court ruled in November that the government’s existing plan to tackle the pollution crisis was “illegally poor,” following a lawsuit by the nonprofit ClientEarth. The court said in April that government ministers had until the end of July to release their final policy on the issue. The final plan is expected to be unveiled on Wednesday, the Guardian reported. A spokesman told the paper that about $3.9 billion had been earmarked in the plan for spending on air quality improvements.Environmental campaigners in the U.K. told the BBC this week that the measures in the new plan that they’d seen so far were “promising,” but stressed they’d have to see the full strategy before they could pass judgment.CLARIFICATION: This article previously stated that nitrogen dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It is not, but it is considered an indirect one because it contributes to the production of tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas."

I’ll really have those [schools] bombed … because you are operating illegally and you are teaching the children to rebel against government,” Duterte said in a press conference after his second State of the Nation address on Monday. The Philippines has been fighting a Communist rebellion in the country’s south for nearly 50 years. Duterte amped up the rhetoric surrounding the conflict this week with his accusation that indigenous-run schools in the region are supporting rebel groups and “teaching subversion.” Meanwhile, the Philippines military is attempting to quell an Islamist insurgency on the southern island of Mindanao, where Duterte declared martial law in May.Rights groups say they are concerned that Duterte’s rhetoric may give tacit approval to the military to abuse civilians. “By calling for an attack on schools, Duterte is directing the military to commit war crimes,” Human Rights Watch researcher Carlos H. Conde wrote on Tuesday. “Duterte should publicly retract his threat of violence against tribal schools before the military acts on them.” Members of the indigenous Lumad community have claimed that military and paramilitary groups have targeted their schools in Mindanao since martial law was declared, threatening harm to staff members and forcing at least two dozen to close. Duterte is notorious for inflammatory statements and threats. Many are written off as bluster, but some have become policy. A campaign promise to carry out a violent campaign against drug dealers and users, for instance, has come to fruition ― resulting in at least 7,000 people killed in a brutal “drug war” since Duterte took office.Rights groups have repeatedly taken issue with Duterte’s statements threatening abuses or condoning atrocities. In May, Duterte joked that soldiers fighting the Islamist insurgency in Mindanao could commit rape with impunity. He has publicly made rape jokes in the past, and has encouraged extrajudicial killings. This week, he reaffirmed his commitment to the “drug war.”“The fight will be unremitting as it will be unrelenting despite international and local pressure,” Duterte said in his Monday address."

Finbar Anderson, who previously worked on the case, explains evidence that local authorities’ offers to take in more children were suppressed.The 6-year-old boy arrived in London alone and scared. He hadn’t eaten for two days. Like all of the children who had made the journey with him, he was a refugee. Offers of shelter for them had come from around the United Kingdom, and the British home secretary said that they would “without hesitation” provide the children with visas.Speaking to Parliament, the home secretary reflected what a “terrible dilemma” it was for parents to choose between “sending their children to a foreign country… and continuing to live in the terrible conditions to which they are now reduced.”The year was 1939; the boy’s name was Alfred Dubs. He had fled Czechoslovakia on the Kindertransport, a rescue effort masterminded by British stockbroker Nicholas Winton that helped 10,000 predominantly Jewish children escape persecution from the Nazis.In March 2016, Lord Dubs tabled an amendment to the Immigration bill obliging the U.K. to take in 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children from around Europe. The bill was eventually passed after the wording of the amendment was changed from 3,000 refugees to a “specified number.”Last October, the U.K.-based charity Help Refugees commenced legal action against the government over its implementation of the Dubs amendment. At the time, not one child had been relocated under the Dubs scheme.This February, the government announced that it would be closing the scheme. It had determined that a maximum of 350 children could come to the U.K. under the Dubs scheme after a consultation with local councils around the country, asking each their capacity to take unaccompanied refugee minors.The decision was met with dismay from parliamentarians, civil society and members of the public. Many were unconvinced by how the government conducted their consultation with local councils and its conclusion that only 350 places were available.For example, there appeared to be not one offer from the entire region of southwest England. The Home Office then admitted that, through an administrative error, it had missed offers of 130 places from various local authorities in the southwest, and in April the limit was increased to 480.Yet these 130 places are far from the only oversight, according to evidence gathered by Help Refugees for their case calling for a judicial review of the government’s consultation process. The case was heard by the U.K.’s High Court last month, and a verdict is expected in September.Based on documents disclosed in the course of the litigation and comments by local councilors, the charity argues that the government’s consultation was so seriously flawed as to be unlawful.For example, while the government began a consultation in Northern Ireland, it was subsequently abandoned, with no clear reason given. The children’s commissioner for Northern Ireland was nonplussed, noting that, “Nothing… indicated that there was a lack of any capacity or willingness” to accept unaccompanied child refugees there.In Scotland, councils were advised that they should not respond to the government’s initial letter regarding the consultation, as a Scotland-specific letter would soon follow. It never did, and 91 percent of places offered by Scottish authorities were not counted as a result.In Wales, 86 percent of places offered were not counted toward the final tally as they arrived after the cutoff period, according to evidence collected by Help Refugees. The Welsh cabinet secretary complained of the “lack of adequate and timely consultations from the U.K. government around the various children’s schemes.”The Home Office reportedly attempted to suppress public dissent from local councils. A council leader for Hammersmith and Fulham in west London told the Observer newspaper that if the Home Office got wind of any criticism from councils on the issue of the Dubs Scheme there would be “payback … The Home Office have gone out of their way to thwart every single attempt to act not just on the spirit of the Dubs amendment but on its specific terms.”Nevertheless, senior councilors have spoken out about flaws in the consultation process. The Leader of London Borough of Lambeth Council stated that if it had been more thorough, a more accurate and potentially higher number of places could have been indicated and subsequently been made available.” The leader of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham “cast some doubt on how thorough” the consultation had been in evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee.The Home Office says it is “committed to supporting vulnerable children who are caught up in conflict and danger.” A spokesperson told The Guardian: “It’s vital that we get the balance right between enabling eligible children to come to the U.K. as quickly as possible and ensuring local authorities have capacity to host them and provide them with the support they will need.”Only around 200 children have come to the U.K. so far under the Dubs scheme, all from the northern French port of Calais. I went to the now-demolished “Jungle” camp in Calais in 2015 as a volunteer, handing out clothes to hundreds of migrants and refugees sheltering in the makeshift settlement.Unlike the Kindertransport refugees, who came directly to the U.K. from their home countries, the children in Calais had come through Africa, the Middle East or Central Asia, crossed the Mediterranean, and then Europe. The vast majority were teenagers.The Jungle was dismantled last October, but many of those children are still scattered around northern France in reception centers or living underground in Calais, as authorities try to prevent the formation of another informal camp. Thousands more are waiting to be relocated from camps in Italy and Greece.Lord Dubs says the mood in the U.K. is very different to the one into which he was welcomed in the 1930s. Asked shortly after he proposed his amendment whether the government would have supported a similar project to the Kindertransport, he said: “This lot would’ve probably said no.”This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

Imam Nazar, disputed the death toll and said reinforcements had arrived to beat back the insurgents.The attack came after days of fierce fighting across Afghanistan and underlined the steadily deteriorating security in much of the country, which has also seen a string of high profile attacks in cities including the capital Kabul.While the fighting has intensified, the United States, which is expected to send around another 4,000 troops to Afghanistan to bolster its existing training mission, is still to announce its new strategy for the region.The Taliban, fighting to restore Islamic rule to Afghanistan 16 years after being driven from power by a U.S.-led campaign, controls or contests at least 40 percent of the country, inflicting what U.S. advisers say are unsustainable casualties on Afghan security forces.In the first 10 months of last year alone, some 6,785 soldiers and police were killed.On Wednesday, the Taliban’s main spokesman said the insurgents were close to taking Waygal district in the eastern province of Nuristan, a day after they took Jani Kheil district in Paktika province, further to the south.Over the past week, the insurgents have also taken districts in Ghor province in the west and Faryab in the north, although the defense ministry said government forces had retaken Kohistan district in Faryab.Kunduz, the northern city which the Taliban captured briefly in 2015 and managed to enter in 2016, has also been under heavy pressure.U.S. advisers say that Afghan security forces, fighting largely alone since a NATO-led coalition ended its main combat mission in 2014, have made progress but still rely too much on vulnerable checkpoints exposed to Taliban attack."

Not only is Mr. Trump setting his vainglorious sights on Attorney General Jeff Sessions in an ill-conceived effort to roust the AG from the Justice Department (and, thereby, cracking open a door to get rid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller), he has targeted transgender citizens for removal from—or refused entry into—any form of service in the U.S. Armed Forces. Wednesday morning’s presidential anti-transgender tweet follows on the heels of Mr. Trump’s Queeg-like search for “leakers” in the White House and throughout the Executive Branch. Talk about a witch hunt.The continuation of this unbalanced man’s early morning searches for strawberries of villainy and treachery on Capitol Hill, behind the doors of the Justice Department, and in the White House itself would not be complete without entangling others in his unhinged rambles and rants. It is not satisfying enough, apparently, for Mr. Trump to watch adults like Jeff Sessions twist on the gallows of his contempt. It is also not enough, apparently, for Mr. Trump to play the Wizard of Oz to his political base and encourage his sham-entrapped entourage of electoral suckers to trumpet his praises despite his deceptions.No. Mr. Trump is finding out that playing games with the grownups in Washington is not exciting enough (and may be a wee bit dangerous), so he turns to the kids in the country, specifically to the Boy Scouts of America (one of which he never was—probably due to that bone-spur that also kept him out of Vietnam, where John McCain was wasting America’s time by not being a hero).Mr. Trump’s bizarre speech (full transcript here) on Monday to the Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia, illustrates the murky depths of deception down to which this president will attempt to drag impressionable young Americans, involuntarily bound to the coils of his bombastic and simplistic rhetoric.Had he simply followed the time-honored script of support and encouragement, Mr. Trump might have garnered more than a few lines of good press. He started out well enough:“When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you are not only shaping young lives, you are shaping the future of America.”But then came the first clank of the Trumpian chains being fastened to the impressionable minds of the attending crowd:“You know, I go to Washington and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. In fact, today, I said we ought to change it from the word “swamp” to the word “cesspool” or perhaps to the word “sewer.”Clink. One more link added to the chain.And then, for some unfathomable reason, Mr. Trump went off on a ten-minute memory lane trip to the history of William Levitt of Levittown fame, talking about Levitt’s rise to success, and then his downfall—sprinkled with references to yachts and New York parties. Relevant to the Boy Scouts how?But lest you think Mr. Trump might have returned to the Boy Scout path, he stayed true to form and basked in the glory of his election, and how he duped the Trump deniers:“Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, these dishonest people, where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump?” “But you remember that incredible night with the maps, and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red it was unbelievable. And they didn’t know what to say.”What’s going on is more than incredible. What is going on is shameful, deceptive, duplicitous, unpatriotic, and, perhaps, in the end, un-Constitutional. Trump’s hunt for witches, is not the ethical or moral model for America’s young men and women involved in Scouting to follow.Here is my simple message to the Scouts who listened to Trump on Monday and heard about Trump’s anti-transgender military service tweet on Wednesday: No matter what clothes they choose to wear, no matter what war they fight in, no matter the battles they have to face at home or in a foreign land, transgender Americans in uniform—soldiers, Navy and Coast Guard sailors, Marines, and airmen—have more patriotism in their little fingers than Donald Trump has in all his wildest dreams."

But there are several possibilities, all subsidized by the government. Most members of Congress get their insurance on the DC health exchange, which offers high quality plans, and for which the Federal government subsidizes 72%-75% of the premiums. Alternatively, McCain may also quality for VA benefits or Medicare. In all cases, his health care his heavily subsidized by the Federal government.Now McCain is enabling McConnell to take health insurance away from over 20 million Americans.If the Republican Congress is going to take away government-subsidized health care from millions of Americans, then it should take it away from itself.Let John McCain and other Senators and representatives seek private insurance with no guaranties they won’t be denied for pre-existing conditions, or face astronomical premiums and high deductibles.Is this what McCain wants on his tombstone? “R.I.P. I took healthcare away from 20 million Americans.”McCain still has a chance to redeem his legacy by voting against all of the A.C.A. repeal bills that McConnell may try to put forward.Will his legacy be depriving millions of Americans of health care that McCain himself is entitled to? Or will he rehabilitate his image as a maverick by standing up to McConnell?"

These discussions are always plastered all over the news, covering headlines and filling up the push notifications on my phone. No matter where I go or what I do, even when I’m trying to avoid the topic, there seems to be no escape from the looming headlines.As a young woman with a chronic illness, my relationship with the health care debate is a little bit different than your average 20-something. Disability and health care are an important part of my life and have been since my health began deteriorating when I turned 15. Since then, I’ve dedicated the majority of my time to the disability community— from volunteering in hospitals to establishing organizations with my peers. Over the last year, I’ve built relationships with people all across the disability spectrum, most of whom I consider close friends. Most of the people being arrested on TV for these causes are people who I know.While my journey into the world of disability and healthcare began as an attempt to understand my own experiences, this is no longer about me. Everyone who I’ve met on this journey has incredibly valuable experiences ― rich lives of their own. The more that I learn about the different ways in which people experience disability, the more urgent this fight becomes. These people are your friends, too— maybe more than that. They’re our mothers, sisters, brothers, fathers, and best friends from high school. They’re our teachers and lawyers and doctors. No matter how severe their preexisting condition or situation in life, they deserve to be given the opportunity to live. But if the Republicans succeed on their quest to repeal the ACA, we will all be living in a world where all our friends are dead.I do not want to live in a world where all my friends are dead."

He backed off those comments Tuesday, saying he had no plans to fire people, “at least for now.”"

Yes, you read that correctly. In 2005, Trump created a sketch of the New York City skyline for a charity auction benefiting global literacy. The style is, well, understated, featuring boxy buildings with triangle roofs arranged in a row atop an enigmatic double swoosh. The medium is some kind of Sharpie-esque marker and the signature, of course, is scrawled in gold. Yet, the amateur artist did take one creative risk in his rendering, altering the Manhattan landscape so that Trump Tower dominates the view. In the real world, Trump’s skyscraper is the 64th-tallest skyscraper, but thanks to the power of art the building is front and center. Trump has a contentious relationship with the art world, to say the least. Since the president’s inauguration, many have used creative means to call out Trump’s potentially troublesome business ties with foreign governments, his “abusive” health care plan, his disgusting comments toward women and his relentless tweeting. We doubt this sketch will do much for his paltry reputation in the art world, but, in all fairness, the frame is nice. While six months in, Trump has the lowest job-approval rating of any modern president at this point, we sure hope he doesn’t pivot to art anytime soon. The framed sketch is currently up for auction online at Nate and Sanders. The bidding ends July 27 at 5 p.m. PST. The starting price is $9,000."

She was the last whale to be born since SeaWorld discontinued its breeding program.Kyara, who was born in April, died at San Antonio’s SeaWorld park on Monday after showing signs of pneumonia, SeaWorld said in a statement.“Despite (the staff’s) best efforts, her health continued to decline and she passed away earlier today,”the statement read. “The veterinary team will conduct a full post mortem examination to determine the cause of death. It may take several weeks before results are finalized.”The park said that pneumonia is one of the most common causes of morbidity or illness in whales and dolphins, “both in the wild and in aquariums.”Over the last 30 years, nearly 150 sea lions, beluga whales, orcas and other dolphins have died from infections at SeaWorld’s three parks in Orlando, San Antonio and San Diego, San Antonio’s Express-News reported.Back in 2015, three killer whales died from infections at the San Antonio park. Earlier this year, the orca named Tilikum, whose involvement in a trainer’s death inspired the anti-SeaWorld documentary “Blackfish,” died after suffering from an infection at SeaWorld Orlando.Kyara’s death is particularly significant, since the park announced in March 2016 that it would be ending its breeding program. The decision followed public backlash after the 2013 release of “Blackfish.”SeaWorld CEO Joel Manby, in announcing the program’s end, said the park wanted to appease those who are more “conservation-minded.” Kyara’s mother, a 25-year-old orca named Takara, was already pregnant at the time of that announcement. The last time SeaWorld collected an orca from the wild was 35 years ago, according to the park. After that, its whales were either purchased from other parks or were bred through artificial insemination.Public response to news of Kyara’s death this week appeared mixed, with comments on SeaWorld’s Facebook announcement appearing mostly sympathetic. Reactions on Twitter, in contrast, included criticism and anger against the park, as well as talk of boycotts and protests.On Monday, animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals held a protest outside of SeaWorld San Diego’s orca show. During that event, Oscar-nominated actor James Cromwell was arrested for helping to interrupt an orca show with a megaphone.“Orcas deserve a full life in the ocean, not a life sentence of swimming endless circles until they drop dead from disease,” the 77-year-old actor, who starred in “Babe” and the FX TV series “American Horror Story,” said in a statement. “My friends at PETA and I want SeaWorld to move these intelligent animals to seaside sanctuaries without delay.”His arrest came just a week after he served several days in jail for a 2015 sit-in against a New York power plant.Another protest is being planned for Tuesday at SeaWorld San Antonio, according to online activists.

He said many of them faced “a feverish search for legal assistance” after their deportation orders were unexpectedly resurrected by the U.S. government after several years.Goldsmith wrote, in his 34-page opinion and order, the extra time assures “that those who might be subjected to grave harm and possible death are not cast out of this country before having their day in court.”The decision effectively means no Iraqi nationals can be deported from the United States for several months.It was not immediately known whether the U.S. government would appeal. A representative for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit was not immediately available for comment.There are 1,444 Iraqi nationals who have final deportation orders against them in the U.S., although only about 199 of them were detained in June as part of a nationwide sweep by immigration authorities.The ACLU sued on June 15 to halt the deportations, arguing the Iraqis could face persecution, torture, or death because many were Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims, or Iraqi Kurds and that the groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq.Those arrested by immigration authorities had outstanding deportation orders and many had been convicted of serious crimes, ranging from homicide to weapons and drug charges, the U.S. government said.Goldsmith sided with the ACLU, expanding on June 26 an earlier stay which only protected 114 detainees from the Detroit area to the broader class of more than 1,400 Iraqi nationals nationwide. Goldsmith’s Monday decision came hours before that injunction was set to expire.The ACLU argued many Iraqi detainees have had difficulty obtaining critical government documents needed to file deportation order appeals, and also that the government has transferred many detainees to facilities in different parts of the country, separating them from their lawyers and families.Under Goldsmith’s ruling, immigration authorities must provide the ACLU with bi-weekly reports about each Iraqi that include where they are detained.On Friday, a federal prosecutor told Goldsmith his injunction was not necessary because many of the detainees were appealing final deportation orders through immigration court.The roundup of Iraqis in the Detroit area followed Iraq’s agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from Trump’s revised temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries.Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago but were allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them.That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March."
58,MEDIA,Trump’s Attacks On Jeff Sessions Test Breitbart’s Support For The President,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breitbart-sessions-trump_us_59779572e4b0c95f375f4948,The pro-Trump site has long been closely aligned with the ‘beleaguered’ attorney general.,2017-07-25,"Breitbart described Jeff Sessions' endorsement of Trump in early 2016 as uniting the ""populist, nationalist movement.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597797081a00008381dc07d5.jpeg?cache=OWsnpC2Gdx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Feb. 28, 2016, Jeff Sessions put on a red “Make America Great Hat” and, appearing at a rally in his home state of Alabama with Donald Trump, became the first U.S. senator to endorse him in the Republican presidential primary. Sessions then called Steve Bannon.“At some point in history, the people need to have their voice heard,” he said on the Sirius radio show for Breitbart News, the “populist, nationalist site” Bannon was running at the time. “And it just might be heard this year.”Bannon thanked Sessions, calling him the “leader of this populist revolt against the political elite.” That same day, Breitbart Washington editor Matthew Boyle described Sessions in his dispatch from the Trump rally as “the intellectual leader of the future of the conservative movement.” And a Breitbart headline framed the “stunning” Trump-Sessions event as uniting the “populist, nationalist movement.”For several years, Sessions and Breitbart have been ideologically in sync, each taking similarly hardline stances on issues like immigration and advancing a worldview that would later be championed by Trump.“Sessions kind of represents the heart and soul of the Breitbart ethos,” Joshua Green, author of Devil’s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency, told HuffPost.So Breitbart, usually quick to amplify Trump’s views and battle his enemies, has been thrust into a difficult position as the president continues to turn his fire on an ideologically aligned politician the site has long supported and vigorously defended ― as well as the man Trump himself picked to be the nation’s chief law enforcement official. Trump told the New York Times last week he wouldn’t have selected Sessions for attorney general if he knew he’d recuse himself from overseeing the Justice Department’s investigation into possible collusion between the president’s campaign and Russian officials. He dismissed Sessions’ early presidential endorsement Tuesday in comments to the Wall Street Journal as “not like a great loyal thing.” Trump later reiterated his disappointment with Sessions during a Rose Garden news conference. And after tweeting Monday about his “beleaguered” attorney general, Trump followed up Tuesday by tweeting that Sessions was taking a “VERY weak position” by not seeking to prosecute Hillary Clinton, the president’s 2016 Democratic rival, over her use of a private email server when she served as secretary of state.That most recent Twitter tirade prompted a critical response on Breitbart. Reporter Adam Shaw wrote Tuesday that Trump’s swipe highlighted the president’s “own hypocrisy.” Although Trump reveled in “Lock Her Up!” chants on the campaign trail last year, he indicated after the election that he no longer wanted to target Clinton. And so Trump’s criticism of Sessions’ decision, which appears to echo his own, seems odd. Despite the public swipes, Trump is apparently concerned that firing Sessions could alienate some of his grassroots support. He has privately asked how such a move “would play in the conservative media,” according to The Washington Post.“I think that for supporters of Trump and Sessions, it puts them in a bit of a tough spot,” Green said. “It’s like seeing your parents fighting.”Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who’s now a political analyst and consultant, told HuffPost that alienating early backers, like Sessions, could hurt Trump’s standing with conservative media. “This is as much of an ally as Trump has ever had,” Bardella said. “The fact he’d be so willing to turn his back on him and publicly embarrass him ― if you’re willing to do that to your friends, where does anyone else stand at the end of the day?”Some signs of fraying have surfaced within conservative media over Trump’s treatment of Sessions, as CNN’s Oliver Darcy wrote Tuesday.“It’s starting to feel like Capt. Queeg,” radio host and Trump-backer Ann Coulter told The Washington Post’s Robert Costa, referring to the paranoid ship commander in “The Caine Mutiny.” “He’s screwing with Sessions? Wow, is that treacherous!”Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow did not respond to a request for comment on the site’s coverage.Despite its critical Tuesday story, Breitbart overall has taken a more restrained approach to Trump’s attacks on Sessions.“In any other scenario, if any other politician wrote and attacked Sessions the way the president has, Breitbart would’ve declared war on them,” Bardella said. “If this was Speaker [Paul] Ryan, Hillary Clinton, [Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz, there’d be 20 stories on the homepage very vocally and visibly defending Jeff Sessions.”Breitbart rallied behind Sessions in response to criticism of him when he was up for Senate confirmation as attorney general.  “The populist senator’s partisan opponents and their allies in corporate media have done everything in their power to smear Sessions’ good name,” Julia Hahn wrote in January. Later that day, Hahn wrote another piece on Cruz’s support for Sessions in response to the “false smears peddled by the populist Alabamians’ partisan opponents.”Hahn has since joined the Trump White House, which features several prominent players hailing from the Sessions-Breitbart orbit. Bannon, who left Breitbart in August to help lead the Trump campaign, now serves as the president’s chief strategist. While still running Breitbart, Bannon helped convince the Trump campaign to hire top Sessions aide Stephen Miller in January 2016, according to Green’s book. Miller is now a senior adviser and Trump speechwriter. A June 2016 Politico profile of Miller ― headlined “The Believer” ― explored how the former Senate aide engaged with Breitbart, a site described in the article as “Sessions country long before it was Trump country.” One former Breitbart reporter, who wasn’t named, told Politico that “anything that Sessions sends out, [the site] writes up immediately.” “They’re all in the same boat together, Sessions, Trump and Breitbart,” the reporter said. “There’s no other politician that Breitbart does that for. They go above and beyond.”Michelle Fields, a former reporter for Breitbart and HuffPost, tweeted Tuesday that the site “will defend almost anything Trump does, except going after Sessions (who has always been close w/ everyone at Breitbart).”Sessions had been praising Breitbart before Trump got in the political arena, telling Green a few years back that the site has “an incredible eye for an important story, particular ones that are important to conservatives and Republicans.”Not only has Sessions received glowing coverage on Breitbart, but Bannon even encouraged the former senator in 2013 to run for the president. He was also instrumental in urging Sessions to back Trump in 2016, according to Green’s book. On the night before Sessions endorsed Trump, he was concerned about being the first senator to take the plunge. Sessions asked Bannon if he believed the New York businessman could win. “One hundred percent,” Bannon said. “It’s do or die,” Bannon added. “This is it. This is the moment.”“Okay, I’m all-in,” Sessions said. “But if he doesn’t win, it’s over for me.”"
59,POLITICS,Texas Senate OKs Trans Bathroom Restrictions,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-senate-bathroom-bill_us_59779857e4b0c95f375f513c,It's unclear whether Republicans in the state House of Representatives will kill the measure or pass a different version.,2017-07-25,"Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) called the legislature back for a special session this month, largely to pass bathroom restrictions that would target trans Texans. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597798e91a00003300dc07de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― The Republican-dominated state Senate on Tuesday passed a bill that would force trans Texans to use bathrooms of the gender on their birth certificates, rather than the one they identify with. The 21-10 vote on party lines, with one Democrat defecting, came after more than 200 opponents ― including many trans Texans ― testified against the bill on Friday. Procedural rules require three readings of the bill before final passage, but it is likely to formally sail through the state Senate sometime this week. It still needs state House approval and the governor’s signature to become law.“I believe it to be right for Texas, and reflective of our values,” state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst (R-Brenham), the lead author of the bill, said on the floor of the Senate. “The proverbial silent majority thinks this is common sense.”Under the legislation, Texans would only be allowed to use bathrooms, locker rooms and showers in schools and government buildings that match the gender on their birth certificates. An amendment adopted before the vote would allow people to use state-issued IDs to identify their genders. (Changing the gender listed on a Texas ID requires an updated birth certificate or a court order.) The bill also would overturn non-discrimination ordinances passed by cities like Austin and San Antonio to make public bathrooms accessible to transgender people. Kolkhorst and other supporters described their efforts as a public security measure designed to protect women and children from sexual predators. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an outspoken social conservative, forced the special session of the legislature that began this month largely to pass the bathroom restrictions. But LGBTQ groups and the business community have widely criticized those concerns as manufactured and unnecessary, since assault in any setting is already illegal. The only group directly affected by the proposed law are trans Texans, who often face bureaucratic obstacles when attempting to change the gender identification on their birth certificates.“Transgender people are under attack in the state of Texas,” Lisa Scheps, the director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas, told HuffPost. “We are under attack by the legislature, and the governor and the lieutenant governor… But that doesn’t stop our resolve.” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo spoke against SB 3 on the steps of the Capitol, as lawmakers gathered inside for the vote. “It doesn’t address a problem of bathroom predators, because there is no problem of men dressing as women to assault women in public restrooms,” Acevedo said. “It doesn’t make us safer, it creates confusion for ordinary citizens, complicates law enforcement’s job, and puts a target on the backs of LGBT Texans. It solves no problems, while creating a host of new ones. And worst of all, it facilitates discrimination.”Democratic senators grilled Kolkhorst over the bill on Tuesday, with Sen. Kirk Watson (D-Austin) likening it to Jim Crow-era restrictions that kept black Texans out of bathrooms used by whites. But Democrats’ numbers are too small to keep the bill from advancing. “We all agree men should not be in women’s restrooms,” Sen. Judith Zaffirini (D-Laredo) said. “This bill, however, does not achieve that goal. In fact, it would do the exact opposite ― it would force transgender men into women’s bathrooms and force transgender women into men’s bathrooms, putting them in danger.”Instead, the debate is playing out between the state’s hard-line conservatives, led by Patrick, and more moderate Republicans. It remains to be seen whether Patrick and his allies will get their way after SB 3 passes to the House of Representatives. Texas House Speaker Joe Straus (R-San Antonio) has loudly voiced his opposition to legislating trans bathroom use, saying it would undermine the safety of “very vulnerable young Texans” and would be a shot in the foot to the state’s business community. Two studies that figured prominently in the public debate over the bathroom proposal predict that Texas will sacrifice billions in tourism revenue if the measure becomes a law that provokes boycotts.Straus and his loyalists will likely find a way to kill SB 3 in the House, according to Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. “SB 3 will never see the light of day,” Jones told HuffPost. “It will be dead on arrival. Speaker Straus will send it to the State Affairs Committee and it will sleep in a drawer.” The question will then become whether Straus and his more moderate and business-friendly Republican colleagues will abandon the idea altogether, or try to cobble together a compromise to appease social conservatives like Patrick and Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who have pressured Straus to pass some version of the bathroom restrictions. Texas Rep. Ron Simmons (R-Carrollton), for example, has filed a similar bill in the House that would overturn the state’s non-discrimination ordinances, but doesn’t specify that people must use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. Groups organizing to kill SB 3, however, don’t see a way of watering down the proposal enough to make it acceptable. “There is no compromise on discrimination,” Dan Quinn, the communications director for the Texas Freedom Network, told HuffPost. “Either you discriminate or you don’t. There’s no middle ground.” Multiple federal courts have already ruled that transgender students’ rights are protected by Title IX, the section of federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education, according to Kali Cohn, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. While the ACLU doesn’t comment about its plans to file lawsuits, Cohn described the various proposals to keep trans Texans out of the bathrooms they identify with as unconstitutional and vulnerable to challenge in the courts. “The practical effect of what those bills do is the same ― they target transgender students for discrimination,” Cohn said. “If they pass as drafted, [Texas] will be in violation of federal law and the Constitution.” "

I dream of the days when no one complains about math and I am not throwing dinner together before racing out the door for practices. Sleeping in. The carefree schedule. Not having to do any school work. I anticipate summer with more excitement than my children. And then like clockwork, about two weeks into summer, I remember what I forget every year:I am not a great summertime mom. The magical summer I dream of in March is mostly just a dream. I love the idea of summer, but with four children, the reality of it is never quite like I imagine. Blame it on Newton’s Third Law of Physics (which I had to google the name of because I stopped paying attention in science class around second grade):For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.Sure, having children who are old enough to sleep in is the most magical thing on the planet (the action)...until I want to Netflix and chill with my man...and my children want to come in my room every 30 seconds because they aren’t tired (the opposite reaction). And, even though my kids play all day long, our carefree schedule does not provide enough activity to tire them out. Before you tell me that your kids play baseball or are on swim team, here is what you need to know about me: Give me football in Fall, basketball in Winter, and soccer in Spring. But suggest that my kids play the slowest moving sport of all time which involves copious amounts of dirt, and tell me to sit outside in the blazing sun for a double header while corralling the children not currently playing...and I will seriously question our friendship. And don’t even get me started on the insanely early hours swimmers like to keep.Add in the amount of time I would spend applying sunscreen each day, and trust that if I am going to live my best life, it does not involve any aforementioned activities. I take responsibility for my disdain towards the available summer sports, but I am who I am...and it only serves to prove my point that I am not a summertime mom. As if my reference to Sir Isaac Newton and the use of physics in the middle of July wasn’t proof enough.The reason I cautiously admit that summer is not my thing is because people like to post stuff on Facebook with titles like “You Only Have Eighteen Summers With Your Children So You Better Make The Most Of Your Time”. Which excludes but implies the subtext, “If you really love your kids, you will soak up every moment and spend every minute enjoying your precious offspring.” But this also excludes my current reality: I am pregnant with my fifth child and literally so sick and tired. And my children have decided that summertime is the perfect time to fight all day, beg to play electronics every 39 seconds, and ask “what are we doing today” twelve times an hour. I barely have time to soak up their preciousness because I am mostly refereeing while letting them know they are responsible for their own fun. Which they have difficulty with in late July because we are currently living on the surface of the sun...all indoor activities have been exhausted...and I limit how much they play electronics.Not because I want to. On the contrary, my pregnant self would love if electronics all day could be a thing. My house would stay clean, and they would barely break to eat (double win!). But ole Newton proves true again in that electronics make my kids crazy. Sure, they’re quiet while playing them, but I must face the wrath of who they become when I take them away. And it ain’t pretty. This is what I’ve concluded: for some people, the eighteen summers are an awesome time to create memories, cherish your children, and soak up the time. And maybe if I wasn’t miserably pregnant, I would feel this way. (Probably not.)Then there are other people, like me, who are grateful to know that I also have eighteen Falls and eighteen Winters and eighteen Springs to do the same.And that's my family's jam. We all function better on full (but not too full) schedule, adequate sleep, and a consistent routine...when we don't default to electronics to fill the endless hours...and everyone generally knows what to expect each day.I don't particularly like school. I am not even a type-A personality. And if this pregnancy sickness doesn't subside soon, cooking good meals still won't happen. I've just hit that point in the summer where it's a little too relaxed and way too hot. And I'm over it. Instead, I am looking forward to chatting with moms at cheer practice, spending Saturdays watching my favorite boys and my favorite Seminoles play football, and settling into a nice, predictable routine. As predictable as a pregnant mom and four kids can be. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to buy school supplies. That same mid-March delusion is hitting where I convince myself that, if I buy all cute, new school supplies, my kids will actually enjoy school and not complain about math every single day.A mom can dream.

61,BLACK VOICES,Solidarity With Justine Damond Shouldn't Belittle The Fight For Black Lives,"Mycah Hazel, Contributorblogger, equal opportunity enthusiast",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/solidarity-with-justine-damond-shouldnt-belittle-the_us_5976a572e4b0c6616f7ce4bb,Ending police brutality for whites means encouraging officers not to be so “trigger-happy.” Ending police brutality for blacks takes an added level of consideration.,2017-07-25,"<p>Valerie Castile, mother of Philando Castile, embraces Don Damond, fiancé of Justine Damond. Philando Castile was shot and killed by Officer Jeronimo Yanez following a traffic stop.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5976abbb210000b21afc87e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The fatal shooting of Justine Damond has created shock both in her homeland of Australia and across the U.S. While some members of the far-right have insisted that anti-racism groups have been silent since the shooting of the Australian white woman, diverse rallies including prominent black activists and families/friends of police brutality victims have proven that anti-racism groups are not only showing up for Justine Damond – they’re setting race aside to do it. Shaun King, an avid police brutality and Black Lives Matter writer for New York Daily News implied that it doesn’t surprise him that black activists protested in Minneapolis, “because people are bothered by injustice and when they see this, it wasn’t racial.” Cathy Jones, who organized a vigil near the crime scene the day after Damond’s death, claimed that “it’s never been about race. It’s been about police accountability.” Even John Thompson, best friend of Philando Castille, said at a solidarity gathering, “It’s not about race. It’s not about white. It’s not about black. It’s about the police chief killing us.” As uncertainty continues and rage builds, people have put race on the back burner to justify their support for Damond and to get more people to acknowledge police brutality. This is courteous, and fighting for Justine is vital – but race shouldn’t have to be excluded from the picture for people to rally.Though many have factored race out of the reasons behind the shooting of Justine Damond, this doesn’t mean race can automatically be eliminated as a factor in previous police shootings of people of color. Damond’s case showed people that police brutality can affect both blacks and whites, but it doesn’t erase the fact that police brutality impacts blacks disproportionately: black Americans are nearly 2.5 times likelier than white Americans to be fatally shot by police officers. There are more white victims of police shootings than black victims, but this is due to the largeness of the white population in the U.S. There are almost 160 million more white people than black people in the United States (2016). White people make up 62% of the population in the U.S., but only 49% of the population of those fatally shot by police officers. Meanwhile, black people make up 13% of the U.S. population, but 24% of the population fatally shot by police officers. These ratios, according to the Washington Post, prove that black people are 2.5 times likelier than white Americans to be shot. Does this mean that cases like the shooting of Justine Damond aren’t a problem? Of course not. We need to highlight any case where someone is unfairly killed by police. Still, the racial disparity in the likeliness of being killed by police is a sign of racial bias. People have set race aside out of respect for the Damond family, but reiterating police brutality’s disproportionate impact on black lives is not disrespectful. It’s just telling the truth. Police brutality against all needs to end, and a large part of ending this brutality means focusing on the black communities that are the likeliest subjects of it. Ending police brutality for whites means encouraging officers not to be so “trigger-happy.” Ending police brutality for blacks takes an added level of consideration. It means ending a predetermined view of black people as criminals. By setting race aside, we are limiting our room for improvement. When we consider police brutality just a “human issue,” we allow law enforcement to ignore the data that has proven that police brutality and profiling has horribly impacted black communities – and we allow officers to not improve their relationship with those communities. We leave room for police departments to approach improving their tactics in a shallow sense that won’t adhere to the specific needs of communities of color.The traffic stop has become an example of a cop encounter that has increasingly turned deadly for black Americans. According to a 2011 Bureau of Justice study, 13% of black drivers were stopped by police in 2011 compared to 10% of white drivers. The same study states that 84% of white drivers stopped by police believed they were stopped for a legitimate reason compared to the mere 68% of black drivers stopped by police that believed this. Black drivers stopped by police are also more likely to be searched by police than white drivers. Studies over the next five years within large cities have only confirmed these racial disparities. A San Francisco report showed that in 2015, 13.3 percent of black people were searched following traffic stops, compared to just 1.7 percent of white people. The report also documents that SFPD officers exhibit racial bias in their arrests, citing instances of officers “using racial slurs, acting in a sexually inappropriate manner towards Black women, and committing acts of violence against Black people.” The Department of Justice’s investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, released in 2015, proved, among other violations, that FPD repeatedly engages in unconstitutional stops and arrests in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that this misconduct “disproportionately impacts African-Americans.” Data from other big cities only falls in line with this disproportionate policing: a 2015 New York Times analysis found that since 2010, Greensboro officers searched black drivers more than twice as much as whites, and a 2016 report found that in Chicago, black and Hispanic drivers are four times as likely to be searched than white drivers. With so many high-profile fatal police shootings occurring after traffic stops, the racial aspect of traffic stop demeanor among officers can’t just be swept under the rug.Police brutality has various causes and racial effects. These may make police brutality difficult to describe but this doesn’t mean that they can be disregarded. Fighting against police brutality is about ensuring the safety of all races, but it’s also about ensuring that no one race is brutalized more than another. "

According to SNL, when Trump looks in the mirror, he sees the extremely buff image of John Cena staring back at him.Perhaps the real Trump doesn’t think he has the body of a professional wrestler, but with his legendary ego, it’s possible the president does imagine himself as a stronger, younger and classier person than some of the country actually believes him to be.Specifically, he might see himself to be more like the new White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci.Scaramucci is a fellow New Yorker, a wealthy man and, as “The Daily Show” pointed out last night, already has all of Trump’s unique hand gestures down. And in a new video uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday, the show’s host Trevor Noah claims Trump already sees himself as having all the qualities of Scaramucci.“And you know what’s funny is when you look at Scaramucci, you can see that Trump thinks he looks like Scaramucci is, do you know what I mean?” Noah said between shooting scenes for an episode.“Trump looks at Scaramucci and he’s like, that’s me, that’s me folks,” he continued. “Look at his hands, ’cause he also does the hands but he does it in a classier way [...] Scaramucci has swag and you can see Trump is like, ‘That’s me, look at me, look at me.’”Watch Noah’s full breakdown above, but also check out the viral video the show released highlighting the similarities between Trump’s and Scaramucci’s hand gestures:"
63,PARENTS,Parents Are Furious About Trump's Speech To Boy Scouts,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parents-are-furious-about-trumps-speech-to-boy-scouts_us_597748a6e4b0c95f375e9436,The highly politicized speech has been described as a break from tradition for the non-partisan organization.,2017-07-25,"President Trump addressed an estimate 40,000 Scouts, leaders and volunteers at the National Boy Scout Jamboree",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597768e115000021008b37a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Parents are voicing their outrage after President Donald Trump delivered a politically charged speech at The National Scout Jamboree.In West Virginia on Monday, the president addressed tens of thousands of Boy Scouts at the national event, which takes place about every four years and has featured remarks from U.S. presidents throughout its 80-year history. “Tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of that,” Trump began his speech.“And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you amazing young Scouts can achieve your dreams, what to think of, what I’ve been thinking about. You want to achieve your dreams, I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I’m in front of the Boy Scouts? Right?” he continued.However, the speech quickly turned into a tirade against the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama, the “fake media,” and the “cesspool” or “sewer” of politicians in Washington, D.C.Trump also once again touted his Electoral College victory in November. “And you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College ― popular vote is much easier,” he said.Referencing Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price (a former Boy Scout) and the push for senators to vote for healthcare reform, the president stated, “He better get them. Oh, he better ― otherwise, I’ll say, ‘Tom, you’re fired.’ I’ll get somebody.”At another point, he noted, “And by the way, under the Trump administration, you’ll be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again when you go shopping. Believe me. ‘Merry Christmas.’” Following the remarks, many parents spoke out against the highly politicized, campaign rally-esque speech in a forum meant to promote values of leadership, integrity and respect among young men. There were also parents who praised the president’s speech and said their sons were inspired by the remarks. Throughout the president’s address, the crowd of mostly young Scouts, ages 12 to 18, responded with cheers, chants and boos to mentions of “fake news,” Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and even President Obama. This occurred despite earlier instructions from jamboree organizers about maintaining a “friendly” and “respectful” attitude.The mandate read:As a unit leader or staff member, you can help make the president’s visit a success by ensuring that any reactions to the president’s address are, as we state in our Scout Law, friendly, courteous, and kind. This includes understanding that chants of certain phrases heard during the campaign (e.g. “build the wall,” “lock her up”) are considered divisive by many members of our audience, and may cause unnecessary friction between individuals and units. Please help us ensure that all Scouts can enjoy this historical address by making sure that your troop members are respectful not only of the president, but of the wide variety of viewpoints held by Scouts and Scouters in the audience tonight.Still, despite cheers from the young audience, the response online Tuesday remained overwhelmingly negative with parents flocking to the Boy Scouts of America’s Facebook page to express their concern. During his speech, Trump also called out President Obama. “By the way, just a question: did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?” Trump asked. The audience shouted, “No!”Though Obama did not attend a jamboree during his presidency, he did address the 2010 National Scout Jamboree via video.“For a century, Scouts just like you have served your communities and your nation in ways both large and small,” Obama stated in his address. “And today, Scouts across the country continue the tradition of collecting food for those in need, improving our neighborhoods, and reaching out to those less fortunate.”He concluded, “I hope that when you’re called upon to help write the next great chapter in the American story, you will uphold the best of the Scouting tradition and respond with enthusiasm, skill and determination.”Similarly, other past presidents have focused their jamboree remarks on Scouting values and leading by example.President Bill Clinton told Scouts to encourage their peers to get involved with community service. President George W. Bush emphasized the importance of doing the right thing. “In the years ahead you will find that indifferent or cynical people accomplish little that makes them proud,” he said. “You’ll find that confronting injustice and evil requires a vision of goodness and truth. You’ll find that many in your community, especially those younger than you, look to you as an example of conduct and leadership.”As many have noted, Trump’s politicized speech was a break from tradition. Parents of Scouts at the jamboree said that Trump’s speech promoted divisions among attendees and dampened the spirit of the event.Defending the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts for Equality co-founder Zach Wahls noted on Twitter that Trump “put BSA in an incredibly bad position.” Wahls said this was done knowingly as the president acknowledged at the beginning of his speech that he was meant to put politics aside in that forum. Following the uproar, the Boy Scouts of America issued a statement Monday night. Though the statement does not address Trump’s remarks specifically, it emphasizes the organization’s non-partisan stance.The statement reads: “The Boy Scouts of America is wholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy. The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies.”"

The couple claimed Green told Edmondson, “I know niggas like you. I pay for niggas like you scholarship,” before two of his associates choked Edmondson. Soon after, one of them allegedly turned around and choked Williams, too.“I spent the whole night crying,” Williams said Tuesday. “I still feel that man’s hand around my neck.”“You don’t know how it feels to see your girlfriend hurt and scared,” Edmondson added. “I felt powerless to help her.”According to their account, things didn’t stop there. The next night, when Edmondson asked Green to apologize, Green punched him in the face, they said. Green faced assault charges last summer as a result of the incident, later accepting a plea deal and agreeing to pay a $500 fine. But the victims struggled to return to their normal lives after the incident.Edmondson even temporarily left Michigan State University as he dealt with harassment on and offline.“No one stood up to me, even close friends who I thought would be in my wedding one day,” he said, adding, “I have never felt so low in my life. I felt like I was being kicked when I was already on the ground.”The couple will be represented by high-profile attorney Lisa Bloom, who organized the press conference at her Los Angeles offices. Bloom has represented a number of celebrity clients including Kathy Griffin and Blac Chyna, and said she feels Green never properly accepted responsibility for his role in the events that transpired in Michigan.Williams agreed. “We do not want this to happen to anybody else,” she said. The NBA star is just one month removed from helping his team win the NBA Championship against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Last season, he earned his second straight All-Star selection and a spot on the league’s All-NBA Third Team."
