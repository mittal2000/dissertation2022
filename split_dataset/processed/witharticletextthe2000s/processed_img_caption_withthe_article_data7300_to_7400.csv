The result is a huge victory for the AfD, which was founded in 2013 by anti-eurozone economists but saw a rapid rise in recent years as it embraced an anti-Islam, anti-immigrant platform.“We will take back our country and our people,” Alexander Gauland, one of the AfD’s leading candidates, told a crowd of supporters after exit polls came in. The AfD’s election success is an unsettling development for Germany, which has for decades rejected far-right political movements and held a longstanding discomfort of fervent nationalism. But amid both growing anti-immigration sentiment and a larger fracturing of established party systems in many European nations, modern German politics has shown it’s also not immune to radical right-wing populism.Much of the AfD’s campaign focused on opposing immigration, Islam and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to allow over one million asylum seekers into the country during the peak of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2015. Controversial AfD posters filled German streets with anti-Muslim messages and ethnonationalist sentiment, while an online campaign ad blamed Merkel’s policies for terror attacks on European soil.In a press conference held the week of the election, the AfD’s lead candidates Gauland and Alice Weidel claimed that Islam was a political ideology not a religion and held no place in Germany.The AfD also pushed the boundaries of publicly acceptable views around the country’s history. Candidates including 76-year-old Gauland called for the country to abandon aspects of its continued atonement for its Nazi past, even saying that Germans had a right to be proud of the “achievements” of common soldiers during both world wars.A leaked email reportedly from Weidel claimed that Germany was “overrun” by Arabs and other minorities, while the government was a puppet of the countries that won the Second World War. But the AfD’s rhetoric also mimicked other far-right populist parties in Europe, attempting to appeal to mainstream voters and shift public perception that it’s too radical to support. The party denies its views are racist or that it holds any sympathy for Nazism, instead presenting its attacks on multiculturalism and Islam as merely wanting to preserve national identity and culture.Often more extreme sentiment slipped through their messaging, however, including earlier this year when one candidate slammed the country for its public remembrance of Nazi crimes, saying Berlin’s Holocaust memorial is “a monument of shame in the heart of the capital.”Other parties widely condemned the AfD for its rhetoric and radical views during the campaign. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel likened the party to Nazis, and officials ruled out including the party in any coalition government.Condemnations from establishment politicians did little to dissuade AfD voters, however, whose grievances against the status quo helped push the party into parliament. Exit polls showed that a large part of the AfD’s support came from eastern Germany where the economy has lagged behind the rest of the country, while the party’s support skewed heavily towards men.Although the AfD saw the biggest increase in seats during Sunday’s election, several other smaller parties also capitalized on dissatisfaction with Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and its coalition partner the Social Democratic Party. The environmental Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, for instance, also gained seats as the two largest parties fell in support from last election.The results were similar to other European elections this year, such as France and the Netherlands, where traditional voting blocs shifted and establishment parties suffered losses.In those elections, far-right parties also received historic levels of support even as they failed to actually form governments. But in Germany, where the country’s Nazi past previously made support for the far-right taboo, the success of the AfD has special resonance.The majority of the country will hardly welcome the far-right’s presence, however, and within hours of the exit polls release hundreds gathered in protest outside the AfD election night headquarters in Berlin. Head of the Social Democratic Party Martin Schulz said after the vote that as leader of the party that stood up to Adolf Hitler, he believes that the AfD should be thrown out of parliament. "

Several other parties managed to cross the 5 percent threshold to enter parliament, including the far-right Alternative for Germany party, pro-business Free Democratic Party and environmentalist Greens.Merkel will now likely seek to partner with the Free Democrats and Greens to form a government ― an untested alliance known as the “Jamaica coalition” because of the parties’ colors.

Although Merkel’s victory in the vote was fairly certain, the election saw fractures emerge in Germany’s established political landscape as the two largest parties lost seats to smaller political movements. Merkel’s party had the biggest fall, dropping about 8 percent from last election, while the SPD is down 5 percent.“We expected a better result, that is clear,” Merkel said Sunday night, according to The New York Times. “The good thing is that we will definitely lead the next government.”The shift was similar to other European elections this year, such as France and the Netherlands, where once prominent mainstream parties suffered major losses. As in those elections, Germany’s vote also resulted in significant gains for the far-right.The anti-immigration, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany, or AfD, looked to take just under 13 percent of the vote on Sunday, becoming the first far-right party to enter German parliament since World War II. The AfD’s rapid rise since its founding in 2013 has brought once-fringe views back into Germany’s politics, including ethnonationalist ideology that has long been taboo in the country. Post-war Germany had previously shunned far-right parties, as they evoked the trauma and crimes of Nazism.Establishment politicians like Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, SPD leader Martin Schulz and even Merkel herself all spoke out against the AfD during the campaign.

Despite facing some backlash to her policy and giving fodder for the far-right, Merkel’s approval ratings rebounded in the ensuing years.Polling in the weeks leading up to the election put Merkel on pace for an easy victory, holding a double-digit lead over Martin Schulz’ Social Democratic Party. Several other parties, including The Left, Greens and the AfD, hovered above the 5 percent threshold to enter parliament but failed to ever pose a legitimate challenge to Merkel. The wide margin of the CDU’s win looked unlikely not long ago, when Schulz was contesting Merkel in the polls and pundits wondered whether the SPD could unseat the chancellor. But Merkel instead weathered all challenges, as the SPD drastically dropped off in support and Germans opted for the chancellor’s platform of economic growth and political stability.Part of the SPD’s struggles stemmed from an inability to articulate any substantive differences from Merkel’s CDU, its partner in the coalition government. The sole televised debate between Schulz and Merkel was widely seen as a bore, lacking any major conflict and allowing Merkel to portray herself as the confident leader of a prospering country.Germany’s economy experienced strong growth in the past year, and income inequality is less pronounced than in other European nations. At the same time, Merkel has also come to be seen as a steady hand at a time of global instability. Following the election of President Donald Trump, for instance, Merkel has repeatedly said that Europe could no longer completely rely on the United States and must take matters into its own hands.Although digs at Trump are a common way for European politicians to stir up domestic support, Merkel’s statements are also indicative of her push for a stronger European Union. Along with her ally French President Emmanuel Macron, Merkel will likely seek reforms in the EU to deepen economic integration among states.Merkel’s fourth term may also see her become an even more influential figure for international affairs outside of Europe. During the campaign, Merkel urged for a diplomatic solution to tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program, defended the Iran nuclear deal and called for the Paris climate accord to be upheld. She also has a long history of dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, acting as a prominent intermediary between the West and Moscow.Born in communist East Germany and trained as a physicist, Merkel has had an unlikely rise to become only the third chancellor since World War II to hold a fourth term. The past year has seen her take on an equally improbable role as the most influential defender of Western liberal order ― a position that Trump has left vacant and that Merkel has reluctantly and increasingly filled."

3,COLLEGE,Milo Yiannopoulos: Stay The Hell Off My Campus,"Dan Evans-Nakamura, ContributorAKA ""Dan From The Internet"", UC Berkeley Senior, Assistant Pro...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/milo-yiannopolous-stay-the-hell-off-my-campus_us_59ae35e2e4b0c50640cd6198,"The far right has a new playbook, and it’s important we all recognize it.",2017-09-24,<p>There are more people in this picture than there are on UC Berkeley’s campus who actually want to hear from these clowns.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c7dafa1a00002250f08428.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I started my freshman year at Berkeley as the school kicked off the 50th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement. Each student starting their time at Cal that year received a copy of Freedom’s Orator, a biography on FSM leader Mario Savio. As incoming students, we were motivated to follow in Savio’s footsteps: to not be afraid to make our voices heard — and to speak out against injustice. Three years later, as a bleach-blonde bullshit merchant looks to build his brand by co-opting Savio’s legacy and promoting injustice on the campus I call home, now’s as good a time to speak out as any.February 1, 2017 was the first time that far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos came to Berkeley. Many of my peers had just attended the Women’s March, or had protested the travel ban at to San Francisco International Airport. The anti-Trump #Resistance movement was just beginning to pick up steam. Yiannopoulos was also hitting a fever pitch in his career; with a $250,000 book deal in the works, a Senior Editor position at influential pseudo-journalistic hate cesspool Breitbart, and a controversial college tour, “Dangerous Faggot” that kept him steadily in the headlines. Leading up to the event, I did weeks of research into Yiannopoulos. If there was a perspective I wasn’t hearing or information I wasn’t being told, I wanted it. Why had this person become a hero on the alt-right?After concluding my research, it hit me: Yiannopoulos doesn’t truthfully believe in freedom of speech for the sake of ideological diversity — he’s just using it as a ruse to antagonize the left to in order to score alt-right brownie points. There are two reasons why I know this: Firstly, his takes on climate change being a hoax, queerness being a mental illness, and sexual assaults on college campuses being overblown have been repeatedly debunked, yet he still peddles them and attacks people for not taking him seriously. Secondly, because here is a clip of Milo himself confirming he does exactly that.The right wing has a new playbook, and it’s important we all know the basic steps of it:Saturate the media with with dozens upon dozens of empty, one-sided, bombastic #hottakes. (Check out how much time the Ben Shapiro-managed Daily Wire devotes to college campuses, and even Milo’s own site has a special section for this obsession.)That’s how Gamergate got started and how Yiannopoulos got his fame: by using his platform at Breitbart to launch a harassment campaign against several journalists and feminist activists, all under the guise of “whistleblowing to maintain journalistic ethics.” (For more about Gamergate, I highly recommend this article). I observed this first hand: I posted a video to YouTube the night of the cancelled talk on February, detailing what I knew about Milo at that time and giving my opinions on it. The same demographic that is usually found yelling racial epithets in video game chatrooms flooded the comments.Their best trick is to make you think that in order to be tolerant, you must tolerate intolerance. They want you believe that freedom of speech means treating seriously the opinions of assclowns like Ann “Immigration-Is-Genocide” Coulter, or Steve ”I-Don’t-Want-My-Kids-To-Go-To-School-With-Jews” Bannon. To be “tolerant,” they say we must tolerate David Horowitz, whose organization labelled several Berkeley faculty members by name and face as “terrorist supporters” and threw posters all over campus just last week, subjecting them to online harassment. To be “tolerant,” they say that we must tolerate Milo himself ridiculing an outspoken trans student activist, leading to his beta-male fanboys harassing her and other students. (I can already hear the comments section on this: “lol, it’s called diversity of opinion, cuck.”)Even after the Milo and the Berkeley Patriot (a new student group that has grown largely by riding Yiannopoulos’ coattails) repeatedly alleged foul-play by the campus administration, the University was willing to shell over $1 million to secure their hastily planned circus from the inevitable wrath that they sewed the seeds for, and Milo couldn’t have hoped for any better publicity. Don’t believe these provocateurs when they say “freedom of speech.” They only want freedom from the consequences of their own actions. To receive unprecedented leniency and campus resources is the ultimate definition of the same privilege that these speakers choose to downplay, all while Yiannopoulos continues to laugh his way to the bank, having received at least $12 million to make this his business.For the record: the same orange orangutan president that “authentic first-amendment warrior™” Milo Yiannopoulos calls “daddy” traveled to the deep south and spent much of the weekend berating people of color for practicing their first amendment rights. FSM activist Mario Savio traveled to the deep south to directly protest and resist the big injustice of that time: segregation. Social justice warriors and anti-fascists own the Free Speech Movement. And free speech protects citizens from their government, not “dangerous faggots” from their consequences. By the way Milo, count me in as one of the many Black men who would never spend a night with you because A: you’re human scum and B: unlike you, I’m not into older men.Of course anyone can say whatever they want to in America, that’s not the issue. The issue is whether or not California taxpayers and the Berkeley community are going to subsidize and tolerate your brand-building stunt. The answer from me and many others is a hard no. So to Milo Yiannopoulos and any other alt-right halfwit who chooses to co-opt legitimate discourse on college campuses for their own purposes, this message is for you: stay the fuck off my campus. "
4,POLITICS,The Vietnam Protestor And The Kneeling Athlete Are The Same,"Jim Moore, ContributorJournalist, audiobook narrator, editor and photojournalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vietnam-and-the-right-to-kneel_us_59c814cee4b0b7022a646b9c,I see someone who is exercising our democracy’s prime directive.,2017-09-24,The American flag at dawn off the stern of a paddle wheel boat on the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c815801900004500565644.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few weeks ago, in the run-up to the PBS airing of Ken Burns’ documentary on Vietnam, I was asked by several friends for my opinion on that period of time in which the United States was being whipsawed emotionally, politically, financially, and, most important, mortally, by our involvement in the war.On the surface, their requests seemed reasonable, given my personal and professional credentials: I was a military brat, son of a West Pointer; I was a college student in the late 1960s, on a campus that had its share of pro- and anti-war organizations; I was a journalist/photojournalist who covered several of the Washington anti-war marches and the race riots of 1968, and I continued to cover the military well into the 1980s; and I eventually served for more than 30 years in government, on the House and Senate Veterans committees, and in the executive branch under four presidents, principally as a senior-level staff member—speechwriter to four Secretaries—in the Department of Veterans Affairs.In the course of my work for and with veterans, I had the distinct honor to know men and women whose bravery and sacrifice humbled me every day. Even now, thanks to social media, I look with wonder at the names of Vietnam veterans and journalists who are legends, heroes, and wounded warriors, and who were gracious enough to accept my friend requests, or who invited me to be their friends.These are just facts of a long life here in Washington, D.C., facts that pale in comparison to the career contributions of so many other men and women whose life’s orbits occasional cross mine.I understand why a career arc like mine might encourage friends and colleagues to ask my opinion on the Vietnam war. And I understand why so many them would question my reluctance to share an opinion. It is my habit to demure on offering opinions about things of which I have little experience or no personal investment—either as a participant, or as a knowledgeable spectator—because such opinions are of little value in debates of real substance.But then I started watch the Burns’ documentary, and, at the same time, watched professional athletes come under fire from a disruptive, unethical, and immoral president, and so many things began happening inside me that my internal worldview began to morph. A door opened.My ‘ah-ha’ moment was not sparked by the Vietnam series; it came about as I watched the kneeling that that is taking place in our athletic arenas, and president Trump’s response to them. It is his continued moral infirmity and the reactions of his team of sneering, hubris-filled suits he has surrounded himself with that broke this reluctant camel’s back.It is clear that I—and many Americans—do have a personal investment in the events and outcomes of a war painted inaccurately at the time by the blood-soaked brushes of leaders whose moral palettes did not contain the right colors, e.g., truth, candor, clarity of purpose, admission of failure, accountability, shame, sorrow, guilt, and responsibility to the fallen and their families. No, the Vietnam War isn’t over, because the painting is not yet dry for so many Americans, and I’m not sure it will dry in my lifetime.America’s leaders of both parties have been unable to shake a very bad habit: lying. That’s not revelation, to be sure, but addressing it and calling it out by name has taken on a new urgency in a world that is divided and hostile here at home and abroad.What’s more, too many of our leaders compound their lies with ignorance, impenetrable rationalizations, hiding behind shields of scripted spokespersons, and establishing media alliances all-too-eager to take the proffered bags of silver in exchange for ratings.There is no difference between the Vietnam protester and the kneeling athlete. Most Vietnam protesters I knew—some of them close friends—did not question the strength or purpose of the overarching fabric of the Constitution—a blood-stained cloth, hand-stitched imperfectly, by the Founders. What the protesters objected to was the willful back-room repurposing of that sacred weave by leaders who tried to justify their immoral decisions by wrapping their mistakes in the very cloth that defined their role in government. That’s not responsible governance; that’s cowardice. It’s shameful. And it took the lives of 58,000 Americans, and left hundreds of thousands more—families, friends, colleagues—broken in sorrow.When I see an athlete taking a knee during the National Anthem, I don’t see a disrespectful citizen; I see someone who is exercising our democracy’s prime directive: “You are allowed to express yourself peacefully without fear of reprisal.” If the First Amendment had a mantra, that would be it. There is even an essay on its value that every American should take time to read: Letter from Birmingham Jail, by Martin Luther King, Jr.What do the kneelers have to protest? Here’s a short list of what our newly-unenlighted government is too self-involved to take on: Racism, bigotry, inequality, injustice, lives ignored, lives taken senselessly, poverty, homelessness, religious persecution, xenophobia, unequal education, unaffordable medical care, no medical care, disdain for those who are physically or mentally disabled, soaring drug abuse, senior abuse, child abuse, human trafficking, climate change, and global responsibilities that would fill another page.Vietnam’s aftershocks continue as still-rolling waves of discontent and disaffection rising and falling on the shores of our national conscience. To those who say, “Let it go. The damn war is over,” I say, no, the war is not yet over, it has begun anew. Its first shots were heard in November 2016, and they continue to ring loud and mercilessly upon the sensibilities of every American who once dreamed of a day when the echoes of Vietnam would truly fade away, to be muted by the sounds of comity, friendship, and peace. I am one of those Americans, and that is my opinion."
5,POLITICS,White House Aide Struggles To Defend GOP Bill's Pre-Existing Conditions Loophole,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-wallace-march-short-graham-cassidy-preexisting-conditions_us_59c7d090e4b01cc57ff2cc4c,Chris Wallace had him dead to rights.,2017-09-24,"Chris Wallace, host of ""Fox News Sunday,"" grilled White House director of legislative affairs Marc Short on the Graham-Cassidy bill's impact on preexisting conditions protections.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c7d1681d0000c30ee72916.jpeg?cache=WHC56jjSDO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A top Trump administration official ended up conceding on Sunday that individuals with pre-existing medical conditions might end up with higher premiums under the latest effort by Senate Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.On “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace pressed White House director of legislative affairs Marc Short about a provision in the GOP repeal bill that would allow states to seek a waiver from rules barring insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions higher premiums.Short defended the provision ― referred to by Wallace as a “loophole” ― by saying Republicans do not want “Washington, D.C., choosing all the rates across the nation for all sorts of factors.”The health care bill, proposed by Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, has been enthusiastically embraced by President Donald Trump but appears to face long odds of passing. The Affordable Care Act ― known as Obamacare ― forced insurers to cover people in the individual insurance market who have illnesses or other medical conditions that qualify as “pre-existing.” It also mandated that insurers adhere to “community rating” guidelines when setting premiums, charging the same rates for an entire region, rather than charging people with pre-existing conditions more or otherwise differentiating between customers based on medical histories.The Graham-Cassidy bill preserves the first of these regulations, known as “guaranteed issue.” But it allows states to seek a waiver from federal “community rating” provisions so long as it is shown that “adequate and affordable” coverage is available to people.Wallace insisted that without a clearer definition of “adequate and affordable” coverage, the White House and congressional Republicans were opening the door for people with pre-existing conditions to pay significantly more in premiums because of their health histories.“That’s a loophole large enough to drive a tank through,” he said.Short responded with bromides about devolving federal power to the states, but little in the way of substance disputing Wallace’s characterization of the bill.Here is the exchange between the two on the matter:WALLACE: I want to press on this point of pre-existing conditions. Because the Republican bill says states can get a waiver ― let’s put this up on the screen ― States can get a waiver from Obamacare protections if they explained to federal bureaucrats how the states will maintain access to, and this is the key phrase, “adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions” without ever explaining what adequate and affordable coverage is. And then on the very next page, the Graham-Cassidy bill says that “Yes, states can increase premiums for people with pre-existing conditions.” That’s a loophole large enough to drive a tank through.Earlier in the interview, Wallace shot down Short’s claim that, under Graham-Cassidy, “every state’s a winner, including Maine, including Alaska.” Short singled out the two states because Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are two of the Republican senators most skeptical of the bill.But Wallace noted that independent analyses have projected that Graham-Cassidy would cause 34 states to lose federal health care funding they are currently entitled to receive. The bill would reduce federal Medicaid funding in those states ― which include Maine and Alaska ― and the District of Columbia by 2026, according to the health consulting firm Avalere. The drop is the result of a series of funding changes in Graham-Cassidy that include a new cap on Medicaid spending and a redistribution of funds from states that have expanded the program to those that have not.Short insisted that Graham-Cassidy was merely trying to “equitably” distribute federal funds, and correct Obamacare’s practice of picking “winners and losers” from among the states.Wallace disputed the “winners and losers” characterization.“They get less money than they would have under Obamacare and the reason they are going to get less ― it wasn’t that the Obamacare law chose winners and losers, it was that the states [made such a choice] when they decided to go with Medicaid expansion or not,” Wallace said."

But on Saturday morning, a day before Milo Yiannopoulos’s “Free Speech Week” rally at the University of California, Berkeley, was scheduled to start, the alt-right provocateur alerted his followers that he would be holding an “emergency” press conference on Facebook Live. His previously scheduled press conference, set for a luxe event space on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, had reportedly been canceled by the venue’s owners. And so come noon, he could be found sitting in a drab hotel room, flanked by anti-Muslim activist Pamela Geller and men’s-rightser-cum-conspiracist Mike Cernovich. Yiannopoulos had an announcement: “Free Speech Week” was no more. And then he tried to sell some stuff to his fans.Hours earlier, the conservative student co-organizers of the rally told the university they had canceled the four-day shindig, citing what they claimed to be unfair treatment by UC Berkeley administration.In the video, Yiannopoulos explained that without a student sponsor, he couldn’t hold an official university event. So he announced that he’d be holding an “unofficial” rally at the campus on Sunday. “We are going to be hosting an event, come hell or high water, tomorrow,” he said. “We have been in touch with Berkeley PD and are very happy to say the police are behind us, and will be staffing Sproul Plaza tomorrow in force.” This rally, he said, would go forward “with or without student help, with or without the cooperation of UC Berkeley itself,” and even if “domestic terrorists” from Antifa showed up. He lashed out at the university, claiming it used bureaucratic tricks to railroad “Free Speech Week.” The administration, Yiannopoulos claimed, “had done everything in its power to crush” the event. Then came the sell. Yiannopoulos promoted some future events at other California universities — part of what he’s dubbed his “Troll Academy” tour — and took time to announce that his company, Milo Inc., would be publishing a new book by Pamela Geller: Fatwa: Hunted in America. Yiannopoulos had wanted his “Free Speech Rally” in Berkeley to be the Woodstock of the far-right: a big, bad gathering of prominent far-right figureheads, including Ann Coulter and Steve Bannon. And his student co-organizers had hoped left-wing riots at the event might amplify Milo’s message. But here was Milo on Saturday, his Woodstock canceled, talking to a camera in a poorly lit hotel room, hawking a yet-to-be published book to less than 3,000 live viewers. It was as if no one but Sha Na Na had shown up at Yasgur’s Farm.“Claims that this is somehow the outcome desired by the campus are without basis in fact,” Dan Mogulof, spokesman for UC Berkeley, said in a statement Saturday. “The University was prepared to do whatever was necessary to support the First Amendment rights of the student organization.”In the weeks leading up to the “Free Speech Week” rally, Yiannopoulos and the Berkeley Patriot missed multiple deadlines to secure campus venues and to confirm a guest list, the university said. Despite these alleged missteps, UC Berkeley had said as late as Friday that it was still preparing for the rally. On Wednesday, the university published a full “Free Speech Week” schedule, complete with times and locations. Many have suspected that Yiannopoulos never wanted the event to go off in the first place. Instead, the theory goes, he wanted once again to claim the mantle of the martyred conservative man of ideas, suppressed by the liberal jackboots of the ivory tower.In February, some 1,500 people protested his appearance on campus by tearing down infrastructure and throwing Molotov cocktails, and the event was canceled. His “Dangerous Faggot” tour on campuses across the country last year also sparked protests, and led to acts of hate targeting minorities. From Salon:Following his lecture [at Chicago’s DePaul University], ThinkProgress reported that DePaul students discovered nooses strewn around campus. While conservatives had chalked the sidewalks with pro-Trump slogans in the days leading up to the event, they replaced them with a more permanent rejoinder: “Fuck Mexico” was painted in black outside the school’s quad. When The Daily Caller, a popular right-wing blog, reported that Ada Cheng, a women’s studies professor, resigned in protest over Yiannopoulos’ speech, she received death threats. Internet trolls even targeted her page on Rate My Professor.It’s this kind of hate that brought anti-fascist protesters out onto the streets on Saturday in Berkeley for a demonstration that at times felt like a victory march. A brass band played, and protesters, many of them wearing masks, chanted and cheered and waved signs. On the back of a pickup truck, people took turns speaking into a microphone. One woman addressed the man who had brought them all here: Yiannopoulos. “He failed!” she said to loud applause.If Yiannopoulos shows up at UC Berkeley tomorrow as he says he will, he’ll likely be greeted by an even larger contingent of anti-fascists. “Even if every fascist event gets cancelled, we feel very strongly that our protests should still go forward tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday,” read a Facebook post Saturday from the group Refuse Fascism, “because the fascism that is behind the Fascist Week, the fascism in the White House – is still hammering ahead.” Yiannopoulos, for his part, is telling his supporters to be prepared for Antifa tomorrow. “If you’re planning on coming to Sproul Plaza tomorrow, there might be a few ANTIFA goons there,” he wrote in a Facebook post, linking to a Milo Inc. guide to the Antifa. “But don’t worry: We’ve got you covered. The ANTIFA HANDBOOK is your how-to guide to understanding, disrupting, and defeating this dangerous, but strangely pathetic, association of rejects from more upscale terrorist organizations.”America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

8,POLITICS,Donald Trump Repeats Call For NFL Boycott To Stop Anthem Protests,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-call-for-nfl-boycott_us_59c7af8ce4b06ddf45f879da,"Under fire, the president characteristically digs in.",2017-09-24,President Donald Trump at the rally in Alabama on Friday where he began his attacks on athletes who protest racism by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c7b08f1d00002900e728df.jpeg?cache=bkCYnVgUmD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a pair of early-morning tweets, President Donald Trump once again encouraged football fans to boycott the NFL if the league does not “fire or suspend” players who kneel during the national anthem to protest racism.Trump argued that if fans take coordinated action, they “will see change take place fast.”He went on to argue that the protests were partially responsible for what he asserted was declining public interest in NFL games.With the Twitter posts, Trump’s escalated his public campaign against the protests by athletes that he began with comments at a political rally in Alabama on Friday. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired?’” Trump said at the gathering.His comments prompted an outpouring of criticism of Trump from several NFL players. And on Sunday the owner of one of the league’s most successful franchises joined that chorus. The New England Patriots ― the reigning Super Bowl champions ― released a statement from owner Robert Kraft, a friend and supporter of Trump’s, condemning Trump’s attacks.“I am deeply disappointed by the tone of the comments made by the president on Friday,” Kraft said. “I am proud to be associate with so many players who make such tremendous contributions in positively impacting our communities.”Kraft added that he backed the rights of players “to peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful.”Shortly afterward, Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan locked arms with players and staff who knelt during the national anthem at the start of a game against the Baltimore Ravens in London.NFL Commissioner Roger Gooddell on Saturday condemned Trump’s “divisive comments,” but refused to name him explicitly. And Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross also criticized the president’s “divisiveness” without naming him.Trump’s crusade against the practice of kneeling during the national anthem began with his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks Friday at a rally on behalf of Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who is locked in a close race to hold onto his seat.The president on Saturday tweeted that “if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!”Trump appears to be wagering that a prolonged battle over a hot-button cultural issue like the protests will work in his political favor. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin defended Trump’s remarks in an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” telling host Martha Raddatz that players “have the right to have the First Amendment off the field,” but that the NFL should fine or suspend players who protest as the anthem is played at the start of games.Trump’s attacks on protesting NFL players is part of a larger battle he and his administration has been having with the sports world. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested earlier this month that ESPN should fire host Jemele Hill for calling Trump a “white supremacist.”On Saturday, Trump claimed he was withdrawing an invitation to the White House for the Golden State Warriors, the reigning NBA champions, because star guard Stephen Curry was “hesitating” about attending. Curry had said on Friday that he would vote against the team making the traditional visit, but that the Warriors had not yet decided as a group what to do.Rather than have a chilling effect on athletes protesting racism, Trump’s comments have prompted a show of solidarity from many black athletes and entertainers, as well as white allies. NBA star LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers spoke out against Trump, and on Saturday, Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball player to kneel during the anthem.The movement to protest racism, and particularly police killings of black men, by kneeling during the anthem began with a protest by then-San Fransciso 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in an August 2016 pre-season game. Initially, Kaepernick sat during the anthem, but quickly switched to kneeling in a bid to avoid appearing disrespectful.Kaepernick continued the protest through the 2016 season, inspiring many of his fellow players to join him. In March, Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers and has since failed to get picked up by another NFL team, leading to speculation that owners have blackballed him for his political stance.This story has been updates with comment by Mnuchin and background on the escalating war between Trump and parts of the sports world.

9,WORLD NEWS,North Korea Says Rockets To U.S. ‘Inevitable’ After Trump Dubs Kim ‘Rocket Man’,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-trump-rocket-man_us_59c6acfae4b01cc57ff2912f,"""We are finally only a few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force,” said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.",2017-09-23,North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York on Sept. 23.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c6ad491900003a005654df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," North Korea said on Saturday that firing its rockets at the U.S. mainland was “inevitable” after U.S. President Donald Trump called Pyongyang’s leader “rocket man,” in a further escalation of rhetoric between the two leaders.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho’s remarks before the United Nations General Assembly came hours after U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers escorted by fighter jets flew in international airspace over waters east of North Korea, in a show of force the Pentagon said demonstrated the range of military options available to Trump.“Through such a prolonged and arduous struggle, now we are finally only a few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force,” Ri told the annual gathering of world leaders.“It is only a forlorn hope to consider any chance that the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) would be shaken an inch or change its stance due to the harsher sanctions by the hostile forces,” he said.Trump announced new U.S. sanctions on Thursday that he said allow targeting of companies and institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea. Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted its ninth round of sanctions on Pyongyang to counter its nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.Ri, who said Pyongyang’s ultimate goal was to establish a “balance of power with the U.S.,” retorted that Trump himself was on a “suicide mission” after the U.S. president said Kim was on such a mission.The U.S. bombers’ flight was the farthest north of the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea that any U.S. fighter jet or bomber has flown in the 21st century, the Pentagon said.“This mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the President has many military options to defeat any threat,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, callingNorth Korea’s weapons program “a grave threat.”“We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the U.S. homeland and our allies.”Ri warned Pyongyang was ready to defend itself if the U.S. showed any sign of conducting a “decapitating operation on our headquarters or military attack against our country.”North Korea has launched dozens of missiles this year, several flying over Japan, as it accelerates its program aimed at enabling it to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile.The flight follows a week of heightened rhetoric from Washington and Pyongyang, with Trump and Kim Jong Un trading insults. Trump called the North Korean leader a “madman” on Friday, a day after Kim dubbed him a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a program aimed at enabling it to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. The North has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific.The Pentagon said the B-1B Lancer bombers came from Guam and the U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle fighter escorts came from Okinawa, Japan. It said the operation showed the seriousness with which it took North Korea’s “reckless behavior.”The patrols came after officials and experts said a small earthquake near North Korea’s nuclear test site on Saturday was probably not man-made, easing fears Pyongyang had exploded another nuclear bomb just weeks after its last one.China’s Earthquake Administration said the quake was not a nuclear explosion and had the characteristics of a natural tremor.The CTBTO, or Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors nuclear tests, and officials of the South Korean meteorological agency also said they believed it was a natural quake.An official of South Korea’s Meteorological Agency said acoustic waves should be detected in the event of a man-made earthquake.“In this case we saw none. So as of now, we are categorizing this as a natural earthquake.”The earthquake, which South Korea’s Meteorological Agency put at magnitude 3.0, was detected 49 km from Kilju in North Hamgyong Province, where North Korea’s known Punggye-ri nuclear site is located, the official said.All of North Korea’s six nuclear tests registered as earthquakes of magnitude 4.3 or above. The last test registered as a 6.3 magnitude quake.Tensions have continued to rise around the Korean Peninsula since Pyongyang carried out its sixth nuclear test, prompting a new round of U.N. sanctions.Trump told the U.N. on Tuesday the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies.North Korea’s nuclear tests to date have all been underground, and experts say an atmospheric test, which would be the first since one by China in 1980, would be proof of the success of its weapons program."

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c625001a00002400f082a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BERKELEY, Calif. — What a mess. A spokesman for disgraced right-wing troll Milo Yiannopoulos says the “Free Speech Week” rally he organized this week at University of California, Berkeley, is going ahead as scheduled, even though multiple sources involved in the planning say otherwise.“No, it’s not cancelled,” Alexander Macris told HuffPost in an email, adding that Yiannopoulos is “looking forward to speaking throughout the 4-day event alongside other defenders of freedom.”Yiannopoulos organized the rally, scheduled to start Sunday, with The Berkeley Patriot, a conservative student newspaper. It had been set to feature a who’s who of far-right speakers, including Yiannopoulos and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, and was expected to draw large counter-protests. Earlier Friday, Berkeley Patriot editors told local NPR affiliate KQED that the event had been called off. One of the event’s scheduled speakers told HuffPost in an email Friday that the rally wasn’t happening.Lucian Wintrich, a correspondent for the far-right site Gateway Pundit, who had been involved in organizing “Free Speech Week,” posted a video to Twitter Thursday night saying the rally was a no-go.Macris, Yiannopoulos’ spokesman, didn’t respond to an email asking to explain this confusion, but Yiannopoulos himself could clarify things Saturday afternoon, when he plans to hold an “eve of battle” press conference in San Francisco. Yiannopoulos also announced he’ll be leading a march through the Berkeley campus on Sunday. “Free Speech Week” has been disorganized since its inception over the summer. Many of the high-profile, far-right figures slated to speak at the event — including white nationalist social scientist Charles Murray, the conservative Manhattan Institute’s Heather MacDonald, newly infamous Google memo guy James Damore, and Ann Coulter — have either dropped out or said they were never actually asked to attend.University officials have claimed that Yiannopoulos and The Berkeley Patriot have missed multiple deadlines to book indoor campus venues and confirm a guest list. The university said it set the deadlines to allow time to set up security.Yiannopoulos denied missing any deadlines, writing in an Instagram post that the university deliberately stonewalled organizers and engaged in “bureaucratic brinksmanship.”“They do not want us on campus,” he said this week in a Facebook video.University spokesman Dan Mogulof, speaking to BuzzFeed News on Friday, called Yiannopoulos’ accusation “utter nonsense.”The university has given every indication this week that it’s ready for the event. “Despite today’s conflicting media reports about the status of events scheduled for next week ... the university is proceeding with plans to provide security for the campus community and any of the speakers who will appear here,” the school said in a statement on Friday. The university said in another statement that it was in the “process of spending close to a million dollars on these security arrangements; if these events take place we want them to be safe and peaceful.”Earlier this week, Berkeley published a full schedule for “Free Speech Week.”All of the events appear to be scheduled for Sproul Plaza, an outdoor space on the Berkeley campus that has hosted many a raucous political rally over the decades.It was here in February, less than a month after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, that some 1,500 people protesting an appearance at the university by Yiannopoulos toppled light poles, started fires and hurled Molotov cocktails. Out of concerns for security, the school canceled Yiannopoulos’ speech.“If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view — NO FEDERAL FUNDS?” Trump tweeted later.Yiannopoulos — who the Anti-Defamation League calls a “misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, transphobic troll who is extremely good at getting people to pay attention to him” ― used the episode to play victim and further the claim that liberal-leaning colleges like UC Berkeley stifle the free speech of conservatives.He appeared to relish the spotlight until a short time later, when a video emerged of him making comments condoning pedophilia. He subsequently lost his job with Breitbart News and was removed from the Conservative Political Action Conference speaking list. He also lost a lucrative book deal with publisher Simon & Schuster.“Free Speech Week” would give Yiannopoulos a chance to rehabilitate or burnish his image as a far-right firebrand.But there are many who don’t want to let him.The anti-Trump group Refuse Fascism is set to protest any and all “Free Speech Week” events, according to its Facebook page. Meanwhile, more than 130 Berkeley professors and graduate students have signed an open letter calling for a boycott of classes and other university events during “Free Speech Week.”“Once more, signs point towards an escalated and uncontrollable confrontation both on and off campus during these four days,” the letter states.“The history of these events has been chilling,” it continues. “Since Inauguration Day, Alt-Right followers have shot someone at the University of Washington, stabbed two people to death on public transport in Portland, stabbed to death a college senior in Maryland, beaten numerous nonviolent protesters at the University of Virginia, and most recently murdered a peaceful protester with an automobile in Charlottesville.“Therefore, as faculty committed to the safety of our students and our campus, we are calling for a complete boycott of all classes and campus activities while these Alt-Right events are taking place at the very center of UC Berkeley’s campus.” America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

He was diagnosed with stomach cancer in the fall of 2016 and underwent treatment. Bradley headed out on the road earlier this year after receiving a clean bill of health but the cancer recently returned, spreading to his liver.”Bradley, known as the “Screaming Eagle of Soul” for his impassioned performances, famously found musical success late in life. He released his debut album “No Time For Dreaming” in 2011. Bradley’s life, including years of struggling with poverty and homelessness, was the subject of the 2012 documentary “Charles Bradley: Soul of America.”Bradley was born in Gainesville, Florida, in 1948 and was raised by his grandmother until the age of 8, when his mother brought him to Brooklyn, New York. He ran away as a teenager, living intermittently on the streets and at friends’ homes for a couple of years before enlisting in the Job Corps. From there, he spent 10 years working in Maine as a cook, then went on to live and work in various places around the U.S. and in Canada before ultimately moving back to Brooklyn.Though Bradley had been performing music for decades — largely James Brown covers — prior to his 2011 album, “No Time for Dreaming” launched him to fame and landed on Rolling Stone’s list of top 50 albums of 2011.Bradley began to tour worldwide, and went on to release two more albums, 2013’s “Victim of Love,” and 2016’s “Changes.” He was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding On-Camera Musical Performance in a Daytime Program after performing on “CBS This Morning: Saturday” last year.The musician had to cancel several tour dates earlier this year due to his illness. When he did so, he expressed love on Twitter for those who made his “dreams come true.”"

He's only ensuring they won't.",2017-09-23,San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick (7) pumps his fist as he acknowledges the cheers from the 49ers' fans ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c6a1c91d00003d00e727d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Saturday morning, President Donald Trump attempted to rescind a White House invitation he apparently had never extended, when he tweeted that Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry was no longer welcome to make the customary visit to celebrate the team’s NBA championship.Curry, Trump said, was “hesitating” to commit to the trip ― an obvious falsehood, considering that the point guard had on Friday stated plainly that he had no interest in visiting the president.The tweet followed Trump’s Friday night attack on NFL players who, inspired by the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, have spent the last year protesting racial injustice and police brutality during the national anthem. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” Trump said at a rally in Alabama. “Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” That, meanwhile, followed the White House’s decision last week to call for the firing of ESPN anchor Jemele Hill, who in a series of tweets had called the president a “white supremacist.”Curry, Hill, and the vast majority of NFL players who have protested during the anthem, like Kaepernick, of course, are all African-Americans. In the span of less than two weeks, the president of the United States has used his bully pulpit three times to attack prominent black sports figures.That is a remarkable and improper use of presidential power. But it is not at all surprising that sports figures have become the focus of Trump’s ire. From boxer Jack Johnson to the University of Wyoming’s Black 14, from Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos to Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges, America has a long tradition of black athletes taking a stand against racial injustice. Black protest in sports tends to take the form of a freighted absence — Ali gone from boxing for three years; Abdul-Rauf in the locker room during the national anthem. Curry’s pointed withdrawal from the White House visit is of a piece with Kaepernick’s choice to sit during the anthem, which subsequently led the league to blackball him. ESPN, in its frantic attempts to keep Hill off the air, nearly created a charged absence right in the middle of its afternoon programming block.It was only a matter of time before the racial reaction embodied by Trump’s presidency would explode across the sports landscape. There are few places in America where black people are more visible and their voices more audible than in the NFL and NBA, and on ESPN. Seventy percent of NFL players are black. Nearly three quarters of NBA players are. ESPN, for all its other faults, is by far the most racially diverse sports media outlet on the planet.Echoes of the white grievance that powered the Trump campaign can be heard, for instance, in the complaints about ESPN’s liberal tendencies, a polite euphemism for the network’s blackness. They can be heard, too, in the furious response to Kaepernick’s protest, in which athletes represent an ascendant black power that is ungrateful for the opportunities extended to them, and wrong for pointing out the obvious racial injustices that still exist in the country. The backlash is fueled by the belief that, in return for million-dollar salaries and the fragile affections of many white fans, black sports figures are required to sacrifice their basic humanity and their right to participate in civic society. Curry and Kaepernick and Hill broke that unspoken agreement.“What we do with the black athlete is say, ‘This is what you get,’” said Louis Moore, an author and history professor at Grand Valley State University. “We take these black athletes and say, ‘Look, they’ve made it! Anybody can make it in America!’”“But the moment they speak up,” he continued, “they become problematic.”Trump was speaking to this very sense of grievance in his follow-up tweets:Trump and his supporters demand that athletes “stick to sports” on the premise that sports are not an acceptable arena for any discussion of social injustice, as if any other venue would be, as if sports themselves weren’t already deeply political, as if American sports weren’t the domain of government-abetted monopolists enjoying a set of power arrangements that—as athletes point out from time to time, to national opprobrium—aren’t as far removed from the plantation as we’d like to think. When Hill pointed out the plain fact that Trump is a white supremacist whose presidency is based on white supremacy, she knew what she was talking about. She covers sports, after all.That they are rich and famous does not insulate black sports figures from America’s racist legacy, as is demonstrated by the cases of NBA player Thabo Sefolosha, former NFL running back Warrick Dunn, or former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin, whose cousin was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop. Trump has drawn such a forceful rebuke from so many athletes precisely because his words and policies directly affect them too.In targeting Hill, Curry and NFL players like Kaepernick, Trump was goosing his small but fervent base of supporters, people who do not want to confront America’s racial realities through sports or anywhere else.But if this weekend’s immediate response is any indication, Trump’s comments will only embolden athletes to take an even more forceful stance against him and what he represents. Numerous NFL players have already spoken out against his speech in Alabama. LeBron James called Trump a “bum” for his criticism of Curry. The NFL Players Association said that its members “can no longer afford to stick to sports.” North Carolina’s title-winning basketball team announced it would not visit the White House.

I even wrote about the fact that I write about Trump so much, after a friend commented on the fact that all of my posts seemed to be centering around American politics. In that post, I concluded that I would keep writing about Trump because his actions, words and policies have serious impact on the world. I’ve continued doing this; but it’s not just the current political climate that I find myself writing about. I keep coming back to the election.The 2016 Presidential election was the first time when I truly felt engaged in politics. Some of the campaigning period overlapped with that of the Canadian election, so the combination of both really sparked my interest. Although I wasn’t old enough to vote at the time, I began to consider which candidate I agreed with most and which policy issues I felt most strongly about.After a few years of continually asking my dad to explain the Electoral College to me, I finally understood it enough to be the one to answer my friends’ questions. I devoured articles about the primaries and brought up politics every chance I could. I was fascinated, and so excited to finally feel like I had a good grasp on what was happening in the political sphere around me.I think though, more than this, I felt a connection with Hillary Clinton. I don’t ever remember a specific moment where I realized I identified with her, other than watching her speeches and realizing how intelligent and qualified she was. I admired her for being a strong woman in an area dominated by men; in some leadership positions I’d held in high school, I was among the few females represented. Mind you, I didn’t experience what Clinton did — rampant sexism and blatant misogyny — but regardless, I developed an appreciation for her leadership.The day after Trump won, I wrote about the bewildering, blistering reality of watching Clinton’s concession speech. It was sometime in those days afterwards, when the smoke was clearing but the headlines were still confounding and conflicting, that I turned on Twitter notifications so that I got updates every time Clinton tweeted. I still have them turned on; it’s not often that a tweet pops up, but when it does, I smile because I remember her campaign and what she fought for.You can probably assume, based on all of this, that I was thrilled when Clinton announced she’d be releasing a book. I had already read Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign, which contextualized many of the articles I’d read about Clinton’s loss and helped better shape my understanding of the election. Now, as I type this, What Happened, Clinton’s account of the 2016 election, sits on my bedside table. I’m not very far into it (and you can surely expect a post about my thoughts when I’m done), but so far I’m really enjoying it. I’ve written and read a lot about the election, as I’ve established; but I still jump at opportunities to learn more and think more about it.It seems that I’m not alone in this curiousity. Quoting a tweet that says that Clinton’s book has sold the most copies of any nonfiction release in the past five years, Nate Silver wrote, “The notion that ‘nobody wants to re-litigate 2016’ is sort of a myth…”. I’m sure that not everyone who purchased or read What Happened supported Clinton; many probably read it out of hatred or so that they could argue about or dispute its contents. But still, a lot of people remain stuck on the campaign trail. This could be because the results of the election came as such a shock to many people that there were some psychological reasons for their inability to move on.I have to wonder as well if it is partly because of the new inhabitant of the Oval Office that many people still think so much about the election cycle. After all, Trump is still holding campaign rallies (yes, even though he already campaigned and won). In many ways, he is still talking and acting like he’s on the campaign trail, leading some to believe he is already campaigning for the 2020 election.The 2016 U.S. election was historic. We saw the first female leader of a major party and we saw a stunning defeat that many of us didn’t predict. There has been no shortage of things to reflect on in the wake of Nov. 8. What role did voter suppression play? What role did the media play? What role did Russian interference play? Should the Electoral College be abolished? Politicians, journalists, researchers and citizens are still searching for the answers to these, and many other, questions.Reflection is good; action, I think, is better. I am excited to continue reading What Happened, not only to gain a better understanding of what really did happen but, more importantly, to learn how Clinton is moving forward and how she suggests the rest of us move forward, too."

One week after that diagnosis, she had her eye removed. Some wonderful artist somewhere made a glass eye to look like her other eye. It was a work of art and a work of science, as her doctors were able to connect it to her existing eye muscles so it would track with her real eye. It tracked pretty well, most of the time, although I trained myself to always look into her real eye, anyway.But Cancer, you were relentless. You hid the ocular melanoma from her and her immune system just long enough to metastasize, sending cancer sleeper cells throughout her blood stream. No one knew that, of course, when she decided to have her eye removed in a desperate attempt to get away from you, forever.My sister adjusted to only having one eye and less depth perception. Then she lived what remained of her life with a vengeance. She ran marathons on the North Pole. She biked for days in the Oregon mountains every year with Cycle Oregon and completed the Death Ride Tour of the California Alps. She ran 5 miles a day every day to boost her immune system against your relentless quest to kill her even though she hoped she had cut you out of her body.But you won, cancer, you greedy bastard. You took my sister's eye and then stalked her for six years. She hoped she had escaped your demonic clutches but then you reared your ugly head in her liver. And then in her lungs. And then in her scalp and her brain. And in a matter of months, you shut her liver down and dealt the death blow. You killed her. You won. You bastard. And for what? What did you get out of snuffing out the life of a person who worked tirelessly to make the world a better place? My sister never failed to make contributions big and small because she could, leaving behind two heartbroken kids, a devastated mother, sister, bother-in-law, nephew and many, many friends? Like a suicide bomber, when she died, you died. So what was the point of that?So hear this, Cancer. We are coming for you. We are getting closer and closer to figuring out how to eradicate your ability to murder us. Immunotherapy is promising and trials are commencing. My sister Jill had been accepted into a cutting-edge immunotherapy clinical trial in New York but you killed her before she could get there. You are pure evil.You are a force to be reckoned with, Cancer, but you have no soul. You have no ideology, no beliefs, no mission and no end game unless eradicating all living creatures is your end game. But if that is the case, you'd eventually have no living bodies to invade and kill. Then you would also become extinct.So, Cancer, here's my message to you. We will hunt you down. We will find you. We will figure out how to stop you. And we will win. Unfortunately, it will be too late for my sister and too late for so many other people.But the day will come, Cancer. We will kick your narcissistic demonic ass. You have it coming, on behalf of my sister Jill and so many others.Sincerely,A heartbroken sister"
15,ARTS & CULTURE,"NYC's Guggenheim Museum Under Fire For Show With Live Reptiles, Film Of Dogs Strapped To Treadmills",Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/guggenheim-museum-dog-fighting-reptiles_us_59c6d865e4b01cc57ff2944f,Animal welfare activists are accusing the New York City museum of cruelty.,2017-09-23,"A photo of a previous installation of ""Theater of the World,"" included in a press release from the Guggenheim Museum.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c6deb51d00003d00e7282c.jpeg?cache=oK9qICFmfU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Aug. 26 ― The Guggenheim will not be showing the three animal-related works that have sparked protests, the museum announced Monday. PREVIOUSLY:New York City’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, commonly called The Guggenheim, is facing accusations of animal cruelty over an upcoming show that includes an arena where live reptiles and insects will “devour each other” and a video of dogs strapped to treadmills.Those exhibits are slated to be part of the museum’s October show, “Art and China After 1989: Theater of the World.” The exhibit features more than 150 pieces of art by more than 70 artists, the vast majority of which are not sparking any backlash. However, three pieces in particular are attracting criticism from animal welfare activists.The piece that’s gotten the most negative press is “Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other,” by controversial artist duo Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. When they first staged the piece in 2003, four pairs of pit bull-type dogs were brought to the Today Museum in Beijing and strapped onto non-motorized treadmills at close proximity, facing each other — similar to techniques sometimes used to train fighting dogs.The Guggenheim’s exhibit will not involve live dogs in the flesh — it’s a video of the 2003 performance, the museum emphasized in a statement. The Guggenheim described the piece as “an intentionally challenging and provocative artwork that seeks to examine and critique systems of power and control.”Peng has previously defended the piece, saying that the dogs were not being abused because they are “naturally pugnacious” — an oft-repeated stereotype about pit bulls. The New York Times article on the exhibit, however, describes the dogs tethered to the treadmills as being frustrated, getting “wearier and wearier, their muscles more and more prominent, and their mouths increasingly salivate.”Animal welfare activists say that the video itself is unethical because of how it was created, and the way it depicts pit bulls.“[The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] opposes the use of animals in art if such practices produce pain, injury or distress to the animals,” said ASPCA president Matt Bershadker in a statement to Pix 11. “The video perpetuates the false stereotype that pit bulls are only purposeful as vicious dog fighting instruments, not as what they are at their core: affectionate and loyal animals who crave our attention and deserve safe and loving homes.”Two other exhibits under fire include a video featuring mating pigs covered in ink, and the show’s titular piece ― an installation involving live reptiles and insects, some of which will die during the show. The Guggenheim describes “Theater of the World” by artist Huang Yong Ping as “a caged arena shaped like a mythological tortoise, hundreds of live reptiles and insects devour each other over the course of the show.” A Guggenheim spokeswoman told HuffPost that one section of the installation will house leopard geckos, Italian wall lizards, millipedes, crickets, cockroaches, grasshoppers, and two types of beetles. A second will contain corn snakes and sulcata tortoises.“The Museum staff worked closely with the artist as well as with an entomologist and reptile and insect care experts,” she said in an email. “The insects were sourced in consultation with local experts; all are non-venomous. The reptiles have been selected and are cared for by trained professionals, including regular observation by a veterinarian.”She added that lighting will be appropriate to help the animals acclimate to their environment, and that their feeding is managed by “trained experts.”It was not immediately clear what the museum’s initial press release meant when it said the reptiles and insects would “devour each other.”Versions of the piece have been shown all over the world, and it has sparked controversy multiple times, including when the Vancouver Art Gallery removed the installation in 2007 after Huang refused to let them make some alterations at the recommendation of a veterinarian.Huang argued in a 2015 interview that the installation isn’t cruel, saying it’s no different from pet stores selling bugs as food for other animals:I was trying to present a metaphor through these creatures, not to emphasize their cruelty. I was presenting a case in which the bugs represented different kinds of people who supposedly cannot exist together, and raising the question—what would it be like if they coexisted? Hence the metaphoric title Theater of the World. I believe that this artwork is about raising such meaningful questions, not illustrating so-called cruelty.An online petition calling for the removal of the exhibits involving animals had garnered more than 160,000 signatures as of Saturday afternoon.This article has been updated with comments from a Guggenheim spokeswoman."
16,THE WORLDPOST,"Amal Clooney: 'Finally, We Have A Coordinated Effort To Bring ISIS To Justice'","Amal Clooney, ContributorLawyer, Activist and Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amal-clooney-isis_us_59c569bae4b01cc57ff22947,"Thanks to a new international investigation, victims of ISIS now have hope of being heard in court.",2017-09-23,"Nadia Murad, an ISIS survivor, and Amal Clooney attend a Security Council meeting set to adopt a resolution to help preserve evidence of ISIS crimes in Iraq. U.N. headquarters, New York, Sept 21.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c58f291a00002400f08216.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UNITED NATIONS — For the first time, the United Nations has launched an international investigation into the crimes of the so-called Islamic State. In doing so, the U.N. sends a message to ISIS terrorists that if they commit genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity, they will be put on trial. And it tells victims that they may finally have their day in court.Security Council Resolution 2379 was spearheaded by the U.K. government and passed unanimously Thursday by the council’s 15 members. It establishes a U.N. investigative team, led by a special adviser, to collect evidence of ISIS’s crimes in Iraq. This evidence can then be used in trials against ISIS militants around the world. The resolution is a rare show of unity for the council and provides a global response to ISIS that extends beyond the battlefield to include a commitment to punishing individuals through the courts. It is a major victory for ISIS victims, who have bravely campaigned for justice and waited too long for a chance to see their tormentors in the dock.According to the U.S. State Department, ISIS has “committed the overwhelming majority of serious human rights abuses” in Iraq. The U.N. has documented the terrorist group’s horrific crimes against Shiites, Christians, Sunnis and others as well as crimes amounting to genocide against the Yazidis. Yazidis are neither Christian nor Muslim, and partly because they do not have a holy book, ISIS considers them to be the worst type of infidel.Nadia Murad, an ISIS survivor who has become the U.N.’s ambassador on human trafficking, is one of thousands of Yazidis who were kidnapped and kept as sex slaves by ISIS militants. Her mother and brothers were executed, and her nephews were taken as child soldiers. Nadia cannot understand why, even though the genocide began over three years ago, no ISIS member has been put on trial for it. Instead, evidence has been disappearing every day: witnesses have fled, medical evidence has been lost and documents have been destroyed. Mass graves, including the one where Nadia believes her mother is buried, have been exposed to contamination. Unless evidence is properly collected now, justice will forever remain out of reach. This is why the Security Council’s intervention is so critical: not just for the Yazidis but for all victims of ISIS’s brutality.The U.N. team established by the Security Council is to work alongside Iraqi prosecutors and judges to gather evidence for use in trials that respect international standards of due process, whether in Iraq or abroad. Although many ISIS fighters have been killed in Iraq, thousands have been arrested there and many more can be detained as additional evidence is gathered. Some of ISIS’s foreign fighters are returning to their home countries and could be prosecuted there too. New evidence can also help the International Criminal Court, which has jurisdiction over ISIS fighters who are nationals of any of the 124 countries that are members of the court.The Security Council’s resolution answers a call for assistance by the Iraqi government, which faces serious challenges in prosecuting the large-scale atrocities that have afflicted its civilian population. Although there have been some trials against ISIS members in Iraq, none have included charges of genocide or sexual violence. The trials that have taken place have also given rise to serious due process concerns.The U.N. has found that there has been “a consistent failure to respect … fair trial standards” in Iraqi criminal courts. U.N. observers report that judges routinely convict defendants based on confessions alleged to have been obtained by torture and that defendants are “rarely given the opportunity to present a defense … or meet with a lawyer.” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International reports reached similar conclusions. Despite these shortcomings, trials before Iraqi courts result in lengthy prison sentences or even in executions; in fact, use of the death penalty in Iraq is currently on the rise. The U.N. must not be complicit in the use of courts as killing machines or in any trial that denies the defendant due process and thereby robs victims of their right to meaningful justice. This is why it is important that the resolution requires evidence to be gathered “to the highest possible standards” and only for use in “fair and independent” criminal proceedings. The terms of the resolution expressly require that the U.N. team should also comply with international law and U.N. best practice. This sets a high bar because international law includes detailed requirements for fair trials, and U.N. best practices include a commitment to not use the death penalty.The resolution also envisages long-term international assistance to Iraq’s legal system to promote its ability to conduct fair trials. It proposes that the international experts on the U.N. team should “share knowledge and technical assistance with Iraq” and that states should do the same in order “to strengthen [Iraq’s] courts.” Such assistance measures could include training for Iraqi judges and lawyers as well as legal advice on adding international crimes to the statute books. But in the shorter term, it is difficult to envisage how Iraqi trials could meet international standards without assistance that includes adequate participation in the trials by international judges, prosecutors and trial monitors.The success of the Security Council’s initiative will ultimately depend on how it is implemented by the U.N. and the Iraqis. Much remains to be done, and the success of the investigation is far from certain. But for Nadia and thousands of other victims of ISIS’s brutality, this is a time to celebrate the fact that justice is now, finally, within reach.Amal Clooney is legal counsel to Yazidi victims of ISIS’s crimes, including Murad and victims represented by the nonprofit Yazda. For over a year, Clooney has advocated for a U.N. investigation into ISIS crimes and for prosecutions before international courts. She currently represents Yazidi women in cases against current and former ISIS members in Germany and the U.S."

Luther Strange in Alabama on Friday night.While hurling insults at his enemies in the press, Trump claimed that the news cameras posted at the back of the rally wouldn’t show the size of his crowd and would air only cropped footage of Trump standing at the lectern.“Fake news. They won’t show this,” the president said. Then, after mocking news reporters, Trump pointed to the cameras and said, “Look at the crowd. I’d love to have them show it, but they won’t show it!”The president made these remarks while many people were at home looking at the crowd as Trump made his speech on CNN, a news organization Trump has repeatedly insulted as “fake news.”The irony was not lost on many people.Trump has labeled a number of news organizations as “fake news” ― including The New York Times, ABC, NBC, CBS and The Washington Post ― but his insults toward CNN are among his most vitriolic. As part of his efforts to undermine American journalists, the president once retweeted an edited video of him beating up WWE owner Vince McMahon in 2007 ― however, in the repurposed video, Mahon’s face was replaced with a CNN logo. It doesn’t seem likely that Trump’s grudge against CNN will go away any time soon.So when Trump made the call that the news cameras wouldn’t be airing the size of his crowd, CNN made sure to let him know they did.Strange, an appointee to the Senate, will face Roy Moore in the Republican primary runoff Tuesday for a special election."

21,GREEN,The Radioactive Puppies Of Chernobyl Are Finally Getting The Help They Need,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puppies-chernobyl_us_59c694f9e4b0cdc77331a46f,The dogs are descendants of those left behind after the 1986 nuclear disaster.,2017-09-23,"Stray puppies play in an abandoned, partially-completed cooling tower inside the exclusion zone at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on August 18, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c697011a00002400f082dd.jpeg?cache=sY0BsDtOJT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A viral video this week sheds light on a heart-rending situation: The radioactive puppies and dogs of Chernobyl.After the catastrophic 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what’s now northern Ukraine, many people forced to evacuate the surrounding area left their pets behind, thinking they’d be able to return in a few days. Instead, soldiers were dispatched to shoot the abandoned animals.But some survived. And hundreds of dogs that now roam the area around Chernobyl are believed to be their descendants.“Puppies of Chernobyl,” a short documentary uploaded to YouTube by filmmaker Drew Scanlon, shows a series of adorable puppies and dogs in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone — a 1,000-square-mile area around the nuclear plant where access is strictly limited.Workers at the plant, tourists and some others are allowed in, but only under tight government control. Several hundred people, mostly elderly former residents, also have moved back into their villages over the years, against official orders.Scanlon says in the video that officials forbade him from petting any of the puppies because of the hazards posed by radioactive particles on their fur.

Several hundred people, mostly elderly former residents, also have moved back into their villages over the years, against official orders.Scanlon says in the video that officials forbade him from petting any of the puppies because of the hazards posed by radioactive particles on their fur.

23,HEALTHY LIVING,How Bacteria Could Protect Tumors From Anticancer Drugs,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-bacteria-could-protect-tumors-from-anticancer-drugs_us_59c516f7e4b0f2df5e83adad,Cancers have unwitting allies: the healthy cells that surround them.,2017-09-22,"<p>Bacteria, in green, inside a pancreatic cancer cell</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c51752190000150056526d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ed YongCancers have unwitting allies: the healthy cells that surround them. Several groups of scientists have now found that normal cells can inadvertently release substances that shield their malignant neighbors from anticancer drugs. That would explain why even targeted therapies — smart drugs that are meant to hit the specific genetic faults behind various cancers—sometimes stumble right out of the gate. When pitted against isolated cancer cells in laboratory tests, they perform as expected. But when pitted against actual tumors, which enjoy a kind of innate resistance because of the healthy cells around them, the drugs can fail.But at least half of the cells in the human body are not human.Every person is a seething colony of microbes — a collection of tens of trillions of bacteria and other microscopic organisms that live in and on our bodies. And a team of researchers, led by Ravid Straussman from the Weizmann Institute of Science and Todd Golub from Harvard Medical School, have shown that some of these bacteria can also shield tumors from anticancer drugs.RELATED: The FDA Approves a Landmark Cancer DrugBack in 2012, Straussman and Golub’s team grew dozens of types of cancer cells together with dozens of types of healthy cells, and found hundreds of combinations where the latter protected the former to some degree against chemotherapy. But one particular interaction was especially dramatic: A lineage of skin cells from one individual could completely protect pancreatic cancer cells from gemcitabine — a frontline drug that’s used to treat this stubborn disease.“We could pour on more and more gemcitabine — ten times more than was needed to kill the cancers — and the skin cells from this woman were enough to protect them,” Straussman recalls. Even the liquid in which the skin cells had grown was enough to protect cancers from gemcitabine. Clearly, the skin cells were secreting some kind of chemical that neutralized the drug. But what was it? A protein? A piece of DNA? The team spent years trying to identify the mystery molecule, to no avail. “We did tons of experiments and they led us nowhere,” says Straussman. “It didn’t make any sense.”They finally worked out what was happening when they filtered the liquid — and completely removed its ability to protect tumors. Even filter paper with very large pores, through which most molecules could easily fit, had this effect. That’s when they realized that they weren’t dealing with a molecule at all. They were dealing with a microbe.RELATED: The Cancer Patient Taking On High Drug PricesThe team, including Straussman’s student Leore Geller, showed that a bacterium called Mycoplasma hyorhinis had infected the skin cells. If they killed it off with antibiotics, the cells could no longer rescue cancers from chemo. And if they added the bacterium to mice that were suffering from tumors, the rodents became resistant to gemcitabine.It turns out that Mycoplasma hyorhinis has an enzyme called CDD that can dull gemcitabine’s sting by converting it into another inactive chemical. And it’s not alone. One in every nine known species of bacteria has a version of CDD with the same ability. And some of these drug-defusing bacteria exist within the actual tumors of people with pancreatic cancer.The team showed that by checking biopsies from the tumors of 113 pancreatic cancer patients, as well as samples from 20 healthy pancreases taken from organ donors. Just 15 percent of the healthy organs contained traces of bacterial DNA, compared to 76 percent of the tumor samples. And while bacterial DNA could just have come from dead cells, the team also saw whole intact bacteria within the tumors. They treated the samples with glowing antibodies designed to latch onto bacterial molecules, and then looked through a microscope. And there they were: bacteria, nestled among — or sometimes within — the cancer cells.RELATED: The Man Who Blew The Door Off The Microbial WorldThe bacteria in the tumors were a motley crew of varied species, and Mycoplasma wasn’t among them. But almost all of these microbes had the CDD enzyme, and almost all of them could neutralize gemcitabine.Straussman thinks that these bacteria could reach the pancreas through two different routes. The pancreas secretes hormones and digestive enzymes into the gut, and microbes could reach it by traveling in the opposite direction. Alternatively, they could travel via the blood. Bacteria enter our bloodstream all the time, leaking through from our guts, mouths, and other organs. Typically, the immune system takes care of these interlopers, but tumors are weird places where the immune system is suppressed and blood vessels are unusually leaky. They could easily act as refuges for wayward bacteria.“It would be naïve to think that antibiotics would cure these patients,” Straussman says. For a start, microbes would be just one of the many hurdles to successfully treating pancreatic cancer. Courses of antibiotics might also take out bacteria in other parts of the body, and some studies have shown that certain cancer drugs depend on the presence of such microbes. And finally, you’d likely need to administer antibiotics for a long time to kill off the bacteria lurking within a pancreatic tumor. “You’d get antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, and you reallydon’t want those in patients,” Straussman says. A better solution, he says, would be to look for molecules that can block the CDD enzyme, and stop the bacteria from neutralizing gemcitabine.Other scientists will need to replicate this work to see if they can detect the same bacteria in these kinds of tumors. In studies of this kind, there’s always the nagging possibility that the microbes in question could have come from equipment, the researchers’ bodies, or the laboratory environment, rather than from the actual tumors. “Contamination is a hazard in this work; this is an important concern,” says Libusha Kelly from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.And even if the microbes are there, it’s not clear if they would neutralize gemcitabine to the degree the researchers saw in the lab, or if they would actually make a difference to a person’s treatment. Microbes or no, gemcitabine or no, pancreatic cancer is still a notoriously difficult disease to treat. “Many different microbial enzymes have the capacity to metabolize drugs,” Kelly says. “What we don’t understand is how often this potential is actually realized in a way that influences treatment outcomes.”Still, “the study reminds us that the tumor microenvironment consists of more than just human cells,” says Emily Balskus from Harvard University. There are microbes too, and variations in these communities could explain why some people respond well to treatments and others do not. “We can’t fully understand human health and disease without considering these organisms.”“This work could also have implications for cancer drug development and cancer therapy,” Balskus adds. Doctors might make different decisions about how to treat a patient based on the microbes that are found in or near their tumors. And researchers might develop new ways of treating cancer by targeting these microbes instead of the cancer cells directly.“It’s not just pancreatic cancer and it’s not just gemcitabine,” Straussman says. “There are bacteria in tumors that we never knew bacteria were present in — and that fact has broad implications. These microbes might influence so many other hallmarks of cancer.” Do they affect a patient’s response to immunotherapy — treatments that stimulate the immune system? Do they influence cancer stem cells — the cells that generate the bulk of a tumor? Do they influence metastasis — the process through which cancers spread through the body?“Every buzzword you can think of in cancer ... how are they affected by bacteria in tumors?” says Straussman. “My team is exploring many of these directions, but we’re just starting.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Why Happy People Cheat, The First White President"

Please pray for his speedy recovery,” she wrote online.After serving in the Kansas legislature, Dole was elected to the U.S House of Representatives in 1960 and then the Senate in 1968, where he was re-elected four times.Dole twice served as Senate Republican leader and earned a reputation as an effective legislator who was well liked among Democrats as well as Republicans for his ability to build coalitions.Dole was also part of four unsuccessful presidential campaigns. In 1976, he was President Gerald Ford’s vice presidential choice, but that ticket lost to Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale.Dole ran for president in 1980 but lost the Republican nomination to Ronald Reagan and eight years later Republicans chose George H.W. Bush over him. Dole won the Republican nomination in 1996 but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Bill Clinton.(Reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Tom Brown)"

He must report to Congress by mid-October.The deal was signed two years ago and approved by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif. In exchange for bans on developing nuclear materials, most sanctions were lifted. Then the 15-member UN Security Council voted to accept it.With the exception of Israel, Washington has little support. At a closed meeting on Wednesday of the signatories, all told the United States no one supported its position.Not worth the paperIn an apparent reference to North Korea, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said, “This is not only about Iran.”“For which state would refrain from developing its own nuclear programs if it turns out that negotiated agreements…are not worth the paper they are written on?” he told the General Assembly on Thursday,Federica Mogherini, the foreign affairs official for the European Union who chaired the Wednesday meeting, said everyone had told the United States, represented by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Ambassador Nikki Haley, there would be no renegotiation.“The international community cannot afford dismantling an agreement that is working and delivering,” she said after the session. “We already have one nuclear potential nuclear crisis — that means we do not need to go into a second one.”Them, not usAhh, that was them, not us, the Americans told their counterparts, diplomats said, referring to the Obama administration. This a new administration and a new situation.France’s president, Emanuel Macron, apparently wanted to find a way out for Trump. While saying the Iran deal had to be preserved in its current state, he proposed discussions with Tehran on its ballistic missile program, its role in the Middle East and what happens after some provisions of the deal expire in 2025.Mogherini also said that issues out of the scope of the agreement could be tackled in other forums.In a lively news conference following his speech to the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned that any breach of the agreement, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), could allow his oil-rich country to resume its uranium enrichment program for its nuclear reactor. Now it is forced to import the metal from Russia. He reiterated that Iran would never build a nuclear bomb.“Either the JCPOA will remain as is in its entirety, or it will no longer exist. There will be absolutely no changes, no alteration, nothing done to the current framework of the current JCPOA.”Corrupt DictatorshipTrump during his campaign and in his General Assembly speech not only disparaged the deal but the entire Tehran government.“The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy,” he said. “It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are, in fact, its own people.”In answer to questions, Rouhani said he saw no reason to speak to Trump on other issues. “Before anything we are waiting for Mr. Trump to issue an apology to the people of Iran.”The agreement, negotiated mainly by former Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran’s Zarif, took two years of pouring over each word. Left unsaid were Zarif’s efforts to sell the deal to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and the country’s powerful Revolutionary Guard.Rouhani said that if the United States breaks its commitment no other government would negotiate with Washington. “A government that chooses to trample upon her legal and legitimate international commitments – a conversation or negotiation with such a government would be a waste of time. “"

While this week’s announcement of a $32 million aid package,2017-09-22,"<p>Over 15,000 Rohingyas have fled their burning villages each day</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c519901a00001400f0808d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This Article is Co-Authored by US Ambassador Osman Siddique & Samier MansurAs world leaders converged upon New York City for this week’s UN General Assembly, more than 420,000 Rohingya refugees traversed the monsoon rains and bloodied fields of Myanmar into Bangladesh’s makeshift and overcrowded refugee camps. Their malnourished and disfigured bodies tell the stories of starvation, torture and rape at the hands of Myanmar’s security forces since the latest round of violence broke out three weeks ago.For those who weren’t able to flee in time, their bullet-riddled bodies (including those of children) have washed up on the banks of the Naf River, a natural border between the two nations. Since late August, thousands of Rohingya homes have been razed to the ground, and between 1,000-3,000 have been killed in what the UN, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch have all called in stark terms nothing short of “ethnic cleansing.”Any hope that Nobel Peace Laureate and de-facto head of state, Aung San Suu Kyi will intervene to halt the violence diminishes by the day. World leaders, including fellow Nobel laureates, have appealed to her to help end the violence, yet despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary she has labeled the coverage “fake news.” This blanket denial has provided Myanmar’s powerful military leadership the necessary political cover to carry out what observers are calling the final stages of a “slow-burning genocide” against the Rohingya population.Four decades of systematic and sustained persecution have rendered the Rohingya the world’s most persecuted minority, and the world’s largest stateless group. Almost half of their total population is now dispersed as refugees around the broader region. These developments have escalated what was once an internal conflict into a global concern.The U.S. can play a more engaged role in this unfolding situation. While this week’s announcement of a $32 million aid package combined with an appeal for peace by the State Department is a good start; the U.S. has specific specific humanitarian, political, security, and economic interests to take on a more sustained and assertive role to help bring about a sustainable resolution to the issue.First, at a time when U.S. global leadership has been questioned by the international community, a more engaged response to the Rohingya issue would reinforce the U.S.’ values-driven commitment to a rules-based order. There is no better opportunity to demonstrate this than at the heels of the UNGA where Vice President Mike Pence rightly said on the matter, “Keeping the peace requires more than peacekeeping — it requires action, reform, and lastly it also requires a willingness to call out senseless attacks on innocent people around the world.” It’s time to walk that talk.Second, the U.S. and the world community have vested interests in a politically stable and democratic Myanmar. Suu Kyi’s inability to intervene in the current crisis is a clear indication that national authority remains beyond her control. The ongoing maltreatment of minorities at the hands of the military and political leadership runs contrary to pluralistic and democratic values. Not only do they stifle democratic gains that the U.S. has long supported in the region, they firmly entrench Myanmar’s military junta as the ultimate power broker of the nation.Third, the current situation has the potential to inflame internal and regional hostilities. Over the last 50 years, the Rohingya have been denied the most basic of human rights. Last month, the Anann Commission accurately diagnosed that unless the “legitimate grievances” of the Rohingya people are addressed, they will become increasingly prone to radicalization. Once the current humanitarian phase is over, there is high risk of the situation unfolding into a cross-border security concern.Bilateral tensions have also flared with Bangladesh bearing the burden of Myanmar’s aggressive military campaign. The small nation has absorbed ― in an unprecedented display of humanitarian concern ― the economic and social impact that comes with hundreds of thousands of fleeing refugees. Further escalation comes from Myanmar’s repeated violations of Bangladesh’s air space with its helicopters and drones. The current situation is not sustainable. An expeditious resolution can help prevent the deterioration of regional relations, radicalization along the border, and miscalculation among security forces of both nations.Fourth, Myanmar’s economic potential makes it a valuable partner in the region. World powers are attracted to its vast energy reserves, access to a new 50-million-person market in the process of reform, and geographic link to the Indian Ocean ― one of the world’s busiest hubs of international trade. Despite this potential, the reality is that no nation ― not even Myanmar ― will be able to realize these benefits if it continues to choose a path of internal conflict and regional destabilization.As we speak, 15,000 refugees continue to cross the border daily. If there is a lesson to be learned from recent history’s experiences with ethnic cleansing ― from Darfur, Kosovo, Rwanda and Bangladesh ― it is this: condemnations, unless backed with concrete action have the tendency to fall on deaf-ears; or worse, quicken the pace of brutality and devastation.Nearly 50 years ago, the U.S. turned a blind eye as approximately 2-3 million Bangladeshis were massacred in a genocide launched by its Cold War ally, Pakistan. The people of South Asia have not forgotten this sad episode; and the US has the opportunity to set the record straight when it comes to its moral power and commitment to human rights in the region.There are four steps the U.S. can take in this regard: 1) Keep sustained pressure on Naypyidaw to end hostilities, and allow in humanitarian observers into Rakhine province to maintain the peace; 2) Offer to mediate bilateral talks between Bangladesh and Myanmar to support a safe, orderly, and expeditious repatriation of all Rohingya refugees who have fled the violence (not just those whom Myanmar considers its citizens); 3) Call for official recognition of the Rohingya as protected citizens of Myanmar; and 4) Ensure Myanmar’s commitment to implement the Annan Commission, which contains meaningful long-term recommendations for peace and national inclusion of the Rohingya people.Time is of essence, and there are enough pressing interests for U.S. to take a firm stand against ethnic cleansing and help set a trajectory for lasting peace and stability in the region."

They cannot rely on foreign support. Tell your citizens they should instead take an active role in restoring peace to Afghanistan themselves. Tell them they can do this. Tell them that your government will help them.Too much time and energy is wasted – by Afghanistan’s political leaders, educated elite and the public itself – urging the international community to rush to their rescue. When our leaders constantly spout this idea that Afghanistan needs more foreign troops, money and assistance, it becomes woven into the national psyche.President Ghani recently told a citizen gathering in the Paktia province that he has finally convinced world leaders that the war in Afghanistan is a foreign project that requires foreign solutions. He seemed to suggest that the world will save us all.These kinds of remarks are more suited to a politician running for office. We need strong leadership from an experienced president who can inspire citizens with a sense of pride and ownership in their own land.Peace will not come from outside the borders; it must arise from inside the villages of Afghanistan itself. Garnering international sympathy may give war-weary Afghans temporary solace, but relying on assistance from abroad is a fool’s errand. The Afghan president can take a cue from the 20th-Century American journalist Walter Lippmann, who famously remarked that a good leader is someone who tells his people what their responsibilities are.Here is what he should tell his people:Historically, tribal etiquette has been the foundation of order in Afghanistan. For centuries, ethnic tribes fended for themselves, keeping the peace and keeping their territory safe without the help of large armies.During the Russian invasion of the 1980s, it was villagers and ordinary people who stood against the Soviet army and eventually prevailed. During the past 16 years of U.S. presence in Afghanistan, villagers and citizens in several areas defended their turf without assistance. In the Urgun District of Paktia, citizen governance alone prohibits the Taliban from infiltrating.During the late 1980s, the Taliban easily took control of Afghanistan because they promised to clean up the mess the mujahedeen had created. But they have long since lost support of the citizenry because they are seen as lackeys of foreigners who have no agenda for Afghanistan but to destabilize the elected government of Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah.Ghani should spend more time on closing the gap between his people and their government. Public support is the key to peace and his own future.In 1996, more than a decade before the Taliban was declared a terrorist organization, a group of them came to San Diego, California, where I lived at the time. They were asking Afghan-Americans to urge U.S. congressmen to recognize and support the Taliban. My father, a retired government civil servant, asked the Taliban lobbyists if they have the support of the Afghan people. “If you do,” he said, “then you don’t need our support.” To this day, my late father’s words remain relevant.Realizing the importance of public participation, the U.S. Defense Department has approved the hiring of more civilians to work under the command of the Afghan army to secure cleared areas. The decision was welcomed by some Afghan Army officers.One ex-Afghan Army general – now a member of Parliament – told TOLO news the army “can’t be on every street corner or in every village and district … Local police and citizens should be responsible for keeping their areas safe after they have been cleared by the army.”He is right, but a dominant expectation remains that the government will guard and protect every public and private entity all the time. This becomes clear when we hear the outcry after incidents such as the recent ISIS attack that killed 20 at a Shiite mosque in Kabul.The government cannot assign army and security forces to protect every school, mosque, and shop. I suggest Afghans consider assigning teams of civilian volunteers to work with law enforcement, like the Zharandoy, a group similar to the Boy Scouts of America. They could work in conjunction with law enforcement to patrol streets and borders, promoting safety.This policy of waiting for foreign and domestic governments to solve everything, then blaming them when they fail, is fruitless. It only feeds a culture of dependency that prevents the country from taking any major steps toward achieving a lasting peace.Waiting for peace to be imported from foreign lands reminds me of the Samuel Beckett play “Waiting for Godot,” in which the characters spend all their time waiting for someone who never comes.With limited capital and human skills, it will not be easy. But that’s no excuse for Afghanistan’s government and citizens to eschew their responsibilities. To twist the famous line from U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961: Ask not what governments can do for you. Ask what you can do for yourselves."

The cost of the trips exceeded $300,000, Politico reported. Charmaine Yoest, an HHS spokeswoman, defended the cost in a statement, saying Price was justified in taking the flights because he wanted to hear from many Americans.“This is Secretary Price, getting outside of D.C., making sure he is connected with the real American people,” she said in a statement to The Washington Post. “Wasting four hours in an airport and having the secretary cancel his event is not a good use of taxpayer money.”But Politico found that Price could have used a commercial plane for many of the trips on which he used a private jet. For example, the outlet reported that HHS paid $17,760 for a chartered flight from Washington to Nashville, Tennessee, on June 6 when there were commercial flights available for just a few hundred dollars. Price also used a private plane to fly to the swanky Aspen Ideas Festival in June, a trip Politico estimated to have cost more than $7,000.Price began using private air travel after a delayed commercial flight made him miss a public event that his office had planned, according to the Post. Price isn’t the only Trump Cabinet official to use private air travel for government work. The Associated Press reported that Linda McMahon, the head of the Small Business Administration, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have also traveled by private aircraft. A Department of Education spokesperson told the AP that DeVos pays for all of her own travel, and an SBA spokesman said McMahon paid for the difference between private and commercial services out of pocket. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and financier, requested a government plane to take him and his wife on their honeymoon, but ultimately did not get one. Even White House staff seemed annoyed at Price’s travel as Republicans are pushing for legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act.“No one is quite sure what [Price] is doing,” a senior White House official told Politico. “You look at this week, we’re doing a last final push trying to get this over the finish line, and he’s nowhere to be found.” The HHS Inspector General’s office said Friday it would investigate Price’s travel. “OIG is conducting a review of Secretary Price’s Federal travel using chartered aircraft. The review focuses on whether the travel complied with Federal Travel Regulations, but may encompass other issues related to the travel,” Tesia Williams, a spokeswoman for the office, told the Post. “We take this matter very seriously, and when questions arose about potentially inappropriate travel, we immediately began assessing the issue. I can confirm that work is underway and will be completed as soon as possible.”"

But the repeated raids caused him major “inconvenience” and cost the lives of four of his guard dogs, which escaped from his compound through the fence and ended up being struck by cars out on the road.Cerveró wants to build a replacement wall, but says he’s hit an impasse with the authorities, who ruled the wall must be constructed at least 82 feet from the boundary fence — which would mean him losing another large chunk of his land.The provincial government has not commented on his new security measures."

Local officials said the prison lies within a security complex but that only prison guards were present during the air strike.“This building is used by Houthi militia and the forces of the deposed president as a command and control center for their military operations,” a statement by the coalition said, referring to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, a Houthi ally.“The coalition forces’ leadership stresses that targeting protocols and procedures were followed fully,” the statement said.The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Yemen’s Houthi movement since March 2015. It wants to restore the internationally recognized president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was driven into exile by the Iran-allied Houthis in late 2014.A Reuters witness at the security complex said the building was destroyed and medics pulled about 17 bodies away, many of them missing limbs. Others remained trapped under the rubble.One of the strikes directly targeted the building, the witness said, bringing it down over the heads of the prisoners. Two others hit the gate of the complex and nearby administration buildings.The air attack was one of the deadliest among thousands of bombings. The attacks have largely failed to dislodge the Houthis from the capital, Sanaa, but have repeatedly hit schools, markets, hospitals and homes, killing many civilians.HADI REJECTS PEACE PLANRights groups have said the raids may amount to war crimes, but an investigative body set up by the coalition largely defended its methods in an August report, which concluded that Houthi rebels regularly deploy to civilian sites.The Houthis deny this, and a top official in the movement criticized the United Nations and the United States, the Saudis’ key ally and arms supplier, for not doing enough to hold the kingdom accountable for its air strikes.“We condemn the position of the international community and the U.N. for providing cover for the crimes of Saudi Arabia against Yemenis, and they are subject to the wishes of America,” Saleh al-Samad said in a statement late on Saturday.The bombing may signal a renewed outbreak of violence a day after Hadi rejected a new U.N. peace proposal, saying the deal would only be a path to more war and destruction.Speaking after a meeting with U.N. envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed in Riyadh, Hadi said the agreement would “reward the rebels and penalize the Yemeni people and legitimacy,” according to the government-controlled Saba news agency.According to a copy of the proposal seen by Reuters, the plan would sideline Hadi and set up a government of less divisive figures.Hadi’s opponents accuse him of commanding only a small support base in Yemen and of being unable to bring its warring factions together, since he invited the Saudi-led coalition to intervene in the civil war."

While its share of the vote tripled from the last election in 2013, it came in only third with 15 percent.Instead, voters appeared to have recognized efforts to stabilize the economy after its 2008 collapse. The center-right Independence Party, which shared power in the outgoing government, won the largest share of the vote with 29 percent.No party has won an outright majority and President Gudni Johannesson has yet to hand the mandate to the party that will be tasked with forming the next government.Poet Birgitta Jonsdottir, who leads the Pirate Party, told Reuters she was happy with the result. “Our internal predictions showed 10 to 15 percent, so this is at the top of the range. We knew that we would never get 30 percent,” she said.Supporters of the broader pirate movement from 15 countries, along with ex-campaign workers for former U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, had visited Reykjavik to back the Icelandic party, hoping that it would have a shot at forming the next government and deal another blow to mainstream politicians.Both the Independence Party and the Pirate Party, whose founders call themselves “hacktivists,” have so far ruled out working together, though this could change during negotiations in the days to come. The Left-Greens came second with 16 percent.MESSY COALITIONIndependence Party leader Bjarni Benediktsson, current finance minister, said: “It would be natural that we are a leading party in the next government.”His party has promised to lower taxes and keep the economic recovery on track. Fueled by a tourism boom, economic growth has recovered since the banking crisis and is expected to hit 4.3 percent this year.In a tight race, the newly-established Vidreisn, or Reform Party, could become kingmaker. The pro-European, liberal party which won around 10 percent of votes in its first election has not yet taken sides.The senior coalition partner in the outgoing government, the Progressive Party, saw its support dive to 11.5 percent.It was hurt badly when Gunnlaugsson resigned as prime minister in April after documents leaked from a Panamanian law firm linked him to an offshore company that held millions of dollars in debt from failed Icelandic banks.The Independence Party will hold 21 seats in the 63 member parliament, up two. Representation by the Left-Green Movement rose three to 10 seats, while the Pirate Party has gained seven to 10 seats."

A man was waiting there. He was a production manager for Waha, a subsidiary of Libya’s state-owned oil company.The Waha official handed Mitchell a thick envelope. Inside were more than 100 pages of internal Waha documents about a $45 million environmental contract to clean up oil-polluted rivers in the Libyan desert. The packet included several bids from Unaoil’s competitors and detailed information about how Waha would pick a winner. The man walked Mitchell through the documents for about a half hour ― and hinted he expected something for his trouble. The next morning, Mitchell called Ata, Cyrus and Saman Ahsani, the father and two sons who ran Unaoil. They were pleased. That afternoon, Martin Abram, a Unaoil manager, met Mitchell at the Unaoil staffhouse to deliver an envelope full of cash. Mitchell didn’t count the money, but the envelope was stuffed thick with U.S. dollars. Around midnight, he drove to the Waha manager’s home to hand over the envelope. The man thanked him and said he expected a 5-10 percent kickback ― about $2-4 million ― if Unaoil won the contract. Then they had coffee. It’s no secret that Libya’s oil industry under dictator Muammar Gaddafi was rife with corruption. People assume that bribery is commonplace in many parts of the world. But it’s almost unprecedented for a person who actually paid a bribe to speak about it publicly, let alone name the individual who allegedly pocketed the money. (The Huffington Post and Fairfax Media are withholding the Waha manager’s name because he could not be reached for comment.)In March, HuffPost and Fairfax Media, citing more than 100,000 leaked emails, revealed that Unaoil had repeatedly bribed government officials in corruption-prone regions to secure contracts for its multinational corporate clients. Law enforcement quickly raided Unaoil’s office in Monaco and interviewed its top executives. The FBI, the United Kingdom’s Serious Fraud Office, and law enforcement agencies in Australia and Iraq have opened investigations. Waha did not respond to multiple requests for comment made through several channels.The Ahsanis and Unaoil deny any wrongdoing. “Although there is a great deal that the Company would like to say about the subject matter of this article, there is an investigation on-going,” a Unaoil spokesman told HuffPost in a statement. “Any allegations of corruption are denied. It would be inappropriate to make further comment at this juncture but the Company looks forward to speaking out on this in the fullness of time.”Until now, no one else from Unaoil has spoken out.But Lindsey Mitchell has a story to tell. “Is it trying to get rid of it off my conscience?” he asked in a recent interview with HuffPost and Fairfax Media. Perhaps, but “it’s time for someone like me, that’s been there, done that, to help educate the public on what happens out there.”Mitchell grew up in a small rural town on the sprawling prairies of Canada. “It was like Nebraska,” he said. Most people, including his father, worked in the oil industry. His dad didn’t make great money, but it was enough to care for a family of six kids. They went to church at least once a week, and sometimes twice. When he was 16, Mitchell had a falling out with his father and left home. He soon found a job on an oil rig. Some days, he would wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. and drive to four different rigs, covering over 300 miles. Eventually, he was hired by a drilling fluid engineering company, which paid for him to go to college. Mitchell was a “holy terror” in his early 20s, he recalled. “I liked to bar fight a lot.” He met his wife in a pool hall. “It was a gift,” Mitchell said of their chance encounter. “The big guy upstairs was matchmaking.” But she gave him an ultimatum: focus harder on his career or forget about a future with her. They later married and had three kids. After more than a decade as a drilling fluid engineer, Mitchell started a company with one of his brothers. They eventually sold it for a profit. By 1998, the oil business had slowed in North America. Mitchell applied for a position with an oilfield services company in Saudi Arabia. About three months into that job, he said, he caught his first glimpse of corruption in the industry.Every couple of weeks, Mitchell and a company executive would go to the bank and meet with the manager in his office. They’d drink Turkish coffee and smoke cigarettes. One day, the visit dragged on for more than two hours. Eventually, Mitchell suggested they get moving. But he was told to wait. A man entered the office holding a cardboard box filled with cash.Mitchell realized his colleague was preparing to meet somebody to pay a bribe. “When you’re in the industry, you hear about these things,” he said. “But you don’t really witness it until you actually get into these countries, and you figure it out pretty quick.”After leaving Saudi Arabia, Mitchell took a job as a field operations manager for Baker Hughes, an American company that later admitted its subsidiary paid over $4 million in bribes in connection with a project he worked on in Kazakhstan. Mitchell said he was never asked to pay any bribes while at Baker Hughes and never did.In 2003, he moved back to Canada and started his own energy services company. He figured that venture would be his last. But after the company went public, he stepped down. About a month later, an oilfield services outfit in Jordan that was looking to expand into Libya called him.It was 2006. The U.S. was lifting sanctions against Libya. “Things were looking like it was going to be booming,” Mitchell said. He accepted the offer. Over the next three years, he built relationships with some of the top players in the country’s state-owned oil industry. Eventually, Mitchell could walk into Waha’s office and meet with executives without an appointment. “Once they like you, you’re in,” he said. Even as he cultivated ties with Waha executives, however, Mitchell made a point to steer clear of work that he thought might require him to pay kickbacks. At the time, he said, the people at Waha “knew I was a straight shooter.”Mitchell headed home to Canada at the end of 2008. A few months later, he received a call from Unaoil’s founder, Ata Ahsani. Mitchell and his wife flew to Monaco for three days, meeting with the Ahsani family. He accepted a job managing Unaoil’s business development in Libya and Kazakhstan. When he took the job, Mitchell said, he didn’t know much about Unaoil. He started to worry when he realized the company had few hard assets — equipment or vehicles, for example — in Libya. It was a middleman, winning contracts for other companies. Unaoil’s main resources were its people and their relationships with government officials who made decisions about awarding contracts. Once he understood Unaoil’s business plan and met up again with Waha officials, Mitchell knew things had changed for him. “You realize that, going into this, eventually you’re going to have to pay somebody to get business,” he said. “It reminded me a lot like Saudi Arabia.” The Waha production manager called Mitchell in the summer of 2009 to arrange the parking lot meeting. That led to the first and only time Mitchell would pay a bribe, he said.The morning after he received the inside information on how to win the $45 million contract, Mitchell hesitated before relaying the information to the Ahsanis. He knew that once he made the Skype call, they would tell him to handle the payoff.The guilt set in soon after Mitchell paid the bribe. “I thought about my children,” he said. “How they would totally disrespect me. … I always preached to them about good work ethics and to be 100 percent honest in business.”If Unaoil won the Waha contract, Mitchell expected to collect as much as 2 percent of the project — nearly $1 million. But he also knew he didn’t want a reputation as a guy who paid bribes to get work. Mitchell sent his resignation letter to the Ahsanis on Aug. 31, 2009. “This has been a hard decision to make but I feel it is the right one,” he wrote. “This is non-negotiable and is not open for further discussions.” He wrote that his sudden departure was motivated mainly by a desire to spend more time with his family. But it was clear to Unaoil executives that something else was bothering him. “From the tone of your email, there seem to me to be other issues that you have with us that you are not stating,” Saman Ahsani emailed back. “Then there are the questions of our commitments to others,” he continued. “What about [the Waha official]?”“On the matter of [the Waha official],” Mitchell wrote, “well, I did my thing for Martin [Abram] and [another Unaoil employee] and did the introduction. I think [the other employee] should get in there and take care of building that relationship.”Over the next several years, the bribe weighed on Mitchell’s conscience. But he wasn’t particularly worried about getting caught, he said. Bribery was such a common practice in Libya and he had only taken part that one time. Mitchell was in Iraq for work when HuffPost and Fairfax Media published the first story about Unaoil bribery in March of this year. It took him a few days to realize that the story could have consequences for him. He was initially more interested in figuring out who had leaked Unaoil’s emails. After the company’s office was raided and the FBI and the Serious Fraud Office began investigating, Mitchell began to get nervous. “I had to make a conscious decision: Do I wait for them to come to me? Or do I reach out and try to make sure I’m the good guy in this?” Still in Iraq, Mitchell drafted a long email to his wife and their adult children. “I wanted to make sure they knew that their dad didn’t do anything wrong and I’m not going to be thrown in jail,” he said. He told his kids about the 2009 bribe. “It was an emotional time.”Mitchell met with the Serious Fraud Office in Vienna soon after. Next, two FBI agents, a Justice Department official and a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police sat down with him in a hotel room in Canada for a six-hour debriefing. U.S. law enforcement flew him to Washington, D.C., in mid-May. He turned over two Nokia mobile phones, a BlackBerry and a Mac laptop, and spent two more days outlining Unaoil’s infrastructure and business practices — including the 2009 bribe. (He also told the FBI that Muhannad Alamir, one of Unaoil’s former fixers in Libya, later helped the State Department recruit unarmed guards for the U.S. facility in Benghazi.)Mitchell was struck by how much material with his name on it — email correspondence, meeting minutes, financial spreadsheets — was in the hands of law enforcement officials. The Justice Department provided him with a letter of safe passage guaranteeing that he wouldn’t be arrested when he landed in Washington. But he hasn’t received any assurances that they won’t prosecute him.Mitchell saw Saman Ahsani earlier this year for the first time since he quit his job at Unaoil. They met at Unaoil’s office in Monaco and walked to a coffee shop a couple of blocks away. The firm had been losing contracts because of the bribery allegations, Ahsani told him. “They were in survival mode,” Mitchell said. For the past several months, Mitchell has been preparing for a backlash from former business associates who might feel betrayed by his decision to go public. “It’s been a difficult ride,” he said. But in some ways, it’s been a relief to finally tell his story. He wants people to understand how even well-intentioned individuals can become implicated in corruption. It also feels good to clear his conscience. He’s thought about his time at Unaoil a lot over the years. “Finally, I’ve got somebody I can talk to that gets it,” he said. “To finally have someone ― even the FBI and all that ― to talk to, it’s been a relief.”The Justice Department, which otherwise declined to comment, won’t say when or whether prosecutors plan to file charges against anyone involved in the Unaoil scandal. And there’s no guarantee that Mitchell won’t be charged. But he’s not too worried anymore. “From what I was told by the FBI,” he said, “they felt I was the good guy.”Nick McKenzie of Fairfax Media contributed reporting. Read his story here.

While a significant number of people in Turkey reportedly believe Gülen was behind the failed coup, the U.S. so far does not accept Turkish government information as sufficient for extradition. Gülen denies having any involvement in the coup or its planning. In his meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Bozdağ said he presented fresh evidence to back up the country’s request on the self-exiled cleric. Turkey has been battling several militant organizations domestically and internationally, including the self-proclaimed Islamic State and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or the PKK, which the U.S. deems a terrorist organization. But, none of these are as dangerous as the supporters of Gülen, according to the justice minister, who calls the group, FETO, the “Fethullah Terrorist Organization.” This, he claims, “presents a new kind of terrorism” with the degree of infiltration it has achieved in Turkish military, judiciary, police and state audit institutions. The Gülen movement has reportedly opened or inspired 160 or so charter schools in the U.S. using public funds, which are often the top performers in their towns, but Bozdağ said during a press conference in Washington Thursday that Gülen supporters, “disguise themselves as philanthropists promoting education and religion.” He alleged that Gülen schools and educators in the U.S. are used to transfer large sums of money from Turkey and asked U.S. officials to investigate this flow of money. Bozdağ labeled Gülen as “Turkey’s Osama bin Laden,” and compared the cleric’s movement to “Daesh,” an Arabic acronym for the self-proclaimed Islamic State, in blaming him for the coup attempt. He said in statements to the press that Turkey had banned 35,970 people from 124 countries from entering the country and that authorities had arrested or deported 2,800 people from 92 different nations, all of them on terrorism-related charges.Turkey has detained thousands and fired or suspended some 100,000 people in a crackdown and state of emergency following the summer putsch. But Bozdag said that “any allegations of injustice” during the purge are “being investigated thoroughly” and would be “made public immediately.”During the press conference, The WorldPost posed two questions to Bekir Bozdağ to learn about why the issue of Gülen’s extradition is so important to Turkey and what it means for the future of Turkish-American relations. A third question was then asked in private. Below are the questions and the justice minister’s answers.What would be the impact on U.S.-Turkish relations if Gülen is not extradited?When the process is still ongoing, I don’t want to talk about a perception that he will not be extradited.Of course, if the process is prolonged, or if something happens within that process, this would mean a huge blow to the relationship between Turkey and the U.S..We, as Turkish people, do not understand or accept the fact that Fethullah Gülen, who is the murderer of 241 civilians and caused the wounding of around 2,194 people, bombed the parliament with F-16 jets [and] attempted the assassination of our president, is acting freely in the U.S..We want [the] U.S. to understand us, because there is a growing anti-Americanism among Turkish people, as is observed by the representatives of the U.S. in Turkey.The possibility that no sanctions are taken against the perpetrators of such grave offenses will increase the problem.Although this is a legal process, we still believe that the U.S. will not choose a terrorist over Turkey.The purge of suspected Gulenists has been very broad. Do you believe public institutions have now been cleared of those who plotted, supported or were sympathetic to the coup?A purge of civil servants from the state for being a member of [the] Fethullah Terrorist Organization, or for having ties to it, is based on a law.Each state has the right [to seek] high loyalty to the public order when it comes to civil service.The state also has the right not to employ someone who isn’t loyal to it, or is loyal to a terrorist or terrorist organization instead of the state.The U.S. authorities, government and people will not allow a member of Daesh or other terrorist organization[s] to be employed by the U.S.. The same goes for Turkey.We cannot say that the purge is 100 percent over. We are doing it for each and every one of the terrorist organizations; it’s not confined to FETO. After the dissolving of [the] Soviet Union, many other countries that gained independence purged or cleansed those who were still attached to the Communist regime.The same example is true for Germany as well. Around 500,000 people in East Germany were dismissed from their duties after the unification. This is an example we’re seeing in all the countries. Are you satisfied now that the country is secure and ready to return to normal, or will the emergency powers remain? If so, for how long?The extension of the state of emergency has to do with the extensive process that the government is going through. We need time to take careful steps.

42,THE WORLDPOST,Turkish Justice Minister On Fethullah Gülen: 'The U.S. Will Not Choose A Terrorist Over Turkey',Ilgin Yorulmaz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-justice-minister-gulen_us_57e84b2ee4b0e28b2b54a70c,"Bekir Bozdağ, who was in the U.S. to push for the exiled cleric's extradition, also told The WorldPost Turkey's post-coup purge isn't “100 percent over.”",2016-10-30,"Bozdağ said Gulen is ""Turkey's Osama bin Laden"" while speaking to press in Washington following his meeting with Loretta Lynch.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5815521b190000ec02c2fd23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ met with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch in Washington on Wednesday to press for the extradition of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, who Turkey blames for orchestrating an attempted coup on its country on July 15.  While a significant number of people in Turkey reportedly believe Gülen was behind the failed coup, the U.S. so far does not accept Turkish government information as sufficient for extradition. Gülen denies having any involvement in the coup or its planning. In his meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Bozdağ said he presented fresh evidence to back up the country’s request on the self-exiled cleric. Turkey has been battling several militant organizations domestically and internationally, including the self-proclaimed Islamic State and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or the PKK, which the U.S. deems a terrorist organization. But, none of these are as dangerous as the supporters of Gülen, according to the justice minister, who calls the group, FETO, the “Fethullah Terrorist Organization.” This, he claims, “presents a new kind of terrorism” with the degree of infiltration it has achieved in Turkish military, judiciary, police and state audit institutions. The Gülen movement has reportedly opened or inspired 160 or so charter schools in the U.S. using public funds, which are often the top performers in their towns, but Bozdağ said during a press conference in Washington Thursday that Gülen supporters, “disguise themselves as philanthropists promoting education and religion.” He alleged that Gülen schools and educators in the U.S. are used to transfer large sums of money from Turkey and asked U.S. officials to investigate this flow of money. Bozdağ labeled Gülen as “Turkey’s Osama bin Laden,” and compared the cleric’s movement to “Daesh,” an Arabic acronym for the self-proclaimed Islamic State, in blaming him for the coup attempt. He said in statements to the press that Turkey had banned 35,970 people from 124 countries from entering the country and that authorities had arrested or deported 2,800 people from 92 different nations, all of them on terrorism-related charges.Turkey has detained thousands and fired or suspended some 100,000 people in a crackdown and state of emergency following the summer putsch. But Bozdag said that “any allegations of injustice” during the purge are “being investigated thoroughly” and would be “made public immediately.”During the press conference, The WorldPost posed two questions to Bekir Bozdağ to learn about why the issue of Gülen’s extradition is so important to Turkey and what it means for the future of Turkish-American relations. A third question was then asked in private. Below are the questions and the justice minister’s answers.What would be the impact on U.S.-Turkish relations if Gülen is not extradited?When the process is still ongoing, I don’t want to talk about a perception that he will not be extradited.Of course, if the process is prolonged, or if something happens within that process, this would mean a huge blow to the relationship between Turkey and the U.S..We, as Turkish people, do not understand or accept the fact that Fethullah Gülen, who is the murderer of 241 civilians and caused the wounding of around 2,194 people, bombed the parliament with F-16 jets [and] attempted the assassination of our president, is acting freely in the U.S..We want [the] U.S. to understand us, because there is a growing anti-Americanism among Turkish people, as is observed by the representatives of the U.S. in Turkey.The possibility that no sanctions are taken against the perpetrators of such grave offenses will increase the problem.Although this is a legal process, we still believe that the U.S. will not choose a terrorist over Turkey.The purge of suspected Gulenists has been very broad. Do you believe public institutions have now been cleared of those who plotted, supported or were sympathetic to the coup?A purge of civil servants from the state for being a member of [the] Fethullah Terrorist Organization, or for having ties to it, is based on a law.Each state has the right [to seek] high loyalty to the public order when it comes to civil service.The state also has the right not to employ someone who isn’t loyal to it, or is loyal to a terrorist or terrorist organization instead of the state.The U.S. authorities, government and people will not allow a member of Daesh or other terrorist organization[s] to be employed by the U.S.. The same goes for Turkey.We cannot say that the purge is 100 percent over. We are doing it for each and every one of the terrorist organizations; it’s not confined to FETO. After the dissolving of [the] Soviet Union, many other countries that gained independence purged or cleansed those who were still attached to the Communist regime.The same example is true for Germany as well. Around 500,000 people in East Germany were dismissed from their duties after the unification. This is an example we’re seeing in all the countries. Are you satisfied now that the country is secure and ready to return to normal, or will the emergency powers remain? If so, for how long?The extension of the state of emergency has to do with the extensive process that the government is going through. We need time to take careful steps. If there are mistakes, we need time to investigate them. There is, however, no state of emergency with the normal flow of life.

43,POLITICS,Why the Media's Double Standard On Clinton’s Emails?,"J.H. Snider, ContributorPresident of iSolon.org",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-medias-double-standard-covering-hillary-clintons_us_58164107e4b096e87069675f,"Scandals are most interesting when they involve the rich, powerful, and famous.",2016-10-30,<p>Illustrative national media coverage of the Hillary Clinton email scandal.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58164dcf170000fe025baa4b.png?ops=crop_0_35_1391_675%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"During the last two years, media of all stripes have regularly covered Hillary Clinton’s email practices. But widespread similar email practices by local government officials have been treated, at best, with a yawn; at worst, by sweeping them under the rug.The Media’s Economic Calculus Media economics helps explain this double standard, which unfairly harms Clinton because it treats local government officials with kid gloves.Let’s start with the revenue side of the media’s economic calculus. Covering a presidential election has huge economies of scale, as the audience for a presidential election is the entire nation: some 325 million people. In contrast, there are 89,000 local governments in the United States. Thoroughly investigating an email scandal at the local and national levels may cost the same but the market for that information is much smaller locally.According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the ratio of reporters to employment in Washington, DC (3.7 per thousand jobs) is more than ten times the average of all states in the United States (.30 per thousand jobs). The 2,500 DC reporters primarily cover only the federal government (albeit a very large government) whereas the remaining 37,500 reporters primarily cover the 89,000 local governments. And the DC reporters also earn more than twice as much—an average salary of $77,870 (highest in the United States) versus $36,360 in other states.Alas, public attention is skewed to national issues. Scandals are most interesting when they involve the rich, powerful, and famous. Virtually no one is interested in the email practices of tens of thousands of obscure bureaucrats such as assistant school superintendents and political appointees in towns and counties.Now for the cost side. At the national but not local levels of government, the media have vigorous expert and well-funded independent entities subsidizing their fact finding. These include government entities such as the FBI, inspectors general, and the staffs of Congressional oversight committees. And they include nonprofits with the patience, money, and legal skills to bring effective court cases. These independent executive, legislative, and judicial branch entities all have special legal rights to fact find, such as subpoena power and the threat of bringing perjury charges for lying, that the press lacks.Better media coverage at the national level, in turn, leads to a virtuous cycle, as it stimulates the independent entities to redouble their fact-finding efforts.Illustrating this economic calculus, most local political communities don’t have any, let alone three (Fox, CNN, or MSBN), 24-hour cable TV news channels covering them.The Court of Public Opinion vs The Court of LawMedia attention (”The Court of Public Opinion”) is critical to the enforcement of laws regarding government email practices because violating most such laws involves at most negligible legal penalties . Even Clinton, who was subject to much stricter email retention rules than most local government officials, has not been indicted (and is not expected to be indicted) either for using private email for government purposes or not being fully responsive to Freedom of Information Act requests for her official email correspondence. A caveat is that sending and receiving classified information on Clinton’s private email system could be subject to substantial legal penalties. But even here local government officials routinely keep legally mandated confidential information (e.g., personnel records) in their private email systems without any worries of legal punishment for doing so.Clinton has been hurt politically in the email scandal less because of what she did than the perception that she covered up what she did. But at the local level of government very few officials have to worry about being caught lying red-handed about their email practices. For in order to be caught lying red-handed someone has to have not only the motivation but resources to seek the truth in an effective way. The result is a vicious cycle because without an effective mechanism to investigate the truth reporters aren’t going to ask questions in the first place.The Politics of Fixing the ProblemI live in a state (Maryland) and county (Anne Arundel County) where Clinton-like email practices are rampant. Yet I have not seen a single mainstream local media outlet either investigate or condemn such practices. Last year a bill with seven co-sponsors was introduced into the Maryland General Assembly to prevent Clinton like email abuses in the executive branch of Maryland local government. It was introduced after I published an op-ed condemning such practices in the Baltimore Sun. Local government officials discreetly lobbied against it via their powerful trade association, the Maryland Association of Counties. The result was that in the House it couldn’t even get a committee vote. No press reported on the bill.Clearly, we aren’t going to fix the problem of Hillary Clinton-like email practices unless the media shine a light on those practices. But preserving Clinton-like email practices may be as important politically for many high level local executive branch officials as preserving the right to gerrymander is for incumbent state legislators. Regardless of partisan affiliation, control over information is power, and high level local government officials want to keep that power by controlling who sees their official emails. If so, we can expect their continued behind-the-scenes opposition to effective steps to prevent Clinton like email practices.RecommendationsThere are many culprits that have been fingered for America’s dysfunctional democracy. Winner-take-all media economics, as illustrated in the Clinton email scandal, should surely be one of the top culprits. American media have become driven by high profit national investigative reporting at the expense of local investigative reporting.Only by passing legislation to make it more cost-effective for media to cover local email abuses is there any realistic hope of media covering such abuses. The primary focus should be on incentivizing and empowering independent government watchdogs—local analogs to the FBI and inspectors general—to do the fact-finding on the media’s (and public’s) behalf.Local media may not be able to afford investigating email abuses by local government officials. But they should at least cover and support legislative efforts that would enable them to cost-effectively cover such abuses in the future."

But now this group has embraced Trump as some type of savior who they believe will use his bull-in-a-china-shop style and business know-how to fix the broken system and lift America’s workers. Struggling blue-collar workers often voice disdain for billionaires, but millions of them have embraced Trump—maybe because they like his macho personality, his shock jock rhetoric and his defiant challenge to a system that they feel has been rigged against them.With wages stuck in a rut much of the past decade, with thousands of factories shuttered and with Washington gridlocked on issue after issue, it’s understandable that many workers would embrace a brash outsider. Trump has wooed and wowed white working-class voters by shrewdly focusing on two issues that anger them: trade and immigration. Trump repeatedly bashes Mexico, China and immigrants, pledging to overhaul our trade agreements and to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants who he says have stolen American jobs.When one digs beneath Trump’s rhetoric, however, it’s not at all clear how or whether his ideas would lift American workers. Indeed, many economists warn that Trump’s get-tough trade policies could spark both a trade war and a recession that would batter millions of the workers who support him.So let’s drill down and examine what Trump’s policies would mean for workers. On one of the most important issues for workers – raising wages – Trump offers no coherent policy. One day he says wages are too high; another day he signals he might support a federal minimum wage increase, but maybe not. Trump dislikes labor unions and hasn’t proposed anything to strengthen collective bargaining, which economic studies show can be an important tool to making sure that corporations share their profits and raise wages. Indeed, Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas is refusing to bargain with the labor union that represents that hotel’s workers. And notwithstanding Trump’s invective against undocumented immigrants, not only did he employ undocumented workers to do the demolition work for his signature Trump Tower in Manhattan, but he cheated many of them on wages.Trump vows to cut taxes for American workers, but his proposals would actually raise taxes for millions of middle-class Americans, while disproportionately reducing levies on the rich and real estate developers like himself. Trump would do the bidding of the wealthy by abolishing the estate tax and cutting the corporate income tax – all part of a plan that would reduce federal revenues by at least $5 trillion over ten years, leaving less money to expand pro-worker programs like job training, aid to education and the Earned Income Tax Credit.Trump has bucked the GOP establishment by opposing cuts in Social Security and Medicare benefits. That’s good news for workers, millions of whom have been too financially stretched to save adequately for retirement. Many face their “golden years” with just $20,000 or so a year in Social Security benefits. On infrastructure, Trump has echoed Hillary Clinton in calling for spending hundreds of billions of dollars on roads, bridges, railroads and airports. That would help workers by creating hundreds of thousands of middle-class jobs while improving economic efficiency and productivity, but the problem is, Trump ― having proposed more than $5 trillion in tax cuts ― hasn’t put forward a credible plan to finance his infrastructure spending.Trump’s No. 1 issue has of course been immigration, headlined by his promise to expel 11 million people. His supporters love this idea, convinced that undocumented workers are a drain on the public fiscally (even though they usually pay taxes). Deporting 11 million immigrants would be a shock to the system; it would devastate many communities and reduce consumer demand – at car dealers, appliance stores, supermarkets – crimping economic growth.Many businesses that rely on unauthorized immigrants ― meat-packing plants, fruit and vegetable growers, furniture factories, car washes ― might lose a large swath of their workforce, and their production might thus decline. Some might have to close, hurting G.D.P. growth and rendering Trump’s improbable promise of achieving 4 percent-a-year growth all the more implausible. Moreover, Americans might soon have to pay more for some goods and services, whether meat, fruit or having their car washed. No doubt many companies would seek to hire American workers to replace those deported, but how many Americans are eager to work in car washes or pick tomatoes for $9 an hour or do dangerous construction work or toil in slaughterhouses for $12 an hour? Maybe car washes and farmers would raise wages to $10 or $11 an hour, but that still might not attract enough American workers. Bottom line, Trump’s deportation plan may hurt American workers more than it helps.On trade, Trump has promised to get Mexico, China and other countries to renegotiate trade deals. He has also threatened to slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods and 35 percent on cars assembled in Mexico. Any freshman economics student will immediately see problems with this. These tariffs would force Americans to pay more for imported TVs, mobile phones, toys and cars. And if a Trump administration slaps steep tariffs on China and Mexico, those countries are likely to retaliate, imposing penalty tariffs on U.S. products, perhaps on soybeans or machinery. That would hurt our factories, farmers and workers in Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin and other states. That’s how ugly trade wars start, and that’s one reason Moody’s Analytics predicted that a Trump presidency could cause a recession with 3.5 million jobs lost.The two major trade deals approved during Bill Clinton’s presidency ― the North American Free Trade Agreement (negotiated by George H.W. Bush) and Permanent Normalized Trade Relations with China – unfortunately accelerated the exodus of factory jobs. Many Trump supporters are angry at Hillary Clinton because of her husband’s support for trade deals that hurt many American workers, although don’t forget that Republican lawmakers in general supported these deals more than Democratic lawmakers did.It is far from clear that Trump’s pledge to renegotiate these deals will bring back many jobs. Because of far lower wages in Mexico and China, American companies were moving jobs and factories to those countries even before Congress approved NAFTA and normalized trade with China. Those two measures opened the floodgates for American multinationals to send more production offshore because they created far stronger protections for companies that invested in factories in Mexico and China. Whatever a President Trump does to “fix” our trade deals, it’s still dubious that many factory jobs will pour back into the U.S., considering that American manufacturing wages average $26 an hour, compared with $2 or $3 an hour in China and Mexico. As much as we might hope otherwise, many manufacturers will continue to make their telephones, televisions, toys and garments in China instead of the U.S.To add jobs, the next president ― whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton ― will need to do five things: pursue robustly pro-growth policies, promote innovation, produce a better educated, better trained workforce, modernize our decaying, efficiency-killing infrastructure and persuade or pressure American companies to add new jobs and operations here, rather than over there.Trump talks as if it’s all simple, as if he has all the answers, as if he’ll bring back all the jobs, and evidently many workers lap up what he says. But the truth is, there is no miracle policy for creating or bringing back millions of jobs. It’s a long slog that will take innovation, investment, smart policy and hard work, lots of it."

Following “The Birds,” Hedren worked on another movie with Hitchcock ― 1964’s “Marnie” ― and she claims things escalated to the point where Hitchcock was essentially stalking her. She writes that the director had a secret door installed between his office and her dressing room. She also claims he kept a lifelike mask of her face for his own use. According to the excerpts, Hitchcock once entered her dressing room and “put his hands on” Hedren, but “the harder I fought him, the more aggressive he became,” she writes, per the Post. Hedren’s experiences on Hitchcock’s sets inspired the 2012 HBO film “The Girl,” but the actress has never gone into this much detail about the alleged assaults. She has, however, spoken about the director in multiple interviews over the years. In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, the actress called Hitchcock a “misogynist” and said he had “a whole lot of problems,” while in a profile published by The Telegraph, she said he put her in a “mental prison.” "

Chua Buu Dai Son Pagoda in Da Nang, Vietnam Vietnam has more than 2,000 miles of coastline--which means a lot of beaches to choose from.

Pecan Crusted Chicken Tenders with Honey Mustard SauceIn this fun twist on chicken tenders, tenderloins are breaded in pecans and panko, and then pan-fried until crispy and golden.

Eliot was clearly onto something when he asked, ""If you aren't in over your head, how do you know how tall you are?"" The very act of stepping outside of your comfort zone is critical to your success and well-being.Our brains are wired such that it's difficult to take action until we feel at least some stress and discomfort. In fact, performance peaks when we're well out of our comfort zone. If you're too comfortable your performance suffers from inaction, and if you move too far outside of your comfort zone you melt down from stress.Peak performance and discomfort go hand in hand. Stepping outside of your comfort zone makes you better, and it doesn't have to be something as extreme as climbing Mount Everest. It's the everyday challenges that push your boundaries the most, none of which require a flight to Nepal. Step out of your comfort zone and embrace these challenges.1. Get up early. Unless you're a morning person, getting up earlier than usual can take you way out of your comfort zone. However, if you get up well before you have to start getting ready for work, it's worth it. It gives you an opportunity to collect your thoughts and mentally prepare yourself for the day ahead, rather than just dashing from one activity to another. It also gives you the opportunity to eat a good breakfast and exercise, both of which have well-known health benefits.  2. Accomplish an ""impossible"" goal. Few things compare to the exhilaration of accomplishing something that you didn't think you were capable of. These achievements fall so far outside of your comfort zone that they seem impossible. Maybe it's running a marathon or giving a keynote speech at a convention. These accomplishments are worth every bit of suffering you endure to achieve them because once you finally do it, you feel invincible and carry that triumph with you forever.3. Meditate. It's easy to get stuck in your comfort zone when you're so busy that you don't slow down enough to really think about what you're doing and why you're doing it. Meditation is a great way to break this cycle and also happens to be very good for your brain. It increases brain density in areas responsible for self-control, focus, problem-solving, flexibility, and resilience. Best of all, these changes are lasting.4. Focus on one thing at a time. Focusing completely on a single task is a big risk--the risk of failing at something to which you've given your all. That's why it's so uncomfortable. The alternative--multitasking--is a real productivity killer. Research conducted at Stanford confirms that multitasking is less productive than doing a single thing at a time. The researchers found that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information, or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time. When you try to do two things at once, your brain lacks the capacity to perform both tasks successfully. When you spread yourself too thin and chase after every bright, shiny thing that catches your eye, you're missing out on an important opportunity for personal growth.  5. Volunteer. It would be great if everyone volunteered for purely altruistic reasons, but we all have demands on our time and have to set priorities. The problem is that after a long workday, volunteering can get pushed down somewhere below watching ""epic fail"" videos on YouTube. Volunteering is a powerful experience that feels good and expands your network at the same time. Have you ever met anyone who made volunteering a priority and wasn't changed for the better by the experience? Neither have I.  6. Practice public speaking. You've likely heard that the majority of people fear public speaking more than death. In fact, 74 percent of Americans have glossophobia (the fancy word for a fear of public speaking). So, yes, it's a challenge. It's also worth it. Whether you're addressing five people around a table or an audience of five thousand, becoming a better public speaker can be a huge boon to your career.  7. Talk to someone you don't know. Unless you're an extreme extrovert--or a politician--talking to new people probably makes you at least somewhat uncomfortable. Do it anyway. Social interaction is good for your mood (even when you don't like it), expands your network, exposes you to new ideas, and boosts your self-confidence.8. Bite your tongue. Sure, it can feel so good to unload on somebody and let them know what you really think, but that good feeling is temporary. What happens the next day, the next week, or the next year? It's human nature to want to prove that you're right, but it's rarely effective. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you and the relationship severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you're able to choose your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right. The vast majority of the time, that means biting your tongue.9. Say no. The more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Saying no is indeed a major challenge for many people. No is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it's time to say no, avoid phrases such as I don't think I can or I'm not certain. Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them. When you learn to say no, you free yourself from unnecessary constraints and free up your time and energy for the important things in life.  10. Quit putting things off. Change is hard. Self-improvement is hard. Scrounging up the guts to go for what you want is hard, and so is the work to make it happen. When things are hard, it's always easier to decide to tackle them tomorrow. The problem is that tomorrow never comes. Saying you'll do it tomorrow is just an excuse, and it means that either you don't really want to do it or that you want the results without the hard work that comes along with it.Bringing It All TogetherStaying in your comfort zone means stagnation. Just as an oyster only makes a pearl when it's irritated by a grain of sand, no one has ever accomplished anything remarkable when comfortable.What do you do to move out of your comfort zone? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

And the challenger is ""Silicon Desert"" of Saudi Arabia. Troubled by plunging oil prices, Saudi Arabia is turning to information technology (IT) industry.Recently, Saudi Arabia teamed up with Japanese telecommunications and technology group SoftBank to launch a new tech fund that will manage as much as $100bn (KRW 113.9 trillion), shocking the IT industry. The new fund, dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund, will be seeded with $45bn from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and $25bn from Softbank over the next five years. Doors are open to other global investors. The Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund has already decided to invest billions of dollars, according to Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia also made a $3.5 billion investment in U.S. ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. in June. Charles Kane, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, suggested in an interview with Seeker that the Saudi strategy will involve other major investments in American tech hotbeds like Silicon Valley as well as tech booming regions in Europe. Saudi Arabia is aimed at leveraging its influence to encourage companies to establish startups and rum them within the kingdom. In other words, its ultimate goal is to create the next Silicon Desert. Saudi's such ambition is in line with Vision 2030 Reform Plan, launched by Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in April. The plan sets out goals to further develop the promising new generation by improving education from a young age, tailoring education to meet market requirements and ensuring a good supply of quality graduates in emerging markets. The Saudi government is aiming for a minimum of five Saudi universities to be ranked among the top 200 internationally by 2030. In order to implement its strategy, Silicon Desert may be the best choice. However, it is unclear whether the Saudi strategy will bring a rosy future. As the Saudi government started cutting subsidies for education, health, gas and water amid economic slowdown caused by tumbling oil prices, the realization of Silicon Desert ambition will be a long time coming. ""You don't magically start Silicon Valley in Saudi Arabia,"" Kane pointed out. Silicon Valley's engines of innovation are driven by local research universities that graduate resourceful entrepreneurs and attract the venture capitalists looking to fund them. In Saudi Arabia, most students attend religious schools and the talent at private companies is typically imported. Of course, the government is seeking to shift educational priorities toward engineering and technology, but this will take time to bear fruit. The most important thing is that Saudi's massive financial support at tech startups could artificially inflate their value and produce a bubble - the problem that Silicon Valley is experiencing at the moment."
55,POLITICS,"Countering Terrorism: A Comprehensive Conceptual Framework, Case of Intellectuals and Mass Media","Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, ContributorPresident of the International American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/countering-terrorism-a-co_b_12711048.html,,2016-10-30,2016-09-03-1472943427-1526888-ScreenShot20160831at4.32.07PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-03-1472943427-1526888-ScreenShot20160831at4.32.07PM-thumb.png,"In order to country terrorism more efficiently, it is critical to develop a conceptual framework for understanding and countering terrorism that encompasses all linked facets. One of the most comprehensive conceptual frameworks, which encompasses various dimensions of anti-terrorism effort, is developed by Dr. Hamza Baitalmal, associate professor of Mass Communication. In his conceptual framework, Baitalmal identifies the path Saudi Arabia has taken to counter terrorism from prisms of six factors: security, financial, legislative, executive, Judicial, and Intellectual and media. The strategies that are used to deal with each factor are laid out in detail as well. It is worth noting that although ""Saudi Arabia has been for the last 15 years bombarded from everywhere for its ""presumed"" nurturing of such extremist groups"", ""Saudi Arabia had been shocked like any other country in the world with the September 11/ 2001 incident, and this also true for all terrorist act happened in the world since then. This could be a surprise for many, and contrary to what most of the international Media propagates about Saudi Arabia. The international media had set the agenda, and framed the incident as if Saudi Arabia were the attacker or behind any terrorist act worldwide"". As a result, Riyadh adopted a multi-dimensional plan and broad perspective strategy to counter terrorism. Baitalmal argues that ""The framework we propose can be useful for understanding this case specifically, while it also applies to other simpler cases that are part of the direct efforts put in by Saudi Arabia to fight terrorism. But at the same time, it can be a helpful tool in any campaign to restore the image of Saudi Arabia. In addition it ""present a summary of each element, and the strategies used to deal with each element. It also includes a description of the way the framework had been built, a situation analysis and the shaping of Saudi Public thought, and finally our conclusions."" When it comes to the security dimension ""The security forces have achieved a lot in its efforts to face up to acts of violence and terrorism. The ministry of interior's records show that it is totally bent on apprehending terrorists, and destroying all cells connected to terrorism in the Kingdom."" Regarding Intellectual and Media Use by Terrorist Groups, extremist and terrorist groups have been adept at using classical and even new social media. These forms of media appeal to the terrorists because of several reasons including ""It is easy to avoid tracking by security agencies especially as they can change the location (of the server) of the host country. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of extremist and terrorist groups, is the wide use of classical and even new and social media, professionally and in a way that draws attention."" In addition, ""some of these terrorist groups have produced books and publications in which they misrepresent the religious views of senior religious scholars (Olama), of both classical and contemporary persuasion. By this, they are trying to convince followers of the legitimacy of their calls and practices.""  Unfortunately, the ""traditional media has contributed to the growing strength of these groups by re-broadcasting shows that highlight terrorism and some of their deeds. The media itself considers this coverage mere news articles for their audiences, however the material is in fact indirect ""propaganda"" for their strength and brutality, and even part of an inadvertent form of psychological warfare, on behalf of the terrorists.""  On the other hand, Riyadh's media system ""is not different from other media systems in the region or some of the other developing countries. Until recently broadcast  media was owned and operated by the government, while print media was private, but under government supervision. In 2012 three new public authorities were established; the Saudi Broadcasting Corporation, to operate government radio and television services, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), and the General Commission for Audiovisual Media to regulate private radio, and (and TV) services that are been introduced in Saudi Arabia for the first time. Up till now, six radio operators have been granted a license, their no TV channel operators as of now. The idea behind this move was to give some administration, and financial independency from direct government control. This move has been appreciated and seen as a step in the right direction to improve the service. To complete describing the media scene in Saudi Arabia, one cannot escape writing about some Saudi businessmen investing in Arab media. There are five Saudi media conglomerates: the Saudi Research & Marketing Group (1972) that publishes Al Sharq Alawsat Arabic daily Newspaper (1978) and the Arab News(1980) English daily newspaper; Alhayyat that publishes Alhayyat Arabic Daily newspaper; Orbit Show Time Network (OSN) (2009), a joint venture with the Kuwaiti Investment House; ROTANA (1982), an entertainment TV network; and finally the MBC group that operates several radio and TV channels, the most prominent being the Alarabiya news channel, a TV channel competing with the Aljazeera New Channel.""  Baitalmal adds that ""Media in Saudi Arabia for long has been criticized for not keeping up with development in Saudi Arabia. Criticism has come from different social groups, but mainly the conservatives and the liberals. This criticism has intensified lately with the introduction of the new, and social media. The criticism can been seen as a reflection of each group's perception of the role of the media in society. The liberals define the media as a tool for modernization, while the conservatives see it as a tool for propagating the cause of Islam. This difference has led to confrontation between the two groups, a confrontation that can easily be seen in the continuing debate in print and social media. Saudi media and those investing in it, have put in thousands of hours and pages of material related to fighting terrorism and extremism. These efforts include customized weekly programs on radio and television. As part of a public campaign, newspapers have devoted special pages daily, as well as weekly, to address the issue of extremism and terrorism. This is in addition to the employment of TV drama, in efforts to fight terrorism. Worth noting, is that the Saudi efforts were not only restricted to traditional media, but have also extended to Social media. Since the inception of social media, the Saudi society has been reported, in several surveys, to be one of the top users in the world, of this medium. Unfortunately, it is also reported to be a favorite for terrorist groups to recruit followers, and collect money."" Concerning intellectual efforts, ""among the most prominent of all these efforts was the establishment of a research chair in 11 different Saudi universities to study the phenomenon of extremism and its ideology, and the spread of terrorism. At the international level, the Kingdom has taken several initiatives for cooperation with international institutions and organizations in this regard, and the most prominent of these was the call for a dialogue between civilizations, as well as the adoption of the King Abdullah Center for Dialogue of Civilizations in Vienna in 2009."" It goes without saying that there exists obstacles in countering terrorism. Accordingly ""Since the issue of terrorism is a multi dimensional phenomenon, it requires the effort of several government and private sectors. The mere multiplicity of parties who are interested in addressing terrorism, in itself makes it hard to deal with the matter. In other words, the main obstacle is that there is no ""single"" administrative unit to manage all the effort. The different views and definitions on the matter, by the various social groups, is another obstacle. There is no single method agreed upon by these multitude of forces, to guide therapy. There are also those who do not actually agree with these efforts; they are mainly hardliners. Hence, part of the effort to deal with terrorism, is unfortunately spent on convincing those who do not support the effort, to support it in the first place. One final note is that these huge steps taken by the country, may be incommensurable; in other words have no ""agreed"" upon standard of measurement. There is no easy way to quantify and evaluate these efforts to decide whether they are successful or not. Saudi Arabia believes it is winning in its effort against terrorism, while others may not have the same opinion. Thus, Saudi Arabia may not see relief from many of the accusations leveled against it, in the near future."" Finally, Baitalmal's comprehensive, informative and intriguing conceptual framework, which is practical as well, concludes that Riyadh's ""battle with terrorism is a security matter, it had been recognized from the beginning, that terrorist acts are an expression of a complex extremist ideology; a multi dimensional phenomenon . As a result the effort to fight terror can also be seen as complex and multi dimensional. In this study we tried to develop a conceptual framework to help identify the Saudi effort to fight terrorism. This framework encompasses six elements: Security, Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Media and Intellectual Efforts. The framework could be useful to understand this case specifically, but can also apply to other more simpler cases, i.e. more direct efforts to fight terrorism. At the same time, the framework may help in any campaign to enhance the Saudi ""image"".""______________________You can sign up for Dr. Rafizadeh's newsletter for the latest news and analyses on HERE.

The campaign believed she had put it behind her in July, when Comey announced he would not be recommending that she be charged with any crime.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have been blasting Comey ever since. Podesta said Republicans’ “brow-beating” of the agency in that time should have made it clear to him that they would use his letter to hurt her candidacy with just 10 days to the election.Campaign manager Robby Mook criticized Comey for creating the appearance that the FBI has resumed an investigation, even though his letter suggests he does not know whether there is any basis to do so. “He owes voters the full story,” Mook said.Comey’s three-paragraph letter said that he learned on Thursday that an unrelated investigation had turned up additional emails that could be pertinent to the Clinton email probe, and that he had authorized agents to determine whether that was the case.Since then, several media outlets have published reports saying the “unrelated investigation” was that of former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who is accused of exchanging sexually explicit messages with a minor. He shared a laptop computer with his now-estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top adviser to Clinton, and agents recently discovered her emails on the device, the reports said.Podesta said Abedin had fully cooperated with the FBI and turned over everything she should have. He pointed to media reports that the emails on that laptop were likely duplicates of others that agents had already examined during the investigation.“Hillary is not going to be distracted by all this in the final days of the election,” he said.The campaign’s decision to aggressively turn questions on Comey suggests it realizes the potential damage the letter could inflict in the closing days, when some voters are tuning in to the election for the first time.Mook, though, said he doubted Comey’s actions would change the minds of many voters, who had almost certainly heard enough about Clinton’s emails over the past year to form an opinion. “They’ve already factored it into their decision making,” he said.If anything, he said, the renewed GOP attacks on Clinton based on the letter has actually energized Clinton’s supporters and activists who are turning out early voters in the key states to work even harder – “and not let Donald Trump and the Republicans who are trying to bully the FBI have their way.”"

Pat McCrory (R) for re-election because his anti-LGBTQ law, HB 2, is driving business out of his state and into Virginia.“Which candidate would do the most to help our local economy? That’s easy. It’s Pat McCrory, the Republican governor of North Carolina,” reads a Friday editorial in The Roanoke Times. “North Carolina panicked and made a spectacle of itself by passing HB 2, its so-called ‘bathroom bill.’ In response, various companies and even sports leagues pulled events from the state,” the editorial continues. “Three of those have wound up in Salem ― the NCAA Division III men’s and women’s soccer championships, as well as the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association football championship. That’s money in the bank for us.”McCrory signed HB 2 into law in March. It bans local governments from passing LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies, and, going further than any other state, it bars transgender people from using public bathrooms that match their gender identity. The national backlash has been brutal, with businesses boycotting the state, sporting events pulling out and entertainers canceling shows.In all, North Carolina has already lost at least $395 million to HB 2, according to a tally by Wired. That doesn’t include the $250 million and 730 jobs the state lost this week when CoStar Group, a real estate research firm, announced it chose Richmond, Virginia, for a major expansion instead of Charlotte, North Carolina, because of the law.“Feel free to argue all you want which presidential candidate would be best,” reads Friday’s editorial, “but it’s clear that Virginia would be best served if North Carolina re-elected McCrory.”McCrory’s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The governor has signaled he won’t repeal the law, and has taken a hit in the polls over it. He’s up for re-election in November and has been trailing his Democratic challenger, Roy Cooper."

Watch St. Louis. Watch Chicago, watch Chicago. Watch so many other places,” the GOP nominee urged his supporters at a recent rally.Election experts typically respond by pointing out that instances of fraud by voters at the polls are actually remarkably rare.But they do happen. Case in point: Police in Des Moines, Iowa, said Friday that they had arrested Terri Lynn Rote, 55, on suspicion of voting twice in the general election.Rote, a registered Republican, allegedly submitted ballots at two different early-voting locations in Polk County, Iowa, according to local media reports. She has been charged with first-degree election misconduct, a felony.“I wasn’t planning on doing it twice. It was a spur of the moment,” Rote told Iowa Public Radio. “The polls are rigged.” She said she feared her first vote for Trump would be changed to a vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.In February, a reporter for The Blaze, a conservative website run by Glenn Beck, interviewed and photographed Rote, who was then planning to support Trump in the Iowa caucuses.The Polk County auditor said this was the first instance of alleged voter fraud he could remember in 12 years, while the county prosecutor called it one of the few examples he’d seen in his 25 years of work.According to police, two other unnamed suspects are accused of casting mail-in ballots and also voting in person, but they have not been arrested.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

That’s the point.”There are exceptions to this protocol under unusual circumstances, but Comey would have had to consult with a senior official at DOJ before doing so, according to Werner-Simon, who instructed federal prosecutors about these protocols as senior litigation counsel at DOJ, the last position she held there.“Who gave him permission? If he is going to use unusual circumstances under the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual, who did he discuss it with?” Werner-Simon said.Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge appointed by President Bill Clinton who now lectures at Harvard Law School, had a similarly stinging indictment of Comey’s actions.“I cannot think of any reason except Comey’s own personal interests to make public the possibility that there may be emails whose content he does not know that may be relevant to the investigation,” Gertner said.“To release that kind of information is outrageous,” she added. “The FBI typically does not release information about an ongoing investigation, information that could have an impact on an upcoming election ― and he does not have the foggiest idea what is in these emails.”The professional considerations that may have motivated Comey are obvious. Comey, a Republican, faced considerable criticism and scrutiny from congressional Republicans for declining to press charges against Clinton for her handling of classified emails on a private email server.Comey appeared to recognize the unusual nature of his decision to release the information about the newly unearthed emails on Friday in a letter to his employees explaining the choice.“Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,” Comey wrote. “I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.”Indeed, some former federal prosecutors believe that based on his previous statements, Comey was required to follow up with Congress.Solomon Wisenberg, a former federal prosecutor who served as deputy independent counsel in the investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, argues that Comey made a mistake in July when, in an announcement that the DOJ was not pressing charges, he criticized Clinton’s behavior and subsequently testified that he would re-open the investigation if new information warranted it. In so doing, Comey obligated himself to keep Congress up to date, argued Wisenberg.“His duty was to shut up and he didn’t. If you want to talk about violating protocol, he has provided a roadmap,” he said.Having made that error, Comey was likely obligated to inform Congress about the discovery of the new emails, according to Wisenberg, who is now a white-collar criminal defense attorney. “He told them if things change, he would report to them. Given that set of facts, he was duty-bound to do it,” he said.John Bellinger, a former legal adviser to the State Department and National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration and one of many Republican former federal prosecutors to sign a letter calling for nominee Donald Trump to be “rejected” at the polls, offered a similar assessment.“I don’t think Comey had any choice but to disclose the fact now so that he is not accused later of withholding material information from Congress,” he said.But, Bellinger also argued, “Comey now owes it to the American people to announce his assessment before the election, even if he normally would have taken a longer period to run down every loose end.”Werner-Simon maintains, however, that if Comey felt obligated to provide Congress with piecemeal updates about the investigation, he should have been less equivocal about the implications of his findings.Comey, she noted, wrote that the emails “appear to be pertinent to the investigation,” and other phrasing that lacks the full-throated conviction that would justify making an exception to protocol.“If there is some kind of rule of completeness argument, then be more forthcoming in your controversial disclosure,” she said. “Do not use words like ‘appears’ or ‘could be’ or ‘maybe’ or other conditional speech. If you’re going to do it, then at least do it in a standup complete way.”"

Voters, she told MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki, “have a right to know who this woman is, because you look at the polling and it’s exactly who they suspect she is.”Comey’s letter prompted cheers from Trump supporters, who would like to see Clinton in trouble. But it also sparked a wave of complaint from Democrats, and even some former Department of Justice officials, questioning the timing of Comey’s letter and its scant details likely to leave many voters bewildered. Many challenged the FBI director’s motives, increasing the pressure on him to comply with calls from both campaigns for more information. Matthew Miller, a former Department of Justice spokesman, turned to Twitter to question Comey’s judgment. “This is such an inappropriate public disclosure by Comey,” Miller wrote. “And sadly the latest in a long string of them. But today’s disclosure might be worst abuse yet.” Miller told Politico that the Justice Department typically avoids discussing investigations within 60 days of an election because “voters have no way to interpret FBI/DOJ activity in a neutral way.” He also noted that Comey seems only to comment on ongoing investigations when they involve Clinton. One former federal prosecutor said Comey acted “totally inappropriately.”“He had no business writing to Congress about supposed new emails that neither he nor anyone in the FBI has ever reviewed,” Nick Akerman, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, told Politico.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Comey’s statement “is particularly troubling since so many questions are unanswered.”“Director Comey’s announcement played right into the political campaign of Donald Trump, who is already using the letter for political purposes,” Feinstein said in a statement. “And all of this just 11 days before the election.”The conservative foundation Judicial Watch issued a statement taking partial credit for the FBI director’s actions and joined the demand for more information.“Hillary Clinton’s email misconduct and lies, aided and abetted by the Obama administration, have created a national crisis,” Judicial Watch said. “The FBI needs to disclose more information about what it found and when ― the American voters deserve answers now.”Comey said in his letter that the FBI didn’t yet know the significance of the new emails. The Wall Street Journal reported the FBI hadn’t determined whether emails in the new trove were duplicates of the thousands of emails already reviewed by investigators.A Newsweek article argues that Comey was forced to disclose the investigation. Withholding it would have backfired horribly on the bureau if the probe was discovered after the election, the article says. Comey’s position may be complicated by his earlier testimony to Congress about the FBI’s initial probe of Clinton’s emails, in which he recommended no charges against Clinton and called her actions “extremely careless.” “Even at the risk of helping Trump, Comey has notified Congress (and the world) about it so as to clarify his prior testimony,” Benjamin Wittes wrote on Law Fare blog. “This allows voters to judge how to consider this before the election—even though he will almost surely not be able to say anything more until after the election. It’s a way of not pretending that the investigation is ‘complete’ when he knows there is some degree of residual issue.”Comey, for his part, said in a note to FBI employees Friday that he had “an obligation” to disclose the probe to Congress.“I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,” Comey wrote in the memo, obtained by The Washington Post. “I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.”"

The conflicting new claims called into question accounts of Thursday’s chaotic demonstration, in which 142 people were arrested as police in riot gear removed protesters from an encampment blocking the pipeline’s path. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe claimed Friday that the supposed shooting victim drove a truck through a highway barricade set up by protesters, who gave chase and forced him off the road. He then got out of the vehicle and “fired several shots from his assault rifle,” the tribe said in a statement posted to Facebook. Bureau of Indian Affairs agents detained the man, whose name has not been released, and turned him over to the FBI, according to BIA spokeswoman Nedra Darling. The FBI, in turn, handed the man over to local law enforcement, according to an FBI spokeswoman. Documents found in the man’s Chevy Silverado pickup suggest he was a Dakota Access Pipeline security guard in a company-owned truck, the Standing Rock Sioux statement said. The tribe posted photos of insurance papers linking the vehicle to the pipeline. Mother Jones reported there was an employee ID badge in the pickup. Protesters, who prefer to be called water protectors, later set the vehicle on fire, according to Mother Jones.Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier on Friday said the man, a contractor providing security, was indeed armed, but “that was more or less in self defense.” The man fired no shots, Kirchmeier said during a press conference, and was not wounded by gunfire. Friday’s accounts differ in several respects from what authorities said on Thursday. The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services had said the man was a “private individual” who was shot in the hand by protesters. The department’s spokesman said the man was armed, but didn’t indicate whether he’d fired any shots. Friday’s protest was noticeably calmer than the previous day’s, when police clashed for hours with Native Americans and environmental activists who oppose construction of the 1,172-mile pipeline. Police used pepper spray, bean bag rounds, a taser and other non-lethal weapons against protesters, Kirchmeier said. No shots were fired by law enforcement, he added.A woman who was later arrested fired three shots on Thursday that narrowly missed a law enforcement officer, authorities said. Protesters threw feces, water bottles, logs and other debris at officers during the conflict, authorities said. The tumult that unfolded Thursday prompted some calls to safeguard protesters who remain in a separate camp on federal land, where they’ve been for months.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called on President Barack Obama to send Department of Justice personnel to guarantee safety and First Amendment rights for protesters, and to suspend all federal permits for the pipeline project until the outcome of a “full cultural and environmental review.” Amnesty International announced it had deployed a team of human rights observers to the area. Even before Thursday’s clashes, Standing Rock Sioux members had accused local and state law enforcement of civil rights violations.The tribe opposes the pipeline, saying it could pollute the Missouri River, the source of their drinking water, and will disturb burial grounds and sites of cultural importance. The Obama administration has withheld a permit that would allow Energy Transfer Partners to build across the river while the government reviews its approval of the largely completed pipeline. UPDATE: This story has been revised to include information from the FBI."

Recently, at the final presidential debate, he portrayed undocumented immigrants as violent criminals coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, referring to them as “bad hombres.” This was incorrect for two reasons. For one thing, not all undocumented immigrants are from Mexico or Latin America. And native-born Americans are more likely than immigrants to commit crimes.Longoria also voiced her support for Hillary Clinton, whom she has vocally endorsed (despite someone mysteriously slapping her image on a pro-Trump flyer earlier this month.) She said she doesn’t really get why people don’t find the Democratic nominee “likable.”“I know her on a personal level, and she is one of the most likable, amazing, engaged, compassionate human beings,” she said. Even so, she added that quality leadership, not likability, should be what voters actually care about.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

I am a psychiatrist and I have seen a number of people with mental illness perform pretty good comedy. Then there is Gethard, who seems to me to be the Chris Rock of the genre of self-disclosure monologues about personal suffering - and finding a way to live and love.Gethard has perfect pitch when describing anxiety, depression, hopelessness, suicidal impulses, alcoholic blackouts and psychiatric treatment. He has a sweetness to him that is not the least bit saccharine, a graciousness too, and he knows when to lighten the mood when the material is starting to get a bit too dark.From when a boy, Gethard tells us he was panicky, fearful, awkward, and bullied. By the time he was an undergraduate at Rutgers he was having severe depressive episodes and a good dose of paranoia. Like so many youth, he eluded treatment until one night he came close to killing himself by not avoiding a preventable car crash. But it was almost a decade later that he finally surfaced from his psychic abyss, not without a mood disorder but despite it. That’s the silver lining of his monologue, and deserves to be heard by tens of millions of people with mental and addictive disorders and their families and friends.I loved the way Gethard described his psychiatrist of almost a decade, his fondness for how she helped him as well as her idiosyncrasies and irreverence to convention. He was brilliant in nailing a doctor at a student health service who put his brittle efforts at protecting himself ahead of caring for patients, especially Gethard. His tales of psychiatric medications were faultless in their accuracy and in imparting the many dilemmas of taking a drug that can make you loopy, interfere with ejaculation, cause hemorrhoids and produce muscle spasms, to name a few. Yet he was clearly pro-medication and understood the necessity of his taking psychiatric drugs. He remarked he “takes Wellbutrin [an anti-depressant] for breakfast.” It was heartening, as well, to hear him adamantly dispel the myth that medications destroy creativity; in fact, he made a point of saying they were instrumental to his getting beyond chaotic, inchoate material to the clarity and capability he so keenly evidenced in this show.In the 75 minutes of Career Suicide there were so many deftly delivered nuggets of hope and direction I wished many of my patients could hear them. We all need to come clean, to face our shame and do the work of building or rebuilding our lives. We all need attachments to people who truly care about us, who will pick up the phone when we need to reach them. We all need to work at making a life of dignity and connection. We need to find what he called “anchors”, those beliefs and activities that will get a person from a Sunday night suicidal frenzy to a doctor’s appointment on Thursday. And there is work, what calls us to get up, get going and do a day’s work whether you are a comedian, plumber or doctor.Some might find Gethard to be a bit graphic at times, so be prepared for when he bares details about body and its fluids. But compared to Chris Rock, Chris Gethard is a choir boy. There also are plenty of New Jersey jokes but, hey, who can resist - especially if like him you are a New Jersey native. When my wife and I left the wonderfully intimate Lynn Redgrave theatre in the East Village we were uplifted even though we just had taken a journey through emotional hell. We had a lot of laughs. And for me, a busman of a psychiatrist on holiday, so to speak, I was proud to be among those Chris Gethard so kindly appreciated and poked such good fun at. ___________________________________________________________________________________________My new book, Improving Mental Health: Four Secrets in Plain Sight, Foreword by Patrick Kennedy, will be available on November 1, 2016.The opinions expressed herein are solely my own as a psychiatrist and public health advocate and public health doctor.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

And she spoke out in 2015 when Arkansas passed an anti-LGBTQ “religious liberty” bill which legislators were forced to soften after national outrage.“It was shocking that it had to be spoken of, that in this time it still came up,” she said. “But it’s fear ― people are afraid of what they don’t know. It was just something that felt like an egregious abuse of civil rights. I felt like I couldn’t be silent about it. I love my state. I love the people of my state. My state has always had its battles for civil rights...Growing up someplace like that, you either become committed toward bigotry or against it. You can’t really sit on the fence.”Steenburgen also weighed in on North Carolina’s anti-LGBTQ law, HB2, with its draconian provision that dictates which bathroom transgender people use, and she discussed a transgender family member, who has helped to educate her.“It’s not just in the South,” she explained, “because I have a transgender relative, and so I know that he’s experienced these kinds of things [discrimination] in lots of places. We sometimes ask him questions we wouldn’t dare ask anyone else about what it feels like, or which pronouns to use, or things like that, and he’s very patient about it… It does take speaking out and standing up for them ― and them articulating, beautifully in many cases, their own feelings about it. It’s going to be okay, but this is what we go through when we change.”Steenburgen also discussed Hillary Clinton, whom she’s counted as a dear friend since the former Secretary of State’s years as first lady of Arkansas. Steenburgen and Danson campaigned for Clinton in her first presidential run in 2008, and did so this year as well. Steenburgen recalled imagining Clinton as president over 30 years ago – and dismissing the thought, seeing it as impossibility.“I remember having the thought one time,” she said. “I remember where I was sitting. It was on the kitchen counter, having chocolate chip cookies in the governor’s mansion. And she was first lady. And I remember thinking, ‘Wow, what if you could be president someday?’ I remember thinking, ‘Mary, it’s not going to happen in your lifetime.’ I remember looking at her and having that thought. It felt impossibly too high a mountain to climb. And I do tell kids that now, because for many young women, she’s at least been there so long that they’ve had that possibility. But for many of us of my generation, it just felt like a weird, far away dream.”"

Basically, it’s a good chance for all the major players in the Trump camp to show up, briefly account for their actions, and try and build the case that they’re not really to blame for what happened.“If Donald Trump had only listened to me!” is a dominant theme.One of the more important members of that coterie is Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who is basically of the opinion that the GOP presidential nominee is an unruly infant:To hear Kellyanne Conway talk about managing her boss is to listen to a mother of four who has had ample experience with unruly toddlers. Instead of criticizing Trump’s angry tweets, for instance, she suggested that he also include a few positive ones. “You had these people saying, ‘Delete the app! Stop tweeting!’ ” she recalled. “I would say, ‘Here are a couple of cool things we should tweet today.’ It’s like saying to someone, ‘How about having two brownies and not six?’ ”This is something we’ve heard before.

69,GREEN,Elon Musk Unveils Shingles That Could Finally Make Rooftop Solar Sexy,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tesla-solar-roof_us_5814025ae4b0390e69d07c6e,The billionaire envisions solar roofs and batteries powering homes with electric cars in the garage.,2016-10-29,"Elon Musk's vision for his customers: A home with solar roofing, a battery in the basement and an electric car in the garage. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5814047d170000aa025ba801.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Elon Musk late Friday debuted glass roofing shingles that generate electricity from the sun, a critical step toward merging Tesla Motors with his solar energy firm, SolarCity.At a 30-minute press conference on a movie studio lot in Los Angeles, the billionaire tech titan unveiled a suite of shingles, some made to replicate traditional roof tiles, that he said were designed to make rooftop solar chic, the way his Tesla cars made zero-emissions vehicles fashionable.“Just like with electric cars, which didn’t look good, had low range and didn’t have good performance, they looked like golf cars. People had a really hard time buying electric cars,” Musk told a crowd gathered at the outdoor event, which was broadcast on both Tesla and SolarCity websites. “Something similar needs to happen to solar. We need to make solar panels as appealing as electric cars have become.” Musk showed off four houses ― which looked to be from the set of the ABC’s “Desperate Housewives” ― with different styles of glass shingles. The first, using a laminate coating, replicated a Tuscan terra cotta tile. The second mirrored the design of French slate. The third modeled a gray, textured look commonly seen on suburban homes. The fourth sported a sleek, modern look.Photovoltaic cells, embedded under layers of glass, become visible as the tiles are tilted in different directions.Musk didn’t say how much the solar shingles would cost or when they’ll be available.The shingles aren’t necessarily supposed to replace the solar panel business that has buoyed SolarCity. Rather, Musk said he’s targeting the roughly 5 million homeowners who replace their roofs in a given year. He said the new solar tiles are more visually appealing than traditional shingles or solar panels.“Over time, every house would be a solar house,” he said. “It’s a neighborhood where the aesthetics get better over time. You’ll want to call your neighbors over and say, ‘Check out the sweet roof.’”Tesla in June made a bid to buy SolarCity in hopes of combining the companies into a one-stop shop for clean energy needs. Together, the companies would sell panels to produce electricity, which would be stored in Tesla Powerwall batteries and charge the Tesla vehicle in the garage. The deal, which has been panned by skeptical Wall Street analysts, seems likely to win approval from shareholders when it comes up for a vote on Nov. 17. After all, investors who buy stock in Tesla and SolarCity ― both cash-hungry companies that have historically struggled to turn profits ― tend to be among Musk’s most devoted believers.Musk also announced an update to the $5,500 Powerwall, a lithium-ion battery meant to store excess solar energy during the day for use at night. The new Powerwall doubles the amount of energy that can be stored and deployed. “You can take a four-bedroom house and you can power your fridge, sockets and lights for a day,” Musk said. “If you have solar on your house, you can power indefinitely.” Still, the economics of storing energy may not yet make sense in most parts of the United States. In most states, electricity rates are higher during the day and cheaper at night. Through a process called net metering, utility companies buy excess solar energy from homeowners at the higher day rate. When the sun sets, those customers buy electricity back at the cheaper night rate. Only a handful of states lack such policies.  “It only makes sense for storage if it’s more expensive to buy electricity at night and sell it back during the day,” Brian Warshay, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told The Huffington Post in May 2015, when the Powerwall was announced. “But most people aren’t on those types of rates.” Musk, however, focused on the big picture, outlining a vision for a distributed system of energy production in which utilities ― with the help of Tesla and SolarCity software ― manage a grid fed by massive clean-energy power plants and homeowners’ rooftop solar. Along with the Powerwall II, Musk unveiled a new Powerpack, a scaled-up battery meant for use by utility companies.Already, Tesla is working on three projects with utilty companies in southern California, Hawaii and New Zealand, he said.Climate change, caused by carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, makes such an energy transition necessary, Musk said. The presentation began with Musk standing in front of a NASA chart showing a massive spike in the amount of carbon particles, which trap heat from the sun and cause global warming, in the atmosphere. “The future is bright for electricity,” he said. “It’s a very bright future for both utilities and for rooftop.”  Musk isn’t the first to launch a solar shingle product. But, with star power almost unprecedented for an energy or auto executive, he is likely the highest-profile person to try. “The allure that this guy has for sparking the imagination of people, he does bring a certain panache to this for sure,” Tensie Whelan, director of New York University’s Stern Center for Sustainable Business, told HuffPost ahead of the announcement. “How he thinks in systems is really interesting ― connecting the roof, the battery and the car. That broader, fully integrated solution is a smart way to go.” Still, the solar roofing market remains a nascent industry with more losers than winners. Industrial giant Dow Chemical Co. discontinued its solar shingle in June, five years after predicting the product would pull in $1 billion and capture one-fifth of the market. Over the last few years, at least a dozen other companies manufacturing similar products have closed down or gone bankrupt.A few seem to have succeeded. For example, French behemoth Saint-Gobain, which rolled out its solar shingle soon after Dow, still sells the product, called Apollo II. And Luma Resources, a small startup based in southern Michigan, has spent nine years honing its solar roofing product. It has installed about 750,000 watts of shingles, enough for roughly 150 to 200 individual homes in the U.S., Canada and Jamaica. The company’s president, Robert Allen, credits his staying power with his earlier career as a roofer, and his view of the product foremost through that lens. “Musk is in for a much, much, much bigger challenge to create a solar roof than he thinks he’s in for,” Allen recently told HuffPost. But, then again, automakers ― nearly all of which are now rolling out electric cars to rival Musk’s ― likely said much the same thing about Tesla. "
70,WEIRD NEWS,WikiLeaks Documents Reveal United Nations Interest In UFOs,Lee Speigel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wikileaks-ufos-united-nations_us_5813aa17e4b0390e69d0322e,An international UFO committee almost became reality.,2016-10-29,Numerous WikiLeaks documents from 1978 reveal strong interest in UFOs at the United Nations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5813c33d190000ec02c2fb08.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Revelations in a set of hacked emails released by WikiLeaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about UFOs and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth. But a very significant ― and possibly overlooked ― group of WikiLeaks items relevant to the topic was released on May 18, 2015.WikiLeaks posted more than half a million U.S. State Department diplomatic documents from 1978 detailing America’s interactions with countries all around the world ― including Grenada Prime Minister Eric Gairy’s efforts to organize a United Nations-based committee to research and investigate global UFO reports.Many of the documents, written by American UN officials, indicated how closely they were monitoring Grenada’s UFO-related activities. One document, from Nov. 18, 1978, revealed my involvement in helping Grenada to produce a credible UFO presentation. I had an opportunity in early 1978 to meet Gairy in New York to present an idea about how I thought the UN would pay attention to his UFO crusade. Through his ambassadors, I gave him a copy of a documentary record album, “UFOs: The Credibility Factor,” that I produced for CBS Inc. in 1975. Gairy and I met, and after I convinced him I could bring a very credible group of speakers to the UN, he agreed to sponsor my proposal (see image below). Shortly after a handshake deal, he made me a temporary delegate-adviser of Grenada and the rest was, well, history.The following image shows part of the group I brought together in July 1978 to meet with UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. He wanted to know what we were planning to do at our November event in front of the Special Political Committee, which included representatives from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.Another cable posted on WikiLeaks, from Nov. 24, 1978, refers to Ambassador Richard Petree’s meeting with Grenada representatives “to discuss their UFO resolution. Ambassador Petree acknowledged the high level of interest in UFOs among some elements of the private sector and scientific community ... and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the U.S. and other countries.”On Nov. 28, 1978, the day after our presentation at the UN, this document was sent through official channels, detailing the actual UFO event, describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations.A few days after that, on Dec. 2, 1978, a follow-up cable was transmitted, including the following:Subsequent to the introduction of the Grenadian UFO resolution, Misoff [Mission Officer] has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions, which included representation from Austria, USSR and Grenada, in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem.The following week brought forth another document, on Dec. 8, 1978, which stated:“The General Assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects, and to inform the secretary-general of the observations, research and evaluation of such activities.”It was further suggested that Grenada’s views on UFOs could be discussed in 1979.

But a very significant ― and possibly overlooked ― group of WikiLeaks items relevant to the topic was released on May 18, 2015.WikiLeaks posted more than half a million U.S. State Department diplomatic documents from 1978 detailing America’s interactions with countries all around the world ― including Grenada Prime Minister Eric Gairy’s efforts to organize a United Nations-based committee to research and investigate global UFO reports.Many of the documents, written by American UN officials, indicated how closely they were monitoring Grenada’s UFO-related activities. One document, from Nov. 18, 1978, revealed my involvement in helping Grenada to produce a credible UFO presentation. I had an opportunity in early 1978 to meet Gairy in New York to present an idea about how I thought the UN would pay attention to his UFO crusade. Through his ambassadors, I gave him a copy of a documentary record album, “UFOs: The Credibility Factor,” that I produced for CBS Inc. in 1975. Gairy and I met, and after I convinced him I could bring a very credible group of speakers to the UN, he agreed to sponsor my proposal (see image below). Shortly after a handshake deal, he made me a temporary delegate-adviser of Grenada and the rest was, well, history.The following image shows part of the group I brought together in July 1978 to meet with UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. He wanted to know what we were planning to do at our November event in front of the Special Political Committee, which included representatives from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.Another cable posted on WikiLeaks, from Nov. 24, 1978, refers to Ambassador Richard Petree’s meeting with Grenada representatives “to discuss their UFO resolution. Ambassador Petree acknowledged the high level of interest in UFOs among some elements of the private sector and scientific community ... and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the U.S. and other countries.”On Nov. 28, 1978, the day after our presentation at the UN, this document was sent through official channels, detailing the actual UFO event, describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations.A few days after that, on Dec. 2, 1978, a follow-up cable was transmitted, including the following:Subsequent to the introduction of the Grenadian UFO resolution, Misoff [Mission Officer] has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions, which included representation from Austria, USSR and Grenada, in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem.The following week brought forth another document, on Dec. 8, 1978, which stated:“The General Assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects, and to inform the secretary-general of the observations, research and evaluation of such activities.”It was further suggested that Grenada’s views on UFOs could be discussed in 1979. Unfortunately, that didn’t come to pass, as Grenada Prime Minister Gairy was overthrown in a 1979 coup.Needless to say, without the Gairy-based initiative on UFOs, it was quietly relegated to Grenada’s back burner.This is the tip of the UFO-UN iceberg. It shows how the subject of UFOs wasn’t merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside. There was, and perhaps still is, some interest there, just waiting to emerge. "
72,BUSINESS,8 Ways To Get People To Take You More Seriously,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-ways-to-get-people-to-t_b_12593248.html,,2016-10-29,2016-10-21-1477088876-6830883-8WaysToGetPeopleToTakeYouMoreSeriouslyHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-21-1477088876-6830883-8WaysToGetPeopleToTakeYouMoreSeriouslyHP-thumb.jpg,"Do you ever feel like nobody takes you seriously at work? If so, you're not alone. More than 50% of people don't feel respected at work, according to a global survey of more than 20,000 employees by the Harvard Business Review.Maybe colleagues ignore your input in meetings. Perhaps they interrupt you or don't include you in important decisions. It's easy to blame that on a bad boss or a toxic work environment. In some cases, that's even true. But if you really want to be taken more seriously at work, you should start by looking in the mirror and doing what you can to increase your influence.There are eight things you can do right now to increase your credibility, get people to take you more seriously, and ensure you get treated with the respect you deserve.  1. Don't let your statements sound like questions. One of the most common things people do to undermine their credibility is end their sentences on a higher inflection than where they started. It's called ""upspeak,"" and our brains are trained to interpret that pattern as a question. So instead of delivering information, you end up sounding like you're asking if your own input is correct. And people notice. In a survey of 700 managers by Pearson, 85% considered upspeak to be a sign of insecurity and emotional weakness, and 44% said they mark job candidates down by as much as a third for using upspeak. That's one habit you should break right now to give yourself an instant credibility boost.2. Don't just give reports--tell stories. The most successful TED talks follow a magic formula--they are 75% stories and 25% data backing up those stories. Stories provide an emotional hook that helps people remember what you said, and they give you a platform for connecting your knowledge to the real world. There's a huge difference between memorizing mathematical formulas, for example, and being able to use them to calculate whether a particularly dangerous asteroid is going to hit us in our lifetime. Stories help people take you seriously because they demonstrate that you can apply what you know and can connect to your audience with emotional intelligence.3. Encourage people to talk about themselves. When you first started dating, your mom probably encouraged you to get your dates to talk about themselves. Sure, it's good manners--and we all know that everybody likes to talk about themselves. But it turns out that there's a scientific basis for this. Your brain rewards you for self-disclosure. In fact, talking about yourself feels so good that it causes neurological changes in the brain. So if you want people to pay attention to what you have to say, let them talk about themselves first. Once those ""feel-good"" neurotransmitters are flowing and people start feeling connected to you, they're much more likely to take you and your contributions seriously.  4. Do your homework. One of the best ways to get people to take you seriously is to be prepared and know what you're talking about. Americans attend 11 million meetings every day, and unproductive meetings cost the US economy $37 billion every year. Why are there so many unproductive meetings? Because people are unprepared. Don't be one of them. Whether it's a team meeting or briefing your boss, always take the time to prepare. Know what you want to say, be able to back up your opinions with data, and be prepared to answer questions two or three levels down.5. Stay informed. If you look at the employee handbook for tech company Valve, it says that it looks for ""T-shaped"" employees: people who have a lot of broad knowledge layered on top of their primary area of expertise. Do whatever it takes to keep up with what's going on in the world. It's particularly important to stay abreast of trends in science and technology, especially as they relate to business. You don't want to look like a deer in the headlights when somebody starts talking about how the Internet of Things is going to transform manufacturing.  6. Dress for success. Fair or not, we judge people on their appearances every single day. And it happens so fast--in about a tenth of a millisecond, according to researchers at Princeton--that we don't even realize we're doing it. We make inferences about a person's character and capabilities based on appearance. If your appearance is sloppy, for example, people are likely to subconsciously conclude that your work will be sloppy too. Looking polished and well-groomed, on the other hand, creates the impression of responsibility and competence. That doesn't mean you have to rush out and blow your budget on a designer wardrobe. But it does mean that you should show enough respect for yourself and for your colleagues to make a substantial effort.  7. Strike a power pose. If you assume an expansive pose--taking up more room by keeping your shoulders open and your arms wide--other people see you as more powerful. This is a hard-wired human characteristic, as people who have been blind since birth throw their arms out in victory, even though they've never seen someone do this. Moreover, power poses actually change our body chemistry. Researchers at Harvard found that after participants held a power pose for just two minutes, their levels of testosterone rose by 20% and their cortisol (the stress hormone) levels dropped. Power poses are a win-win: they make other people see you as more powerful, and they actually make you feel more powerful.  8. Be confident but not too confident. No one is going to have confidence in you until you have confidence in yourself. But you have to balance that confidence with a little humility. Truly confident people aren't afraid to admit that they don't know everything--it doesn't make them feel threatened at all. In fact, the most confident people are eager to ask questions and learn. The best way to show your confidence is to own what you know and what you don't.Bringing It All TogetherIf you feel like you don't get the respect you deserve at work, nobody can change that but you. Sometimes people don't take you seriously because of little things that you don't even realize you're doing. And that's something you can fix.What do people do that makes it hard to take them seriously? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

Quite to the contrary in fact, as new data from Eventbrite suggests. Spending time at home in front of the TV instead of sleepless nights in dusty deserts surrounded by freaks and bass music has its moments, but after awhile, the restless spirit gets tired of resting.Thankfully, us party deviants have the holiday event season to look forward to which kicks off this Halloween weekend and closes with New Year's Eve as its grand finale. Events such as L.A.'s Minimal Effort at Los Angeles Center Studios are drawing crowds from all over Southern California. Many event organizers are shifting their focus from large scale festivals to smaller, local events that offer all the accoutrements of a grandiose festival without having to spend hundreds of dollars just to schlep all your camping gear into the middle of nowhere. Many organizers are bringing the aesthetics of music festivals to their venues, offering a more convenient setting without sacrificing production value. Ranging from arenas to small clubs, one can experience beautiful live art, stellar lineups, and performance artists in their own city which allows for a broader audience to attend.Eventbrite, a leading global marketplace that powers two million events each year, has uncovered some key insights into the holiday event season. They have seen a huge increase in both free and ticketed Halloween events on their platform this year which means that participants as well as organizers are putting more emphasis on Halloween parties than before. This leads to event organizers seeing higher profits on Halloween parties than in recent years so as a result, they are investing more money and resources into better performers and venues. There are also large scale raves and underground Halloween parties that are happening, many of which are not included within the statistical data, despite the controversy surrounding several popular EDM festivals. Regardless of the type of parties occurring, there is no doubt that there are more than a plethora to choose from.From 2014 to 2015, Eventbrite saw a 64% increase in ticketed Halloween events which boasted a 76% increase in gross ticket sales during the same time period. While this data represents last year's statistics, the company expects 2016's numbers to be even higher when they pull this year's data after the holiday is behind us. New Year's Eve events will also be included in future statistics as they mark the finale of the holiday event season with organizers placing an equal emphasis on the holiday. Because many of the same venues who throw raging New Year's Eve parties will also have just hosted Halloween events, they will continue to evolve and improve for future events.  While Halloween has both big and small cities coming alive with parties of all crowds and sizes, in venues that range from the streets of West Hollywood to intimate indoor venues, New Year's Eve seems to mark a resurgence in the festival season. Events such as SnowGlobe in South Lake Tahoe, Cosmic Convergence at Lake Atitlan in Guatemala, Bass Nectar's New Year's Eve at the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex in Alabama, Decadence at the Colorado Convention Center, and many more are all boasting superstar lineups and sparing no expense on epic production.Both Halloween and New Year's Eve bookend a season of partying that is taking place at several small and often more intimate, local venues, further connecting the community. This event season gives the fairweather partiers their chance to cut loose as well as avid festival-goers various places to satiate their appetite for fun until next season.Website | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram"
74,WOMEN,Why Career Success Isn't About Working Harder,"Skirting the Rules, ContributorA societal movement that enlists women through fiction (for in...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-career-success-isnt-a_b_12697526.html,,2016-10-29,2016-10-29-1477702770-7484619-STR_watermarks_jocelyngreenky.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-29-1477702770-7484619-STR_watermarks_jocelyngreenky-thumb.jpg,"Jocelyn Greenky is the hilarious, smart, cool big sister you probably wish you had at work to turn to for honest advice on how to navigate those endlessly confusing office politics. She learned herself by working at big companies like Hachette Filipacchi and Wenner Media, where she held top leadership titles such as corporate editorial director. Jocelyn also co-wrote The Big Sister's Guide to the World of Work: The Inside Rules Every Working Girl Should Know after word spread of her rule-skirting career wisdom through the corporate grape vine. Literally hundreds of women would call her to get her tell-it-like-it-is take on their workplace dilemmas (think: My boss hates my guts. What should I do?). We caught up with Jocelyn at a recent Art of Being Salon in Manhattan to get her advice on how to maximize your time at work.Know you don't have to just ""pay your dues."" Jocelyn started out at a lackluster job working as an assistant at an advertising agency--and hating it. ""I was brainwashed into believing that I was stuck, that I had no options, that I had to 'pay my dues,' instead of looking for alternatives,"" she says. The idea of ""paying your dues"" isn't all that uncommon in the workplace, and many women simply end up putting their heads down and working harder and harder, waiting for the promotion that never comes. Create options for yourself. Jocelyn reminds us not to forget that we have options. (And if you don't have options, you better go out and make some.) She suggests always having an exit strategy, and points out that many men have one on hand before they've even gotten the job they're applying for. Women, Jocelyn argues, tend to be pretty monogamous about their jobs, often feeling disloyal if they're out there actively looking for opportunity. But The Big Sister's Guide describes options as ""an absolute necessity for the life and health of [your] career and [your] sanity.""Cultivate your work relationships. You probably hear this one a lot, but according to Jocelyn, having a positive attitude really does matter. In order to make those important options for yourself, you've got to build some strong relationships. Jocelyn's advice to her younger self ""would be to stop bitching so much about being stressed at work because it only drove my friends, family, and co-workers away."" And driving your coworkers away isn't going to get you that promotion. So say hi to the newbie down the hall or drop a handwritten ""Thank You"" note to your coworker after they help you out--it'll pay off.Boost your score with strategic favors. ""The thing I think women could really learn from men is that getting ahead isn't just about being productive,"" Jocelyn says. Doing favors for other people who have the power to help you (or ""back scratching"" as she calls it) is one of the best ways to get them to help you out later on. Women are naturally hard workers who try to make everyone happy. Seems like a good thing, right? Not when the modern workplace is dominated by ""guylogic--"" which is all about keeping score. If a higher up wants something done, men do that before anything else because they know it's going to make them look good. And you should, too.   Spend 40 percent of your time not doing your job description. At this point, you're probably wondering how the heck you're supposed to have time for all of this. But don't worry--Jocelyn's got you covered. ""One way to be more productive is to practice the 60/40 rule, where you spend 60 percent of you work day doing what's in your actual job description, and the other 40 percent making connections, building your reputation, and practicing that strategic 'back scratching' that guys are so good at,"" she explains. You might feel guilty about not ""working"" while you're at work, but the truth is that this kind of networking will actually make you more valuable and, in turn, help your company. The more you know about your industry and the more contacts you have, the better--for both you, and for your employer.Take inventory of what you do. So even though it may feel like you're slacking, taking these little steps to change your workday routine might actually be the key to your success. Jocelyn--and all of those women who've taken her advice over the years--are proof of that. And if this all feels a bit overwhelming, start small. ""Try writing down everything you do and who it benefits for one week,"" Jocelyn suggests. ""Organizing your actions on paper helps you become conscious of what tasks and relationships have the biggest career payoffs.""  *Additional reporting by Jessica Demarest What Tracking My Time for a Year Taught Me About ProductivityThe Interesting Link Between Self Care and SuccessQuestions to Ask Yourself When You're on the Verge of a Career Change"

It might be a toxic friend or colleague, a dead-end job, or a struggling relationship. Whatever the challenge, you have to see things through a new lens, and take decisive action if you want to move through it successfully.It sounds easy, but it isn't.It's fascinating how mentally strong people set themselves apart from the crowd. Where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to overcome.Too many people succumb to the mistaken belief that mental strength comes from natural, unteachable traits that belong only to a lucky few. It's easy to fall prey to this misconception. In reality, mental strength is under your control, and it's a matter of emotional intelligence (EQ).Emotional intelligence is the ""something"" in each of us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions to achieve positive results.Despite the significance of EQ, its intangible nature makes it very difficult to know how much you have and what you can do to improve it if you lack it. You can always take a scientifically validated test, such as the one that comes with the Emotional Intelligence 2.0 book.Unfortunately, quality (scientifically valid) EQ tests aren't free, so I've analyzed the data from the million-plus people TalentSmart has tested in order to identify the behaviors that are the hallmarks of high emotional intelligence. This data shows that what you don't do is just as important as what you do when it comes to EQ.The beauty of EQ is that it's a flexible skill that you can easily improve with effort. Absolutely anyone can enhance their EQ by emulating the habits of emotionally intelligent people. If you're up for it, start with these critical things that emotionally intelligent people are careful to avoid. They consciously avoid these behaviors because they are tempting and easy to fall into if one isn't careful.1. They don't stay in their comfort zone. Self-awareness is the foundation of EQ, and increasing your self-awareness isn't comfortable. You can't increase your EQ without pushing yourself to discover what you need to work on and what you should be doing differently. This is hard because when you take a really good look at yourself, you aren't going to like everything you see. It's more comfortable to keep the blinders on, but they make certain that you'll never have a high EQ.  2. They don't give in to fear. They say that bravery is being scared to death to do something and doing it anyway. Many times, that's true, even when it comes to your career. The fear doesn't have to come from something as extreme as rushing into a burning building; it can be a fear of public speaking or going out on a limb to try for a promotion. If you use fear as an excuse not to do something, you've already lost. It's not that emotionally intelligent people aren't afraid--they simply pick themselves up and fight on regardless of the fear.3. They don't stop believing in themselves. Emotionally intelligent people persevere. They don't give up in the face of failure, and they don't give up because they're tired or uncomfortable. They're focused on their goals, not on momentary feelings, and that keeps them going even when things are hard. They don't take failing to mean that they're a failure. Likewise, they don't let the opinions of others keep them from chasing their dreams. When someone says, ""You'll never be able to do that,"" they regard it as one person's opinion, which is all it is.4. They don't beg for attention. People who are always begging for attention are needy. They rely on that attention from other people to form their self-identity. Emotionally intelligent people couldn't care less about attention. They do what they want to do and what needs to be done, regardless of whether anyone is stroking their ego.  5. They don't act like jerks. People who act like jerks are unhappy and insecure. They act like jerks because they don't have the emotional strength to be nice when they don't feel like it. Emotionally intelligent people place high value on their relationships, which means they treat everyone with respect, regardless of the kind of mood they're in.  6. They don't hold grudges. The negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. Researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you're holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs.  7. They don't hang around negative people. Negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to negative people because they don't want to be seen as callous or rude, but there's a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear to someone and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral. Emotionally intelligent people avoid getting drawn in by setting limits and distancing themselves from negative people when necessary. Think of it this way: If a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You'd distance yourself, and you should do the same with negative people.8. They don't feel sorry for themselves. Here's the worst thing about feeling sorry for yourself, other than it being annoying, of course: it shifts your locus of control outside yourself. Feeling sorry for yourself is, in essence, declaring that you're a helpless victim of circumstance. Emotionally intelligent people never feel sorry for themselves because that would mean giving up their power.9. They don't feel entitled. Emotionally intelligent people believe that the world is a meritocracy and that the only things that they deserve are those that they earn. People who lack EQ often feel entitled. They think that the world owes them something. Again, it's about locus of control. Emotionally intelligent people know that they alone are responsible for their successes or failures.10. They don't close their minds. When people close their minds to new information or opinions, it's typically because they find them threatening. They think that admitting that someone else is right means that they're wrong, and that's very uncomfortable for people lacking EQ. Emotionally intelligent people aren't threatened by new things; they're open to new information and new ideas, even if it means admitting that they are wrong.11. They don't let anyone limit their joy. When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself with others, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel good about something they've done, they don't let anyone's opinions or accomplishments take that away from them. While it's impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don't have to compare yourself with others, and you can always take people's opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain--you're never as good or bad as they say you are.  12. They don't get eaten up by jealousy and envy. Emotionally intelligent people understand that the happiness and success of others doesn't take away from their own, so jealousy and envy aren't an issue for them. They see success as being in unlimited supply, so they can celebrate others' successes.13. They don't live in the past. Failure can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you'll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, failure results from taking risks and trying to achieve things that aren't easy. Emotionally intelligent people know that success lies in their ability to rise in the face of failure, and they can't do this if they're living in the past. Anything worth achieving is going to require your taking some risks, and you can't allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed. When you live in the past, that is exactly what happens--your past becomes your present and prevents you from moving forward.  Bringing It All TogetherImproving your emotional intelligence is the single most important thing you can do to improve your life. The good news is that you can make it happen with a little determination, effort, and a good model to follow.What other things do emotionally intelligent people do (or not do)?

Right and left will be quaking in their boots after contemplating the following twisted tales! [Cue: shrieking and chains clanking]Because we've already traveled this road once (last year's frightful horror stories already involved none other than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton), we decided to make it hard on ourselves today. This is because the horrorshow on both right and left is so easy to imagine for everyone, at this point, that they could fit on a couple of tweets: ""For GOP -- President Hillary Rodham Clinton!"" and ""For Dems -- email scandal throws election to Trump!"" So instead of taking things easy, we've instead decided that the Republican nightmare will begin with Trump winning and the Democratic nightmare will start with Clinton winning the election. This made coming up with these fearsome tales more challenging, we felt.One apologetic note, before we begin. Each year, we take the time to carve pumpkins into Jack-o-lanterns, to accompany our nightmares. Sometimes they come out looking like what they're supposed to, sometimes not so much. So, just in case anyone can't interpret the first of these, that's supposed to be the White House with a giant ""TRUMP"" sign on the top of it. As we discovered, the White House is a lot harder to carve onto a pumpkin than we had initially thought. Just wanted to avoid confusion for everyone.OK, enough apologizing for poor pumpkin art (Trumpkin art?), lets get right to our haunting tales of dread and woe for Republicans and Democrats alike. We tossed a coin, and it determined that the GOP frightful fable would be first. So buckle your seatbelts, here we go....Republican Nightmare -- Jobs for all!Donald Trump's campaign turns out to be right, and millions of ""shy Trump voters"" (who are too embarrassed to admit to pollsters that they're supporting Trump, thus skewing all the polls in Hillary's direction) actually exist -- and they turn out on Election Day, bigly. Trump sweeps Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Florida, Iowa, Arizona, and Nevada to squeak out a victory in the Electoral College.Hillary Clinton turns out to be the one who refuses to concede on the night of the election, and demands recounts everywhere. Even after the recounts, however, it becomes apparent that she lost and Donald J. Trump will be our next president.Republicans cautiously rejoice, as they all breathe a collective sigh of relief. Their House majority is saved, and they even retain the Senate, 51 to 49. This, they all tell themselves, will assure a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for decades to come.Trump's transition team, however, begins to frighten Republicans to their core. Trump's first major announcement is that he will be appointing his daughter Ivanka as his new Chief of Staff. ""She's going to run the White House beautifully,"" Trump assures America. His sons are appointed Special Counsels, and Trump shocks Washington by announcing that these are the only advisors he is ever going to listen to at all -- his Cabinet won't have any input to his decisions whatsoever. ""I have a much better brain than anyone, so I'll be making all the big-league decisions,"" Trump helpfully explains.Chris Christie is nominated for Attorney General, who immediately announces that he'll be appointing none other than Rudy Giuliani as ""Special Clinton Prosecutor,"" who will have an unlimited budget to investigate every aspect of both Clintons' lives, back to when they were in grade school. This reassures nervous Republicans.Trump has ""the classiest inauguration ever,"" complete with scantily-clad dancing girls (who all come down with pneumonia, after performing outdoors in the 20-degree weather in January). Trump immediately begins construction of a giant, gold-plated ""TRUMP"" sign on the White House roof, to the horror of pretty much everyone.After the Senate confirms Christie, he also announces several other measures that Trump has demanded. First, the I.R.S. will be directed to hound every name on Trump's new (and official) ""Enemies Of The Trump State"" list, which -- to their horror -- includes every single Republican officeholder who didn't fully endorse Trump, as well as every Republican alive who has ever said anything mean or nasty about Trump. The list also has a few Democrats on it (Rosie O'Donnell's name is actually the first on the list), but over three-fourths of the names are from the GOP. Trump promises them they're all going to get ""the audit from Hell,"" just to make things worse.Republicans are united in their outrage towards Trump, but they all know that if they say anything negative about him they'll be painting a giant target on their own backs, so none of them ever go on the record opposing Trump's enemies list.Trump then shocks the country by naming his own sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, to the Supreme Court. Because he knows the Senate might refuse to confirm her, he sneakily appoints her while the Senate is in recess, meaning she'll serve at least until the end of his term without having to be confirmed at all. Trump insists she is qualified, since she's already a senior federal appellate court judge. But what really horrifies Republicans is that she's both pro-choice and downright liberal -- not exactly what they had expected to see on the high court from a Republican president.Congressional Republicans try to take the reins of power, by hastily passing a budget with every single one of the items they've been dreaming about for years -- eliminating the E.P.A., declaring Planned Parenthood a criminal enterprise, slashing entitlement programs, and revising the tax code so that millionaires are absolutely exempt from all federal taxes. In other words, the basic Republican Party platform.But President Trump surprises them all by vetoing it. Borrowing a tactic from Maine's Governor Paul LePage, Trump declares that from now on he himself will be introducing all the bills Congress will then be required to pass, and that he'll veto any and all legislation that his sons and daughter didn't actually draft. He unveils his first bill, which outlines how he's going to build his border wall and threaten Mexico with nuclear war if it doesn't pony up all the money to pay for it. ""If you don't pass my bills,"" Trump warns Congress, ""then you might as well just go home and not even bother coming in to work, because I won't be signing any of your stupid bills at all.""Russia announces it is annexing Ukraine. Trump praises Vladimir Putin for doing so, saying, ""that's a bold bit of leadership, and Ukraine wasn't doing anybody any good as it was."" Trump has Putin over for a barbeque on the White House lawn, and after the two leaders meet behind closed doors for three hours, they issue a joint statement on the Middle East. Russia is awarded full military control over Syria, and President Trump explains, ""Putin has promised to wipe out everyone who doesn't support Assad, so that takes care of ISIS."" Putin struggles to control his maniacal grin while Trump talks. Trump also announces that all high schools in America will now require students to be fluent in Russian before they can graduate. Putin tries to stifle his laughter behind his hand, unsuccessfully.Trump then announces to the rest of the world that the United States will be pulling our military out of all foreign bases, effective in one month's time, unless they all start paying what Trump calls ""protection money"" to the U.S. Treasury. ""Nice little country you got there,"" Trump sneers, ""it'd be a shame if anything were to happen to it.""The world's economic system collapses within days. Every other country on the planet immediately dumps all holdings in America and liquidates all reserves of the U.S. dollar. As the dollar collapses in value in the currency markets, the smart money starts buying Russian rubles and Chinese yuan.President Trump insists that everything is going to plan, and with the dollar virtually worthless outside America, ""now all the jobs have to come back home."" This is true -- American companies simply can't afford to operate the way they have been, and to compete in America they know they'll have to make all their products within the country's borders.However, it being the twenty-first century and all, they actually have another option. The result is that 499 of the Fortune 500 corporations announce within the week that they will be moving their companies overseas permanently, and will still sell products in America -- but will only accept foreign currency to buy these products. The exodus of companies causes further collapse to the U.S. economy.Congress belatedly acts, and begins impeachment proceedings against Trump, but they have waited too long. President Trump announces martial law (due to the rioting and looting which has broken out in all 50 states over the collapse of the economy), and federalizes not only the National Guard, but all police forces, everywhere. All members of Congress are rounded up and sent to ""re-education camps.""In the end, Trump does make good on his promise of ""jobs for all"" as half of the country is arrested and sent to the labor camps, while the other half now enjoys job security as prison guards. The era of the American gulag begins, and Trump proclaims himself ""President-For-Life.""Democratic Nightmare -- Queen Hillary The FirstHillary Clinton wins the presidential election with more Electoral College votes than Barack Obama managed to get in 2008. Democrats rejoice at a third consecutive term in the White House. Democrats also retake control of the Senate, but fail to win the 30 seats necessary to take the House. Donald Trump threatens ""massive lawsuits,"" but by this time nobody is paying the slightest bit of attention to him. Like most threatened Trump lawsuits, they never actually happen. Trump crawls back to New York and starts up an alt-right media empire.Once the dust from the election settles, Hillary Clinton reverts to form. In the transition period, she announces she's naming 23 former Wall Street banking executives to be her economic advisory team. A former Goldman Sachs executive is her pick for Secretary of the Treasury. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren hold a joint press conference to denounce Clinton's picks, and when Clinton is asked to respond, she just laughs loud and long. ""What did they really expect?"" she finally gasps, with tears running from her eyes from the laughter. In the midst of this, the announcement that Bill Clinton will be in charge of hiring all White House interns goes almost unnoticed. Hillary further announces that Rahm Emanuel will be her Chief of Staff, much to the progressives' horror. Hillary fills out her cabinet with former members of the ""Democratic Leadership Council"" from the 1990s, and announces her legacy will be a return to neo-liberalism, and her White House will be ""as friendly as can be"" to Big Business. As if this weren't bad enough, she decides to nominate Henry Kissinger as her Secretary of State.Inauguration Day dawns cold and snowy. This time around, Chief Justice Roberts actually reads from an index card, so he gets the wording of the presidential oath correct. However, Hillary muffs her lines slightly, and has to hold a second swearing-in hours later as Republicans scream: ""She's not the legitimate president!"" to anyone who will listen. At the Inaugural Ball, Hillary Clinton appears with a suspiciously-large diamond tiara, and instructs everyone that officially meeting her now means people should either bow or curtsey before she will acknowledge their presence.On her first day in office, President Clinton announces she is issuing a blanket pardon for any and all crimes either she or her husband may or may not have ever committed. ""Republicans can just chew on that -- there is now no point in investigating anything which happened prior to today,"" Clinton proclaims. Congressional Republicans howl, but since there is no precedent and since pardoning yourself and your husband is not actually banned by the Constitution, she gets away with it.Clinton's first 100 days absolutely horrify all progressive Democrats. She begins by pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership through the Senate, breaking the first of many campaign promises. When asked about this flip-flop, Clinton blithely responds: ""You guys actually believed I was against the 'gold standard' of trade agreements? Wow -- you're stupider than you look!"" Clinton also names a former corporate lawyer for Lehman Brothers as her Supreme Court nominee. It is quickly discovered that he has spoken and written extensively on how much he approves of the Citizens United decision, crushing progressives' hopes for a less corporate-friendly Supreme Court. When Bernie Sanders pushes a ""free public college for all"" bill through the Senate, Clinton responds with: ""What have you guys been smoking? That ain't gonna happen."" The bill dies in the House, of course. Clinton also announces that her Justice Department will be prosecuting any businesses and people involved in the recreational marijuana market in Colorado, Washington, ""and all those other hippie states that think they can ignore federal law.""Clinton unveils her first budget, and Democrats recoil in shock. Hillary has rewritten the tax laws so that anyone in the banking industry pays a flat ""one-percenter's one percent"" in federal income tax. The bigger shock is that Clinton presents her first budget in a joint appearance with Speaker Paul Ryan. ""I promised to be president for all Americans, and in that spirit I am reaching out to Republicans with this bipartisan budget."" What this means is that Clinton and Ryan have reached the fabled ""Grand Bargain"" on taxes and entitlements. Social Security payments will be drastically reduced, in exchange for only lowering taxes on the wealthy by five percent, instead of the twenty percent Republicans wanted. ""This is the best deal I could get,"" Hillary explains to aghast Democrats, ""and I think we should all join together and pass it.""Clinton announces her foreign policy goals in her first weeks in office, which include immediately instituting a no-fly zone over Syria. Additional aircraft carriers are sent to the Mediterranean to enforce the new ""Operation America Owns Syria's Skies."" Two months later, a Russian fighter is shot down by an American pilot. Russia immediately begins targeting the aircraft carries with cruise missiles.Hillary Clinton makes a fiery speech, quoting Maggie Thatcher at length. Clinton declares that ""America will not be pushed around,"" and gives the Russian military 24 hours to vacate Syria. Putin laughs at this, and lobs a few more cruise missiles (so far, Putin has only been launching his older missiles with conventional explosives on them, which the carriers can easily shoot down). In retaliation, Clinton launches a massive carpet-bombing of all Russian bases within Syria.Within hours, panic spreads in both countries. Millions flee coastal cities deemed to be military targets in the United States, and ""flyover country"" becomes the most attractive destination, deep within America's borders. Seeing such disruption, and at the very brink of nuclear war, both sides slowly back down. Clinton is forced to end her no-fly zone over Syria, while the Russians only agree to stop attacking American military units.The panic lasts weeks, however, and takes a very heavy toll on the economy. Stock markets tank, tens of millions are fired (or don't show up to work, having fled to the interior), and the dollar collapses.Hillary Clinton, at this point, seems to suffer a mental breakdown. In a bizarre ceremony, she announces that due to the emergency, America can no longer afford to have any divisions within its government, and she is thus seizing all power and naming herself ""Queen of the United States."" Her Inauguration Ball tiara is upgraded to a solid gold crown, encrusted with diamonds and other precious gems. Clinton announces that future elections simply won't be necessary, since she will be in full control of all the levers of power in an absolute monarchy.Her last statement before ending the coronation ceremony is that Chelsea will henceforth be known as ""Crown Princess Chelsea,"" and that the secession of power will continue only within ""the House of Rodham."" In the midst of these shocking developments, nobody pays much attention to the seventeen interns who get caught having an orgy with Bill and Donald Trump Jr. in the Rose Room of the White House.Have a happy Hallowe'en everyone!Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigant"

We apologize to her.”Streeter, who has written song for artists including Usher and Ariana Grande, revealed that team had decided not let her perform in the shirt in a video published to Twitter on Wednesday night. Afterward, she told the Associated Press that she felt “extremely, extremely angry, and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it. It broke my heart.”Streeter added that she believes the U.S. cannot continue to silence protests that hope to improve the treatment of people of color in the country.“We live in the greatest country in the world, but there are issues that we cannot ignore,” she said. The 76ers’ first statement on its refusal to let Streeter perform, released shortly after the Wednesday night game, did not deny her account of the incident. Rather, it said the organization wanted to “move from symbolic gestures to action.”To try and right its wrong, the team has offered to let Streeter sing the anthem at a game of her choosing. The organization has yet to hear back. "
