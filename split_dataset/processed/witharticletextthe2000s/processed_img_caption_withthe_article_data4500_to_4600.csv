Huber tweeted a photo of his cardboard friend back in January.Huber is a car salesman from West Palm Beach, Florida, according to Reuters.During Friday’s rally, Trump pointed to him in the audience, saying he saw Huber earlier on the news talking about his love for the president. Then he invited him onstage to speak to the crowd.“’You’re great,’ is what he told me,” Huber told CNN when asked what Trump whispered to him onstage.Huber explained that he had been waiting for the president since 4 a.m. that day, which, consequently, led to him being interviewed by news reporters before the rally. “I told the reporter that I love President Trump and President Trump heard me say that and he told me that onstage,” Huber told CNN. “And he said that he loves me.”Some claim that Trump’s team staged Huber’s appearance at the rally to get more press, pointing to a Facebook post Huber sent days earlier, with a Trump Winery location tag.Huber’s interview with CNN was mostly friendly, considering that his idol continues to call the outlet, among other news organizations, “fake news.”But the car salesman wasn’t going to let CNN get off easy.As the interview ended, Huber asked if he could say one last thing and Brown agreed.He said: “Let’s just be a little, little nicer to our president.”"

He talks about other black people in the same way. In his absolute gentleness and pacifism, his ideas spoke directly to the DuBoisian “double consciousness,” imagining compositions to play into the ears of Fanon and Wilderson as they mourned the humanity that black people never had.Sun Ra was never a human; he was a myth.In invoking our friend Sun, I hope to begin to explore some of my own ideas around “future,” “art,” and how these things intertwine in service to black people.I am writing from Cape Town, South Africa, where black people have been subjugated on their lands, and within their societies and cultures. Racialized violence in Cape Town is different than violence perpetrated across the black diaspora, on other colonized continents, and even in African nations that were colonized by European countries with strategies of assimilation, rather than segregation. But no matter where we are, racism and the process of racialization – whether as a system invented purely to maintain and support capitalism, or as a social relationship of dominance (existing despite capitalism) to maintain the “psychic health” of white bodies – exploit and dehumanize black people in order to benefit and “humanise” whites.In the face of racism and the threat of having his humanity stolen, Sun Ra found a way to be himself. Ra was himself in the kind of radical way that Fanon proposes might only happen through a re-enactment of violence upon the oppressor. Somehow, through his creative practice, Ra managed to, of course, make weird, sometimes hilarious and always otherworldly sounds – but more than that, he worked so hard on making a space in which that creation was possible. It might have been outer space, or ancient Egyptian history, or numerology that helped him in forming this world. But his unwavering assertion was that here, on planet Earth, in the midst of these oppressive and violent forces, he would not be provided with the resources he needed as a maker, and the vibrations he required as a creator.And so, Sun Ra became a myth in the present. He was not interested in the so-called “humanity” defined for us here, a humanity that only exists where it finds its antithesis in the exploits and abuses of others. Whiteness, masculinity, cisgendered-ness, nondisabled-ness, heterosexuality, wealth – these constructs are still the measurements for how we determine how close to or far from the ideal “human” we are. Sun Ra took one look at that picture, shook his head, and was like “nah.”Sun Ra did something that I love so much, something that I also try to do – he took his imagination very seriously, and he allowed his fantasies to form the departure point for his work. This, I feel, is radical. Essentially, he used his imagination as the infrastructure and the resource base from which to create actual things that are still available to us now. What I am saying is that Ra drew on imagination, knowledge and ideas from histories, stories and religions that came before him without limitation on how he brought all of these together into his own vision. And I really think that we can do this, too – and actually already do.So I suppose that in thinking through the really difficult question, What is the importance of art for black people throughout the world?, I would prefer to address it in a very vague sense. That is to say, to me, the things we make are not significant. It is the creation of the space in which making is possible that is so crucial. And to create those spaces, we must do the impossible and find each other in the cracks of the system – find each other as wholes beings who remain whole within the world against all odds. From this impossibility, creation emerges.What I am framing as “impossible space,” might also be described as spaces in which we, often alienated black folk, feel seen. We exist in this impossibility all the time – amongst friends, family and good conversation – but we also create these spaces by more overt means. We create impossible space in the occupation of land and the re-appropriation of places and buildings as acts of resistance. Impossible space collides with the status quo, and living within it can pose danger to an establishment whose prerogative is in benefitting through the exploitation of us as bodies, and the exclusion of us as humans.Oppressed people, those of us who have been “othered” and ousted simply need more space for our imaginations to live, produce children, cultivate and comfort each other, laugh and be well fed. I do not want to step into a fully-fledged fantasy of what art could be for black people “in the future,” because I think that we each have an idea of what these spaces feel like in the present. I think we just need more of them, and I think we need to be safe within them.So, while my fantasy is not full on, I will paint a little picture that illustrates some of the ways I feel art should be used. The art practices I imagine would have a different name (which I am still working on), and these different practices would be useful, communal and fun; our objects would not need to be precious because the spaces in which they are made would be safe, and reliable and always available to hold and honor more process and more production. There would be no art “status quo.” And while whiteness might always come hand in hand with hegemony, a useful art production is absolutely anti any socio-cultural reproduction. For this reason, spaces are multiple and varied, nobody is bored and everything is in flux. Art does not function as separate from anything else. It lives among us and informs and helps us think through our lives. We use art to think about our approaches to learning, thinking, seeing and conscientising, and we use these other processes to inform our “art.”For me, this future is about microcosms of impossibility, ruled by black people – myths – with ideas that produce spaces that produce things that produce ideas that produce spaces that produce ideas and so on. It is easier than we think to invite people to come and make things with us in our personal parallel universes. We are all in existence as we speak, and like Sun Ra, it’s time that we begin to think of ourselves as “impossible,” here, as myths of the present.This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network.

This week he introduced SB328, a bill that would require California school districts to start middle and high school classes no earlier than 8:30 a.m.“Every year we discuss as parents, educators, and legislators, best practices and interests of the children and education,” says Portantino. “Well, data is clear: starting the school day later improves the quality of education, health, and welfare of our children. So let’s do it.”The average school day for middle and high school students in California starts at 8:07 a.m., with commute times considerably earlier. These very-early hours were established largely to save money on bus costs before schools understood teen sleep needs and patterns. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 4 in 5 American secondary schools start the day before 8:30 a.m., with nearly 10% of high schools requiring attendance before 7:30 a.m.The result is a public health and equity issue right up there with child labor, smoking, and seatbelts. According to the nonprofit advocacy organization Start School Later (which, full disclosure, I co-founded and now direct) restoring more traditional school start times — as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Association (AMA), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other medical and education experts — is a practical and necessary solution with broad and immediate benefits for children of all ages.Start School Later has nearly 90 chapters across the U.S.A., including a statewide California chapter led by Irena Keller, PhD, adjunct professor of child and adolescent development at San Jose State University, and local chapters in Chico, Los Angeles, Redlands, and San Diego.LEGISLATION TO HELP LOCAL DISTRICTSIf passed, Portantino’s bill will ensure that the more than 3 million public middle and high students in California can go to school at times that allow them to get a healthy night’s sleep, have time for breakfast, commute to school after sunrise, and arrive at school ready to learn. It would also be a model for many other states and municipalities around the country that have been unable to restore developmentally appropriate school hours on their own.Local school districts must, of course, set their specific schedules. However, in many districts local resistance prevents school leaders from acting on the strong body of scientific evidence showing that sleep, and school hours that allow for healthy sleep, are critical to health, safety, and academic achievement. (Those who want help might also benefit from an upcoming national conference on teen sleep and school start times, which includes leaders from districts that have navigated this change successfully.)Parameters for developmentally appropriate school hours would be consistent with the many other state regulations for local districts, including requirements about the number of days and hours students must be in class. To date, however, no state has provided clear guidelines for safe, healthy school hours, although Maryland and New Jersey recently passed legislation to study or incentivize later school start times.Last year, Maryland passed the “Orange Ribbon for Healthy Schools“ bill to create a no-cost incentive program to recognize districts moving to later bell times. At the federal level, California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren has also repeatedly introduced versions of a “ZZZ’s to A’s“ Bill and Resolution to the U.S. Congress — all unsuccessful to date — proposing limits on the hours at which American high schools can begin required instruction.MORE SLEEP = MORE SUCCESSA large, broad, and consistent body of evidence shows that moving middle and high school bell times later gives more students more (and better) sleep and reduces rates of sleeping in class, mood swings, depression, stimulant and illegal drug use, and car crashes, as well as suspensions, tardies, absences, and drop-outs.Just this month a new study of 30,000 teenagers across 29 schools in 7 states showed that two years after moving bell times to 8:30 or later, the average graduation rate moved from 79% to 88%. According to study author Pamela McKeever, EdD, the study’s findings linking later bell times to improved attendance and graduation rates raise questions for school officials about “whether later start times are a mechanism for closing the achievement gap.”In California, as in many states, improved attendance would also benefit districts financially because school funding is tied to attendance. By improving current attendance by just 1%, The Los Angeles Unified School District would gain an estimated $40 million per year, funds that could be re-invested in schools to benefit students.NOTE: An earlier version of this article was published in Huffington Post Education on February 15, 2017.Visit Our Website | Sign Our National Petition | Join Our Newsletter | Follow us on Facebook | Join a Chapter | Make a DonationFollow Terra Ziporyn Snider, PhD on Twitter: www.twitter.com/terraziporyn"

No such event has happened.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a8f4302900002200f2752e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump falsely suggested at a Florida rally Saturday that Sweden had suffered a terror attack the previous night.After announcing that the White House planned to renew its efforts to restrict immigration, Trump cited several European countries and cities that he said showed the dangers of admitting immigrants, particularly refugees. “You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” Trump told a large crowd of supporters in a hangar at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport. “Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden,” he added. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”Trump’s subsequent remarks made clear he was referring to European locales that had endured terrorist attacks in the past two years.“You look at what’s happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the world,” he said. “Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.” Observers on Twitter pointed out that no such attack took place on Friday night.Others concluded that Trump had been referring to a segment on the Fox News show “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” which explored an alleged rise in crime following Sweden’s admission of a large number of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.Sweden, which has a population of around 10 million, has let in nearly 200,000 asylum seekers in response to the wave of refugees arriving in Europe that peaked during the summer of 2015.Sweden does not grant asylum to all applicants. Nonetheless, the generous policy, which has proved controversial, means the Scandinavian country has taken in more refugees per capita than any other European nation.The people Sweden has allowed to enter come mainly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, countries undergoing devastating conflicts.UPDATE: Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Sunday that Trump was “talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general, and not referring to a specific incident.”Sanders added that the president had been “referring to a report he had seen the previous night.”Trump himself weighed in shortly thereafter to clarify that he was indeed referring to the Fox News segment about immigration in Sweden:CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that Sweden has a population of around 9.5 million. In fact, it is estimated that about 10 million people live there."

Roosevelt’s signing of the executive order that authorized the internment of 120,000 men, women, and children of Japanese descent during World War II. As we contemplate the actions of the Trump administration in matters pertaining to national security, it is imperative that we remember and reflect upon this lesson from the past.In the immediate aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, there was no clamor for the mass internment of persons of Japanese descent. To the contrary, shortly after Pearl Harbor, Attorney General Francis Biddle assured the nation that there would be “no indiscriminate, large-scale raids” on such individuals, and Congressman John M. Coffee expressed his “fervent hope” that “residents of the United States of Japanese extraction will not be made the victim of pogroms directed by self-proclaimed patriots.”In the weeks that followed, however, a demand for the removal of all persons of Japanese ancestry—citizens and non-citizens alike — exploded along the West Coast. The motivations for this sudden outburst of anxiety were many and complex. In part, this demand was fed by panic-driven fears of a possible Japanese invasion of the mainland. Conspiracy theories abounded, and neither government nor military officials did anything to allay these anxieties.General John L. DeWitt, the top Army commander on the West Coast, reported as true a fabricated report of an imminent uprising of 20,000 Japanese Americans in San Francisco. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover publicly dismissed this hysteria as unwarranted, and Attorney General Biddle repeatedly reiterated that no person would be detained “on the score of nationality alone.”Public agitation for a mass evacuation of all persons of Japanese ancestry was inflamed, however, by a California legislative manifesto that purported to connect the ethnic Japanese with an alleged fifth column, asserting that even ethnic Japanese born in this country are “totally unassimilable” and insisting that every American of Japanese ancestry had primary allegiance “to his Emperor and to Japan.”On January 4, 1942, newspaper columnist Damon Runyon falsely reported that a radio transmitter had been discovered in a rooming house that catered to Japanese residents. Who could “doubt,” Runyon asked, the “continued existence of enemy agents” among the Japanese population? On January 14, Republican Congressman Leland M. Ford demanded that “all Japanese, whether citizens or not, be placed in inland concentration camps.”Such demands were further ignited by the Report of the Commission on Pearl Harbor, which was released on January 25, 1942. Hastily researched and written, this report falsely asserted that persons of Japanese ancestry had engaged in espionage and facilitated Japan’s attack on the United States. Although these assertions were unfounded, the report played a key role in turning Americans against Americans. Shortly after the report was released, Henry McLemore wrote a column in the San Fransisco Examiner calling for “the immediate removal of every Japanese on the West Coast.” He added: “Personally, I hate the Japanese. And that goes for all of them.”On February 4, California Governor Culbert Olson declared in a radio address that it was “much easier” to determine the loyalty of Italian and German aliens than of Japanese Americans, and that “all Japanese people, I believe, will recognize this fact.” California’s Governor, the Mayor of Los Angeles, and most members of the West Coast congressional delegations now demanded that all persons of Japanese ancestry be removed from the West Coast.California Attorney General (and future Supreme Court Justice) Earl Warren argued that, unlike the situation with respect to Germans and Italians, it was simply too difficult to determine which Americans of Japanese ancestry were loyal, and which were not. General DeWitt added that, “you needn’t worry about the Italians, except in certain cases” and “the same for the Germans.” But “a Jap’s a Jap.”In early February, Attorney General Biddle, resisting growing pressure for internment, informed President Roosevelt that J. Edgar Hoover had concluded that the demand for mass evacuation was based on “public hysteria” and rampant misinformation. Biddle added that the Department of Justice “would have nothing to do” with any mass evacuation of Japanese Americans.The public clamor on the West Coast, however, continued to build. American “patriots” began to commit ugly acts of vigilantism and vandalism against Japanese Americans and their property. On February 19, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. Over the next eight months, 120,000 individuals of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of whom were American citizens, were ordered to leave their homes. They were assigned to temporary detention camps, which had been set up in converted race tracks and fairgrounds. Many families lived in crowded horse stalls, often in unsanitary conditions. Barbed wire fences and armed guard towers surrounded the compounds.From there, the internees were transported to one of ten permanent internment camps, which were located in isolated areas in wind-swept deserts or vast swamplands. Men, women, and children were placed in overcrowded rooms with no furniture other than cots. And there they remained for three years. Many of these families lost all of their possessions, to say nothing of their liberty and their dignity.The public rationale for the decision, laid out in the Final Report on the Evacuation of the Japanese from the West Coast, was that time was of the essence and that the government had no reasonable way to distinguish loyal from disloyal persons of Japanese descent. This report has rightly been condemned as a travesty. It relied upon unsubstantiated and even fabricated assertions.Why, then, did Roosevelt sign the executive order? Undoubtedly, public opinion played a key role in his thinking. Although Roosevelt purported to explain the order in terms of military necessity, there is little doubt that domestic politics played a role in his thinking. 1942 was an election year. Roosevelt was not prepared to stand up to the growing panic, even though he knew it to be based on false information and public hysteria.In Korematsu v. United States, decided in 1944, the Supreme Court, deferring to the judgment of military authorities, upheld the constitutionality of the Japanese internment. In a memorable dissenting opinion, Justice Frank Murphy courageously declared that “no adequate reason is given for the failure to treat these Japanese Americans on an individual basis, as was done in the case of persons of German and Italian ancestry. . . . I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism.”In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Robert Jackson insisted that the Court must not “distort the Constitution to approve all that the military may deem expedient,” adding that “once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the Constitution, . . . the principle then lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.”On February 19, 1976, as part of the celebration of the Bicentennial of the Constitution, President Gerald Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4417, in which he acknowledged that, in the spirit of celebrating our Constitution, we must recognize “our national mistakes as well as our national achievements.” “February 19th,” he noted, “is the anniversary of a sad day in American history,” for it was “on that date in 1942 . . . that Executive Order 9066 was issued.”President Ford observed that “we now know what we should have known then” – that the evacuation and internment of loyal Japanese American citizens was “wrong.” Ford concluded by calling “upon the American people to affirm with me this American Promise – that we have learned from the tragedy of that long-ago experience” and “resolve that this kind of action shall never again be repeated.”In 1983, Congress appointed the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to review Executive Order 9066. The Commission unanimously concluded that the factors that shaped the internment decision “were race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership,” not any genuine military necessity. The Commission recommended that “Congress pass a joint resolution, to be signed by the President, which recognizes that a grave injustice was done and offers the apologies of the nation for the acts of exclusion, removal and detention.”In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which officially declared that the Japanese internment was a “grave injustice” that was “carried out without adequate security reasons” and without any documented acts of “espionage or sabotage.” The Act offered an official Presidential apology and reparations to each of the Japanese-American internees who had suffered discrimination, loss of liberty, loss of property, and personal humiliation because of the actions of the United States government. Over the years, the Supreme Court’s decision in Korematsu has become a constitutional pariah.As we move forward in the face of a president’s call for a “Muslim ban” and who knows what else in the future, it is imperative that we remember, reflect upon, and remain eternally vigilant against our capacity to do evil in the name of national security."

After Homer asks where it went, Bart suggests, “Maybe another animated show stole it?”Homer decides to go on a quest to retrieve the painting, which Lisa dismisses as a “derivative” work of art. After he leaves, Bart admits to the rest of the family, “Or maybe I sold it on Craigslist.”Homer’s first stop in his search for the painting is a place that looks a lot like “South Park,” inhabited by four children modeled after Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Stan. Homer says mockingly, “Is this a TV show, or did I walk into a third grade shoebox diorama?”The kids start shouting in indecipherable mumbles punctuated by multiple censor bleeps. Homer laughs and jokes, “Out of the mouths of babes.”Television’s most recognizable father figure then goes on to find “The California Raisins” ― whom he accidentally murders in an Indiana Jones-style face-melting ― and a “Robot Chicken” character that ends up having the sailboat painting. Homer steals the painting back and runs through the raisin blood to return to the “South Park” world.As he arrives, Homer runs through all the children with gritted teeth. “South Park” is, of course, famous for repeatedly killing off the Kenny character and then bringing him back as if nothing has happened. The kids are probably all right.Back in the Simpson household, Lisa is hanging up “Girl with a Pearl Earring” in the sailboat’s place. When Homer announces his triumph, Marge grumbles, “Oh [beeped curse word].” Perhaps the quest was for naught. Here’s a screengrab from the moment Homer starts his “South Park” massacre.In 2006, “South Park” ran a two-part episode called the “Cartoon Wars,” which was basically a full-out attack on “Family Guy.” “South Park” creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker essentially skewered the “Family Guy” writing staff for creating jokes based entirely on randomness.Bart Simpson also made an appearance in the special. “South Park” characters made fun of Bart for having an unearned badass persona, and Cartman told him about the time he made a kid eat his own parents.“The day after that episode aired, we got flowers from ‘The Simpsons,’” Parker told IGN at the time. “We got calls from ‘King of the Hill,’ saying we were doing God’s work. It’s not just our opinion.”Green, the creator of the new couch gag and the voice of Chris Griffin on “Family Guy” since 1999, may finally be getting revenge for the old “South Park” episode. In 2014, “The Simpsons” and “Family Guy” had a crossover episode. They’ve shared Fox’s Sunday night lineup for almost two decades.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article claimed the crossover episode between “The Simpsons” and “Family Guy” happened in 2017 instead of 2014."
10,POLITICS,Ray Buckley Drops Out Of DNC Chair Race And Endorses Keith Ellison,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ray-buckley-endorses-keith-ellison_us_58a87e21e4b037d17d285e88,"With a week left, the field is winnowing.",2017-02-18,"Ray Buckley speaks during a Democratic National Committee forum in Baltimore, Maryland, on Feb. 11.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a8806b290000f616f27499.jpeg?cache=W71hSlXVcY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley is ending his bid to chair the Democratic National Committee and throwing his support behind Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.).“From the moment I stepped into this race, I made it clear that the top two priorities of the next DNC Chair must be to strengthen state parties and reform the DNC,” Buckley said in a statement on Saturday. “Many candidates have spoken about these issues, but Keith’s commitment to the states and a transparent and accountable DNC has stood out. He knows elections are not won and lost in the beltway, but on the ground across the country.”“And here’s the thing, we both have a track record of winning elections,” the veteran New Hampshire Democrat added.Ellison also praised Buckley’s record of building up the Democratic Party in New Hampshire in a statement announcing the news.“There is no better example of a strong state party than the New Hampshire Democratic Party, and we have Ray Buckley to thank for that,” Ellison said. “Throughout this race I’ve heard loud and clear from DNC Members that this is a moment to use all our talents to rebuild the party from the grassroots up. That is why I am proud to have Ray’s support.The DNC’s 447 voting members will vote on the next chair and other top offices at a meeting in Atlanta next Saturday.Buckley’s decision is a boon to Ellison as the contentious race to chair the party winds down and it previews the deal making that will likely dominate the final stretch. On Tuesday, Ellison’s chief rival in the race, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez made his own show of strength, claiming to enjoy the support of 180 voting members. (A candidate needs a 224-vote majority to clinch the chairmanship in the first round of voting.)Zach McNamara, a spokesman for Buckley’s campaign, confirmed that the New Hampshire Democratic Party chair would be encouraging the DNC members who support him to get behind Ellison. “Ray is of course going to strongly encourage his supporters to back Keith next Saturday in Atlanta, and we’re confident Keith will have the support to win,” McNamara said in an email message. The Granite State party chair’s endorsement will also have benefits for Buckley, however, whose candidacy failed to gain traction in a race dominated by Ellison and Perez, who both enjoy major national backing.Ellison and Buckley were discussing a deal in which Buckley would assume some operational responsibilities at the DNC, NBC News reported on Tuesday. Their final agreement would have Buckley head the rejuvenation of the Democratic parties of the 50 states and seven territories, including the District of Columbia.“Once we’re successful, Keith has asked Ray to lead the DNC’s effort for a new and innovative 57-state strategy to strengthen our state parties, which will obviously be a prime focus of the new DNC,” McNamara said.Buckley will likely take up that task in his capacity as president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, which he has led since 2009. He is running for re-election as head of the governing body again this year. Elections will take place in Atlanta on Saturday shortly after the DNC office voting.Buckley, a proud operations wonk with deep knowledge of the nuts and bolts of running a party, is also a vice chair of the DNC in his capacity as ASDC president. He is the first openly gay man to hold either position.Under Buckley’s leadership, the New Hampshire Democratic Party has expanded its power significantly. Democrats have won 11 out of 13 of the last statewide races, and the party’s four members of Congress are now all Democratic women.Buckley’s departure narrows the field of DNC chair candidates to nine. In addition to Buckley, Ellison and Perez, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown; South Carolina Democratic Party chair Jaime Harrison; media strategist Jehmu Greene; Robert Vinson Brannum, Veterans Committee chair of the NAACP’s Washington D.C. branch; Milwaukee attorney Peter Peckarsky and Ohio activist Sam Ronan are all vying for the top post. When a party controls the White House, the president typically selects the DNC chair. But following a defeat, it is often the object of internecine party struggle, as candidates clamor to shape party direction and strategy.With Democrats at a historic nadir in their political power, having lost both houses of Congress, the presidency and an enormous number of state legislature seats and governorships, this year’s race to chair the DNC has become especially competitive. The contest has turned into something of a proxy battle between the party’s more progressive, populist wing and its more business-friendly establishment. Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have largely gotten behind Ellison, who endorsed the Vermont senator in the 2016 presidential primary. Perez, who backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has gotten more traction among Clintonites.Some voting members responded to news of Buckley’s endorsement with suspicion, suggesting that Ellison appeared to have exchanged clout within the organization for the New Hampshire chair’s blessing. (Ellison and Buckley’s campaigns both deny this assertion, reiterating that Buckley’s new responsibilities would be limited to an initiative rejuvenating state parties.)Isabel Framer, a voting DNC member from Ohio who endorsed Perez on Saturday, sent an email Thursday to her fellow DNC members, criticizing Tuesday’s NBC News report on talks between Buckley and Ellison.“This isn’t the ‘new DNC,’” wrote Framer, who runs an organization near Akron that helps non-native English speakers with judicial interpretation.On Saturday, Framer said she had not heard about the Buckley and Ellison campaigns’ denials that Ellison had given Buckley a DNC post for his support. But she again shared her worries.“To me, it sounded like he was being hired for a position,” she said. “If there’s gonna be a new DNC, then make sure it’s a new DNC. It’s not right to say, ‘You guys are doing this,’ and then turn around and do what you’re accusing the DNC of doing.”David O’Brien, a political consultant and voting DNC member from Massachusetts, was indignant. He wondered whether Buckley would in fact be heading a state-level initiative for the DNC without additional compensation of some kind.“I don’t like the way it looks and I don’t like the way it smells,” O’Brien said of Ellison’s deal to secure Buckley’s endorsement. After last Saturday’s DNC regional forum in Baltimore, O’Brien was deciding between Perez and Ellison, but his suspicion that Ellison has a deal with Buckley had soured him on the Minnesota congressman, he said Saturday. He is now choosing between Perez and Buttigieg.This article has been updated with more details, including comment from McNamara and DNC members."

An unidentified bystander quickly moved away, but a Cook County sheriff’s guard rushed over to grab the attacker by the waist and pull him off Jones.Jones was charged with fatally shooting Takiya Holmes as she sat in the backseat of her family’s parked van on Chicago’s South Side last Saturday. Prosecutors said Jones and other members of the Black Disciples gang had opened fire on intruders selling drugs in their territory. One of the bullets pierced the van and struck Takiya in the head, officials told the Chicago Sun-Times. She was hit in the right temple as she sat next to her 3-year-old brother. She died in her mother’s arms after the family took her off life support Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune reported.Jones turned himself in to police on Tuesday.The surveillance video shows Jones awaiting his appearance in court in a holding section of the courthouse, apparently handcuffed to a chair. A man wearing the clothing of a Cook County Jail inmate suddenly punches Jones a number of times in the head.Chicago police identified the attacker as Renard Williams, 24, who is also facing murder charges. It’s not clear why the attack occurred.Jones declined to press charges against Williams in the attack. Williams was issued a disciplinary ticket, Cook County sheriff’s spokeswoman Cara Smith told the Sun-Times. Williams has been “a challenging detainee” since he was jailed in August, according to Smith, racking up punishment for various jail infractions.Jones was later ordered held without bail, and he was placed in protective custody at Cook County Jail. Williams continues to be held in the maximum security section of the jail.Chicago saw 762 homicides in 2016, the highest in nearly 20 years. And now, just weeks into 2017, the notoriously violent city is reeling from a number of child murders as victims become trapped in the crossfire of raging gang violence or battles over drug turf. Kanari Gentry-Bowers, 12, was shot last Saturday as she played basketball. A short time later, Takiya was struck. Kanari died Wednesday.On Tuesday, 2-year-old Lavontay White Jr. was fatally shot in the head when the car he was in riding in was ambushed in what police believe was a gang-related attack. The shooting was streamed live on Facebook."

But the supposedly load-bearing wires she was attached to high above the stage didn’t end up working as planned.“There was a very dangerous day right at the end of filming when I was in this excruciatingly painful harness,” Andrews told Colbert, as she pointed upward. “And I was hanging around up there for the longest time with the umbrella.”After floating in the sky for quite some time, Andrews sensed the wires giving out on her.“I thought I felt the wire leave [and] drop about six inches ... I was nervous,” Andrews recalled. “So, I called down and I said, ‘Excuse me, when you do let me down, could you let me down really gently, because I felt myself slip and I just don’t feel too safe up here.’”The crew called back that they would be sure to bring her down very softly.That’s not what ended up happening.“I plummeted to the stage,” Andrews said. “And there was an awful silence for a minute and I did let fly with a few Anglo-Saxon four letter words, I have to admit.” The actress smiled at this polished admittance of crassness, much to the delight of the studio audience. Although Poppins takes flight a few times in the movie, you can likely see the scene Andrews is referring to in her first introduction to the children. Typically when Poppins is flying, the character is completely still (due to rudimentary special effects), but Andrews’ body is moving around while flying with the umbrella near the end of this clip:"

He just landed the role of Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Han Solo “Star Wars” movie. Of course, Disney now owns the rights to that franchise as well.Glover’s two Golden Globe wins earlier this year, for the creation and lead acting role in his new show, “Atlanta,” are contributing to the young actor’s rise.Jones, meanwhile, has voiced Mufasa multiple times since he first lent his talents to the original Disney movie. His voice appears in a “Lion King” video game, short side clips, and the sequels “The Lion King 2: Simba’s Pride” and “The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar.”The actor also recently reprised his speaking role as the villainous Darth Vader in Disney’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.”Hopefully Jones and Glover can pull off a father-son dynamic in “The Lion King” that has less of an underlying dark side than the one in “Star Wars.”It remains unclear when the new version of “The Lion King” will finally debut."

Our Black children see everything that is happening, and we’re teaching them how to prepare for what is coming and get them ready to fight back against the system. I bring my son, Justice, to marches and actions, so he sees what his Black mother must do for her child and what he must later do for himself. When I started working at KFC, I saw the parents working alongside me, and I knew that if I couldn’t make it on my paycheck, there was no way that they could make it with theirs. I’ve always lived in poverty, but living in poverty and having someone depend on me is a completely different story. So one day, I stood up and I said something. And I haven’t looked back.“We are fast food workers who deserve more money and a union. I’m from Brooklyn and I’m making $7.25, and rent is $1300. They need to raise the wage,” I nervously told a reporter standing outside of a McDoanld’s on 42nd Street in New York. That was four years ago. I had no idea that my personal fight for myself and for my son would grow into a movement challenging economic inequality and poor working conditions for thousands of workers.Later, I sat in the very first meeting for the Fight for 15 with some of my coworkers. We wanted better pay, and we wanted a lot more fixed in our workplace. People were getting burned at work and their hours were cut without reason or warning. We’d been letting these corporations give us the bare minimum for too long. It was time to stop letting them tell us what we should have, and start speaking out for what we need. Only we can decide that. In that first meeting we agreed that we had to declare what we wanted – a $15 wage and union rights.There are 64 million workers paid less than $15 an hour in the United States. That’s nearly half of the American workforce that is paid less than $15. These low-wage jobs are some of the fastest growing jobs in our economy, whether fast food, child care, home care, retail, airports, etc. These jobs do not pay enough for people to provide for themselves and their families without some kind of public assistance.People have asked me if I feel like I have nothing to lose. They’re often referring to my job, as though a low-wage job is nothing to lose. They often don’t understand that I do still have bills to pay and a family to provide for. I work for these companies that make millions and I can barely afford a place to live, but I have to do something to survive. At the same time, if i don’t fight for this, I’m going to wind up losing myself. If I don’t fight, I see myself as they see me, expendable, and nothing ever gets better for anyone, including my son. No, I don’t feel like I have nothing to lose. But more importantly, I feel like there is no alternative but to fight and win – for myself, for my family, for all of us.And sometimes this fight has felt like losing. There have been times when I have talked to workers who were “good with $8/hr.” Those moments felt like a nail in my heart. Some people outside of fast food said that $15 is too much, that it is crazy. Yet they complained about not being able to make ends meet. But I keep going. And those harder moments feel farther away.Now, people are seeing that we can win, because it is happening. I wonder what the people who didn’t believe in this change think now, now that we are a movement.We’ve won raises for 22 million people – $62 billion in increases. We’ve been waiting for elected officials to change laws and create policies for us for decades. What we’ve seen in this fight is that we can stop waiting and start leading – and the politicians and the corporations will follow. Unlikely politicians, like Governor Cuomo and Rahm Emanuel, supported increases in the minimum wage because they saw people taking action.But there are still 44 million people who haven’t gotten raises. Even with a $15 wage, we still need union rights.The Fight for 15 has brought together tens of thousands of workers under the same umbrella for better wages and improved working conditions. We got in the streets, we went on strike, we’ve been arrested, and we’ve connected with other workers from different industries, because we believe that this is bigger than wages – this is our lives and our children’s lives.This movement has changed me into an entirely different person than I was when we started, and it’s changed the conversation about workers’ rights and wages in this country. We must show the world that we can keep changing ourselves and changing the system for Black futures.This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network.

As the violence unfolded on those dark nights, I tried to console myself in the belief ― one day, I won’t have to live in a world of terror and violence. There is something worse than the actual violence, when you are a child ― it is the pervasive feeling of powerlessness.Domestic violence is a punctuation of my story, but its not the essence of who I am. One of the greatest moments of my life was that instant that recognized my strength, and the inherent power to chose how I would live my life. Folks who have been through something - understand what it means to push through the veil of fear, and discover who we really are, and the depth of our power. Cayla Mills offers us powerful truth “You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.”So when Mr. Trump presided over the most bizarre press conference I have ever seen, on Thursday, February 16, I saw inflections of a kind violence, I’ve seen before. When asked if he intended to work with members of the CBC (Congressional Black Caucus) by April Ryan, a distinguished African-American journalist, a powerful woman, Mr. Trump’s demeanor visibly changed, as he became viciously irate. In a near threatening tone - he asked Ms. Ryan if “she knew them” (because you know all black people know each other – pardon my sarcasm). He treated her as if she was a minion, asking if she would set up a meeting for him. Black women are accustom to these virulent moments - poised, she checked him with professionalism and declined his assignment.As I was convincing myself to calm the hell down, telling myself throwing my iPad at the television probably wasn’t a good idea, Mr. Trump hurled another insult to someone else. This time it was Jake Turx, who happens to be a Hasidic Jew. Mr. Turx wanted to discuss policy, but 45 abruptly cut him off –- and tangentially launched into a defense of his loyalty to the Jewish community, as though he had been accused of anti-Semitic. Like I said, bizarre.Still, this is not a rant about 45, Mr. Trump.I am wondering what are we going to do as citizens of the USA, as people of every ethnic origin, folks of every gender expression, LGBTQ people, people of every faith tradition and many others; what are we going to do in this moment?In the face of ballistic racism, rising anti-Semitism, xenophobia, sexism, Islamophobia, how are we going to respond in this moment? In the last two weeks, synagogues have received 48 bomb threats. Federal authorities are investigating. We also know incidences of hate crimes have surged since November 9, 2016.No, this moment is not necessarily about 45. This is about us, and the choices we need to make. What kind of world do we want to live in? Do we recoil, with the illusion ― since it’s not happening to us –- we will be okay. When an African-American woman is disrespected in the White House, all of us have been disrespected. When the safety of Jewish communities are in jeopardy, all of us are in jeopardy. When Islamophobia is the new badge for patriotism something has gone terribly wrong. Martin Neimöller’s is yelling at us ― with his poem First They Came….”Believe me when I say, I am no longer the terrified little boy growing up South-Central Los Angeles whose only prayer was to escape violence -– feeling totally powerless. Like many others - who have come through something, I awoke to the reality - that the Creator of all things has endowed me with tremendous power to effect change in my life, my family, community, and beyond - if I choose to access my God-given strength.We have a choice to make. Either we see our commonality, across every community, and take on the complicated and gut-wrenching work of racial justice, and stand against every form of injustice or, we remain silent, and by default, chose the tyranny of hatred. Do we have to wait until it is our daughter, son, partner or loved one that is victimized by hatred’s effect?Protests, demonstrations happening around the world gives me hope. Still, I am convinced we have to do more. Standing against what we refuse to accept through resistance is essential. We also need to commit ourselves to build a new reality for the world we want. The choice is ours.Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline ."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a747da2900002200f2721e.jpeg?cache=TZy8ZA3ztN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Much has been made of the monetary cost of President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall. Trump himself has cited wildly differing estimates. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recently said that the wall would cost $12 billion to $15 billion. Some experts have cited numbers far higher.But the wall’s true cost surpasses even the biggest numbers being discussed. There’s upkeep, of course — hundreds of millions of dollars per year will be needed to maintain the 1,000-mile barrier. There are other expenses, too, some of them intangible and difficult to quantify.The political blowback could be significant. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has already canceled a meeting with Trump over the wall, calling it a sign of disrespect. (Mexico is America’s third-largest trading partner and a close ally.) And the impacts on native tribes, border communities and migrant populations are projected to be immense.Then, there’s the potential damage to the environment, both locally and beyond. Environmentalists say the wall will contribute to climate change, disrupt natural water flows and profoundly affect native species and habitats.“Let me be blunt — there are no benefits of a border wall, and many risks,” Dan Millis, a coordinator of the Sierra Club’s borderlands program, told HuffPost in an email this month. “We don’t just have concerns about the border wall, we have impacts,” Millis said. “That’s because there are already walls and barriers along more than 650 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.” Existing fences have not served their intended purpose, he said, but have “already cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and have resulted in a wide array of unintended and damaging consequences.” Research suggests the existing barriers have not been effective at restricting the movement of people. A report released this week by the Government Accountability Office found that border fencing was breached more than 9,200 times from 2010 to 2015. The barriers, however, have proven to be a formidable foe to migrating animals. A 2014 study found that security barriers on the Arizona-Mexico border were doing little to prevent crossings by humans, but were restricting the movements of native species like pumas and coatis, a raccoon-like creature, thus limiting their access to food, water and habitat. “There was no significant difference in the number of migrants present in areas where there was a wall, compared to areas where there was no wall,” Jamie McCallum, the lead author of the study, told HuffPost in interview last year. “In other words, the wall did not seem to be doing the job it was intended for.” The barriers, however, could be driving some native species to “a possible collapse in population,” the study said. Migration corridors are critical for the health and survival of wildlife along the border. Endangered animals like jaguars and ocelots only live in the U.S. because of movements out of Mexico. Other species, including bighorn sheep, pygmy owls, gray wolves and black bears, travel back and forth across the border to access vital resources and to maintain genetic diversity. Clinton Epps, a wildlife biologist at Oregon State University, told the BBC last year that some species have been crossing the border for millions of years. A physical barrier, he said, could “fundamentally alter” the health and behavior of these populations. A wall also will stifle the ability of species to adapt to a changing climate. Imagine, for instance, if a herd of deer or an endangered species like the jaguar needed to move north or to a higher elevation in order to adapt to higher temperatures and lower rainfall. If “a wall impedes their movement, that particular herd ― or even an entire species ― is put at risk,” said Millis. Beyond the disruption to migratory movements, border infrastructure could also fragment and destroy habitats. Sergio Avila-Villegas, a conservation research scientist from Tucson’s Arizona Sonora Desert Museum, told the BBC that a wall would have “effects for the ecosystem as a whole”.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that 111 endangered species and 108 migratory bird species would be affected by an unbroken barrier along the entire land border between the U.S. and Mexico, reported Outside magazine. The bald eagle, California condor, several sea turtles and the West Indian manatee are among the species that would be potentially threatened by the wall. Natural water flows across the Mexican border also would be affected. Existing barriers have already led to problems like erosion, flooding and sedimentation in border communities. In Arizona, for example, border fences have been the cause of increased flooding. The border wall could additionally be a significant contributor of global warming. “The production of the concrete for a wall such as the one Trump has suggested would produce a lot of greenhouse gases, since cement production is a coal-fired, carbon-intensive process,” said Millis.According to the MIT Technology Review, Trump’s wall would contain some 9.7 million cubic meters of concrete and 2.3 billion kilograms of steel — the production of which would produce more than 7.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. “For some context, that’s the same as the emissions from 823,654 homes over the course of a year,” wrote the magazine. “And that’s on the low end: ongoing maintenance, re-routing of traffic, and other unforeseen consequences could all push the figure far higher.”Environmentalists say they are particularly concerned that Trump, thanks to a legal loophole, may be able to push through his plans for the wall with little or no environmental oversight.In 2005, during George W. Bush’s presidency, Congress passed a bill that allows the secretary of Department of Homeland Security to waive local, state and federal laws deemed to hinder the building of walls and roads along U.S. borders. The Sierra Club said on its website that the law has already been used “multiple times” by DHS to “waive in their entirety” 37 federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, National Historic Preservation Act and the National Forest Management Act. In 2008, then-Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff invoked the waiver to bypass environmental laws to build fences along more than 450 miles of the southern border. “With the stroke of a pen one individual has the ability to dismiss decades of protective laws passed by Congress and signed by presidents, all to circumvent local, state, and federal laws when constructing border walls,” the Sierra Club said. Melinda Taylor, an environmental law professor at the University of Texas, said Trump could exploit this loophole to devastating effect. “The new administration has a wild card they can pull and it’s in this law,” Taylor told CNN last month. “The language in this law allows them to waive all federal laws that would be an impediment to building any type of physical barrier along the border, including a wall.” If Trump does use this “wild card” to duck environmental protections, “it will be particularly tragic,” said Taylor. “If they really try to build a wall, without regard for environmental laws and without environmental impact statements, the effect of a border wall would be more catastrophic than a border fence.”______Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

Dave Brat had said.",2017-02-18,"Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) now says he could've chosen better words when he said women were in his ""grill"" over Obamacare repeal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a89f17290000f616f274cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) admits he “probably should not” have said that women were in his “grill” over Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Brat made the initial comments last month at a private event when discussing an effort on Facebook by his constituents to get him to hold a town hall.“Since Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,” he said. “They come up and say, ‘When’s your next town hall?’ And believe me, it’s not to give positive input.”During a Facebook Live broadcast on Tuesday, Brat said that he should have used different words.“So I shared it in a humorous, light-hearted gesture and people take it out of context. I meant no harm. I probably should not have repeated that phrase. In hindsight, I probably could have chosen much better words,” he said, according to the Culpeper Star-Exponent.Becky Shields, a mom and graduate student who was one of the organizers of the Facebook effort, told The Huffington Post Brat’s comments didn’t “address the root of the problem.”“He addressed the fact that he used a slang phrase, he did not address the fact that he used women as a punchline,” Shields said. “He did say, ‘Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to say in my grill,’ but he did not say that it wasn’t a good idea to make a joke out of his female constituents. That’s what he did when he used that phrase.”“I would urge the congressman to ask himself why women are in his grill no matter where he goes about Obamacare instead of focusing on the fact that he was called out for using slang awkwardly,” she added.Brat had also alleged, without evidence, that the people pushing him to hold a town hall were “paid activists.” Shields said last month the claim was “ludicrous” and that the people organizing the effort were concerned constituents who had full-time jobs.Angry constituents have confronted several other Republicans at town halls in recent weeks and the GOP politicians similarly claimed that they were paid protesters. There is no evidence to support the allegations.On Tuesday, Brat tried to walk back the suggestion that his constituents were paid protesters.“A small percentage of folks load up the Facebook with comments and you can kind of tell there’s an organized pattern at a certain time an email goes out, and all of a sudden you get 50 or 100 people reading off the same script,” he said.Shields said that Brat’s answer was just “verbal gymnastics” and “he needs to own that.”The pressure on Brat to hold a town hall appears to have been successful. After initially saying he was too busy, the congressman said this week that he would host an in person town hall on Tuesday.Shields said she plans to attend and ask him a substantive question (she’s interested to know where he stands on gender rating, the practice of charging men and women different prices for healthcare based on their gender and whether he believes pregnancy should be a preexisting condition).While Shields is happy that the pressure worked, she hopes that Tuesday’s town hall is the first of many.Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the outlet that reported on Brat’s Facebook Live broadcast. It was the Culpeper Star-Exponent."
23,POLITICS,Outdoor Gear Show Folds Its Tents Over Utah's Attacks On Public Lands,Chris D'Angelo and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/utah-outdoor-retail-show-public-lands_us_58a760ece4b07602ad548b2b,The retailers' move comes after Patagonia pledged to boycott the state over GOP plans to scrap a new national monument.,2017-02-18,The Winter Market of the Outdoor Retailers Show took place Jan. 11 at the Salt Palace Convention Center in Salt Lake City. It might be its last time there.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a7792c2800001f00999aca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The state of Utah just let a very big fish off its hook.After months of sparring with Utah politicians over their repeated attacks on public land protections, including the creation of Bears Ears National Monument, the world’s largest outdoor retail show has decided to part ways with Salt Lake City and find a new home.The decision was announced Thursday after officials of Outdoor Retailer, the Outdoor Industry Association, Patagonia, The North Face and REI participated in what clearly proved to be a fruitless teleconference with Utah Gov. Gary Herbert. “Salt Lake City has been hospitable to Outdoor Retailer and our industry for the past 20 years, but we are in lockstep with the outdoor community and are working on finding our new home,” Marisa Nicholson, show director for Outdoor Retailer, said in a statement. In its own announcement, the Outdoor Industry Association, one of several sponsors of the biannual event in Salt Lake, said it is clear the Republican governor has a different perspective ― one it feels is “bad for our American heritage” and the 1,200 businesses it represents.“It is important to our membership, and to our bottom line that we partner with states and elected officials who share our views on the truly unique American value of public lands for the people and conserving our outdoor heritage for the next generation,” Amy Roberts, executive director of Outdoor Industry Association, said in a statement. The biannual outdoor gear show has been held in Salt Lake for more than two decades. Each year, it draws hundreds of brands and suppliers, and roughly 40,000 visitors. It generates $45 million for the Salt Lake economy.In an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, a spokesman for Herbert said Outdoor Retailer’s decision is “offensive” and “reflects a gross ingratitude” for the city of Salt Lake. “It perpetuates the false narrative that Utah — a state that derives much of its inspiration and identity from its iconic public lands, a state that invests tens of millions of dollars into the protection of and access to its public lands — is somehow hostile to those public lands,” Edwards said in an email to the newspaper. “It shows how a political agenda, rather than reason or merit, seems to have captured the decision-making at the Outdoor Industry Association.”The association, however, says Utah has “a long history of anti-public land sentiment and action,” including supporting the transfer of public lands to the state and overturning a newly established monument.In December, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes (R) moved to sue the White House after President Barack Obama set aside nearly 1.4 million acres, including sacred tribal lands, to create Bears Ears National Monument. The Navajo Nation and conservationists, who pushed Obama to designate the monument before President Donald Trump took office, hailed it as a victory. But Reyes, later joined by Herbert and the state’s Republican lawmakers in Washington, blasted the move as a federal land grab and urged Trump to undo it.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told The Washington Post last month that Trump is “eager” to work with Republicans to undo the Bears Ears protections and that the new interior secretary has pledged to quickly address “this travesty.”Major outdoor retailers vowed to take action if the Republican leaders refused to stop challenging the designation. Patagonia, the upscale outdoor apparel giant known for its environmental activism, pledged to boycott the state. Peter Metcalf, co-founder of the gear chain Black Diamond Equipment, urged the Outdoor Retailer show, which he helped bring to Utah 20 years ago, to leave the state. Patagonia pulled out of the event earlier this month.“It would be totally unprecedented to rescind a national monument and designated public lands,” Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario told The Huffington Post at the time. “That, to me, is frankly a horror that anyone would be considering that.”The White House is not explicitly barred from altering a previous president’s designation, but such a move would be a first. Legal analysis by the Congressional Research Service suggests that presidents may adjust, but not completely abolish, a prior designation. The Utah fight comes as Republicans, emboldened by their November election sweep, and environmentalists stand at odds over the future of public lands. House Republicans made it easier to sell off public lands by voting to change how the government calculates the cost of transferring those parcels to states or private developers on the very first day the 115th Congress convened.In January, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) reintroduced a bill aimed at selling off 3.3 million acres of national public land in 10 states ― an area nearly the size of Connecticut. Less than two weeks later, however, facing a wave of public backlash, he withdrew the measure, saying “groups I support and care about fear it sends the wrong message.”Unsurprisingly Chaffetz’s decision has been hailed as a victory by conservationists. But it clearly wasn’t enough to convince Outdoor Retail to stick around. And neighboring Colorado already has its sights set on becoming the next host.In a newspaper advertisement published this week, Conservation Colorado touted the state’s “stronger beer,” “taller peaks” and love of public lands."

Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you which 10 phrases to avoid. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a72be825000026000b9b53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are some things you simply never want to say at work.These phrases carry special power: they have an uncanny ability to make you look bad even when the words are true.Worst of all, there’s no taking them back once they slip out.I’m not talking about shocking slips of the tongue, off-color jokes, or politically incorrect faux pas. These aren’t the only ways to make yourself look bad.Often it’s the subtle remarks—the ones that paint us as incompetent and unconfident—that do the most damage.No matter how talented you are or what you’ve accomplished, there are certain phrases that instantly change the way people see you and can forever cast you in a negative light. These phrases are so loaded with negative implications that they undermine careers in short order.1. “This is the way it’s always been done.” Technology-fueled change is happening so fast that even a six-month-old process could be outdated. Saying this is the way it’s always been done not only makes you sound lazy and resistant to change, but it could make your boss wonder why you haven’t tried to improve things on your own. If you really are doing things the way they’ve always been done, there’s almost certainly a better way.2. “It’s not my fault.” It’s never a good idea to cast blame. Be accountable. If you had any role—no matter how small—in whatever went wrong, own it. If not, offer an objective, dispassionate explanation of what happened. Stick to the facts, and let your boss and colleagues draw their own conclusions about who’s to blame. The moment you start pointing fingers is the moment people start seeing you as someone who lacks accountability for their actions. This makes people nervous. Some will avoid working with you altogether, and others will strike first and blame you when something goes wrong.3. “I can’t.” I can’t is it’s not my fault’s twisted sister. People don’t like to hear I can’t because they think it means I won’t. Saying I can’t suggests that you’re not willing to do what it takes to get the job done. If you really can’t do something because you truly lack the necessary skills, you need to offer an alternative solution. Instead of saying what you can’t do, say what you can do. For example, instead of saying “I can’t stay late tonight,” say “I can come in early tomorrow morning. Will that work?” Instead of “I can’t run those numbers,” say “I don’t yet know how to run that type of analysis. Is there someone who can show me so that I can do it on my own next time?”4. “It’s not fair.” Everyone knows that life isn’t fair. Saying it’s not fair suggests that you think life is supposed to be fair, which makes you look immature and naïve. If you don’t want to make yourself look bad, you need to stick to the facts, stay constructive, and leave your interpretation out of it. For instance, you could say, “I noticed that you assigned Ann that big project I was hoping for. Would you mind telling me what went into that decision? I’d like to know why you thought I wasn’t a good fit, so that I can work on improving those skills.”5. “That’s not in my job description.” This often sarcastic phrase makes you sound as though you’re only willing to do the bare minimum required to keep getting a paycheck, which is a bad thing if you like job security. If your boss asks you to do something that you feel is inappropriate for your position (as opposed to morally or ethically inappropriate), the best move is to complete the task eagerly. Later, schedule a conversation with your boss to discuss your role in the company and whether your job description needs an update. This ensures that you avoid looking petty. It also enables you and your boss to develop a long-term understanding of what you should and shouldn’t be doing.6. “This may be a silly idea …/I’m going to ask a stupid question.” These overly passive phrases instantly erode your credibility. Even if you follow these phrases with a great idea, they suggest that you lack confidence, which makes the people you’re speaking to lose confidence in you. Don’t be your own worst critic. If you’re not confident in what you’re saying, no one else will be either. And, if you really don’t know something, say, “I don’t have that information right now, but I’ll find out and get right back to you.”7. “I’ll try.” Just like the word think, try sounds tentative and suggests that you lack confidence in your ability to execute the task. Take full ownership of your capabilities. If you’re asked to do something, either commit to doing it or offer an alternative, but don’t say that you’ll try because it sounds like you won’t try all that hard.8. “This will only take a minute.” Saying that something only takes a minute undermines your skills and gives the impression that you rush through tasks. Unless you’re literally going to complete the task in 60 seconds, feel free to say that it won’t take long, but don’t make it sound as though the task can be completed any sooner than it can actually be finished.9. “I hate this job.” The last thing anyone wants to hear at work is someone complaining about how much they hate their job. Doing so labels you as a negative person and brings down the morale of the group. Bosses are quick to catch on to naysayers who drag down morale, and they know that there are always enthusiastic replacements waiting just around the corner.10. “He’s lazy/incompetent/a jerk.” There is no upside to making a disparaging remark about a colleague. If your remark is accurate, everybody already knows it, so there’s no need to point it out. If your remark is inaccurate, you’re the one who ends up looking like a jerk. There will always be rude or incompetent people in any workplace, and chances are that everyone knows who they are. If you don’t have the power to help them improve or to fire them, then you have nothing to gain by broadcasting their ineptitude. Announcing your colleague’s incompetence comes across as an insecure attempt to make you look better. Your callousness will inevitably come back to haunt you in the form of your coworkers’ negative opinions of you.Bringing It All Together These phrases have a tendency to sneak up on you, so you’re going to have to catch yourself until you’ve solidified the habit of not saying them.What other phrases should be on this list? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

The entire landmass of the Philippines is made up islands, making it the second-largest archipelago in the world. In fact, the Philippines has approximately 7,500 islands with only 2,000 of them inhabited and nearly 5,000 still unnamed on global maps. (Source) 2. There are about 175 languages spoken in the Philippines, with 171 of them considered “living,” while four tribal dialects have no known living speakers. The country’s official languages are Filipino (based on Tagalog) and English, with Cebuano and Ilocano also popular in some regions. (Source) But when Filipinos interact with tourists and foreigners, it’s easy for them to speak English since it’s the fifth largest English-speaking nation behind the U.S., India, Pakistan, and the U.K. (Source) 3. About 11% of the population of the Philippines – more than 11 million people – work overseas. In fact, the Philippines is the top supplier of nurses in the world, with about 25% of all overseas nurses coming from the country. In the United States, Filipinos are the second-largest Asian-American group behind only Chinese. (Source) 4. Filipinos are crazy about basketball! You’ll see makeshift hoops erected on every street corner, young men commonly wearing NBA jerseys, and local teams playing in every community hall. Their professional league, The Philippines Basketball Association (PBS) is the second oldest in the world after only the NBA! In fact, a good number of players with U.S. college and NBA experience come to play in the PBA. (Source) 5. Filipino’s also love boxing with a passion, and when their most famous native son, Manny Pacquiao, fights, it’s like a national holiday. In fact, Filipinos are so supportive of “PacMan” that every time he has a boxing match, the Philippine National Police report that street crime drops to zero in Metro Manila, and the same is true in most of the country. (Source) 6. The Philippines produces and exports more coconuts than any country in the world, shipping off about 19.5 million tons of the fruit (called “buko”) every year. (Source) 7. While most of their Southeast Asian neighbors practice Buddhism, the Philippines is the only Asian nation that's predominantly Christian, with 90% practicing that religion (and about 80% of its population, Roman Catholic) because of its Spanish colonial influence. (Source) 8. Filipinos are very social, spending as much time as possible with family and friends. But they also stay in touch these days by exchanging a whole lot of text messages. In fact, it’s estimated that Filipinos send about 400 million text messages every day, adding up to about 142 billion texts per year, earning them the designation “the texting capital of the world.” (Source) That’s more than the total number of daily text messages sent in the U.S. and Europe combined. (Source)9. One of the most remarkable geological formations in the world, the Taal Volcano consists of an island (Luzon) that contains a lake (Taal Lake) with a smaller island in the lake (Volcano Island) with a lake on that island (Main Crater of Taal Volcano) with another tiny islet (Volcano Island) inside! (Source) 10. The Philippines population crossed the 100-million threshold in 2014, ranking as the 12th most populous country in the world. With an annual growth rate of about 2 percent, it’s also one of the fastest growing countries in the world. (Source) 11. Manila, the capital of the Philippines, ranks as the city with the highest population density in the world (and some of the worst traffic congestion!). In fact, Manila spans only 24 square miles but has 1,660,714 residents, giving it a population density of 55,446 people per square mile. (Source) Metro Manila, comprising several other conjoined cities, stands at more than 12,877,000 people, making it one of the most populated metropolitan areas in the world. (Source) 12. The Philippines island of Palawan has been named one of the best island in the world by Condé Nast Traveler, Travel & Leisure, and other publications, thanks to its jaw-dropping natural beauty. Visitors can explore white sand beaches, swim in lagoons, enjoy island hopping in Coron and El Nido, find some of the best scuba diving in the world, and even traverse the underground river in the capital, Puerto Princesa, a UNESCO world heritage site and the second longest underground river in the world. (Source) 13. The country suffered one of the largest volcanic eruptions in history on June 15, 1991, when Mt. Pinatubo erupted only a couple hours from Manila. The blast was so powerful that it shot 10 billion metric tons of magma and 20 million tons of toxic sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, 25 miles high. (Source) Mt. Pinatubo’s sent such a big mushroom cloud of ash into the atmosphere that it created a haze of sulfuric acid all around the world for two years, causing global temperatures to drop by 1 degree Fahrenheit! Tragically, the eruption killed at least 847 people, injured 184, and left more than 1 million people homeless, as well as forcing an American air force base to be abandoned and relocated soon after. (Source) 14. Jeepneys are a unique form of transportation that many people in Manila and other places in the Philippines use every day. In fact, jeepneys were born from the thousands of army jeeps that the U.S. military left after World War II. Resourceful Filipinos extended the cabs to accommodate about 18 passengers for hot, bumpy and dusty rides through the streets. As time went on, drivers adorned the jeepneys in colorful and creative designs to help them stand out, with flashing neon lights, paintings of favorite superheroes, basketball stars, cartoon characters, religious sayings, and just about every other gaudy decoration you can imagine. Still costing only about 8 Pesos (20 cents U.S.), about 50,000 jeepneys run daily in Manila alone, billowing thick clouds of black smoke. They don't have set routes, so passengers just jump on a jeepney going in their direction, pass a coin forward to the driver, and ring a bell when they want to get off. (Source) 15. Filipinos LOVE their shopping malls! In fact, they serve as community hubs since they’re clean, safe, and, most importantly, air-conditioned. Aside from the usual stores they also have countless food venues, gyms, grocery stores, banks, health clinics, nightclubs, parks, concert amphitheaters, and even churches inside their malls. In fact, the Philippines is home to three of the ten largest shopping malls in the world, The Mega Fashion Hall of SM Megamall (third-largest in the world, encompassing 5,451,220 sq ft), SM City North EDSA (fourth largest) and SM Mall of Asia (tenth largest). (Source) 16. Even among the countless natural wonders of the Philippines, the island of Camiguin stands out since it’s home to the most volcanoes per square mile of any island on Earth. Only about 14 miles long and 8.5 miles wide, Camiguin holds the distinction as the only island on the planet with more volcanoes (7) than towns (5). It's now a great tourist destination with white-sand beaches and friendly locals, but don't worry – the volcanoes have been dormant since the 1950s. (Source)17. Travelers and vacationers flock to the paradise island of Boracay, known for having one of the best beaches in the world with powder-like white sand. Only 3.98 square miles, the island still receives about 1.5 million visitors from home and abroad every year, making it the most popular destination in the Philippines. In fact, Boracay has celebrated as the best islands in the world in a Condé Nast Traveler reader’s poll, as well as highlighted in Travel + Leisure Magazine, CNN, the New York Times Travel, and others. (Source) Here are 50 facts about the best island in the world, Boracay.18. Typhoons wreak havoc in the Philippines nearly every year, and in 2013, it was Super Typhoon Haiyan (called Yolanda locally) that ripped through the archipelago. Haiyan brought the strongest winds ever recorded at landfall as well as the strongest one-minute sustained wind speed of 195 mph. Sadly, it was also the deadliest typhoon in Philippines history, killing at least 6,100 people and displacing millions according to government reports (although locals estimate the death toll to be closer to 15,000, and a thousand people are still missing). (Source) Coincidentally, I was living on Boracay when Typhoon Haiyan slammed the Philippines, and you can watch my home video of it here.19. Politeness is an art form in the Philippines. Most foreigners will be referred to as “sir” and “mam” no matter their age. You’ll see younger people refer to the women and men a little bit older as “ates” and “kuyas” (sort of like older sister or brother, respectively). Filipinos respect and cherish their elders, and that shows in many ways in everyday life. For instance, seniors are addressed as “po” after please, thank you, and other exchanges, with the younger person taking the elder's hand and touching it to their forehead in a charming display of reverence called “mano.” Elderly, disabled, and pregnant women even have their own line at banks, restaurants and taxi queues, allowing them to bypass the crowd. However, their politeness can go a little too far, as you’ll rarely hear a Filipino come out with a direct “no” answer when you ask them a question, a trait that can create many challenging and hilarious situations for the foreigner! (Source)20. Filipinos are warm, happy, and have a great sense of humor! In fact, the Philippines is one of the happiest countries in the world, ranking near the top on Gallup’s index. (Source) Filipinos also have an uproarious sense of humor, as joking, lighthearted banter, and even singing makes every day in their presence a true blessing. As some Filipino friends have pointed out to me, it’s an inherent trait that helps them cope with such poverty, hardship, and natural disasters. No matter the reason, life in the Philippines is all about smiling, laughing and enjoying every moment with those around you! These are just a small portion of incredible facts about the Philippines, which I find one of the most remarkable countries on earth.

28,BLACK VOICES,'Hidden Figures' Director On 'Hidden Fences' Flub: 'It's Not That Funny',Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hidden-figures-director-weighs-in-on-hidden-fences-controversy_us_58a74c5ae4b07602ad5472c9,"He laughed at first, then he thought about it.",2017-02-17,"The cast of ""Hidden Figures"" with director Ted Melfi, accepting their SAG award in January. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a7706625000017600b9cd1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ted Melfi, director of “Hidden Figures,” has finally weighed in on the infamous “Hidden Fences” controversy. At January’s Golden Globes, both Michael Keaton and red carpet host Jenna Bush referred to the film as “Hidden Fences,” mistakenly combining the title of Melfi’s movie, about black women’s contributions to NASA, with Denzel Washington’s “Fences.”The flubs launched hilarious memes on social media, but also criticism over Hollywood’s inability to differentiate between two films with predominantly black casts. Melfi says his initial reaction to the mistake was to laugh. “You laugh about it. You say, ‘Oh that’s funny.’ And then... it’s not that funny,” Melfi told The Huffington Post.“You start to analyze it. Is it misspelled on the teleprompter? You think, well if that’s the case, it’s even worse.”But ultimately, Melfi says he believes that the “Hidden Fences” debacle was just a mental flub on the part of Bush and Keaton.“At some point you just chalk it up to the fact that people make mistakes. You just move on.”But while the director has moved on from the meme, he still believes that the tendency to lump movies with black casts together is a prevalent problem, and one that needs to stop. “I get upset when I hear ‘black film,’” Melfi says.“And so does Taraji P. Henson. Taraji will always say to me, ‘I’m sick of this. I’m sick of hearing ‘black film.’ Why can’t we just call it a film?’” “Hidden Figures” will compete for the ‘Best Picture’ trophy at next Sunday’s Academy Awards. "
29,HEALTHY LIVING,Air Pollution Linked To Millions Of Premature Births Around The Globe,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/premature-births-air-pollution_us_58a725b2e4b07602ad5422d1,Africa and Asia were the worst affected.,2017-02-17,The image above shows the percentage of total preterm births associated with outdoor PM exposure in 2010. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a74880290000f616f27222.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If protecting the environment alone wasn’t reason enough to take measures to reduce air pollution, the massive global health implications of rising preterm birth rates certainly should be. Each year, 15 million babies around the world ― that’s roughly 1 in 10 infants ― are born prematurely, according to the World Health Organization.Along with factors like poverty and maternal health status, new research suggests that air pollution is a major risk factor for births occurring at 37 weeks or earlier. The findings, published last week in the journal Environment International, showed that 2.7 million preterm births across 183 countries in 2010 were associated with a common air pollutant known as fine particulate matter, or PM. PM is a dangerous form of air pollution consisting of tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and can cause air to appear hazy. Primarily released from sources like diesel vehicles and agricultural waste-burning, PM can penetrate deep into the lungs and contribute to the development of health problems. “This study highlights that air pollution may not just harm people who are breathing the air directly ― it may also seriously affect a baby in its mother’s womb,” Dr. Chris Malley, a researcher at the University of York and the study’s lead author, said in a statement. “Preterm births associated with this exposure not only contribute to infant mortality, but can have life-long health effects in survivors.”For the study, researchers from Sweden, the U.S. and the U.K. looked at data on air pollution levels in different countries, analyzing PM levels by region. Then, they compared PM levels with what scientists know about a mother’s risk of having a preterm baby based on her level of air pollution exposure.Countries in Africa and Asia were the most deeply affected by pollution-related preterm births, with 75 percent coming from South and East Asia. India alone accounted for roughly 1 million of the 2.7 million pollution-related preterm births. In terms of overall preterm birth rates globally, India ranks number one, followed by China, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States.A woman living in urban India or China may inhale as much as ten times more air pollution than someone living in rural England, for example, the study’s authors note. The researchers admit that it’s difficult to determine the exact causes of preterm birth, and that more research is needed, especially in places like India and China, to more clearly determine the risk factors. Preterm birth can have significant short and long-term health implications. It’s the top cause of death among children under five years old, and has also been associated with learning and developmental disabilities as well as an increased risk of psychiatric disorders. "

This week, the “30 Rock” star returns to the silver screen with his movie “Fist Fight” ― his first acting role since he was part of a multi-car crash on the New Jersey Turnpike in 2014. The comedy film, which stars Charlie Day, Ice Cube, Jillian Bell, and Morgan, follows two high school teachers Andy Campbell (played by Day) and Ron Strickland (played by Cube) on the last day before summer vacation. After he accidentally causes Strickland to be fired, Campbell is challenged to an after-school fist fight to settle the score.For Morgan, getting back into the game was challenging. “I struggled at first because I didn’t know if I had my comedic timing or if my instincts were there, and I was afraid,” he said during an interview with HuffPost. “I had to face my fears. I didn’t know. I was on the couch for a year and three months. I hadn’t been active. So to come back and do that, I had a cast and director around me that supported me and gave me the comfort and love that I needed to move forward. And that’s what I did.”The 48-year-old added that director Richie Keen and his cast mates were supportive and encouraging along the way. Earlier this month, Morgan made a surprise appearance in a sketch on the Feb. 11 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” proving that he’s still got it. He’s currently developing a FX comedy pilot with Jordan Peele, and plans to debut his Netflix stand-up comedy special, “Stayin’ Alive” on May 16.Welcome back, Tracy!“Fist Fight” is now playing in theaters."

His attorney, Charles Longstreet II, had earlier filed a notice of intent to assert the insanity defense.Prosecutors said Green will face a possible 45 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced in March.“He wanted to get it over with,” Longstreet told reporters after the hearing, according to The Associated Press.Green’s guilty plea comes roughly 24 years after he admitted responsibility in court for the stabbing deaths of his first wife and unborn child, police said. In that case, he pleaded no contest to second-degree murder. He was paroled eight years ago.Green committed his latest crimes at his Dearborn Heights residence on Sept. 28, 2016. Court records state that he killed his two daughters — 4-year-old Kaleigh and 5-year-old Koi — by poisoning them with carbon monoxide fumes.“They were asphyxiated in a car with a makeshift tailpipe hose that was redirected into the vehicle,” Dearborn Heights Police Lt. Michael Krause told the Detroit Free Press in September.Green’s two stepchildren ― 19-year-old Chadney Allen and 17-year-old Kara Allen — were fatally shot. The teens were killed in front of their mother, 49-year-old Faith Green, who was forced to watch, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office.Authorities were summoned to the scene when Gregory Green called 911. He reportedly told the operator that he’d killed his entire family. However, when investigators arrived on the scene, they discovered that Faith Green had survived being shot and attacked with a box cutter.“All of this seems to have stemmed from a domestic violence related incident,” Dearborn Heights Police Capt. Michael Petri said at a September press conference.Court records indicate Faith Green was in the process of divorcing her husband.Authorities said the 911 call this past fall was eerily similar to one that Gregory Green placed on July 14, 1991, in which he confessed to killing his then-wife Tonya Green. At the time, she was seven months pregnant with their child. Authorities said she was stabbed nearly a dozen times with a steak knife.According to The Detroit News, Gregory Green was denied parole four times in his first wife’s death, with the board citing a lack of empathy and remorse. He was finally paroled in 2008 and two years later married his second wife. Green likely won’t live to see another parole hearing. Per the terms of his plea agreement, he will not be eligible for parole until he is 97 years old, “The plea was given with the express approval of Faith Green, the mother of the children, and the father of the two Allen children,” Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy’s office said, according to MLive.com.David Lohr covers crime and missing persons.

38,POLITICS,Nobody Seems To Have Liked Working For Donald Trump’s New Labor Pick,Alexander C. Kaufman and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexander-acosta-labor-secretary_us_58a7370de4b037d17d277bdd,Alexander Acosta's record at the Department of Justice and in academia raises some concerns.,2017-02-17,"Former U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta holds a news conference about the arrest of seven people in Miami, June 23, 2006.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a74775290000f616f27218.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In 2014, R. Alexander Acosta, President Donald Trump’s second pick for U.S. secretary of labor, became a top candidate to lead the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law. But after the interview process began, faculty at the school rejected the former U.S. attorney and assistant attorney general under President George W. Bush, citing ethical concerns and questions about his ties to Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), a tea party favorite who has railed against what he calls “liberal academic theorists.”“We had a number of concerns to start off with,” Michelle Jacobs, a distinguished professor of law at the school who helped lead the inquiry, told The Huffington Post. “In the end, we weren’t comfortable with him.”If confirmed, Acosta would lead more than 17,000 employees as secretary of labor, a position meant to protect the rights of American workers. The Labor Department was established in 1913 ― two years after the infamous fire at New York’s Triangle Shirtwaist Factory left 146 people dead ― following decades of bloody clashes between workers and industry barons. As secretary, Acosta would be tasked with improving wages, benefits and working conditions for U.S. workers, and administering more than 180 federal laws and thousands of regulations.But his record during the Bush administration raises major questions about Acosta’s ability to oversee the proper enforcement of labor laws and regulations. Acosta’s name pops up frequently in a Justice Department Inspector General report focused on hiring practices in the Civil Rights Division, which Acosta headed from August 2003 to June 2005. During the Bush administration, the Civil Rights Division’s work was deeply politicized, and there was a mass exodus of career employees. An Obama transition team report said the Civil Rights Division had been “demoralized and damaged” by “oppressive” political appointees who were “hostile” to civil rights enforcement.When Acosta headed up the Civil Rights Division, a man named Bradley Schlozman was put in charge of the hiring process. Just before Acosta took over the division, Schlozman sent an email to a former colleague referring to Voting Section lawyers as “mold spores” and “crazy libs” whom he hoped to “gerrymander” out of the section. During Acosta’s tenure, Schlozman sent an email to another Acosta deputy that mentioned an interview with “some lefty who we’ll never hire” and questioned whether applicants were conservatives. “As long as I’m here, adherents of Mao’s little red book need not apply,” Schlozman wrote in another email sent during Acosta’s tenure.The IG report, which wasn’t made public until 2009, says Acosta claimed he “was not aware that Schlozman acted inappropriately in the hiring process” and that “no one complained to him that inappropriate hiring practices were taking place.” But the IG concluded that Acosta “had sufficient information about Schlozman’s conduct to have raised red flags warranting closer supervision of him,” and that Acosta “did not sufficiently supervise Schlozman.”Acosta claimed he didn’t recall the chief of the Special Litigation Section of the Justice Department complaining about one of Schlozman’s hires, whom she considered unqualified for even a line attorney position. Acosta only said he’d known of some of issues with Schlozman’s management and his tendency to make inappropriate jokes, including him passing along a racial joke about a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. (A Division employee had written that he liked his coffee “Mary Frances Berry style ― black and bitter.”)While Acosta said he became more concerned about Schlozman’s judgement in mid-2005, as he prepared to leave, he “took no action to alert those in his chain of command,” the report said.Bill Yeomans, who spent 26 years at the Civil Rights Division and left just before the end of Acosta’s tenure, said he believes the IG report “really gave [Acosta] a pass when it shouldn’t have,” given that he was overseeing the people making improper hiring decisions.Acosta “was the boss. He was the guy who was overseeing this whole operation,” Yeomans said. Acosta left the Civil Rights Division to become a U.S. attorney just as things were “starting to get ugly,” said Yeomans. “His escape was timely.”Yeomans called Acosta a “very shrewd guy,” and said he expected that when Acosta left the Civil Rights Division, he was thinking ahead to avoid trouble.“He’s a very ambitious guy who is willing to be as flexible in his positions as the situation demands,” Yeomans said. “That initially sounds like a good thing, but I think it’s probably not, because he’s very attuned to serving people above him.”“I’m sure he knew that what Schlozman was doing was radioactive, and so he stayed as far away from it as he could on paper, while I’m sure still being very much in the loop about what was happening,” Yeomans said. “He was the guy presiding over the Civil Rights Division during the period when most of the conduct in the report occurred. The report blames most of it on Brad Schlozman, but Brad Schlozman was Alex’s deputy. Alex knew what was going on.”Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement that she was “astonished” by Acosta’s nomination.“Mr. Acosta led the Civil Rights Division at a time that was marked by stark politicization, and other improper hiring and personnel decisions that were fully laid to bare in a 2008 report issued by the Office of Inspector General,” Clarke said. “The OIG found that actions taken during Mr. Acosta’s tenure violated Justice Department policy and federal law. Political and ideological affiliations were used as a litmus test to evaluate job candidates and career attorneys, wreaking havoc on the work of the Division.”“This egregious conduct played out under Mr. Acosta’s watch and undermined the integrity of the Civil Rights Division,” she went on. “It is hard to believe that Mr. Acosta would now be nominated to lead a federal agency tasked with promoting lawful hiring practices and safe workplaces.”“It’s got to raise serious concerns, I hope,” Yeomans said. “We have a guy who presided over what was the biggest politicization of federal bureaucracy probably in history, but certainly during that era. It was a horrible instance of abuse of federal bureaucracy. To think that’s the guy who is going to run labor policy for the entire country, that’s of great concern.”Acosta and the White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article.Trump named Acosta, currently dean of the Florida International University College of Law, to lead the Department of Labor after Andrew Puzder, Trump’s first choice, withdrew himself from consideration. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions had delayed a review of Puzder’s labyrinthine business conflicts, his history of labor violations and hiring undocumented workers, and accusations that he’d physically abused his ex-wife. Puzder, the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, opposed the minimum wage and had suggested his workers should be replaced with robots. Acosta served for nine months on the National Labor Relations Board. His tenure, from December 2002 to August 2003, marked a relatively stable period for an agency that, four years later, would be beset by partisan infighting over new rules to restrict unions. In 2004, Acosta, then an assistant attorney general, wrote a letter to an Ohio judge defending Republicans’ right to challenge voter credentials. The move was unusual. The judge, presiding over a state-level lawsuit between the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, hadn’t solicited the opinion.“Acosta has certainly been part of the movement to restrict voting rights,” Ari Berman, author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America, told HuffPost, saying there had been “a lot of problems” with the Justice Department during Acosta’s tenure. “Between backing Ohio’s voter purge in 2004 and having lawyers under him in the Justice Department who very clearly wanted to restrict voting rights, his record on that is pretty troubling.” (A separate IG report said that Acosta “took a particular interest in the language-minority provisions” of the Voting Rights Act, which Yeomans said was part of Acosta’s strategy to strengthen the Latino vote for Republicans.)When Jacobs, the Levin College professor who helped interview Acosta in 2014, asked him about the 2004 letter to the Ohio judge, she said he insisted he was just following orders from higher up in the Justice Department.“That was one thing we questioned him about, and we really weren’t satisfied,” she said. “He said, when you work at a bigger entity you do what your supervisor tells you to do. But as a U.S. attorney, you have an ethical obligation to assess what you’re doing ethically.”"

While black history is something we acknowledge all the time on HuffPost Black Voices, February is a time for us to double down on this mission and further amplify the experiences of black men and women who have helped to make America what it is.This month, we’ve adopted and adapted the last line in Langston Hughes’ iconic poem “I, Too” to declare #WeTooAreAmerica. With it, we aim to reinforce a message that all black people ― including those who identify as Muslim, immigrant and queer ― are who help to define the identity of this country. On Monday, we partnered with The Creative Collective NYC, a New-York based networking group for millennials of color who work in creative industries, to co-host an event at WeWork Harlem titled “ACTivism.” The event included a discussion moderated by myself with featured guests Bryan Terrell Clark ― an actor who currently stars in “Hamilton” on Broadway ― and Jennifer Epps-Addison ― an activist and the newly-named president for the national non-profit organization Center for Popular Democracy.“Our guest speakers were two individuals who are black history in the making and between the wisdom they shared throughout the night to the undeniable positive vibes found in a room overflowing with melanin, it was truly an empowering experience,” Imani Ellis, the founder of The Creative Collective NYC, which prefers to be identified as theCCnyc, told The Huffington Post. “We wanted to curate a safe space for creatives of color to love on each other and build with each other—not just for black history month, but beyond.” The event, which kicked off with a performance from poet and playwright Cyrus Aaron, included more than 80 millennials of color who work across various creative industries. Following the discussion, Black Voices invited attendees to participate in an activity in honor of Hughes’ and our campaign.In printed copies of the last few lines of Hughes’ poem ― which reads “Besides, They’ll see how beautiful I am/ And be ashamed— I, too, am America,” we omitted the word “beautiful” and then asked attendees to fill in the blank with a word or phrase they believe best describes them.Our goal with this initiative was to highlight how these young men and women of color each have qualities that make them beautiful and unique. Photographer ChiChi Agbim took images of many of the New-York based millennials at the event, so we’re posting the pictures below to celebrate these influencers and have them serve as a source of inspiration for others: "

Voilà! A meme is born.This group photo features President Donald Trump and a merry band of gushingly supportive GOP representatives who call themselves the “Trump Caucus.” Several wags on Twitter were taken by their uniformity (“It’s so white I need sunglasses,” quipped one) and a certain look that said “sales” to many.It was shot after the president schmoozed at a “listening session,” at which he seems to do most of the talking.“I’m negotiating a lot of contracts that are saving billions and billions of dollars for the American people and for all of us, and I’m very proud of it,” he said Thursday. “We’re doing really well. The fake news media doesn’t like talking about the economy.”The crew included congressmen from North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Tennessee, and a lone congresswoman from Tennessee. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) came out for Trump a year ago, they pointed out. “Good friends,” the president said. They mostly told the president their names and chit-chatted a bit.“Are you going to find some of those leakers?” one asked, referring to news that Trump’s fired former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office.“We’re going to find the leakers,” Trump responded, vowing they would “pay a big price for leaking.”“You know, the Russians are just a ruse — it’s all about the leakers,” he added.

41,POLITICS,Judge Orders Release Of EPA Nominee Scott Pruitt's Fossil Fuel Emails,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-epa-emails-release_us_58a62feae4b07602ad5312e0,The ruling comes just a day before a scheduled Senate vote on Pruitt’s confirmation.,2017-02-17,"Scott Pruitt, the EPA nominee, speaks during his Senate Environment and Public Works Committee confirmation hearing on Jan. 18, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a63645280000c63a9996cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A state judge has ordered Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt’s office to release thousands of documents related to Pruitt’s communications with the energy industry. The Thursday ruling comes the day before a scheduled Senate vote on Pruitt’s nomination to run the Environmental Protection Agency.Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons of the District Court of Oklahoma County ruled that the attorney general’s office will have until Tuesday to turn over more than 2,500 emails and other documents. The watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy, with legal representation from the American Civil Liberties Union, had filed a lawsuit against Pruitt earlier this month, alleging that his office had violated Oklahoma’s open records law.The lawsuit claimed that Pruitt, who has served as Oklahoma’s attorney general since 2011, had failed to respond to nine open-records requests seeking communications between his office and members of the fossil fuel industry, including Koch Industries, Peabody Energy and the National Coal Council. The requests had been filed as far back as January 2015.“We are doing this because these emails should be released so that people can properly vet his record before the Senate votes to confirm him,” Nick Surgey, director of research for the Center for Media and Democracy, told Reuters earlier this month. On Thursday, Judge Timmons criticized the attorney general’s office for its “abject failure” to abide by the open-records act, according to the watchdog group.Pruitt, whose nomination as EPA administrator was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Feb. 2, is scheduled to face a full Senate confirmation vote on Friday.Environmentalists and public policy groups are calling for the vote to be postponed until all his Big Oil documents have been released and can be examined.“Senate Republicans are attempting to jam through a nominee who fails any basic test of transparency and honesty required from a public official. Has Scott Pruitt lied to the American people? What favors did he give the oil and gas industry in exchange for their support? Until we have the answers, this nomination can go no further,” said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, in a statement Thursday. Senate Democrats have also pushed for the vote to be delayed until they can review the communications demanded in the lawsuit. “These records are needed for the Senate to evaluate Mr. Pruitt’s suitability to serve in the position for which he has been nominated,” Democratic members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works Committee wrote earlier this week.Pruitt, who sued the EPA 13 times as attorney general, has been heavily scrutinized for his ties to the energy industry. Since 2002, he’s received more than $300,000 in contributions from the fossil fuel sector. As attorney general, he’s been accused of prioritizing industry interests over the health and wellbeing of the environment and his constituents.In 2014, The New York Times reported that Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general had formed an “unprecedented, secretive alliance” with major oil and gas companies to undermine environmental regulations. Pruitt also joined industry players ― including Oklahoma Gas and Electric and the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, an industry-backed nonprofit ― in filing lawsuits to stop regulations.Hundreds of former and current EPA officials have urged the Senate to refuse to confirm him. Almost 800 former EPA staffers signed a letter expressing their opposition. The New York Times reported Thursday that droves of employees at the agency have been calling on their senators to vote “no.”“It is rare,” James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, told the Times about the wave of activism from EPA employees. “I can’t think of any other time when people in the bureaucracy have done this.”――――Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

They both enjoy sitting backstage though to watch their dad perform, and once Martin is offstage the reviews are in. “One day one of them went like, ‘Daddy, what happened tonight? I didn’t like this part. Yesterday was better, last night was better,’” Martin said.The proud dad mentioned his sons’ post-performance advice in an interview with People last year. He said that their criticism is “as raw and honest” as you can get from a kid and that he tries to implement some of their tips. “They go, ‘Dad, that movement I don’t like. Dad, that song, you gotta change it,’ and they bring good points,” Martin said. “I tell them, ‘Son, that’s something that I will consider.’”The twins didn’t always know their dad was an international pop star. In that same interview with People, Martin talked about the moment he let his kids watch his show from the front and realize what their dad did in front of thousands of people.“When the show was over, they came to me and said, ‘Papi, you’re Ricky Martin.’ I said, ‘I’m not Ricky Martin, I’m your father.’ [They said,] ‘No, no, no, you’re Ricky Martin,’ and so it changed,” he said.

It’s targeting Americans in over a dozen Republican congressional districts who have already shown an interest in the progressive demonstrations against President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.People who click on the advertisements are routed to an Indivisible webpage that asks whether they can attend a local town hall, and gives them information about what to do ahead of the event to ensure it has the greatest possible impact. A Planned Parenthood-sponsored citizen town hall in Nevada and a constituent town hall to be held by Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), are among the specific meetings that Priorities USA plans to publicize. Nevada Sen. Dean Heller (R) is running for re-election in 2018 in a state that Hillary Clinton won. Clinton also won a majority of votes in Lance’s 7th congressional district in New Jersey.Some of the meetings are organized by constituents, since many members of Congress have declined to hold in-person town halls.“The upcoming recess week promises to provide even more scenes of grassroots activism by everyday citizens concerned about our country’s future,” Priorities USA chairman Guy Cecil said in a statement.“We are inspired by Indivisible and couldn’t be prouder to partner with them to empower those who want to make their voices heard and engage in social action,” he said. “Republican lawmakers who refuse to stand up to Donald Trump should be prepared to answer for that to their constituents over the coming week, and beyond.”The advertising initiative is Priorities USA’s first media buy of the Trump administration. Although the super PAC declined to specify the size of the purchase, its decision to partner with Indivisible and target town halls is a clear vote of confidence in the nascent anti-Trump grassroots protest movement.In December, longtime Democratic political operatives published The Indivisible Guide to help progressive grassroots activists emulate the success of the conservative Tea Party movement. Indivisible, the organization that grew out of this effort, quickly became a national clearinghouse for liberal activism in the Trump era with chapters springing up all over the country.Local activists, often acting spontaneously with guidance from Indivisible and other organizations, have already used numerous town hall meetings to grill Republican members over their plans to repeal Obamacare and demand details of a replacement for the landmark law. The lawmakers, who often lack answers adequate to mollify their indignant audiences, have at times sought early exits from the meetings or tried to hide information about when and where future events will occur."

What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction.Jewish Holocaust survivors who fled Nazi Germany and other countries as children have a request for President Donald Trump: “Keep the doors open to refugees.”In a letter to Trump released Monday, more than 200 family members and survivors of the Kindertransport ― a program that sent around 10,000 Jewish child refugees to Britain from Nazi Germany and other European nations ― urged Trump to continue to resettle refugees, especially children, in America.The letter, from nonprofit The Kindertransport Association, comes just a few weeks after Trump signed an executive order banning Syrian refugees from the U.S. indefinitely and halting the resettlement of refugees from other countries for at least four months. Though the order is now mired in political and legal challenges, Trump said Thursday that he plans to issue a new order in its place.“We want to bring our personal experience to bear on what we see as a building crisis,” Melissa Hacker, president of The Kindertransport Association, told The Huffington Post.For Hacker, the issue is personal: Her mother escaped from Austria to Britain in 1939 through the Kindertransport program, she said.The letter connects the experiences of child refugees who sought safe haven during World War II to those of child refugees today.“The Kindertransports saved only 10,000 children,” the letter reads, “a small number compared to the 1.5 million children who were murdered. Yet the children who were saved were able to go to a friendly country ― not through luck, contacts or subterfuge, but through the will of the British people and their elected leaders.”“We write to urge [Trump] to give other children at risk the same opportunity,” the letter goes on to say.Today, the world is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, according to the United Nations. There are more than 65 million displaced people, including around 21 million refugees, over half of whom are children. More than 200 Kindertransport survivors, all of whom now live in the U.S., and their descendants signed the letter to Trump, Hacker said.The letter notes that Kindertransport survivors who ended up in the U.S. “have become productive American citizens, including two Nobel Laureates, many successful business people, film and theater professionals, teachers, artists, writers, doctors, and philanthropists.” They are pleading for Trump to open America’s doors to child refugees from Central America, Syria, and more.“In Syria, it’s a civil war, cities are being bombed, children are getting killed, and in South and Central America, many children trying to get to the U.S. are in dire situations,” Hacker said. “No one sends their child away, especially traveling alone, without extreme need, worry, and fear.”The letter follows the United Kingdom’s decision earlier this month to close the Dubs Amendment program for accepting lone child refugees. Only 350 displaced children were able to enter the country, as opposed to the 3,000 previously expected. The Dubs amendment was named after U.K. politician and former member of Parliament Lord Alf Dubs, who himself came to the U.K. through the Kindertransport.“The United States is a global leader in refugee protection,” the letter reads. “The world is looking to us and following our lead.”The Kindertransport survivors’ letter warns Trump about the consequences when America closes its doors to people fleeing persecution and conflict.“In the aftermath of World War II, the price for keeping America’s doors closed to refugees due to fear was made starkly clear,” it reads. “We are among the very few who were welcomed by a country and its citizens and therefore survived.”In a notorious example of American policy toward Jewish refugees during World War II, a ship called the St. Louis, which was carrying more than 900 mostly-German Jews, sailed first to Cuba and then the U.S. in 1939.American authorities turned the ship away. Of the people who were sent back to Europe, 254 died in the Holocaust.See here to read the letter from Kindertransport survivors in its entirety.Know a story from your community of people fighting hate and supporting groups who need it?

Tell us with #LoveTakesAction.Jewish Holocaust survivors who fled Nazi Germany and other countries as children have a request for President Donald Trump: “Keep the doors open to refugees.”In a letter to Trump released Monday, more than 200 family members and survivors of the Kindertransport ― a program that sent around 10,000 Jewish child refugees to Britain from Nazi Germany and other European nations ― urged Trump to continue to resettle refugees, especially children, in America.The letter, from nonprofit The Kindertransport Association, comes just a few weeks after Trump signed an executive order banning Syrian refugees from the U.S. indefinitely and halting the resettlement of refugees from other countries for at least four months. Though the order is now mired in political and legal challenges, Trump said Thursday that he plans to issue a new order in its place.“We want to bring our personal experience to bear on what we see as a building crisis,” Melissa Hacker, president of The Kindertransport Association, told The Huffington Post.For Hacker, the issue is personal: Her mother escaped from Austria to Britain in 1939 through the Kindertransport program, she said.The letter connects the experiences of child refugees who sought safe haven during World War II to those of child refugees today.“The Kindertransports saved only 10,000 children,” the letter reads, “a small number compared to the 1.5 million children who were murdered. Yet the children who were saved were able to go to a friendly country ― not through luck, contacts or subterfuge, but through the will of the British people and their elected leaders.”“We write to urge [Trump] to give other children at risk the same opportunity,” the letter goes on to say.Today, the world is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, according to the United Nations. There are more than 65 million displaced people, including around 21 million refugees, over half of whom are children. More than 200 Kindertransport survivors, all of whom now live in the U.S., and their descendants signed the letter to Trump, Hacker said.The letter notes that Kindertransport survivors who ended up in the U.S. “have become productive American citizens, including two Nobel Laureates, many successful business people, film and theater professionals, teachers, artists, writers, doctors, and philanthropists.” They are pleading for Trump to open America’s doors to child refugees from Central America, Syria, and more.“In Syria, it’s a civil war, cities are being bombed, children are getting killed, and in South and Central America, many children trying to get to the U.S. are in dire situations,” Hacker said. “No one sends their child away, especially traveling alone, without extreme need, worry, and fear.”The letter follows the United Kingdom’s decision earlier this month to close the Dubs Amendment program for accepting lone child refugees. Only 350 displaced children were able to enter the country, as opposed to the 3,000 previously expected. The Dubs amendment was named after U.K. politician and former member of Parliament Lord Alf Dubs, who himself came to the U.K. through the Kindertransport.“The United States is a global leader in refugee protection,” the letter reads. “The world is looking to us and following our lead.”The Kindertransport survivors’ letter warns Trump about the consequences when America closes its doors to people fleeing persecution and conflict.“In the aftermath of World War II, the price for keeping America’s doors closed to refugees due to fear was made starkly clear,” it reads. “We are among the very few who were welcomed by a country and its citizens and therefore survived.”In a notorious example of American policy toward Jewish refugees during World War II, a ship called the St. Louis, which was carrying more than 900 mostly-German Jews, sailed first to Cuba and then the U.S. in 1939.American authorities turned the ship away. Of the people who were sent back to Europe, 254 died in the Holocaust.See here to read the letter from Kindertransport survivors in its entirety.Know a story from your community of people fighting hate and supporting groups who need it?

We are well aware that the only way to escape is suicide,” Kim Jong Nam said in a letter to Kim Jong Un, one of the lawmakers said.Kim Jong Nam, 46, died after an assault, possibly with poison, at an airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Monday. U.S. and South Korean government officials have said they believe he was assassinated by agents from the North.The eldest son of Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Nam was hidden from public view for years because his father and actress mother were not legally married. He was not shown to his grandfather, North Korea’s founding President Kim Il Sung, until he was five years old.Kim Jong Nam spent nine years at an international school in Geneva.When he returned to Pyongyang, he joined the government. His father became leader in 1994 and Kim Jong Nam was expected by some eventually to succeed him - until the Disneyland incident.In May 2001, Kim Jong Nam was nabbed at Tokyo’s Narita airport and held for using a false Dominican Republic passport. He was accompanied by his wife, another woman believed to be a nanny, and a four-year-old boy, his son, according to media reports.He said the family wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. All four were deported and went back to North Korea via Beijing.His father was embarrassed and after that, Kim Jong Nam’s star was on the wane.Kim Jong Nam’s mother Song Hye Rim ended up living in Moscow, away from him, and died there after struggling with depression for years. Kim said he often visited the mother’s grave in Moscow.LOVED BEING FREEAfter the Disneyland incident, much of the rest of Kim Jong Nam’s life was spent overseas, first in China and then in Macau.South Korea’s intelligence service said he had wives and children both in Beijing and Macau, according to lawmakers.“Because I was educated in the West, I was able to enjoy freedom from early age and I still love being free,” he said in notes to a Japanese journalist, Yoji Gomi, who wrote a book on Kim Jong Nam in 2012. “The reason I visit Macau so often is because it’s the most free and liberal place near China, where my family lives.South Korean lawmakers said the spy agency told them that young, unpredictable Kim Jong Un had issued a “standing order” for his half-brother’s assassination after he took power, and that there had been a failed attempt in 2012.“Kim Jong Un said: ‘I just hate him. So get rid of him,’” Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers, cited the spy agency as saying about the standing order.Some analysts have said Jong Un believed his brother could be used in any overthrow of his regime.After that, Kim Jong Nam did not stay long in any place, and traveled frequently between various cities in Southeast Asia and China.Kim Jong Nam had not kept his disdain for his brother a secret.“I’m his half brother, but I’ve never met him so I don’t know,” he said in another note to Gomi.“I’m concerned how Jong Un, who merely resembles my grandfather, will be able to satisfy the needs of North Koreans. Kim Jong Un is still just a nominal figure and the members of the power elite will be the ones in actual power. The dynastic succession is a joke to the outside world.”He added: “The Kim Jong Un regime will not last long. Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse.”Numerous North Korean officials have been purged or killed since Kim Jong Un came to power. Those include his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was considered the country’s second most-powerful person and was believed to have been close to Kim Jong Nam, who he had helped raise.“I was raised getting special love from the aunt and uncle and I am not denying that they are even now taking special care of me,” Kim Jong Nam said in a note written to Gomi before his uncle was killed.(Additional reporting by A.

And that happened. It happened in Europe, mainly in Germany,” Assad said in the interview with Europe 1 radio and TF1 television which was recorded on Tuesday in English.“I think the aim of Trump is to prevent those people from coming.” It was “not against the Syrian people,” he said.Trump said his order, which triggered protests at home and abroad and confusion at U.S. and international airports, was intended to prevent militants from entering the United States. His administration is challenging the suspension ruling, which was upheld last week by appeal court judges.Assad’s government has often criticized Western states for their support for Syrian rebel groups, all of which are regarded by Damascus as terrorists, and has warned that such backing will lead to militant attacks around the world.Trump has not yet set out a clear policy on Syria but has indicated he could cut U.S. support for insurgent groups and has said he wants to mend ties with Russia, whose President Vladimir Putin is Assad’s strongest international ally.Asked directly whether Trump’s immigration policy was the right one, Assad did not answer. He also said he had not yet seen what Trump’s Syria policy would be."

That explosion took place in a street full of used car dealers.U.S.-backed Iraqi forces have dislodged Islamic State from most of the cities it captured in 2014 and 2015. The militants also control parts of Syria .Iraqi government forces last month captured eastern Mosul and are now preparing an offensive on the western side that remains under the militants’ control.

63,POLITICS,Latino Democrats Excluded From A Meeting With ICE That They Requested,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-meeting-democrats-excluded_us_58a5f6c7e4b07602ad52b531,The members wanted to learn more about recent deportation efforts.,2017-02-16,Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) is a longtime immigration reform advocate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a5f808280000c63a99953e.jpeg?cache=EueeVniEbA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Two Democratic representatives say Republicans kicked them out of a meeting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Thursday after the agency canceled a planned summit with Latino members earlier this week in favor of a bipartisan gathering that excluded many of them.Reps. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) and Norma Torres (D-Calif.) said that Republican leaders told them they had to leave the meeting with ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan about deportation raids because they were not invited. ICE set the invite list for the meeting and initially excluded the entire Congressional Hispanic Caucus, according to aides from both parties, before agreeing to include a small number of members.The invite list was striking because the bipartisan meeting was scheduled after Homan backed out of plans to meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to discuss members’ concerns about recent deportation efforts that netted more than 680 immigrants across the country. Earlier this week, ICE officials said the agency canceled the initial meeting, which reportedly included some members outside the Hispanic Caucus, because the CHC attempted to invite too many people ― an excuse one Democratic member said was “bullshit.” ICE promised that Homan would meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers instead. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said at a press conference on Thursday that ICE officials had picked the attendees. A GOP aide confirmed the list came from ICE. ICE officials said that the speaker’s office set the invite list.While initially no members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were invited, eventually four of them attended the meeting, including Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.). She told reporters she was “gravely disappointed” and worried about the precedent set when her colleagues were excluded. No members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus were included.Even though they were not invited, Torres and Gutiérrez tried to enter the meeting and several other Hispanic Caucus members stood outside. Members said Gutiérrez was kicked out of the room first, and then Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) asked Torres to leave. Before she left, she asked ICE officials when she could get answers to questions about the raids. She said the officials did not answer; instead, Goodlatte told her that Republican leadership could get information to them.“I speak English ― I don’t need a translator,” Torres told reporters afterward. “My constituents elected me to represent them here. I should be able to participate and hear firsthand what ICE is saying and what ICE is doing in my communities.” Pelosi said at the meeting she had “never been in a meeting where an agency can designate who can attend” and that it was “highly unusual,” according to a Democratic aide in the room, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“What’s going on across the country is not making us any safer, and we want answers,” Pelosi said.Goodlatte’s office directed questions to the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis). AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said “the speaker’s office organized a small bipartisan briefing that was, at the request of DHS, limited to members with jurisdictional interests in immigration enforcement.”“Members of the CHC expressed interest in attending, and to accommodate the request, we welcomed the chair of the CHC to join on behalf of the other members,” Strong said in an email. “We are confident that the CHC chair is capable of representing the views of her caucus, and this arrangement was made very clear to the CHC ahead of time.”Homan, the ICE acting director, told members at the meeting that arrested individuals were deemed threats to public safety and that their detention was part of target enforcement, although some other individuals were arrested as well, an agency spokeswoman said in a statement.Democratic attendees of the meeting said they got the message that all undocumented immigrants were considered a priority for deportation under President Donald Trump’s recent executive order on undocumented immigrants. ICE provided lawmakers with additional data on the criminal convictions of immigrants arrested last week ― or lack of criminal records, in the case of 25 percent of individuals. The largest proportion of criminal convictions, about 24 percent, were for driving under the influence. About 10 percent were drug-related offenses. Some were also violent crimes, such as homicide and sexual abuse. Democrats said they strongly support finding and deporting serious criminals, but also fear that ICE will indiscriminately arrest people with low-level offenses or none at all. “It was hard to not leave that meeting and believe that the Trump administration is going to target as many immigrants as possible,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), who attended the meeting, told reporters. This story has been updated to include additional comment from ICE."

While photographing one, she noticed two women on motorcycles and decided to introduce herself. Their names were Tru and Love; immediately, Rabut was enamored. The pair invited her to a meeting for their all-women motorcycle crew, Caramel Curves, which took place in a member’s nail salon. Rabut took the women’s portraits, and has been doing so ever since.“I love the feminism and femininity that these women bring to the masculine world of motorcycle clubs,” Rabut told The Huffington Post, taking care not to conflate the two terms.Her shots of the crew include images of riders enveloped in billowy, hot-pink smoke. In some portraits, their camaraderie is clear as they laugh together wearing matching checkered jackets. In others, the pride they take in their pastime is on display as they pose on their bikes, showing off their high heels.“These women are comfortable riding their bikes in heels and love to emphasize that they can do anything a man can do, only better and in heels,” Rabut said. “I think they do a really good job at combating the stereotype that biking is a masculine hobby.”The women of the Caramel Curves rock lipstick and dangly earrings, bauble-y bracelets and gelled hair. They’ve got tattoos and ripped up jeans, too, fusing aesthetics to send a message about blurred gender lines.“They have just as much, if not more, passion than most men that ride,” Rabut said. “Riding bikes gives them a sense freedom and an outlet in the world. I hope that viewers, especially female viewers, feel empowered by these images.”"

The straightforward series addresses the omission of black men from the tradition of formal portraiture, revealing the simple power of a photographic depiction. The project came about while Deeman was mulling over the idea of expectations and the discriminatory frameworks that underlie our assumptions. “I am biracial,” Deeman told The Huffington Post as an example, “and I’ve found that the expectation is that my father is black and my mother is white, but it’s actually the other way around.”The artist then began thinking about men of color and the ways that they have historically been pictured in front of the camera ― the ugly history of physiognomy, and the mugshot, came to mind. Deeman then wondered, if she created images depicting black men in a more dignified light, would they have the power to shatter expectations with no firm footing in reality?Deeman, who is based in San Francisco, recruited strangers to serve as subjects for a series of portraits, the only requirements being that they were of the African diaspora and identified as male. Every man is depicted shirtless, from the shoulders up, staring slightly off-camera.The repetitive formula alludes to the history of portraiture, specifically the stately renderings of patrons, nobility and the aristocratic elite that take up so much space on museum walls. “Men of color historically were not granted the opportunity to appear sympathetic in portraits,” Deeman said. “That was restricted to the bourgeois.”The portraits also allude to the ways photography has been used to criminalize and oppress people of color. “I think photography is problematic because so many people see it as the truth,” Deeman explained. “It has made people buy into physiognomy and eugenics and all of that. I always joke that the photograph was the biggest lie that was ever made.”Physiognomy is a pseudoscientific field that argues one’s character can be determined from his or her appearance, especially facial features. “It was used to justify racism,” Deeman said, “by elevating European features and criminalizing everyone else.” Mug shots, whose aesthetics turn human beings into indexable felons, offer another example of photography invading our subconscious presumptions. “The mug shot is this very stark presentation,” Deeman said. “Formulaic in its style. People are placed against a blue backdrop or white backdrop, the flash is always the same, everything is the same within the context of the image. I wanted to make something with a formula, but challenge that aesthetic.”In lieu of a blue or white backdrop, for example, she opted for a coffee-colored hue, a color that nearly matches her own skin tone. “It’s about placing myself within the image,” she said. “The color represents me.”Deeman’s work highlights the immense power of a simple ritual, a subject and photographer conspiring to create a portrait. For much of photography’s history, men of color were denied access to self-portraits that truly represented themselves as complex individuals. Deeman hopes to rupture this tradition. “We are together in this place, making this photograph,” she said. “In these photos, I’m saying: ‘This is how I think you should be seen, and this is how you should be seen.’”The artist hopes her work can open up a broader narrative for men of color. She does not want to influence her audience’s perception of her subjects, but rather leave space for the viewer to construct complex hypotheses regarding these strangers’ personalities. Through the project, Deeman hopes people will examine their own expectations a bit more critically.“With the administration that we have right now, there are extreme limits on everybody who is not seen as ‘traditionally American,’” Deeman said. “I think that this body of work can challenge some of the stereotypes that some people want to revert back to.”“Erica Deeman: Brown” will be on view at Anthony Meier Fine Arts in San Francisco from March 24 until April 28."

An hour, however, is beyond the pale.“I run a cafe, not an internet cafe,” she said, adding that she knew of no other cafes that levy a similar charge.“It’s getting more and more extreme.

You don’t even open your eyes in the morning for free.”Pokorny introduced the charge last year, she said, but it gained attention on Wednesday when tabloid Oesterreich published the “bizarre bill” one of its reporters was presented with, featuring the 1 euro charge for “electricity.”The fee also applies to laptops and tablets, and for those using more than one outlet is multiplied by the number of devices plugged in.

El-Yacoubi told The Huffington Post that this lack of representation in mainstream fashion campaigns creates an “identity complex” for young American Muslims. Many Muslim teens are balancing the challenges of teenage life with the added stress of having their identity as Americans questioned, and even being bullied because of their faith.That’s why it was especially heartening for the blogger to see Justice, an Ohio-based retail company, reach out to young American Muslims in their latest marketing campaign.Justice focuses exclusively on fashion for “tween” girls between the ages of 7 and 14. In a recent update to the company’s merchandise catalog, the company chose to include a young model wearing a bright blue hijab. The image is now the brand’s cover photo on Facebook and is also featured on Justice’s website. El-Yacoubi called Justice’s decision to include a young person in a hijab in its marketing campaign a “leap forward.”“I honestly teared up when I saw the ad because it’s a celebration of what it means to be different and shows that difference is what makes us beautiful,” El-Yacoubi told The Huffington Post in an email. “It will help the youth cultivate a confident and stronger sense of self at such a young age. By seeing themselves represented throughout mainstream markets it will provide a feeling of belonging, something many of us wished we had growing up.”Keriake Lucas, vice president of corporate communications for Justice, told The Huffington Post that the photo was part of a marketing campaign for January and February called “See Yourself In Justice.”Lucas said the campaign was meant to showcase the diversity of the young girls that Justice hopes to reach. The updated catalog coincides with the release of new extended sizes. “We’re looking at ways of continuing with our message around inclusivity,” she said. “We’re really proud to project to our girl that we are really dedicated to every girl, every day.” Justice is part of the Ascena Retail Group Inc, which also manages brands like Dressbarn, Loft, and Lane Bryant. Justice has over 900 stores located in the United States, Canada, Russia and the Middle East.Lucas said that this particular marketing campaign will also be featured in stores. Sania Siddiqui, a fashion blogger and a mom, told The Huffington Post she would have loved to see an ad like this while she was growing up. “Now that I am a mother of a baby girl, I want her to be confident in her faith yet proud to be American. When Justice includes a young girl wearing hijab, it shows inclusivity to all young girls from different backgrounds,” Siddiqui wrote in an email. “America’s beauty comes from the diversity of its people.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-labor-secretary_us_58a5d24ae4b07602ad526692,Alexander Acosta is a former U.S. attorney who has served on the National Labor Relations Board.,2017-02-16,"U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta speaks to the media during a news conference on June 23, 2006, about the arrest of seven people in Miami.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a5de55280000c63a9994cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump on Thursday named former U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta as his new pick to run the Department of Labor.If confirmed, Acosta would be the first Latino member of the president’s Cabinet.Acosta served on the National Labor Relations Board, as assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division and as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida under President George W. Bush. The Miami native mostly recently worked as the dean of Florida International University College of Law.The announcement came one day after Andrew Puzder, Trump’s first choice for the position, withdrew his name for consideration. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions had delayed review of Puzder’s labyrinthine business conflicts, history of labor violations and hiring undocumented workers, and accusations that he had physically abused his ex-wife.Republican backing for Puzder dwindled as criticism mounted over his long-standing support for increased immigration. The former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of fast-food chains Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, needed “yes” votes from at least 50 of the 52 Republicans in the Senate, as no Democrats or independents had pledged to vote for him. The nominee could have prompted the closest vote since Vice President Mike Pence cast a historic tie-breaking vote to confirm billionaire Betsy DeVos as education secretary earlier this month.Democrats considered Puzder an egregious pick to lead a department meant to advocate for higher wages and standards for U.S. workers. His company repeatedly stiffed employees who were already poorly paid and whom Puzder once referred to as “the best of the worst.” He suggested his workers should be replaced by machines. He also opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, a goal that has galvanized the labor movement since fast-food worker strikes became widespread in 2012.Acosta generated his own controversy in 2014 when the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law named him as a candidate to become dean. Faculty rebuffed Acosta over his apparent role in laying the groundwork for voter ID laws. The laws are ostensibly meant to root out voter fraud, but it is virtually nonexistent and critics say the regulations prevent minorities and elderly people from voting. In 2004, Acosta, then an assistant attorney general, wrote a letter to an Ohio judge defending Republicans’ right to challenge voter credentials.“Our faculty rejected him as unsuitable,” Michelle Jacobs, a law professor at the University of Florida, wrote in an op-ed in March 2014. Some people complained that liberal-leaning faculty opposed Acosta because of his politics.“This leaves the rather disturbing possibility that Acosta was rejected because he was a Republican lawyer working for the Justice Department at a time when voter fraud issues were high profile concerns,” Stephen Bainbridge, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in a blog post responding to Jacobs’ op-ed. “So today’s rebuttable presumption is that conservative legal academics should steer clear of Florida.”Still, labor groups who opposed Puzder’s nomination said they would oppose Acosta if he refused to support increasing the minimum wage and safeguarding collective bargaining rights, which the new Republican-led Congress has already begun to attack. “President Trump’s latest nominee for U.S. labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, deserves a thorough vetting on the issues that matter most to America’s workers,” Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, said in a statement. “We’ll make sure he gets that vetting.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

76,POLITICS,Trump Inspires Bipartisan Effort To Rein Him In On Russia,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-russian-sanctions-congress_us_58a4d86be4b07602ad51754d,GOP and Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill requiring their sign-off for lifting sanctions on Putin.,2017-02-16,Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have been some of Trump's toughest critics when it comes to his relations with Russia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a4de5e25000034080b94a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump is inspiring bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, but not in a way he wants: Republicans and Democrats in Congress are teaming up to try to prevent him from unilaterally lifting sanctions on Russia.House Republicans and Democrats introduced a bill Wednesday to require congressional approval of any sanctions relief provided to Russia. It’s the same bill, the Russia Sanctions Review Act, that Senate Republicans and Democrats introduced together last week. The measure would give Congress 120 days to approve or reject a presidential effort to lift sanctions on Russia, and the president couldn’t move forward with lifting any sanctions during that period.The legislation comes in the midst of a scandal involving the president and his team of advisers, and their potential ties to Russian officials who interfered in last year’s U.S. election to try to help Trump win. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned Monday amid reports that he not only talked to a Russian official in December about sanctions, but lied about it. Another report surfaced Tuesday indicating people on Trump’s campaign were in “constant” contact with Russian officials throughout the election.Congress has been scrambling to make sense of the revelations, with questions arising about how much Trump knew about his team’s communications with Russians, and when. Trump, meanwhile, has said he’s open to easing sanctions on Russia. That’s not okay with many lawmakers, regardless of their party.“I think the recent revelations of Flynn’s secret conversations with the Russian ambassador on the subject of sanctions makes this legislation all the more important,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee and a co-sponsor of the bill, told reporters.“If there were condoned discussions that Flynn had, or if he was acting as a free agent ― in either scenario, this president should not have the unfettered capability of eliminating Russian sanctions,” Schiff said.Republican co-sponsors on the bill include Reps. Tom Rooney (Fla.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) in the House, and Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and John McCain (Ariz.) in the Senate. Rooney and Rubio sit on the intelligence committees in their respective chambers.The bill marks a rare moment of bipartisanship in a Congress largely divided along party lines. It also comes as Republicans, now in control of the legislative and executive branches, are eager to move forward with their agenda. The fact that they’re already teaming up with Democrats to rein in Trump’s actions on Russia, just four weeks into his presidency, shows how much Trump’s problems are affecting his party’s ability to focus on priorities.The question now is whether the bill to scale back the president’s authority gets committee hearings and floor votes. That’s up to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the lead sponsor of the bill, said Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) has “expressed interest.” Hoyer said he plans to talk to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) about becoming a co-sponsor.Royce told HuffPost later that Russia shouldn’t get any sanctions relief until it abides by the terms of the Ukraine peace process. He didn’t endorse Hoyer’s bill, but suggested he would advance a bill like it if Trump were to lift any sanctions before Russia got in line.“If sanctions are eased prior to Russia’s full compliance with the Minsk agreements, I will certainly move legislation to keep them in place,” Royce said in a statement.Asked if Ryan was on board, his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said: “The speaker said if there were efforts to weaken sanctions he would support measures to protect against that. He hasn’t endorsed any piece of legislation at this point as the sanctions are still in place.”As for the Senate, McCain said McConnell hasn’t indicated to him if he supports the bill. McCain said he planned to meet with McConnell later in the day.McConnell spokesman Don Stewart echoed Strong’s position. “I don’t know that he’s said anything new recently about it other than that the White House isn’t doing any sanctions relief, so there’s nothing for Congress to approve,” Stewart said.Of course, if Ryan and McConnell gave a green light to the bill, lawmakers would have to pass it with a veto-proof majority, since Trump would likely veto it. Hoyer, for one, predicted it would have the votes to survive a veto. Asked if he’s reached out to administration officials about his proposal, he laughed.“The White House is not necessarily focused on this matter at this point in time, I think it’s fair to say,” Hoyer said.This story has been updated with comments from Royce."

The “Today, I am a Muslim too”rally, scheduled for Sunday in New York City’s Times Square, is expected to bring hundreds of supporters together to protest Trump’s Islamophobic rhetoric and to show their support for American Muslims. More than 5,000 have expressed interest in the event on Facebook. “There is no greater time than now to stand up for our Muslim brothers and sisters who are under increasing threat and pressure,” a Facebook page for the rally said. The Nusantara Foundation, a Muslim interfaith advocacy organization run by Imam Shamsi Ali, and the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, a non-profit dedicated to strengthening inter-ethnic cooperation, are helping to organize the event. FFEU is spearheaded by Rabbi Marc Schneier and the hip-hop artist Russell Simmons. Women’s March organizer Linda Sarsour will also reportedly be at the event.American Muslim have been fearful about how the Trump administration’s policies could affect their communities over the next four years. The president has used Islamophobic rhetoric to fire up his base and to justify an executive order on immigration that blocked immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and drastically reduces the number of refugees accepted into the country. His administration is reportedly planning to revamp a United States program countering all violent ideologies to focus on what he calls “radical Islamic extremism.” Rabbi Marc Schneier, the FFEU’s president, told The Huffington Post that the goal of the rally was to demonstrate solidarity with the American Muslim community during this time.“Because a people who fight for their own rights are only as honorable as when they fight for the rights of all people,” he told HuffPost in an email. “In this spirit, we stand in solidarity with the American Muslim community in the face of growing Islamophobia and Muslim bigotry in our country.” Imam Ali told The Huffington Post that he hopes the rally will send a clear message to Trump that people remain united, despite his divisive policies.“We are bold and united against injustices and committed to bring back America into the right track.”Correction: A previous version of this article attributed a quote from the FFEU to the organization’s executive director. It should have been attributed to FFEU president, Rabbi Marc Schneier."

(REUTERS/Randall Hill)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a5c369290000f616f26c7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alwyn Scott and Harriet McLeodSEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Boeing Co  handily defeated a union drive by workers at the company’s aircraft factory in South Carolina on Wednesday, as almost three-quarters of workers at the plant who voted rejected union representation.The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation’s most strongly anti-union state.The NLRB said 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).“We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge ofBoeing South Carolina, said in the post.In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at BoeingSouth Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.”The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing’s South Carolina plant on Friday, as the world’s largest planemaker rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner.Any remarks Trump makes at the factory could bring into sharper focus his views on organized labor before he chooses appointees to fill vacant seats on the five-member NLRB.“I think he will cheer the ‘no’ vote,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California Berkeley specializing in labor and the global economy.“I think he’s going to make the case that he wants to see the plant succeed and do everything to create a more competitive environment.”MORALE BLOWThe loss was not seen as a surprise in a state with a strongly anti-union culture. South Carolina is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent.“It’s a blow, but largely to morale more than anything practical,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia.The vote preserves the status quo on the factory floor at Boeing in South Carolina and is unlikely to alter relations with the 30,000 IAM members at Boeing’s factories near Seattle, Shaiken said.Boeing ran a hardball campaign against the IAM in South Carolina, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM.The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015.“Haley said South Carolina doesn’t want or need unions,” said Shaiken. “That creates an atmosphere where to vote ‘yes’ - in the minds of many workers - puts them at risk.”The 26 percent of workers who supported the union showed the IAM had established a foothold, he added. “Can they build on it? That will be their challenge going forward.”Under NLRB rules, the union must wait a minimum of 12 months before petitioning for another election.Boeing said the union was not needed because it is divisive, picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes.President of the Seattle-area IAM local, Jon Holden, said Boeing’s anti-union campaign was not a surprise and followed a strategy they had seen before.The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview.Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent.(Reporting by Harriet McLeod in Charleston and Alwyn Scott in Seattle; Editing by Bill Rigby)"
79,POLITICS,Kamala Harris Quotes Her GOP Colleagues To Make The Case Against Trump's Executive Orders,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-immigration-speech_us_58a61b90e4b07602ad52f18d,"""We must measure up to our words and fight for our ideals, because the critical hour is upon us.""",2017-02-16,Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) delivered her first official speech on the Senate floor on Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a627a8280000c63a999687.png?cache=46P2cYLafi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During her first official speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) quoted several pro-immigrant comments by her Republican colleagues and challenged them to “measure up” to their words.Harris spent the bulk of her remarks challenging President Donald Trump’s temporary bans on all refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as his executive orders vowing to crack down on undocumented immigrants and the communities that shield them from deportation. Near the end of her speech, she noted the importance of bipartisanship in challenging these policies, and cited the words of three GOP senators ― Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.) and John McCain (Ariz.) ― to make her point. “I know, having spent now a few weeks in this chamber, that we have good men and women on both sides of the aisle, men and women who believe deeply in our immigrant communities and who understand that nationalism and patriotism are not the same thing,” she said. She then quoted Cruz, whose father immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba, as saying, “It’s an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who fled oppression because you realize how fragile liberty is and how easily it can be taken away.”Harris cited Paul’s 2013 speech at Howard University, during which he pressed the importance of enforcing “constitutional rights of all Americans ― rich and poor, immigrant and native, black and white.”She also quoted McCain’s 2013 comments in favor of immigration reform, during which he said undocumented immigrants shouldn’t be “condemned forever to a twilight status.”“I say we must measure up to our words and fight for our ideals, because the critical hour is upon us,” she concluded. Harris was elected to the Senate last November and has quickly emerged as one of Trump’s most prominent adversaries in the upper chamber. She’s spoken out against several of Trump’s Cabinet nominees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and last month joined protesters outside the White House in demonstrating against Trump’s Muslim ban.During her speech, Harris cited her law enforcement background ― she spent years as a prosecutor prior to serving as California’s attorney general ― while arguing that Trump’s actions make the country less safe.“These executive actions present a real threat to our public safety,” she said. “I know what a crime looks like, and I will tell you that an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal.” She specifically condemned recent immigration raids across the country, including the arrest of a young man in Seattle who was brought to the U.S. illegally as a child, and was protected under former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected children whose parents illegally brought them to the U.S. from deportation.“The U.S. cannot go back on our promise to these kids and their families,” she said.She also railed against the Muslim ban, saying it “may as well have been hatched in the basement headquarters of ISIS.” Lawmakers have argued that the extremist group could now include the ban in its propaganda. “We handed them a tool of recruitment to use against us,” she said."

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a candidate to chair the Democratic National Committee, speaks during a DNC forum in Baltimore, on Feb. 11, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a5ea9a290000f616f26d53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a leading candidate to chair the Democratic National Committee, wrote in a letter to voting DNC members on Thursday that while he will not release a public estimate of his support, he is in “an excellent position to win next week.” The letter was a response to the release on Tuesday of a whip count by former Labor Secretary Tom Perez’s DNC chair campaign, which said Perez had locked up 180 of the 224 votes needed to clinch the chairmanship in the first round of voting. (If a candidate does not receive a majority of the 447 votes in the first round, there are additional ballots until someone obtains a majority.)In his message to the state party chairs and other officials that have a vote in the DNC race, Ellison offered thinly veiled criticism of Perez’s tactics without actually naming him.“One of the other great candidates for this race released an unverifiable public whip count earlier this week,” Ellison wrote. “You received a voicemail, email and a text message trying to make the race sound like it is over. And the goal is clear: to exert pressure on you.”“We chose not to engage in the same tactics because we believe you deserve the respect to make your own decision without a finger on the scale,” he continued. “However, I feel compelled to respond: we are very confident in our whip count and are in an excellent position to win next week.”The Perez campaign rejected the suggestion that the former labor secretary had tried to assert that he has already won.“We are proud of the broad support we’ve received, but it’s clear that this race is far from over. Tom will spend the next 10 days traveling across the country to talk to Democrats about rebuilding our party,” Perez campaign spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.In addition to Ellison’s letter, he appears to have taken other steps to show confidence in his chances of winning.Ellison is discussing a deal with New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley to have him lead DNC operations in exchange for his support, sources close to the matter told NBC News on Tuesday. The contest between Ellison and Perez, the clear front-runners in the race, is viewed by many progressive activists as a proxy battle between the progressive wing of the party and the more centrist Democratic establishment. Ellison, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential primary, enjoys strong support among Sanders supporters. Meanwhile, Perez, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the primary race and was all but endorsed by former President Barack Obama, has gotten more traction with Clinton backers in the primary race.Perez, Ellison and Buckley are competing with seven other candidates: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown; South Carolina Democratic Party chair Jaime Harrison; media strategist Jehmu Greene; Robert Vinson Brannum, Veterans Committee chair of the NACCP’s Washington D.C. branch; Milwaukee attorney Peter Peckarsky and Ohio activist Sam Ronan. DNC voting members will elect the next chair and other senior officers at a meeting in Atlanta on Feb. 25.This story has been updated to include a response from the Perez campaign.Below is the full text of Ellison’s letter to the 447 voting DNC members:DNC Member - Over the last several months, we have had important conversations across the country about the future of our party. I am proud to have the support of more than 750,000 grassroots Americans, hundreds of state elected officials, more than 15 labor unions and officials, and dozens of state party chairs, vice chairs, and elected official DNC Members who have chosen to make their support public.One of the other great candidates for this race released an unverifiable public whip count earlier this week. You received a voicemail, email and a text message trying to make the race sound like it is over. And the goal is clear: to exert pressure on you.We chose not to engage in the same tactics because we believe you deserve the respect to make your own decision without a finger on the scale. However, I feel compelled to respond: we are very confident in our whip count and are in an excellent position to win next week.We know that this race will be close. DNC members are diligently listening to all of the incredible candidates in this race. That is why I have campaigned in the same manner that I will lead. We have traveled to over 30 states – from Alaska to Florida – to meet with DNC members in their states and hear the opportunities we have for the future of our party. Let me assure you, we expect to earn the majority of support from DNC members on February 25, but we intend to do that the way we have over the last several months – conversations with you the DNC members about our vision to win elections and rebuild the party.You have an important decision to make. We honor those of you who are undecided and we respect and will not attempt to manipulate your process. We want to have final in person conversations with you next week in Atlanta. I look forward to having those conversation. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at dnc@keithellison.org to set up a time to chat.Best,Keith Ellison"

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a61b5f290000f616f26eaa.jpeg?cache=4o42znab4e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will replace his executive order suspending travel from seven Muslim-majority countries “in the near future,” according to a Justice Department court filing on Thursday.Given the upcoming executive order, the Justice Department said a federal appeals court should not reconsider a ruling that suspended Trump’s Jan. 27 order.“In so doing, the President will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation,” the Justice Department said in its filing.Trump has said his directive, issued last month, was necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. It barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days. Refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely.The abrupt implementation of the order, however, plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of America’s leading corporations, especially technology firms, which lean heavily on immigrant talent.U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle suspended the order nationwide after Washington state challenged its legality, eliciting a barrage of angry Twitter messages from Trump against the judge and the court system. A three judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel last week upheld Robart’s ruling.In a news conference on Thursday, Trump said his rollout of the travel ban was “very smooth” but the administration got a bad court decision. He said his new order would be written to conform to legal rulings.“The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision,” he said. “We can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more.”The Justice Department court filing said Trump’s order would be “substantially revised” but did not provide details. Last week an congressional aide who asked not to be identified told Reuters that Trump might rewrite the original order to explicitly exclude green card holders, or permanent residents.An unidentified 9th Circuit judge last week requested that the court’s 25 full-time judges vote on whether that should be reconsidered by an 11-judge panel, known as en banc review.While the Justice Department on Thursday did not seek en banc review, it did take issue with the 9th Circuit’s ruling, saying “it should not remain circuit precedent,” and asking that it be vacated when the president issues a new order.In a separate court filing, the states of Washington and Minnesota said the 9th Circuit panel ruling “is firmly grounded in precedent.” The appeals court should not reconsider the ruling, they said.A representative for Washington state’s attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Trump administration’s planned new executive order.(Reporting by Dan Levine and Doina Chiacu; editing by Frances Kerry and Bill Rigby)"

The film, “Watani: My Homeland,” chronicles the perilous story of one family’s decision to leave their home in Syria for a Turkish refugee camp and, eventually, Germany. An executive order signed by President Trump prevented all Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days, but the ban is currently on hold.Hala Kamil fled Aleppo with her four children after her husband, Abu Ali Slaibeh, was captured by militants from the self-titled Islamic State in late 2013. Filmmaker Marcel Mettelsiefen previously told The Huffington Post he began meeting with the family before Slaibeh’s capture, making over 25 trips to Syria in total to document the family’s struggle and eventual admittance to Germany. Kamil’s husband is presumed dead. In different times, the couple used to watch the Oscars together.“Abu Ali and I would stay up late every year to watch the Oscars live on television. Sipping coffee together as we always did, we’d try to recall the names of all the famous actors and actresses as they graced the red carpet, in complete awe of this huge event,” Kamil said in a statement obtained by The Huffington Post about the news that she’d be able to attend the ceremony.Although she feels “incredibly proud and happy” about representing the film, Kamil called the news “bittersweet.” She hopes attending the Oscars can help her spread a peaceful message about refugees from all over the world, and particularly Syria, “a country that has been burnt alive.”“All this destruction and displacement needs the concerted effort of the whole world working together, to help these people back to their roots, the roots they hold so dear,” she wrote. “We need people to understand that we are not terrorists despite what the media and the politicians might say, all we are is human.”In August, Kamil appeared at the United Nations in New York alongside celebrities including Natalie Dormer to highlight the plight of refugees worldwide. Her children, Hammoudi, Helen, Farah and Sara, joined her onstage.In a video filmed in Germany late last year, Kamil worried she might never see Aleppo again.“I miss my family, I miss my home, I miss my garden,” she said. “I want sometimes to be in my garden to drink coffee with my husband. But now, I lost this dream.”The Oscars will air Sunday, Feb. 26, at 7 p.m. ET on ABC."
