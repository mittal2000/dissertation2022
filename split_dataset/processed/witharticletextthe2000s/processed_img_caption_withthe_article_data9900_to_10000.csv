0,POLITICS,Why The Donald Deals With Democrats On Debt Ceiling And DACA,"John A. Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-donald-deals-with-democrats-on-debt-ceiling_us_59bd2d31e4b0390a1564dde4,Trump has found that people like “the art of the deal” when it resolves political gridlock.,2017-09-16,"<p>Protesters at a Trump rally in Atlanta, GA.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bd2e191c0000160079ec50.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You might have noticed that President Donald Trump’s poll numbers have nudged up lately. It’s because Trump has realized that the public seems to like a spirit of bipartisanship in tackling tough problems. Whether it’s compromising on the debt ceiling to fund the most expensive hurricane to hit America, or resolving the status of Dreamers on immigration, Trump has found that people like “the art of the deal” when it resolves political gridlock.President Trump began his presidency dead even, when it came to approval ratings and disapproval ratings, at 44 percent for each. That’s to be expected, after a contentious election. But while the president’s approval ratings plummeted to as low as 32 percent in August, his disapproval ratings shot up to 58 percent. What happened?NBC’s poll the partial Muslim ban showed it was unpopular. Surveys did not show American popular support for repealing Obamacare, and managed to actually make the health care law more popular than ever, as Republicans couldn’t decide between repeal and replace, “skinny repeal” or terminating it and saying good luck to those once covered by it. That’s why I called for bipartisanship in an earlier column on the subject.Fewer people now want a border wall and few experts feel it would really solve the immigration issue. In-party fighting between Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over who was to blame tore apart Republicans. The response to Charlottesville only made things worse, helping the president set records for low public support.So Donald Trump went back to one factor that attracted so many to his presidency: “The Art of the Deal.” After a tepid response to Hurricane Harvey, he reached out to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, cutting an agreement on the debt ceiling to avoid leaving so many Texans in financial distress after the 500 year storm struck. Such good will from the deal could be felt in Florida and Georgia after Hurricane Irma.While Freedom Caucus in Congress started launching attacks on Trump for the debt deal, I emailed some Trump supporters as to what they thought of it all. They replied by saying they would trust the president, a far cry from what the ideologues in Washington, DC said.Now it looks like Trump and Democrats are inching closer to a deal on DACA, the program allowing “Dreamers” to stay in the United States, in exchange for “enhanced border security” which might do a better job of actually limiting immigration than some silly wall in the middle of nowhere. Businesses support keeping the DACA program around too.Trump may have also been motivated by polls showing a strong majority want Dreamers to stay in America and become U.S. citizens. Or he might have seen surveys from 2015 and 2017 reveal that Dreamers (a) are more likely to start a business than even white residents, (b) are taking advantage of educational opportunities, (c) are working hard for Fortune 500 companies, (d) buying cars and (e) are therefore paying taxes, hardly the huddle masses critics are making them out to be. They’re a lot more like Republicans! Why deport the future of the GOP?Steve Bannon argued that the only reason churches defended DACA was to get more Christians in the pews. And that’s a bad thing? Bannon’s firing, and current lack of control over several unpopular policies, might also explain Trump’s rise in the polls.Hard core conservatives have responded by burning Trump hats. I’m sure the president had a good laugh, knowing he could now sell more. Reports claim these deals with Dems are also improving Trump’s spirits, which once sagged when it turns out Breitbart News didn’t really have any idea where American views really were. But now that the moderates are in charge, the president has a chance to rehabilitate his image with the American people.John A.

1,POLITICS,Egypt's Regime Has Held An American Student For Four Years. He May Soon Know His Fate.,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/egypt-etwiy-american-prisoner_us_59bc427ae4b0edff971c3903,"While the violent authoritarianism of Egypt's president has complicated relations with Western allies, President Trump has developed a close bond with him.",2017-09-16,Ahmed Etwiy of New York is shown in an undated photo provided by his mother.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc78f21c0000240079ebe6.png?cache=WxY4aWlu3a&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A 27-year-old U.S. citizen who has spent more than four years in Egyptian custody on dramatic murder and terrorism charges is expected to receive a verdict Monday in his mass trial with almost 500 other people ― a moment his advocates say could be make-or-break. The case underscores how complicated Washington’s relationship with the world’s largest Arab country remains as the U.S.-supported government engages in what rights groups call the worst wave of repression in modern Egyptian history.Egyptian military officers arrested Ahmed Etwiy on Aug. 17, 2013, during a security operation targeting political protesters, according to his family and American attorney Praveen Madhiraju. Authorities held him at a military facility and then a massive prison complex for over three years before a trial began. Etwiy was not even involved in the protests, his defenders maintain. Then a 23-year-old student at the German University in Cairo, he was in the area to escort his grandfather to a bus depot.But the events of that summer in 2013, when the army aligned with street movements to overthrow Egypt’s first democratically-elected president, and the policies of general-turned-president Abdel Fattah Al Sisi since have embroiled thousands of innocent people, leaving international watchdogs, activists, experts and officials with little hope of progress or accountability. Earlier this month, Italy returned its ambassador to Cairo following more than a year of controversy over the Sisi government’s suspected role in the murder of an Italian student there, and Human Rights Watch released a major report arguing that Sisi has greenlit torture and impunity for state security services ― prompting Egypt to block its website.At least 20 Americans are presently behind bars in Egypt. Only two others have been named by their families and representatives: 52-year-old Mustafa Kassem, who like Etwiy was targeted in the summer of 2013, and Ahmed Hassan, who was arrested at the end of 2016 and turned 18 in jail this past May. The Trump administration says it recognizes its responsibility to detained Americans abroad and has already tried to punish Egypt for its human rights problems by cutting some aid. In an email to HuffPost on Friday, a State Department official acknowledged Etwiy’s plight ― something the administration has previously not done publicly. “We can confirm that U.S. citizen Ahmed Etwiy was arrested in Egypt in August 2013 on charges related to his actions during a protest. The trial of Mr. Etwiy is ongoing and a verdict is expected this month,” the official wrote. “The Department of State takes seriously its obligation to assist U.S. citizens abroad; we are providing appropriate consular services and will continue to monitor his case. Consular officers from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo have visited Mr. Etwiy regularly. Consular officers have also regularly attended trial hearings. We are providing all possible consular assistance.”Trump did personally intervene with Sisi ― a world leader with whom he has developed a particularly strong rapport ― over another detained American this past spring. That woman, Aya Hijazi, was released weeks later. But Etwiy’s family and lawyer have told HuffPost they have had no contact with the White House, and representatives for Kassem and Hassan have previously said the same. “We first reached out to the White House in March, and we’ve tried in several cases, both myself and the families. We haven’t heard anything directly,” Madhiraju, the attorney involved in all three cases, said. “The responsibility is really with President Trump: the law says the president must demand the release of Americans unjustly detained abroad.”Etwiy faces three possibilities in the coming days, he added: more delays in the trial, which he called “political tricks”; the unlikely prospect of the judge exercising independence and releasing the young American because of the way the Egyptian authorities have handled him; or being pronounced guilty of crimes like murder ― and potentially facing the punishment.One of his 494 co-defendants is Ibrahim Halawa, an Irishman who was arrested the same day and was then 17. Irish authorities have been more vocal than those of the U.S., which counts Egypt as a top security partner, and and Irish lawmakers claim Sisi personally assured them Halawa will be pardoned once the trial ends. ”It’s normal to be cursed, stripped naked, beaten with a bar, or put in solitary confinement or the “tank” (a pitch-black 3.5m x 5.5m cell),” Halawa has written. “They might also torture another prisoner in front of you. Of course you never forget. Ever.”The State Department declined to address whether Trump has received any similar government promise regarding Etwiy.Etwiy’s family just wants him back.“Ahmed has a dream of pursuing a career in economics. He had one year left to graduation before he was unjustly detained,” his mother, Nagwa El Kordy, wrote in an email this week. “Ahmed is so kind to me, as a mother I wish nothing from him more than he already does for me. He constantly drives me around town, never letting me run any errands alone. He always has the tendency to free his time to take me to my doctors’ appointments and wait for me until I’m done. As a mother, I miss having my son being there for me, I miss his kindness, his courtesy, the decency and delicacy he shows, and overall I miss his gentleness.”Etwiy spent his early days in prison worrying about his parents’ reaction and the stress he would cause them by not completing his education, according to a witness to his arrest and the early part of his detention who requested anonymity because of fear of reprisal from the Egyptian government.“We started attempts to get his college to accommodate him...that was layers of disappointment over and above the general situation,” the witness said. He recalled tactics he and others developed to survive in the military camp where he and Etwiy were first taken, like sleeping in shifts because the cells were too small for all the detainees to lie down at once. Once they were moved to the prison where Etwiy remains, Wadi Natrun, they faced new challenges, like insect-infested cells, the denial of medical treatment and random beatings.As the Egyptian government decides whether to let the young American leave those conditions, many in Washington will be watching closely. Last month, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote Trump a letter specifically highlighting Etwiy’s plight. “Etwiy and all of our citizens are looking to you for support and relief,” the senator wrote. “The United States remains committed to our partnership with Egypt, as reflected by Congress annually allocating $1.3 billion in U.S. assistance to Egypt. However, U.S. engagement should be coupled with an Egyptian commitment to human rights and democratic reform that will create accountable, democratic institutions and a dynamic civil society that can give all Egyptian citizens a stake in their nation’s future.”"

Brown, known lovingly in her community as Aunt V, was born March 10, 1900, and lived to be 117, according to the Jamaican government.She died at Fairview Medical Centre in Montego Bay, St. James, about 2:30 p.m. local time, according to the Jamaica Observer. Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, announced Aunt V’s death on Twitter and included a photo of his last visit to her home in Duanvale, Trelawny.Holness visited her in April after she became the world’s oldest person, according to the Gerontology Research Group, a volunteer group that tracks the world’s longest-living people. During his visit, Holness gave the 117-year-old a Medal of Appreciation and certificate to acknowledge her hard work and “robust life.” “God has chosen me for a purpose. I never believed I could live this long… to all of this 117 years, but God is good,” Aunt V told the prime minister. “Sometimes I laugh. God has a plan for everybody.”Aunt V had an upcoming appointment to meet with Guinness World Record officials to ensure her official title as the oldest person on Earth. Although she had not been verified by Guinness, it is likely that Aunt V would have been awarded the title since the trusted record-tracking organization depends on the Gerontology Research Group’s information, according to The Associated Press.“She’s the oldest person that we have sufficient documentation for at this time,” Robert Young, a director of the research group, told AP.Aunt V was Jamaica’s first country-certified super-centenarian, a rare title saved for people who live past the age of 110. According to the Jamaican government, she was alive when Britain’s Queen Victoria reigned over the island. In April, Aunt V shared her secrets to living a long life: Hard work and faith in God.“I was a cane farmer. I would do every work myself,” she told AP at the time. “I worked, me and my husband, over that hill.”Aunt V added: “I spent all my time in the church. I like to sing. I spent all my time in the church from a child to right up” to that day."

The law took effect in 2012, prompting celebrations from animal rights activists but backlash from some chefs who said it infringed on their rights to serve what they want.However, in 2015, a Los Angeles U.S. District judge struck down the ban on the sale of foie gras, ruling it was an “ingredient,” and that the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act gives the U.S. Department of Agriculture sole jurisdiction over the ingredients that are allowed in poultry products. A ban on producing force-fed foie gras remains within the state.But as of Friday, it looks like foie gras could soon be off California’s menus once again. A Pasadena-based appeals court overturned the 2015 ruling. Judge Jacqueline Nguyen wrote that the law was not banning an ingredient, but rather a method of production.“It is not the livers that are force-fed, it is the birds,” she wrote, according to the Sacramento Bee. “The difference between foie gras produced with force-fed birds and foie gras produced with non-force-fed birds is not one of ingredient. Rather, the difference is in the treatment of the birds while alive.”Nguyen also pointed out that more than a dozen countries — including Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom — have some type of ban on forced feeding or foie gras, the Los Angeles Times reports.Restaurants are not mandated to remove foie gras from menus immediately, though. Challengers of the ruling still have time to appeal it, and the ban won’t be officially reinstated until the appeals process is over, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. And that process could take months.“As it stands right now, nothing changes,” Cathy Kennedy, director of pro-foie gras group Coalition for Humane and Ethical Farming Standards, told the Chronicle. “We are absolutely going to appeal.”"

Each shows a different  aspect of the pair's relationship,2017-09-16,<p>Superfruit — consisting of Pentatonix members Mitch Grassi and Scott Hoying — released full-length album <em>Future Friends </em>Sept. 15.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bce4df190000160056411c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With Pentatonix, Mitch Grassi and Scott Hoying won TV's The Sing Off and three Grammy Awards. The long-time BFFs admit, however, splinter group Superfruit reflects the ""different sides"" of their personalities in ways the multi-platinum a capella quintet cannot. ""Mitch and I grew up doing theatre and choir. We were such choir nerds!"" Hoying told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. ""Pentatonix satisfies that part of ourselves."" (Not surprisingly, fellow Pentatonix member and long-time bestie Kirstin Maldonado said nearly those exact words in her own, recent interview on the program!)""We’re also gay and fun and best friends,"" Hoying went on to tell Podomatic's No. 1 LGBT Podcast. ""Superfruit is more that side of our personalities.""On Sept. 15, Superfruit released full length album Future Friends. Building on the saccharine-sweet influences of precursor EP Future Friends, Part One, released earlier this year, a video for ""How You Feeling?"" debuted the same day. A pro wrestling-themed music video for the title track was issued earlier this month. ""[Superfruit] is a very good representation of our musical common ground as people, as musicians,"" said Grassi during the interview. ""We have very different musical tastes,"" he shared, ""But I think we both enjoy musicality and funk and summer anthems...""""And pop!"" Hoying chimed in. ""And pop music at its very core,"" Grassi continued, never missing a beat. ""It’s been fun to explore what pop music means to both of us.""WATCH: Superfruit’s “How You Feeling?” Grassi, Hoying and fellow Pentatonix member Kirstin Maldonado -- who released her own solo EP recently -- first met as high school students in Texas. They later formed the a capella group, which ultimately won the third season of TV competition series The Sing Off.Collectively, the quintet has nabbed three Grammys, sold millions of albums worldwide and, later this year, regroup to tour in support of a re-released deluxe edition of chart-topping 2016 album A Pentatonix Christmas. A second-annual televised holiday special is scheduled for NBC.""In Pentatonix, all five of us have to get on the same page for everything we do, so we sacrifice personal things we want [to explore musically], "" Hoying said, explaining his and Grassi's decision to release original music as Superfruit. During what Hoying referred to as a ""transitional phase"" for the larger ensemble -- presumably bass singer Avi Kaplan's departure from the fold earlier this year -- the duo immediately went to work together. In the interest of time, they opted to release an EP which could ""do it's thing"" while working toward the full-length album. ""We were, like, very anxious to get started,"" Hoying stayed. ""We had a few months, so we were like, ‘Let’s get an EP out.’ It was just a way to get content out quickly."" Now that the body of work is available in its entirety, the resulting collection bears a mixture of musical influences. Grassi cites artists from Beyoncé to Bruno Mars and Charlie XCX. Hoying said R&B star and acquaintance Jazmine Sullivan ""inspired"" some melodies for the album. Both give a nod of appreciation to friend Betty Who, who appeared on Party Foul Radio earlier this year. Their collaboration, ""Beautiful,"" appeared on the Aussie diva's 2017 album The Valley. ""It was amazing; we're such big fans of hers,"" said Grassi of the ""last minute"" opportunity to work with Who. ""We love that song. The message is so important right now, and it’s so on-brand for both of us.""WATCH: Superfruit - “Future Friends”Accompanying most tracks from Future Friends are vivid music videos. Each shows a different aspect of the pair's relationship which, despite never-ending curiosity and insistence from fans, is strictly platonic. ""I feel like our friendship is so bright and upbeat and colorful,"" Hoying detailed. ""We wanted to give that look in our videos. We wanted to be fun and free and liberated. ""‘Liberated’ is a good word,"" Grassi agreed.That does not mean the pair do not feel at liberty to be themselves in Pentatonix, Grassi stated emphatically. ""We absolutely do, but it’s different,"" he says. ""We are definitely ourselves in Pentatonix, but it’s a sort of different demographic. There is an overlap, but we’re catering to a different crowd."" Grassi is quick to ease the minds of fans worried success outside Pentatonix might spell the end to the act. He suggests members satisfying individual creative drives actually makes the collective stronger.

Jerry Brown.",2017-09-16,These two Shih Tzus were rescued from a puppy mill and brought to the Toronto Humane Society in 2013.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bd7dea1a00002400f07051.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California will become the first state to ban pet stores from selling cats, dogs or rabbits that don’t come from a shelter or rescue group if Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signs the bill sent to him this week.The Pet Rescue and Adoption Act, AB 485, passed the California State Senate with a 32-0 vote on Tuesday, NBC San Diego reports. It had passed the State Assembly in May on a 55-11 vote. More than 30 California cities already have similar local laws, according to the Fresno Bee.The governor has until Oct. 15 to sign the bill into law or veto it, the Bee notes. Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for Brown, declined to comment to The Associated Press on whether he plans to sign it.Under the legislation, pet store owners that still wished to sell cats, dogs or rabbits would have to work with local animal shelters and rescue groups to do so.Supporters of the bill, which include prominent animal advocacy groups like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States, point to two main benefits. First, it would prevent California pet stores from supporting breeding facilities that mass-produce animals, often in deplorable conditions. Those operations are popularly referred to as “puppy mills,” although the same kinds of facilities also exist for cats and other species.Additionally, the legislation would promote the adoption of pets from animal shelters. Last year, an estimated 1.5 million companion animals were euthanized in shelters in the United States, according to ASPCA data.Dr. Gary Weitzman, president and CEO of the San Diego Humane Society, pointed out that the measure could also save taxpayer money.“California taxpayers spend over a quarter of a billion dollars every year to house homeless animals,” Weitzman said in an ASPCA press release sent to HuffPost. The money aside, he added that the legislation’s chief value is that “it eliminates a main source of sales for inhumane commercial breeders.”Opponents of the bill argue that it would limit consumer access to popular breeds of animals found less often in shelters. They also note that the genetic and medical history of animals in shelters is not always known.“Pet stores represent a well-regulated and reliable source for responsibly raised animals, often breeds which are not readily available nearby,” Mike Bober, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, told the San Diego Tribune.However, the proposed law would only affect pet stores, meaning that people wishing to purchase an animal directly from a private breeder could still do so.According to the ASPCA, more than 230 cities, towns and counties in the United States have similar laws.One of the most comprehensive of those measures was passed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in August. Cambridge’s ordinance bans pet stores from selling any non-rescue animals other than fish — meaning that besides dogs and cats, it also covers everything from birds to snakes to small animals like mice, rats and hamsters."
8,WOMEN,This Cop Had The Audacity To Have A Baby. So Her Bosses Got Rid Of Her.,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breastfeeding-at-work-stephanie-hicks-tuscaloosa_us_59bc02d3e4b0edff971bb8c1,The inside story of how Stephanie Hicks fought back -- and won a victory for herself and working women everywhere.,2017-09-16,Stephanie Hicks poses with her husband and two sons. She was driven off the police force after the birth of her older boy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc0cce1c00003a0079eaad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before she took maternity leave, Alabama police officer Stephanie Hicks was right where she wanted to be in her career. She’d finally landed a spot in the narcotics division, a goal of hers since starting at the Tuscaloosa Police Department in 2007.Narcotics work was often dangerous. There was that time Hicks posed undercover as a prostitute. Another time she masqueraded as a drug dealer. But she loved it. She wanted to focus on drug issues, having grown up in Tuscaloosa and seen the damage that prescription drug abuse was doing to her community.By the time she went on maternity leave in 2012, she was investigating illegal prescription drug sales, counseling and doing community outreach. In her last performance review before she went on leave, Hicks’ supervisor wrote that she “exceeded expectations.”Then the baby came. For 12 weeks, Hicks was home with her little boy. The baby’s collar bone broke during delivery and he needed extra-tender care. He had colic and was constantly crying. She was either breastfeeding him or expressing more milk, using an electric pump, pretty much around the clock.At no point did she back away from her plan to return to work, she said, nor did she intend to stop breastfeeding once she was back on the job.“That was never the plan,” Hicks, 38, told HuffPost recently. Like many other working mothers, Hicks figured she’d bring her pump to work and take two breaks during her 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift to express milk. Friends of hers, including at least one in another division of the Tuscaloosa Police Department, had done much the same.But from the moment she returned to work, nothing went as planned. Hicks said her supervisors treated her differently, refusing to accommodate her need for pumping breaks, among other problems.“I was blindsided,” Hicks said.Less than two weeks after she came back, Hicks quit her job. She felt like she had no choice. Her supervisors had essentially given her an ultimatum: Give up breastfeeding or quit the police force.“There were no other options,” Hicks said.But she hadn’t really given up. Wary after a colleague warned her that supervisors weren’t happy about her leave, Hicks had been secretly taping her own conversations with supervisors. Armed with that evidence, she filed suit against the Tuscaloosa Police Department for discrimination.Now, nearly five years later, she’s scored a decisive win ― for herself and for women around the country.In early September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit confirmed a jury’s finding that the Tuscaloosa department discriminated against Hicks in violation of the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The decision in Hicks v. City of Tuscaloosa appears to be the first time that a federal appellate court has recognized that employers are obligated to accommodate workers who are breastfeeding, just as they would employees who are injured, said Galen Sherwin, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.The ACLU, along with the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, submitted an amicus brief on behalf of 22 women’s organizations in Hicks’ favor. They also helped argue the case before the 11th Circuit.Hicks wrote about her experience on the ACLU’s blog.“My family has made great sacrifices for this fight. We have lost friends and colleagues, suffered great professional harm, and been subject to ridicule, mockery, and retaliation,” she wrote on Thursday. “But I wouldn’t have done anything differently.”“You shouldn’t have to choose between working and breastfeeding,” Hicks, who had her second son two years ago, told HuffPost. “Now women don’t have to.”Returning to work from maternity leave is typically a bit fraught, especially for first-time mothers. But what Hicks experienced went far beyond the typical anxieties. (The following details are taken from the courts’ decisions in her case.)On her first day back at the Tuscaloosa Police Department, Hicks was written up for not changing the oil in her department-issued car. The department offered no evidence that the infraction had occurred. Later at trial, it would fail to provide a single other instance in which an officer in the department had been penalized for not changing a car’s oil.Hicks soon overheard two of her supervisors saying they would find “any way” they could to “get rid of that little bitch.”Only eight days after her return, Hicks was demoted from plain-clothes narcotics investigator to uniformed patrol officer. Her pay was decreased. Her regular weekends off were taken away; her hours were no longer set.Hicks recalled feeling dumbfounded as to what she’d done wrong. “I just kept asking what’s going on,” she said. “I just went on leave and had a baby, and they kept saying you’re a horrible officer. There was no evidence of that.”Hicks played one of her secret audio recordings for HuffPost, which she said was taken when she met with her captain to discuss why she was being kicked out of the narcotics division.In the recording, he does not explain, instead yelling at her that he’s “pissed off.” He says she doesn’t deserve to be in the narcotics division any more than anyone else does. “Pack your stuff up and go. I want you out of the office,” he says.The Tuscaloosa Police Department declined to comment on the case. Lt. Teena Richardson, Hicks’ former direct supervisor, told HuffPost by phone that she did not want to discuss the matter.When Hicks was out on maternity leave, according to the appeals court decision, a colleague heard Richardson complaining about Hicks taking too many weeks off. (Up to 12 weeks is the time-off set by the Family and Medical Leave Act for eligible employees.) And when she returned, it was Richardson she overheard calling her a bitch.As a patrol officer, Hicks once again had to wear a snug bulletproof vest. A lactation consultant and a doctor both told her that the tight vest would inhibit milk production and possibly even lead to infection. Hicks told her supervisors about this right away ― the day after her demotion – and showed them a doctor’s note. She asked for desk duty. It’s not unusual for police officers to be temporarily assigned to desk duty if they’re sick or injured.Her supervisors didn’t give Hicks that option. Instead, they suggested she just not wear the vest, a move that she believed would put her life at risk. They also suggested she wear a roomier vest, which would also be less safe.She appealed to the police department’s human resources office and the city’s legal department, and they didn’t budge.“It was like being asked to jump out of a plane without a parachute,” Hicks said, borrowing a simile that one of her lawyers used in court. “It was a slap in the face,” she said. “I couldn’t accept being forced to choose.”She quit the next day and never spoke to her captain again.The jury trial in February 2016 was painful, Hicks said.“There were so many hurtful things that were said,” she recalled. “One of the witnesses testified that he heard my supervisor refer to me as a cunt, saying I should never have taken that much maternity leave.”Hicks will receive $161,319.92 from the city of Tuscaloosa, plus attorneys’ fees and costs. It’s not clear yet if the city will appeal the 11th Circuit’s decision. The police department referred HuffPost to its legal office, which pointed to a spokesperson for the city of Tuscaloosa, who sent HuffPost this statement: “Although we are respectful of the court’s ruling, we strongly disagree with the decision. Currently, the City is evaluating the next step that will be taken in this matter.”The statement also said, “The City of Tuscaloosa and the Tuscaloosa Police Department strive to provide a workplace that is accommodating for all individuals and free of discrimination and retaliation.”At trial last year, the city tried to argue that Hicks’ performance forced their hand. But the jury found all the evidence of discriminatory conduct more persuasive.The Affordable Care Act requires employers to provide a private sanitary space for breastfeeding women to pump breast milk. Tuscaloosa did not. Hicks pumped in a locker room. Occasionally, janitors and random civilians would walk through, she told HuffPost.“A lot of times it was very rushed,” Hicks said. “My supervisor would be calling me on the radio telling me, ‘Wrap those boobs up.’”She said one supervisor suggested she could pump in a public restroom, hardly a sanitary space, when she was on patrol.Since Hicks filed her case in 2013, the department has created a space for lactating women.More broadly, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires employers to offer pregnant women accommodations so they can continue working ― like putting an expecting patrol officer on desk duty, for example, or switching a Walmart employee who lifts large boxes to handling the checkout line. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this requirement in a 2015 decision involving a pregnant UPS worker who was forced out of her job after the company refused to give her a lighter workload, even though the company made similar accommodations for injured male workers.But when Hicks took her claims against the police department and the city of Tuscaloosa to trial, there was still debate over whether a nursing mother was protected. Courts had previously ruled that lactating women didn’t have the right to any kind of accommodation under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. One judge ruled that it was not sex discrimination to fire a woman because she was breastfeeding in part on the grounds that under certain circumstances men could also breastfeed.“False distinctions and logical distortions,” said ACLU attorney Sherwin, summing up the earlier state of the law.The Hicks decision is the first to recognize that employers are required to accommodate breastfeeding women, Sherwin said. It’s taken a long time, she added, for the law to catch up with the “basic facts of biology.”The victory is a bittersweet one for Hicks. Her career has been completely derailed. These days she’s teaching classes at a nearby gym, as her family scrapes by with less income.“A lot of people doubted my reasons for leaving my career to breastfeed my son,” Hicks said recently, taking a break from preparing for her son’s fifth birthday party. “I put my family at financial [risk], but I couldn’t accept being forced to choose. I wanted other people to understand.”Ultimately she’d like to help other police officers navigate the maternity leave process, Hicks said.“So many other mothers have reached out to me all over the nation, sharing stories of similar situations, who made the choice of quit breastfeeding or quit their job,” she said. “I think so many mothers have the same feelings. But it takes someone taking action to change anything.”Are you a mother with a story about discrimination in the workplace? Please reach out to talk to me at emily.peck@huffpost.com.Clarification: Language has been amended to reflect that Hicks’ settlement and the lawyers’ fees are separate."

That could explain why the gathering that surrounded the base of the reflection pool at the Lincoln Memorial this afternoon was significantly larger than the pro-Trump rally.In 2011, the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center designated Juggalos, who say they are simply fans of a band, as a “loosely organized hybrid gang,” saying a subset of the group is involved in criminal activity. The agency sent out briefing materials to all law enforcement offices around the country listing Juggalos as a gang alongside Crips, Bloods and MS-13. They pointed out particular signs to look for to see if a person was a Juggalo, like the “hatchet man” symbol of the Insane Clown Posse.The result was that people who counted themselves fans of Insane Clown Posse have been fired from their jobs, lost children in custody battles and were targeted and harassed by police.Kevin Gill, an employee for the band and host of a Juggalo podcast, gave the opening remarks, calling the rally, “The most important day in Juggalo history.” This protest was “some monumental shit,” he added, before ripping into a denunciation of the FBI for categorizing Juggalos as a gang. In response, the crowd broke into a raucous chant about the much-hated FBI, “They fucked up! They fucked up!”“Give us back our fucking civil rights,” Gill shouted.Gill and every other speaker at the Juggalo rally preached inclusivity with a passion that speakers at the pro-Trump rally reserved for subjects liker border security.“We don’t care if you’re black, white, Hispanic, straight, gay, trans, fat as fuck or skinny as a broom stick,” Gill said, adding everyone is welcome to be or support Juggalos.This was largely the message from the Juggalos in attendance.“At the core of it, it’s just a battle cry against discrimination,” Christian Ike, a Juggalo who traveled from Los Angeles for the protest, told HuffPost. “Obviously there’s worse discrimination in this country than what the Juggalos are facing. But we’re here to say that we’re also with those people.”Jessica, a Juggalo from Arlington, Virginia, who declined to give her last name, told HuffPost, “We’re not a gang. We don’t do that. We’re about love and family.”“I’m tired of the FBI going around harassing people, pulling them over, people getting fired,” Kev aka “Juggs” from the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, said.Four speakers recounted the ways that their lives have been negatively impacted by the FBI’s designation of Juggalos as a gang.New Mexico resident Crystal Guerrero said that she lost custody of two children because she went to one Insane Clown Posse show. Laura King of Fredericksburg, Virginia, recounted how she was permanently placed on a gang registry while she was on probation for a DUI offense because she had a tattoo of the hatchet man symbol. Jessica Bonometti was fired from her job as a probation officer in Woodbridge, Virginia, because she liked some Insane Clown Posse-related photographs on Facebook.Zac, a Juggalo from Utah County, Utah, wearing a bright orange suit while holding the Utah state flag, told HuffPost that he had been harassed numerous times by police and private security just for wearing Insane Clown Posse T-shirts and having bumper stickers on his car. He said that he doesn’t wear the clothes or decorate his car the way he’d like to because it makes him a target.“I do not support Insane Clown Posse the way I normally would and I feel that it’s in violation of my rights as an American to support a band and that’s why I’m here,” he said.Further east on the mall, closer to the U.S. Capitol building, pro-Trump activists had convened the “Mother of All Rallies,” to “help send a message to Congress, the media and the world: we stand united to defend American culture and values.”As it turned out, the self-described “Woodstock of American rallies,” drew just a few hundred people, leaving much of the enclosed grass area allotted to the group empty for the duration of the afternoon. The lineup of speakers consisted mainly of D-list conservative leaders like Marco Gutierrez, the founder of Latinos for Trump, who famously warned that if the country did not curb immigration there would be “taco trucks on every corner.” No Republican members of Congress or elected officials of any major office were there.The rally organizers made a point of condemning racism on their website, advising attendees, in all caps, “NO CONFEDERATE FLAGS, NO COMMUNIST FLAGS, NO FOREIGN FLAGS ALLOWED.”It was not clear if the members of the Oathkeepers and other right-wing militiamen in khaki tactical vests at the perimeter of the rally strictly enforced this dictum.But for the most part, the gathering appeared to be free of Confederate flags or overtly white supremacist paraphernalia of the kind on display at the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. Jacob Boslet, a 19-year-old from Altoona, Pennsylvania, was waving a “Kekistan” flag popular on the alt-right that resembles a particular version of the Nazi flag.Boslet, whose brother was attending the Juggalo rally, claimed that he was waving the flag to make a statement in support of “free speech,” not white nationalism, which he condemns.“This is to promote the idea that you can create your own entity regardless if it offends someone or not, or someone has already taken it. Look at it ― it looks stupid and is a joke,” Boslet said.There were flashes of the tensions that have flared up between either white supremacists or Trump supporters and left-leaning counterprotesters. Outside the rally perimeter, a group of self-described “antifascists” or Antifa members, some of whom concealed their faces with black bandanas, got into heated political arguments with rally attendees. As the friction increased, U.S. Park Police officers got between the two groups, in an attempt to prevent violence. In short, it was a classic “Make America Great Again” rally reminiscent of those that buoyed Trump’s campaign ― save for the fact that it lacked both Trump and the throngs of supporters that flocked to him on the campaign trail. At one point, a speaker even got the crowd into a chant of “Lock her up,” the campaign-trail mantra about then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Asked about Trump’s stumbles, including the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, rally-goers universally blamed congressional Democrats and Trump’s Republican critics like Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.). For the most part, they were not even especially perturbed by Trump’s apparent willingness to help undocumented immigrants who arrived as children stay in the country. “I don’t really think that people want everyone who came here illegally deported because some of them are trying to build a future for themselves and a future for their country,” Boslet said. In many ways, the ralliers reflected the more independent nature of Trump’s fan base. Few if any attendees who spoke to Huffpost identified as Republicans.Jennifer McGarrity, a 43-year-old sales manager, who drove down from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to show support for the president, identified as a “pro-choice” independent. She was unfazed by Trump’s increased willingness to forge agreements with congressional Democrats.“He knows how to get the deal done when he wants his agenda to pass through so he’ll talk to who he has to,” she said. More than one rally attendee said that their only disappointment in Trump was his willingness to intervene militarily in foreign countries.“I’m disappointed that he wants to be a war president. Instead of going toward a route of peace, he wants to wage war whether it be in Syria or North Korea,” said Manny Vega, a 32-year-old truck driver from Richmond, Virginia, who served four tours in Iraq with the Marines. Vega is especially concerned about the length of the war in Afghanistan, which has lasted nearly 16 years. He noted that the young children of veterans who fought at the beginning of the Afghanistan War are now eligible to serve in it.“It’s a real sad situation where father and son are fighting the same war,” he said."

They pointed out particular signs to look for to see if a person was a Juggalo, like the “hatchet man” symbol of the Insane Clown Posse.The result was that people who counted themselves fans of Insane Clown Posse have been fired from their jobs, lost children in custody battles and were targeted and harassed by police.Kevin Gill, an employee for the band and host of a Juggalo podcast, gave the opening remarks, calling the rally, “The most important day in Juggalo history.” This protest was “some monumental shit,” he added, before ripping into a denunciation of the FBI for categorizing Juggalos as a gang. In response, the crowd broke into a raucous chant about the much-hated FBI, “They fucked up! They fucked up!”“Give us back our fucking civil rights,” Gill shouted.Gill and every other speaker at the Juggalo rally preached inclusivity with a passion that speakers at the pro-Trump rally reserved for subjects liker border security.“We don’t care if you’re black, white, Hispanic, straight, gay, trans, fat as fuck or skinny as a broom stick,” Gill said, adding everyone is welcome to be or support Juggalos.This was largely the message from the Juggalos in attendance.“At the core of it, it’s just a battle cry against discrimination,” Christian Ike, a Juggalo who traveled from Los Angeles for the protest, told HuffPost. “Obviously there’s worse discrimination in this country than what the Juggalos are facing. But we’re here to say that we’re also with those people.”Jessica, a Juggalo from Arlington, Virginia, who declined to give her last name, told HuffPost, “We’re not a gang. We don’t do that. We’re about love and family.”“I’m tired of the FBI going around harassing people, pulling them over, people getting fired,” Kev aka “Juggs” from the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, said.Four speakers recounted the ways that their lives have been negatively impacted by the FBI’s designation of Juggalos as a gang.New Mexico resident Crystal Guerrero said that she lost custody of two children because she went to one Insane Clown Posse show. Laura King of Fredericksburg, Virginia, recounted how she was permanently placed on a gang registry while she was on probation for a DUI offense because she had a tattoo of the hatchet man symbol. Jessica Bonometti was fired from her job as a probation officer in Woodbridge, Virginia, because she liked some Insane Clown Posse-related photographs on Facebook.Zac, a Juggalo from Utah County, Utah, wearing a bright orange suit while holding the Utah state flag, told HuffPost that he had been harassed numerous times by police and private security just for wearing Insane Clown Posse T-shirts and having bumper stickers on his car. He said that he doesn’t wear the clothes or decorate his car the way he’d like to because it makes him a target.“I do not support Insane Clown Posse the way I normally would and I feel that it’s in violation of my rights as an American to support a band and that’s why I’m here,” he said.Further east on the mall, closer to the U.S. Capitol building, pro-Trump activists had convened the “Mother of All Rallies,” to “help send a message to Congress, the media and the world: we stand united to defend American culture and values.”As it turned out, the self-described “Woodstock of American rallies,” drew just a few hundred people, leaving much of the enclosed grass area allotted to the group empty for the duration of the afternoon. The lineup of speakers consisted mainly of D-list conservative leaders like Marco Gutierrez, the founder of Latinos for Trump, who famously warned that if the country did not curb immigration there would be “taco trucks on every corner.” No Republican members of Congress or elected officials of any major office were there.The rally organizers made a point of condemning racism on their website, advising attendees, in all caps, “NO CONFEDERATE FLAGS, NO COMMUNIST FLAGS, NO FOREIGN FLAGS ALLOWED.”It was not clear if the members of the Oathkeepers and other right-wing militiamen in khaki tactical vests at the perimeter of the rally strictly enforced this dictum.But for the most part, the gathering appeared to be free of Confederate flags or overtly white supremacist paraphernalia of the kind on display at the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. Jacob Boslet, a 19-year-old from Altoona, Pennsylvania, was waving a “Kekistan” flag popular on the alt-right that resembles a particular version of the Nazi flag.Boslet, whose brother was attending the Juggalo rally, claimed that he was waving the flag to make a statement in support of “free speech,” not white nationalism, which he condemns.“This is to promote the idea that you can create your own entity regardless if it offends someone or not, or someone has already taken it. Look at it ― it looks stupid and is a joke,” Boslet said.There were flashes of the tensions that have flared up between either white supremacists or Trump supporters and left-leaning counterprotesters. Outside the rally perimeter, a group of self-described “antifascists” or Antifa members, some of whom concealed their faces with black bandanas, got into heated political arguments with rally attendees. As the friction increased, U.S. Park Police officers got between the two groups, in an attempt to prevent violence. In short, it was a classic “Make America Great Again” rally reminiscent of those that buoyed Trump’s campaign ― save for the fact that it lacked both Trump and the throngs of supporters that flocked to him on the campaign trail. At one point, a speaker even got the crowd into a chant of “Lock her up,” the campaign-trail mantra about then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Asked about Trump’s stumbles, including the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, rally-goers universally blamed congressional Democrats and Trump’s Republican critics like Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.). For the most part, they were not even especially perturbed by Trump’s apparent willingness to help undocumented immigrants who arrived as children stay in the country. “I don’t really think that people want everyone who came here illegally deported because some of them are trying to build a future for themselves and a future for their country,” Boslet said. In many ways, the ralliers reflected the more independent nature of Trump’s fan base. Few if any attendees who spoke to Huffpost identified as Republicans.Jennifer McGarrity, a 43-year-old sales manager, who drove down from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to show support for the president, identified as a “pro-choice” independent. She was unfazed by Trump’s increased willingness to forge agreements with congressional Democrats.“He knows how to get the deal done when he wants his agenda to pass through so he’ll talk to who he has to,” she said. More than one rally attendee said that their only disappointment in Trump was his willingness to intervene militarily in foreign countries.“I’m disappointed that he wants to be a war president. Instead of going toward a route of peace, he wants to wage war whether it be in Syria or North Korea,” said Manny Vega, a 32-year-old truck driver from Richmond, Virginia, who served four tours in Iraq with the Marines. Vega is especially concerned about the length of the war in Afghanistan, which has lasted nearly 16 years. He noted that the young children of veterans who fought at the beginning of the Afghanistan War are now eligible to serve in it.“It’s a real sad situation where father and son are fighting the same war,” he said."

Speaking to reporters on Friday, the duo confirmed that they have another project in the pipeline. “We’re back in business,” Dunham said. No details about the project have been made public as of yet, though Dunham hinted, “you’ll definitely see some more awkward situations and people showing their darker selves.” In short, it sounds like a return to form for the brains behind the famously messy, neurotic characters of “Girls.”“We’re feeling lucky and busy,” Dunham told People.There’s no sign of when this unnamed TV show might be coming to viewers, but in the meantime, Dunham and Konner have plenty of joint projects on the way. They co-founded the popular feminist newsletter Lenny Letter, which celebrated its second anniversary on Friday; the newsletter spawned an imprint at Random House that published its first book, Sour Heart by Jenny Zhang, this summer. In 2016, Konner and Dunham revealed that Lenny Letter would be launching an HBO documentary series.Konner and Dunham also produced a short film, the “Lost in Translation”-esque “Tokyo Project,” which will air on HBO this fall. The short was directed by Richard Shepard, who previously worked with Konner and Dunham on “Girls,” and stars actress Elisabeth Moss.Even amid the run of “Girls,” the showrunners were busy with other projects. In 2015, it was reported that Dunham was at work on a new comedy pilot for HBO. “Max,” which was reportedly set in the 1960s publishing scene, was set to star Zoe Kazan. Though “Max” has yet to see the light of day, it seems likely that the project she and Konner referenced on Friday is a new one.In April 2016, Dunham told The Hollywood Reporter that the “Max” pilot had been filmed. “It was really fun to shoot something else with a really strong female lead and just continue to explore our voice and to support other writers that we really like,” she said.While Dunham didn’t offer the Reporter any more details about the project, she said that it had reaffirmed her interest in working behind the camera. “I hope there’s more just directing or just writing in my future because it’s really refreshing for me.” With another TV show coming, it seems like she’ll be getting to do just that."
13,QUEER VOICES,The Powerful Reason Why This Artist Has Been Saving His Urine For The Last 200 Days,Noah Michelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cassils-monumental-pissed-urine_us_59bbeacee4b0edff971b88f4,"""It’s crazy that we have to go to these extremes but this is the culture that we’re living in.""",2017-09-16,"PISSED: A 200-day durational performance where Cassils has captured all the urine their body has passed since February 26, 2017, when Trump rescinded the Obama era order allowing trans teens to use their bathroom of choice versus the gender assigned to them at birth.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc1d3a1a00007100f06e87.png?cache=nzFcOt8rxf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Cassils spent a good chunk of this week trying to ensure that the 200-gallon tank of urine he was installing at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts didn’t leak and destroy the gallery and its important legacy.“Can you even imagine?” the transgender performance artist, who uses both “he/him” and “they/them” pronouns, asked me when we sat down to chat about his second solo show at the New Your City gallery. The show, entitled Monumental, features a new work that he made by saving his urine for the last 200 days and collecting it in the tank.The piece, PISSED, was created in response to President Donald Trump’s February decision to rescind President Obama’s directive that transgender students should be able to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. PISSED will be unveiled at the gallery on Saturday night when, according to a press release for the show, Cassils will perform a related piece, Fountain, and thereby complete “the 200 day durational performance by linking their body to the minimalist structure.”Cassils, a Canadian-born 2017 Guggenheim Fellow and 2015 Creative Capital Awardee currently living in Los Angeles, has made a career for himself by approaching and proposing theories and questions about the body, politics, gender, history, being transgender and other potentially incendiary topics through his performance-based art. Ahead of the debut of Monumental, he discussed the logistics of preserving so much urine for such a long period of time, his relationship to his body as a transgender artist, the divide between art and activism and more.HuffPost: Did PISSED happen organically in response to Trump’s action in February or was it a piece you’d be conceptualizing in some way and Trump’s move ended up giving you the perfect opportunity to actualize what you’d been incubating? Cassils: It’s something that I’ve been thinking about personally as someone who has to navigate bathrooms on a daily basis. This is just an experience that I’ve had. It was really [stemming from] following the Gavin Grimm case in depth and being really inspired by such a young person. Looking at someone who was just 14 years old and speaking his truth to a bunch of adults and students who were bullying him ― and of course he’s picked up by the ACLU because he’s articulate, well-versed, educated white trans man, and certainly, he isn’t necessarily the stand-in for most trans experiences; there was something incredibly compelling about his bravery. I felt quite attached to that particular story and then when Trump rescinded this order, I just couldn’t believe it. I feel like that about so much of what’s happened — DACA last week, Charlottesville — these issues are not necessarily separate. When you look at something like DACA, we have 800,000 dreams who are being kicked out of the country — young people who are trying to do the right thing — and 50,000 of those are LGBTQ members of our community, so [Trump] is affecting trans and queer people on many different levels across all these different intersectional boundaries.When that order was rescinded I was like, “You know what? Fuck this!” I wanted everybody to do an active protest and FedEx their urine to the White House that night. I thought, Let’s all just flood the White House with piss!Literally.Literally! But I am undergoing my citizenship application and my lawyer said, “Do not do that. You will be 86-ed from this country so fast” ― because sending urine in the post is considered a biohazard, so it’s an act of terrorism, believe it or not. Some people think this issue is ridiculous and that we shouldn’t even be having this conversation but the excretion of our bodies can literally be seen as a loaded weapon. Because of the limitations of taking an actual political action, based on my non-citizenship at the time, I thought, I’m an artist and I’ll go the route of the metaphor and I came up with the concept in a day or two.Sometimes my ideas take a very long time to come to fruition but this one was just right on the surface. That being said, I just started collecting my piss that day [Trump rescinded Obama’s directive] or two days after. But I didn’t know how the project was going to manifest or how I was going to keep the urine — working with a biochemist and the procuring of seven fridges [to hold the urine] wasn’t something I was thinking about at the time.How does a person go about collecting and preserving 200 gallons of urine for months on end?That’s a good question — and that’s a question that no one had really previously asked because why would we ever need to save urine? No one does. My wife is a nurse and I asked her to go to work the next day and ask the doctors about urine preservation and she said, “they’re not going to know about that. They keep urine for a UTI test for maybe two days and then they chuck it. But you know who would know? A biochemist.” And it turns out that my wife, who is a former dominatrix, knows a dominatrix who also has a PhD. in biochemistry and if you go to her website it says “PhDeviant” [laughs]. Her name is Mistress Snow Mercy and I called her up and she totally hooked me up. Because she went to UCLA, she had quite a lot of contacts and she contacted the head of the forensics lab at the L.A. Police Department and someone who worked at a higher level for the children’s hospital and together they brainstormed this formula. They ordered this preservative off of Amazon for me and it came in the mail and I was about to open it and I got this phone call and the voice said, “Cassils, it’s Snow Mercy. Do not open that box.” I had opened it a little bit and there was like a skull and crossbones on it. I guess they thought I was in a lab? I was like, “I’m not in a lab — I’m in my bathroom!” [laughs]. So they figured out a much more non-lab necessary process, which essentially ended up being borax, which is a roach killer, and it kills the bacteria.So you just added that to the urine and you were good to go?Right. So, in short, I would carry around a 24-hour medical urine capture bottle and I would bleach all of these bottles to disinfect them and then air-dry them. I have a funnel, because my aim’s not so hot, and then I’d have to bleach that each time I used it. So I urinate into the bottle and then when it reaches completion, I add 30 grams of the borax solution, shake it up, date it and leave it in the fridge. Living with a performance isn’t always easy [laughs] and my wife was like, “You only get one extra fridge in our one-bedroom [apartment]!”She must be ridiculously patient.[Laughs] She really is! I was like, “that’s fair.” So I had to ask my friends ― and a lot of them don’t have spare spaces ― but I found a couple of friends that have a garage or a studio and I found seven people to let me house fridges that I bought off of Craigslist and then I’d load up my Honda with as much piss as I could fit in and then reposition it in someone’s garage. I literally had urine all over Los Angeles.That’s incredible... and disgusting?A week ago, I had to go around with my friend in their larger car and we filled our cars with 200 gallons of urine. We had to make pit stops to assemble it in 50-gallon oil containers for transport out to New York. It was completely insane and logistically, I want to say one of the hardest performances I’ve ever done.Which is saying a lot, considering the performances you’ve done.I think it’s because there was very little pleasure factor in it for me. My other works are hard — but they’re hard in a way that I like. This was really re-inscribing an oppression. You know, first of all there’s the act of saving your piss and holding your piss really replicates the experience one feels when they’re cognizant of what their body needs to do to empty their bladder, be it in a public space or a private space and all of the anxiety that comes along with this. This piece really hyper-performed that for me.When the exhibition is done, what happens to the urine?That’s a good question. I don’t know what will happen. We’ve been in motion, so we’ve just been trying to keep up with the process. This is a 200-day piece — we started this on February 23 and there were certain days when I was traveling and when you’re traveling you can’t bring urine on a flight with you. So I had to get friends to donate their urine to make up for the days that I couldn’t save my own urine because it’s not about my body, per se, it’s about what one body has to mitigate.So it was surrogate urine.Right. I learned a lot from the people who participated in the piece. Some people were trans-identified, some weren’t and especially for the people that weren’t, it changed the issue in their mind. So, I think going forward, what I’d like to do, as this continues, for example, I have an exhibition in Los Angeles in the spring, and at that point we’ll be over a year into this, so what would it be like to create a tank that held 400 gallons of urine and have the city of Los Angeles do a urine drive? That way the piece would be a collective action. So I think I’m going to continue with this but I’m not sure how. As far as keeping the urine [that will be featured in the New York exhibition], I don’t know. I have a friend who is an art historian who said, “You need to work with a contemporary arts conservationist,” and I was like, “Yeah I do!” [Laughs]I love the idea of trying to archive 200 gallons of urine.Right? I was talking with one of my friends who let me store a fridge with her and she was jokingly calling it my “archive,” but it literally is an archive of my body. Tell me more about Fountain, the performance that will take place on the opening night of the exhibition.This sculpture that I’ve made is a result of this 200-day durational performance. The idea behind the sculpture was to showcase to people just how much fluid one body needs to contend with as the result of a government ordinance. So it kind of makes what might seem abstract in nature very concrete. You see this mass and it’s intense — it’s a lot. So that’s present in this room — this large tank of urine. And then the other component is that I’ve created a four-channel audio piece that accompanies this work and that is basically all of the oral arguments that took place in the Gavin Grimm case. It starts at the Virginia School Board meetings when concerned parents and students are addressing the school board and voicing their concerns about Grim — including Gavin’s voice, who is trying to defend himself, and his mother. It’s incredibly moving. And then I follow those arguments all the way up to the 4th Court of Appeals where you hear the lawyer from the ACLU arguing against the Virginia School Board. And what was striking to me — because I’ve never listened to judicial proceedings from start to finish like that — was the incredible ignorance that ran through all levels of the proceedings. You might expect ignorance at a local school board but you don’t expect that from a 4th circuit judge — that’s quite terrifying.This four-channel installation spacializes these arguments so that the discussions are literally being hurled back and forth over the cube. So what it does is that it contextualizes what you’re looking at. Because although this is an idea about making formally what the fluid amount actually is — at worst it could be reduced to just an aesthetic: “This is beautiful!” “Wow, is this golden nectar?” But when you hear these testimonies — and there’s a lot of Bible quoting, it’s really crazy ― you understand the essentializing that goes on in this country. “God made you man — you are a man! How dare you go against being a man? That’s blasphemy!” And although this is about the trans issue, it does speak to the deep divide in our country right now about these fundamental ideologies and ways that we approach living.And then the performance I’m doing is really a closing ceremony for those 200 days. It’s very different from the rest of my performances that are kind of visually bombastic. I will be facing the sculpture on a very, very high [platform] — probably like 10 feet up in the air, so you’re not eye-line with my crotch. I’m looking down on you. And behind me, is a grid of the 262 orange 24-hour urine capture bottles I used and they create another cube. There’s one space left, which is the one final bottle. So for the two hours of the exhibition opening, I will literally just be standing up there and pissing into the bottle if I have to piss. And at the end of the performance I will climb down and I will dump the urine into the cube and I will place that final bottle on the shelf. So it’s really about closing this piece down.Many trans people do not want to center conversations about being trans around the body because they argue that being trans is so much more than that and that when we focus on just the body, we neglect so many other important issues about and related to being trans. As a trans artist whose work centers around the body — often your body in particular — what are your thoughts on that?I think that [concern] is totally valid. I think the key to that is not creating works that are completely sensationalizing specifically the idea of genitals, for example. So, I think in a way, I’m on the same page as that. So rather than talking about [gender affirmation] surgery or the specifics of someone’s genitals, I’m showing you what a huge block of urine looks like — something that regardless of what you look like or how you work in the world is something that we all have to contend with. It’s about erasing those sensationalist markers. So though it is about the body, I try to create work that speaks to — I don’t want to say all bodies but I try to make work that allows someone who might not have the subjectivity to enter into a reflective dialogue. I try to do something that’s emotionally impactful that could perhaps wrench open a little corner of their mind to imagine what it would be like to be that person.It’s about creating modes for empathy. We all have bodies and there’s something incredibly powerful about live performance in a world where we are so attached to our screens. I used to live in New York City in the early ’90s and when you were riding the subway people would actually look at each other or you would read a book and now everybody is invested in their tiny digital device. So there’s something incredibly impactful about the physical presence of liveness and our bodies are what we use as barometers and thermometers to be present. So I think there are ways of speaking to the body without reducing the body to some essentialist or totally objectified or totally sensationalized body.I’m interested in what you just mentioned about your work possibly “wrenching open a little corner of the mind” for individuals to consider things they may not have considered before. So much of the work that you’ve done — including PISSED — involves elements of shock or revulsion, and definitely danger. You’ve set yourself on fire, you’ve changed how your body looks through extreme measures for and through your art. Is the revulsion and the shock intended ― and intentional ― to help wrench that corner open?I think I am an extreme person but I also think we’re living in extreme times. “Cuts,” the piece you’re talking about where I gained 23 pounds of muscle over 23 weeks was an exploration of where is the line in the sand in regards to how we classify people as male or female. Rather than having surgery or taking hormones, I was interested in exploring my body as a material condition — how can I work with flesh and manipulate flesh and sinew? So on one level you can say, “Wow, that’s really extreme.” But for me it’s more about hyper-performing the things that we take for granted.Some people say, “God said you’re a woman, you must be a woman.” Well, actually, my body is a material and based on the sensory input and the nutrition and the biomechanics and the protocol, I can make [my body] one way or the other. This idea that embodiment is so rigid — that you’re either “this way” or “that way” — or even as a trans person, you’re “this way” and then you take hormones or have surgery and then you’re “that” — I’m interested in mutability and the agency that we can inscribe. Fine, if you want to take hormones but you don’t have to. There are other things we can do. So I guess I’m interested in showcasing that process and unpacking it. So rather than just ending with a really bombastic image, like “Homage to Benglis,” with the lipstick — which is a really bombastic image — I show every single image in between and I record every single meal that I’m consuming and I photograph all of the food that I’ve consumed to get to that point. So for me, it’s about revealing the mechanisms of consumption and capitalism around that end image.So, for example, Eleanor Antin, who starved herself for 72 days in 1972, which is the work that that piece is referencing, you look at her body from the first day to the 72nd day and it looks like something, but it’s not what we’d expect now. So part of it is trying to reflect the extremity that exists. It seems insane that I have to make a cube of piss for people to get this idea. I shouldn’t have to make this. I shouldn’t have to hold my own urine. It’s crazy that we have to go to these extremes but this is the culture that we’re living in. So, I feel like it’s a way of calling to attention the insanity of what we’re undergoing and what we’re enduring — and making it a transparent process that reveals the process. It’s all about revealing it.You recently said that you don’t consider yourself an activist, you consider yourself an artist. I’d argue that most people would look at your art and say, “Those are activist works.” But it also seems like part of what you’re saying is to be a… I was going to say a trans person but perhaps just someone who is “other(ed)” in this culture is to be an activist simply by existing. Talk to me about your ideas about art and activism and how they do or don’t link up for you personally.I have friends who are lawyers and doctors — and when I say “lawyers and doctors” that sounds “fancy” but what I mean is my wife is a nurse at the LGBT center. She deals with really intense issues around healthcare and people who are on the streets, people who are fighting every day to survive as members of our community. I have good friends that work for the ACLU. I know people who are on the streets and going to D.C. to push hardline policy changes and really affect the mechanics and laws that affect our day-to-day lives in extreme ways. So, I guess it’s almost in a way out of reverence for that kind of work that I would never claim [to be an activist]. I think what art does is different. It’s really silly, I guess, to distinguish between “I’m an activist” or “I’m not an activist.” I want to make the world a better place and I want to change people’s minds and if that makes me an activist, then I’m an activist.But you’re not concerning yourself with the specific terminology ― you just want to do what you do.I’m doing what I do with the hope that it starts a conversation but I could never say that I can create policy in a direct way — or I’m not doing the work of that. But I’m very interested in working alongside the people who are doing that kind of work. For example, I’m going to have a panel discussion around this exhibition and Gavin Grimm’s lawyer, Chase Strangio, will be present on it. I think my job is to visually create a language to talk about these issues that lawyers are doing in terms of the policy change that they’re creating or that people in the medical industry are doing around healthcare reform and helping those communities. Maybe I am an artist-activist in a way but what I was saying in that particular context you referenced is that it’s a very different kind of work. It’s a work that I’m doing in a solitary way to express an idea to create a dialogue versus working in teams in the government against this incredibly grinding bureaucracy. I just think those activists would [look at what I do and say] “That’s not activism! That looks like a lot of fun.” [Laughs]There’s such an exhibitionist grounding to your work — and I don’t mean “exhibitionist” in a tawdry or salacious way, like a flasher opening his trench coat on the subway — in that your body is literally used as or becomes an exhibition. Who are you doing the work for? You? Your audience? I’m a firm believer in the idea that the personal is the political. In many ways, although I just said that I’m trying to make work that doesn’t speak to my body, on the flip side of that, my body is my own experience — it’s my subjectivity. I can talk about and say, “We need to be making anti-racist works” and I can speak about racism in a larger scheme but I can only speak about it as a white ally and as a Canadian who immigrated to this country. I have a very different experience [from American people of color]. So, I don’t think of my work as “for me.” If it was just for me, I’d just stay in a garage and paint watercolors [laughs].I think of this as — I don’t have children and I’m not going to have kids, so if I can humbly offer forth something that can make a contribution and allow people to have a different observation about the mechanisms about how we’re living, and that can be helpful to cis or queer folks [that’s important to me]. I definitely make work for queer people but I end up going to universities and lecturing and speaking to a lot of young, cis white people and I speak to those young people about trans issues, about issues of racism in relationship to visual arts practice from my perspective. I can only speak from my own perspective but at the same time I hope to offer forth something that is helpful to a multitude of people. I think of my work as a kind of porous sponge — I try to make entry points for people that have different understandings. I want to make something that’s a strong enough of an image that if you know nothing about art, you can get something from it. You can understand it. You don’t need to read the wall text and you don’t have to have a masters degree. Likewise, I like to make something for the art historian who is like “Oh wow! That’s a play on this very particular Donald Judd and that’s kind of queering white male dry formalism and injecting this minimalist content with a contemporary political form.” And maybe someone’s not going to get that — but maybe someone else will.

These fires will have wide-ranging",2017-09-15,"In 2015, Alaska’s Aggie Creek Fire burned for more than two months, scorched about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) and threatened a nearby oil pipeline.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc3cfc1900003a00564068.jpeg?cache=4OcqTilFUZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Climate change is leading to bigger, more frequent wildfires in the North American Arctic. These fires will have wide-ranging impacts on northern peoples and wildlife, warns author Ed Struzik.IN 2014, NORTHWEST Territories saw the worst wildfire season since 1975, with flames burning 3.4 million hectares (8.4 million acres). The next year, more than 2 million hectares (5.1 million acres) burned in wildfires across Alaska, second only to 2004’s record-breaking 2.7 million hectares (6.6million acres). Increasingly, wildfires in the Arctic are getting worse, as lightning strikes ignite tinder-dry plants that burn from the boreal forest to the tundra.Ed Struzik is a Canadian journalist and author of the forthcoming book, “Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future,” which explores wildfires in the age of climate change across North America and, in particular, Arctic ecosystems.Though wildfire can be an integral, natural part of healthy forest ecosystems, increasingly powerful and frequent “megafires” are compromising water and air quality in the North, reshaping the forests and tundra and threatening the survival of local people.Arctic Deeply recently spoke with Struzik about his new book and what he hopes people will come to understand about the dynamics of wildfire in the fragile Arctic.Arctic Deeply: How did you initially become interested in wildfire and what drove you to write a book about it?Ed Struzik: When I was a journalist in 2003, I covered the wildfires that were occurring in Western Canada’s national parks – Kootenay, Banff, Jasper. It was sort of the wake-up call for everybody who had never quite seen a fire season like that. They’d seen big fires, but not so many fires so close to communities. Rob Walker, who was a senior manager with Parks Canada, said at the time that maybe this was a climate-change signal and that things were going to get a lot worse. It struck me every year after that it seemed to be one big fire after another. Then in 2008/09, NASA sponsored a huge project in northern Alberta where they brought 200 scientists from around the world to study smoke from the wildfires that were burning in western Canada, and I was invited to come along by the Canadian scientist involved. Right from that point on I thought there was a book in the making.Arctic Deeply: You dedicate two chapters of your book to wildfires in the Arctic. Why did you feel it was so important to focus on this part of the world?Struzik: That part of the world is going to be hit hardest from an ecological point of view. Wildfire affects so many of the specialist species in the Arctic, most notably caribou. The more the tundra burns, the more the lichen and the forest burn, the less likely caribou will make it over the hump. I’m sure there will be small, shadow herds in the future, but nothing like the great migrations that we’re seeing now. Once lichen burns, it takes 60, 70, 80 years before it comes back and it’s one of the primary components of caribou’s diet. They can shift to other things, but everything points to an Arctic that’s going to favor more southern species moving north – deer, moose, elk and bison. We’re seeing fires occurring both in the forests and on the tundra accelerating the permafrost thawing that’s already taking place, as well. Once that happens, there’s no going back. It’s like a domino effect – the permafrost thaws and then it unleashes everything that’s been trapped for hundreds of millions of years; a lot of it is chemical compounds, such as mercury, that get into the chemistry of the watershed. That’s having a profound impact on microorganisms, right up to fish, to polar bears and to beluga whales, and ultimately the people who live there.Arctic Deeply: How are these changes in Arctic fire regimes affecting these northern communities?Struzik: The big issue for northern people is it’s just going to further destabilize the food insecurity that they have had for the last 30 to 40 years. There will be fewer caribou, which is the primary source of food for an awful lot of people, and once mercury gets into the food chain, if it starts getting elevated in beluga whales, lake trout and Arctic char, these raise a lot of important questions for the future of Arctic peoples.Arctic Deeply: What did you learn about Arctic fire regimes that you found most interesting?Struzik: The take-home point for me was that fire acts as catalyst for a lot of the changes we’re seeing in the Arctic and in the sub-Arctic regions where we have boreal forests which are born to burn. You get a hotter, drier climate and bigger fires burning in places like Great Slave Lake in 2014 and Alaska in 2015, which was one of the biggest fire seasons they’ve had. And it’s not just over when the fire goes out. There are lasting effects and there are some really sobering examples. In Wood Buffalo National Park, fire burned so intensely it essentially turned a healthy spruce forest into more of a desert-like ecosystem because it burned all the nutrients out of the soil. No trees will grow back there for decades, if not hundreds of years.It’s also coming at a time when diseases that we were so concerned about in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan are now migrating northward and they are taking their toll on hundreds of thousands of hectares of trees in the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Alaska. It’s kind of like several things are at play and wildfire is one of those things. The Arctic that we once knew is disappearing very quickly and a new Arctic is unfolding – and wildfire is one of the reasons why. But we really don’t know what the future is going to look like.Arctic Deeply: What message do you hope people take away from this book?Struzik: From an Arctic point of view, we’ve concentrated so much on receding sea ice and melting glaciers, and I’m partly to blame for that. For nearly a decade, that’s been the story. But another story is unfolding now; there’s another change taking place on land at the same time, transforming the Arctic in the same way – sometimes catastrophically and sometimes beneficially. I think that people have to understand that we’re going to see some huge ecosystem changes in the Arctic and sub-Arctic. It’s not going to look anything like it does right now. If we’re going to plan for the future and Arctic peoples are going to have a future in the Arctic, we’ve got to be able to create a road map.How do we get from where we are now to where we hope to be down the road? We’ve pretty much got the receding sea ice and melting glaciers down pat; that’s happening, and we understand that it’s leading to rising sea levels and increasing, more powerful storms, but we’re seeing a similar thing happening now on land that we are only beginning to appreciate.This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply, and you can find the original here.

15,WORLD NEWS,Looking For Democracy In Syria's Idlib: A Diary Entry,"Wissam Zarqa, Syria Deeplly",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/looking-for-democracy-in-syrias-idlib-a-diary-entry_us_59bc2bbce4b086432b07187c,"After being forced to flee eastern Aleppo in December, Wissam Zarqa moved to Idlib. Although the insurgent-held province",2017-09-15,"A Syrian man casts his vote in a ballot box at a polling station in the city of Idlib as the city’s first civilian council is elected, two years after it was overrun by rebels and jihadists, on January 17, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc35b01c00003a0079eb53.jpeg?cache=qxMSPjduC9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After being forced to flee eastern Aleppo in December, Wissam Zarqa moved to Idlib. Although the insurgent-held province is not known as a bastion of democracy, Zarqa will always remember it as the place where he voted in his first democratic election.IDLIB, SYRIA – Hatred of democracy is spelled out in graffiti on many walls in Idlib city. Strangely, however, it was in this very city, at the age of 35, that for the first time I felt I had the right to vote in a fair and democratic election. Last month, I voted to elect a new president of Idlib University.In the 2000 Syrian presidential election, Bashar al-Assad was the only candidate. Though Syria held its first multi-candidate election in 2014, voting was held only in government-controlled areas and Assad won again, in a result that former U.S. secretary of state John Kerry called “a great big zero.”I taught high school students and English Literature students at Aleppo University before I was displaced from the eastern side of the city in December 2016. A few months later I moved to Idlib and began teaching at Idlib University.Idlib is the last major Syrian city that remains outside the clutches of both Syrian government forces and the so-called Islamic State. It was liberated in March 2015 by the Army of Conquest – an alliance of seven rebel and insurgent groups. Today, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance of some of the strongest factions in Idlib, is the preeminent political and military force.Nonetheless, Idlib University is still trying to practice democracy. Dr. Mohammad al-Sheikh was elected president with more than half of the 85 votes. The remaining votes went to the other two nominated candidates, with the exception of one ballot, which was left blank. (That one wasn’t mine!)The university’s former president, Dr. Mostafa Talib, was one of the candidates nominated for the position. He has an excellent reputation as caring for the students. On many occasions, he has paid the tuition fees for students who could not bear the financial burden. However, in these elections, there was a desire for change. It seems Syrians now have a phobia of an individual remaining in power for too long.These elections were not the first instance of democracy in Idlib province. In January 2017, Idlib city residents elected their first local council. The council was supposed to take over from the civil administration, which had been appointed in 2015, three months after the election, but its authority has so far been limited.However, the two elections underscore an important and ongoing debate in Idlib. On the one hand, there is a school of thought that contests democracy, arguing that it is a form of “man-made” law that opposes Islamic law. On the other hand, there are those who argue that democracy is an optimal way to choose a leader who can understand and apply Islamic law in a way that fits the age in which we are living.With this debate in the background, I find myself obliged to discuss democracy with my students every now and then.In one class I taught in the Idlib countryside, I explained to my young students the meaning of the phrase “the majority is not always right.” When I asked them to name the American president, they answered immediately: “Trump!” When I asked them how he had become president, one student replied, “He has a lot of money.” I agreed that he did but argued that there are many other wealthy individuals, yet none of them became president. At this prompt, they concluded that he had been elected over the others because the majority had chosen him.“Is the majority always right?” I asked. They replied with a confident and resounding “No!”In a lecture on research methodology and qualitative and quantitative research, I had my university students compare the concept of democracy with the concept of “Shura” in Islam. Shura is an Arabic word that translates as “consultation.” The Prophet Muhammad and the Quran use the term to denote consultations with the group of people who would be affected by a decision. If we consider this concept of Shura, we come to realize that Islamic law is not, in fact, incompatible with democracy.Despite its drawbacks, I believe in democracy and do believe that a qualitative democracy is the best way to apply the Islamic principle of Shura. But several big questions remain: How do we sow the seeds of democracy in Idlib, and if we manage to do so, will democracy be able to save us from the many threats looming on our horizon? However, the most terrifying question of all is whether my part of the world will be allowed anything more than a phony and hypocritical form of democracy.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply, and you can find the original here.

The letter is in response to DeVos’ Sept. 7 announcement that she plans to rescind Title IX guidelines that include the Obama-era Dear Colleague Letter. The 2011 letter is a comprehensive set of guidelines that helps universities, victims and students accused of sexual assault navigate the reporting process. Senators who signed the letter include Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). The signers are 13 women and 16 men, all Democrats except for Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).“The current guidance is critical to ensuring that schools understand and take seriously their responsibilities under the law, and we urge you to leave the current guidance in place,” the letter reads. “Rescinding the guidance would be a step in the wrong direction in addressing the national epidemic of campus sexual assault.”The letter added that DeVos’ recent announcement shows she is not dedicated to “a fully transparent process” and isn’t committed to “supporting survivors in obtaining justice and ensuring they are safe on campus.”Read the letter in full below. Gillibrand wrote a scathing essay in Cosmopolitan.com Wednesday criticizing DeVos for planning to roll back Title IX. She wrote that DeVos is making an “enormous mistake.”“With so many sexual assaults still happening on college campuses all over the country,” Gillibrand wrote, “we should be doing everything we can to make our sexual assault prevention and enforcement policies stronger ― not weakening them, not jeopardizing them, and certainly not taking them away.”"

My friends and I watched “Unicorn Store,” actress Brie Larson’s directorial debut. The movie centers around Kit (played by Brie), an eccentric woman who has loved unicorns since she was a child. In one of the opening scenes of the movie, we see Kit, covered in a multitude of colors, painting away. It is only when she takes a step back that we see that she has messily painted the wall around her canvas; and that there are a trio of black-clad art judges behind her, who shake their heads as they write negative critiques on their clipboards.After this experience, Kit attempts to conform to the society she sees around her; she sees a commercial for a temporary hiring agency, applies and lands a position in a PR firm. Soon after, she begins finding elegant notes with her name spelled out in extravagant cursive letters. The notes lead her to an address — the “Unicorn Store,” where a brightly dressed salesman (Samuel L. Jackson) informs her that she can have a pet unicorn, if she adheres to several criteria. Through her journey of fulfilling the criteria, Kit makes a new friend, strengthens her relationship with her parents and begins to embrace the creative side she had previously attempted to stifle.Towards the end of the movie, Kit receives a call that her unicorn is waiting for her. She sees her unicorn and, as is clear from the awe-struck look in her eyes, she loves it. However, she ultimately decides not to take the unicorn home; there is another woman on the waiting list, and Kit realizes that this woman may need the companionship and love of the unicorn more than she does (as she has found those things through fulfilling the initial criteria to get the unicorn).You’ve probably heard the quote about the journey being more important than the destination; I can’t state enough how true this is. As I typed that quote, I thought of the journey I’m on now at university. I wouldn’t want to just be handed a degree; though that is the destination of my four years of studying, I would completely miss the valuable journey to get there. The journey of working, learning and growing is one that I think is irreplaceable. When I graduate, I’ll treasure my diploma; but I will know that my experiences are more rich and meaningful than a piece of paper that says my name on it (I realize, of course, that university degrees are prestigious; but there’s a reason you have to work so hard to earn one).What I thought was especially powerful about Kit’s journey in “Unicorn Store” was that, in the end, Kit made the selfless decision to give up the thing she had been working so hard to secure, for the benefit of someone else. Because, really, while the “thing” she was working towards was the unicorn, she was really working towards creating a better life for herself; she just didn’t realize it at the time. Sometimes goals that we have may cause us to do this, too. We may inadvertently improve our lives along our journey to achieve a goal; and while achieving that goal will still feel great, we’ll have the extra benefits we gained throughout the journey.I think as well, though, that sometimes reaching that destination can be a great way to cap off a journey. Yes, my university experience has been shaped by all of the things along the way to graduation; but walking across the stage to receive my diploma will be an acknowledgement of all of those things. In this way, Kit giving up her unicorn was the final stage in her journey; allowing her to move on from her obsession with the destination and realize the progress that had been made along the way. Focusing on the journey instead of the destination is advice I think we can all apply to some area of our lives—even if our end goal isn’t to own a unicorn."

Reuben Eckles, a pastor with Church World Service, told NBC News at Wednesday’s gathering.

Jennifer Butler, CEO of Faith in Public Life, commented: “The Bible says that which we do to the most marginalized among us, we do to Christ himself.

But I worry that without protection for immigrant youth, my younger brother and sister will now be deportable and that our family will be torn apart. Congress must pass a clean Dream Act to protect our communities.”Since the Trump administration announced earlier this month that it would end DACA in six months, punting the issue to Congress to resolve, many religious leaders have spoken out on the urgency of protecting the nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants who could be at risk of deportation.“It’s certainly not Christian, and I would contend it’s not American,” said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York.Pope Francis drew a comparison between immigrant rights and the anti-abortion movement, saying in an interview with reporters aboard the papal plane: “A good pro-lifer understands that family is the cradle of life and that its unity must be defended.”“I believe that this law comes, I think, not from Congress but from the executive branch of the government,” the pontiff said, according to a translation by Crux. “If it is so, I have the hope that it’s re-thought, because I heard the president of the United States introduce himself as a ‘pro-life’ man.”Members of Trump’s informal evangelical advisory board said they disagreed with Trump’s decision but would be focusing their attention on petitioning Congress to devise a plan to protect Dreamers.“This has been an ongoing effort to make sure we’re being a voice for the voiceless,” said Rev.

The annual conference call, a tradition instituted by President Barack Obama to mark Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, has typically drawn leaders from across American Jewish denominations. This year, the weeks leading up to the call exposed a fracture between liberal American Jews who are critical of the president, and their more conservative counterparts who are interested in keeping a line of communication open with the White House.Leaders in the Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist movements boycotted the virtual meeting, citing the president’s initial claim that neo-Nazis and their counterprotestors were both responsible for the violence that erupted at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August. The White House reportedly ended up leaving some of the liberal Jewish organizations off the invitation list. Representatives from several Orthodox-leaning organizations were invited to participate and decided to call in ― including leaders from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Agudath Israel of America, the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, the Republican Jewish Coalition, and other groups.Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told HuffPost that he participated in the conference call around 8 a.m. Pacific time on Friday morning, and that it lasted between six to eight minutes. Unlike the Obama-era High Holy Day calls, Hier said that there was no Q & A session during Trump’s call.Hier said that overall, the president spent time giving High Holy Day greetings to the group and reaffirming a strong commitment to Israel. “He condemned anti-Semitism in the strongest terms and basically said that America is a stronger country because of its vibrant Jewish community,” Hier, who delivered a blessing at Trump’s inauguration, told HuffPost. Hier said he was told that there were Holocaust survivors on the call as well. The president reportedly thanked these survivors for telling their stories and confronting evil in the world. Nathan Diament, executive director of the public policy arm of the Orthodox Union, echoed Hier’s comments about the content of the call, saying that the president expressed admiration for the Jewish community, condemned ant-Semitism and all forms of hate, and reaffirmed support for Israel. “It was significant and meaningful for the President of the United States to speak to the Jewish community ahead of the high holidays,” Diament told HuffPost. The High Holy Days begin this year on September 20.Orthodox Jews, who make up about 10 percent of the American Jewish community, are more likely than members of other denominations to say that they approve of Trump’s performance as president. A recent survey conducted by the American Jewish Committee found that 71 percent of Orthodox respondents had favorable views of the president’s performance so far.However, members of the other three main branches of American Judaism have markedly different views ― 73 percent of Conservative, 88 percent of Reform, and 92 percent of Reconstructionist Jews surveyed viewed Trump’s performance unfavorably. Trump’s track record with the American Jewish community has been riddled with difficulties from the start of his presidency. A few days after his inauguration, he issued a statement about Holocaust Remembrance Day that failed to specifically mention Jewish victims. In August, Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative Jewish organizations jointly criticized the president for his comments on Charlottesville. The president has alternated between condemning white supremacist hate groups and claiming that “both sides” were responsible for the violence that erupted in that city. The three branches of Judaism came together to say that Trump’s “words have given succor to those who advocate anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia.” Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism told HuffPost that his organization stands by their decision to not host a High Holiday call with the president this year. “We are disappointed that the president continues to draw a false equivalency between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators in Charlottesville,” he said.On Friday, Hier defended his decision to participate in the call, saying that while he was critical of the president’s comments on Charlottesville, he felt the American Jewish leaders needed to be at the table to discuss matters that are important to the community.“My philosophy is if we want the United States of America to be a strong country and to have dialogue and freedom, we can’t eternally be mad at each other,” Hier said. “I disagreed with the president’s remarks about Charlottesville, but I’m not in favor of long-term boycotts, because when will it end?”Hier told HuffPost he was confident that the president understood the concerns American Jews have about anti-Semitic rhetoric.“The president’s family are Orthodox Jews, so he knows very well the feeling of vulnerability, how we feel about neo-Nazis and the Klan,” Hier said. “We’re human beings, we all make mistakes. In my opinion, the president misspoke [about Charlottesville].”“But if we never talk to the other side because we’re so angry at their political beliefs, then you fracture forever the United States of America,” he said.

26,POLITICS,Trump’s Election Commission Is Already Laying The Groundwork For Voter Suppression,"Rep. Terri Sewell, ContributorRep. Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) is serving her fourth term represe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-election-commission-is-already-laying-the-groundwork_us_59bc010ce4b02c642e4a15f6,They aim to make the constitutional right to vote a privilege.,2017-09-15,"<p><em>Kris Kobach, named the “King of Voter Suppression” by the ACLU, leads President Trump’s election commission.</em> </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc0f7d1900001700563f81.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, Trump’s commission on voter fraud held its first investigative hearing. Already, it’s laying the foundation for voter suppression.Almost 60 years ago to the day after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Trump’s commission met in New Hampshire to initiate the process of gradually unraveling one of our democracy’s most powerful legislative accomplishments.The “Presidential Advisory Commission on Voter Integrity” is led by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, and it consists of current and former politicians, lawyers, and bureaucrats, all of whom have a history of advocating for voter suppression. Kobach’s record may be the most troubling.Mr. Kobach is the author of a law designed to preclude Kansans from voting in state and local elections if they registered at the DMV without providing proof of citizenship. If the rule had not been blocked by a county judge in Kansas, more than 17,000 legal American votes would have been tossed out.Sham commission Vice-Chair Kobach also has a tendency to make up facts when it comes to election integrity. This past week, Kobach penned an op-ed in Breitbart attributing thousands of votes for Hillary Clinton and Maggie Hassan in the 2016 elections to voter fraud. He referenced New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration laws as the means by which these people allegedly voted illegally. Kobach’s claims were quickly debunked by experts who showed that the “voter fraud” Kobach had uncovered were likely New Hampshire college students legally using their home-state identification to vote.Contrary to the claims of Kobach and the voter fraud commission, there is no actual evidence that suggests people vote illegally in elections, at least not nearly to the degree they claim. Between 2000 and 2010, 649 million votes were cast in general elections and there have been only 13 credible instances of voter impersonation. That’s a voter fraud rate of .0000002 percent. The math speaks for itself.Voter suppression, however, is a very real threat to American democracy and its impact on our elections is proven by recent studies. Some of the most damaging voter suppression legislation in our country has come in the form of voter identification laws. Presenting photo identification may seem like a standard requirement to cast a vote, but more than 21 million Americans don’t have a government issued photo ID. Photo ID requirements would prevent roughly 11 percent of Americans from accessing the voter box.Since 2011, 34 states have implemented voter ID laws, suppressing the votes of nearly 4 million Americans. The precedent for coded voter suppression laws is relatively new, as there were no laws requiring photo ID in this country before 2006.But rather than working to ensure that all Americans have a fair opportunity to have their voices heard in our elections, Kobach and his sham voter fraud commission were hard at work this week setting a new precedent for voter suppression strategies.John Lott, the author of the book More Guns, Less Crime, was empaneled by Trump’s sham commission to weigh in on how to solve America’s non-existent voter fraud problem. Mr. Lott proposed the implementation of criminal background checks for voters in order to “make sure the right people are voting.” This unconstitutional practice would discourage people from participating in our democracy and registering. Eligible citizens should not be shamed or condemned for past crimes for which they’ve served, rather they should be applauded for reentering society with a desire to have their voices heard in the electoral process.One would think, given its name, that President Trump’s “Presidential Advisory Committee on Voter Integrity” would be put in place to mitigate the suppression of the American vote. That, however, is far from their goal. Instead, they aim to make the constitutional right to vote a privilege.I was born and raised in Selma, Alabama, and it is now with great pride that I represent the historic city as their congresswoman. I have seen all my life the way the voter suppression can hinder not only a community, but an entire nation. The formation of Trump’s sham commission on “voter integrity” is only a preliminary step toward wide-reaching voter suppression legislation. We cannot allow that to happen.I’m going to keep raising my voice, I’m counting on you to raise yours too."

When it reopened to incoming animals Wednesday, it did so with only two of its five buildings operating with running water and power.“Fortunately, what we can tell, most of the injuries, the conditions are recoverable. They’re disoriented. They’re orphaned,” she said of their patients, which include a pair of brown boobies that were found disoriented while taking shelter on a container ship pulling into the Keys from Mexico.“The more common cases that we’re getting in are the juveniles, the young squirrels, the young birds, that couldn’t sustain the wind. They were knocked out of their homes, knocked out of the trees, and so they are now orphaned,” she said. Videos posted to the SFWC’s Facebook page show various orphaned babies being bottle-fed by the staff, including two raccoons. “You can tell he’s been without mom for a very long time, probably for before the storm with how thin and dehydrated he was,” a worker said in one video that showed her feeding raccoons individually.With the staff being unable to power up their X-ray machines and perform lab diagnostics, vets are treating the animals as if they have confirmed significant injuries, out of precaution, Parsons-Drake said.In the meantime, she’s urging South Florida residents who are busy cleaning up and returning to their homes to do so with caution as there could be injured animals hiding in the fallen trees and under debris.Just how important is the safety of a bunch of injured animals? Extremely, Parsons-Drake said.“We are a science-based rehabilitation facility,” she said, which believes that “environmental health, animal health, and human health are all linked.”She pointed out that birds treated for botulism, a food poisoning, led to the discovery of tainted water supplies in the area. And she gave the example of bats, whose guano is used as fertilizer for crops, which helps the economy, and whose consumption of mosquitos benefits human health.“It’s critical to us to make sure that these animals are protected,” she said. “Every species has its impact and its significance.”Those wanting to donate to the facility, which works in partnership with The Humane Society of the United States, can do so on its website."

CIA Director Mike Pompeo called Manning an “American traitor,” and said he would withdraw from an appearance at the Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum. Former CIA Chief Michael Morell also resigned his role as a senior fellow at Harvard over the Manning invite.“You have traded a respected individual who served his country with dignity for one who served it with disgrace and who violated the warrior ethos she promised to uphold when she voluntarily chose to join the United States Army,” Pompeo wrote.Manning, 29, served seven years in prison for sharing classified information with WikiLeaks, the largest breach of such intel in U.S. history. The remainder of her 35-year sentence was commuted by former President Barack Obama in January and she was released in May.Harvard originally announced the news of Manning’s fellowship on Wednesday, touting her as the Kennedy School’s “first transgender Fellow.”Early Friday, Manning responded to the controversy on Twitter.The university offered an apology to Manning, and still plans to invite her to spend the day at the school, Elmendorf said.“I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation,” Elmendorf stated. “This decision now is not intended as a compromise between competing interest groups but as the correct way for the Kennedy School to emphasize its longstanding approach to visiting speakers while recognizing that the title of Visiting Fellow implies a certain recognition.”Others invited to be visiting fellows this year include Sean Spicer, former White House press secretary under President Donald Trump, and Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager who was arrested and charged with assaulting a journalist. But it was Manning who sparked outrage.“I have an obligation to my conscience ― and I believe to the country ― to stand up against any efforts to justify leaks of sensitive national security information,” Morell wrote in his own letter.Shortly after Morell announced his resignation, Manning fired back on Twitter with a one-word reply: “Good.”"

If my kid is sick than they should all be sick” ― although as a school teacher myself and a parent of a child with special medical needs, it sometimes feels that way.My daughter was born extremely premature at 23 weeks gestation in 2012. She is what’s called a micro-preemie. She was just one pound and four ounces at birth and not even as long as a ruler. She was not expected to live at all, yet she is now 5 years old and is doing amazingly! Although we elected to “redshirt” her and postpone kindergarten for one more year, you would never know her story and all that she was been through ― unless you see her when she has a cold.When my daughter contracts any type of respiratory virus, it almost always turns into pneumonia. She has had pneumonia more times than I can count on one hand, and many of those times caused her to be admitted to the hospital for several weeks until her body could recover.So what is BPD and why is my daughter so susceptible to respiratory viruses?A quick explanation is that her lungs are mostly scar tissue because of the breathing tube that she had down her throat for 3 of the 4 months she was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) after her extremely premature birth. The forcing of air into and out of her lungs caused them to grow under duress and most of her lungs are scarred. She has grown and will continue to grow some new lung tissue around the scar tissue until she is around 6 or 7 years old, which will help her compensate better, but the scar tissue is never replaced.She will live with weak lungs and extreme asthma-like conditions forever, which does not make her special, as many children and adults live with similar (and much worse) conditions ― but why not help the poor girl out and allow her to stay as healthy as possible if you can do it?That’s my question.I have kept her out of regular school as long as I can. We had tutors and all sorts of interventions come to our house so that she could avoid exposure yet meet all of her milestones, and she has met them all. She was not ever in library storytimes, music playgroups, Mommy and Me classes or anything of that nature, due to how easily germs are spread between babies and small children.I had to cancel parties and not show up to other parties and holiday gatherings when the guests were ill.That is my job as her mother and I’ve done it. Now that she is kindergarten age, the services will no longer come to our home and they must be administered at a school, and quite frankly, she needs to go to school and be with other kids and socialize. Her three older brothers are her world, but she needs to experience a bit more.It’s time.I understand that she will get sick once she is out and mingling with other children. She has already had pneumonia several times and she could have gotten it from anyone or anywhere as most people do. I expect that will happen more now.What I am asking parents is simple.Do not send your children into school if they are visibly sick.I cannot understand why they do.Maybe they cannot afford to take off of work?Maybe they cannot miss that meeting or deadline or flight?I actually understand all of this to some degree, but something has to give.It’s unfair to send a child to school who is sneezing and coughing like crazy or one that requires nose blowing every two minutes.It’s not just my daughter who can get sick. Little Johnny and Little Suzy can catch it just as easily ― and although they may get well more quickly ― I’m sure Johnny and Suzy’s parents don’t want them to bring germs home to the rest of their family who will then have to take off of work, or perhaps infect an infant or elderly person in the home. And don’t forget about the teacher who is very hands on with your children and loves them. Do you want to get him/her sick too?Why spread the germs?Many illnesses are contagious before symptoms are noticed. That’s different. I’m talking about children who show up to school and are visibly ill.Please keep them home.Much as a parent with a child who has a severe nut allergy would ask the other Pre-K parents to not pack snacks that could endanger the life of their child, I’m asking the same.Respiratory viruses endanger the life of my daughter.My daughter and Little Johnny with the nut allergy deserve to go to school and have other parents consider them important as well.We are not asking a lot.We would do it for your kid.Thanks for letting me vent ― now excuse me while to go back to pick up my daughter from school again (1 hour after it started!) because another student got dropped off with green boogers coming out of his nose. I’m so lucky that her teacher calls me to let me know.I wish I didn’t have to be “that mom.”For more information on high-risk pregnancy, premature births and raising a preemie- see my HuffPost Parents page by clicking HERE and visit www.micropreemie.net."
33,POLITICS,Did The Washington Post Break A Law When It Disciplined A Reporter Over A Jeff Bezos Op-Ed?,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/union-challenges-washington-post-jeff-bezos-op-ed_us_59bc19ede4b0edff971bdf01,The Post's union thinks so.,2017-09-15,"Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, right, speaks during a meeting with President Donald Trump on June 19, 2017, alongside Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, center.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc29b71a00007100f06eb5.jpeg?cache=L1MhbsRQ5u&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The union that represents Washington Post reporters has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Post for disciplining a reporter and union leader who wrote an op-ed critical of Post owner and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.The Post issued a formal warning against Metro desk staff writer and union co-chair Fredrick Kunkle on Sep. 5 for publishing the sharply worded op-ed in HuffPost. “One of the wealthiest men in the world is thinking of ways to give back,” Kunkle began the column, which appeared Sept. 1. “But he’s still taking from the very people who helped him build his fortune.” He went on to detail Bezos’ efforts to knuckle the newspaper’s union over workers’ rights and benefits.The Post stated in its disciplinary letter to Kunkle that he had engaged in an “egregious violation of the Post’s ethics policy on freelancing,” and noted that a senior manager had warned him as much a day before he did it.In response to the Post’s warning, the Washington-Baltimore News Guild, which represents the paper’s editorial staff, filed on Tuesday what is known as an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the Post of violating Kunkle’s legally protected right to engage in “concerted activities” to further the union’s interests. The National Labor Relations Act bars employers from interfering in worker activities that advance their welfare, which typically include a worker’s right to publicly criticize an employer about a work-related matter.“If you’re a Guild officer and Freddy is, he has a legal right to publicize a dispute with management,” said Rick Ehrmann, the Guild representative for the Post newsroom. “It doesn’t matter what the outlet is.”Legal experts say the union has a decent argument to make before the National Labor Relations Board. But the company’s freelancing rules mean it is not a slam dunk.As a matter of company policy, Post reporters are not permitted to write for another outlet unless a department head has approved its publication outside the company. Department heads permit outside publication only if the Post has declined to run the story and the outside outlet in question is not deemed a competitor. What’s more, the union effectively ratified this arrangement with language in the collective bargaining agreement. The union contract states that “without permission of the Post, no employee shall … use any material or featured title of The Post or exploit in any way his or her connection with it.”Kunkle, who writes the Post’s “Tripping” blog about transportation in the Washington, D.C. area, pitched the Post’s opinion section at the end of August on an op-ed challenging Bezos’ rollback of employee retirement benefits and planned overhaul of the company’s severance policy, according to his account of events. When the newspaper rejected it, in his telling, Kunkle decided to publish it at HuffPost, informing Washington Post Editor-in-Chief Marty Baron of his plans. (In the interest of full disclosure, I am a member of the labor-management committee at HuffPost, which is represented by the Writer’s Guild of America, East.) Tracy Grant, the Post’s deputy managing editor, met with Kunkle at length on Aug. 31 and told him that publishing the op-ed would violate company policy and be grounds for disciplinary action. Kunkle decided to proceed any way.“I had not really dug into it further, but I did feel it was protected speech under the [National Labor Relations Act],” he said. “I didn’t do it lightly but I just really believe in a person’s right to speak out. That’s one of the beautiful things about this country.” For the submission, HuffPost offered him a $300 fee, which he has yet to receive. In an interview, though, Kunkle said he would have published the column free of charge.Kunkle’s op-ed addressed specific grievances the Washington-Baltimore News Guild has with Bezos’ management, while making a larger point about the way contemporary billionaires use charity to mask the effects of their labor practices. Kunkle took Bezos to task for freezing employees’ pension plan two years ago. He went on to decry Bezos’ current plans to end the prioritization of seniority in layoffs, reduce employee severance pay and make severance dependent on signing away the right to sue. Bezos is guilty of “petty theft from the people who work for him,” Kunkle concluded the column. “He owes them better.”Four days later, Grant sent Kunkle a memorandum issuing a “written warning for [his] willful and intentional violation of The Washington Post’s standards and ethics policy by freelancing for a competing publication without permission.”“Any similar or repeated infractions will result in increased disciplinary action, up to and including the termination of your employment,” Grant ended the letter.Kunkle and the Washington-Baltimore News Guild argue that a union leader using an opinion column to call out management in a labor dispute is simply not subject to the freelancing clause because of its protected legal status.“Had I decided to write something on hunting and the Post said, ‘No, we don’t have a place for it,’ I’m not going to take it to the New York Times,” said Kunkle, who is an avid hunter. “It’s not like I have a right to take it to a competitor.”The amorphous nature of what constitutes a media competitor allows the newspaper to effectively intrude on protected labor rights, Kunkle added.Given the Post’s entry into myriad non-traditional media, including podcasts, “almost everything is our competitor today,” he said.The Post declined to comment on the unfair labor practice complaint.The Guild is “probably” right that the op-ed is protected speech, according to Charlotte Garden, a labor law professor at Seattle University School of Law.“As a union leader, Kunkle was at least implicitly speaking for other employees about a workplace dispute,” Garden said. “Employees can lose [National Labor Relations Act] protection under certain circumstances ― notably when their criticism of their employer rises to the level of ‘disloyalty,’” which is true only in very specific cases regarding criticism of company products, Garden said.The wrinkle for Kunkle, Garden said, is that the company has grounds to argue that the union waived his right to engage in this type of concerted activity by agreeing to the freelance clause. The Guild would have to demonstrate to the NLRB that there is a history of interpreting the Post’s freelance clause to exclude protected concerted activity, according to Garden.Michael Duff, a labor law professor at the University of Wyoming College of Law, argued that while he considers the op-ed “concerted activity,” the matter is “not free from doubt,” and the Post has room to argue that he was writing in an individual capacity, not on behalf of the unionized workers. The fact that Kunkle is receiving payment for the op-ed from HuffPost undermines his case that it was legally protected concerted activity rather than a freelance piece that merely violated company rules, Duff said.Duff nonetheless believes the company policy “probably” violated labor law to begin with because the rule is “sufficiently vague to chill all kinds of concerted employee speech touching on terms and conditions of employment.” If the NLRB found that the rule had such a chilling effect, the company would have to prove that there is an overriding business justification for the provision, he said.For Kunkle, the Guild and future employees concerned about their right to publicly challenge their employers, a lot depends on what happens next.Staff at the regional NLRB office for the Washington, D.C., area will assess whether the office wants to pursue the charge and recommend a hearing before one of the agency’s administrative law judges. If the judge finds merit in the charge, the judge can recommend it to the board.Ordinary cases are heard by a three-person panel of the board. Cases with broader implications are decided by the full board, which includes five people when fully seated. President Donald Trump has filled one of the board’s open seats; as it stands the board has two Democratic-appointed members and two Republican appointees. By the time Kunkle’s charge reached the board, Trump likely would have appointed the last board member, giving Republican appointees a 3-2 majority on the board.If a majority-Republican board hears the charge, it will likely rule in favor of the Post, according to Duff, who was previously a field attorney for the NLRB. In any event, the losing party can then appeal the NLRB decision to the regional circuit court and then to the United States Supreme Court, if it so chooses. In the meantime, the Post’s warning is a source of anxiety for Kunkle, who worries that management could use it as part of a future case to oust him from the company based on his performance. When Kunkle wrote the op-ed, he had no intention of making himself the center of the story, he said.“I did not want any of this sideshow about it,” he said. “I just wanted to get this argument into the world.” He added the Post’s decision to send him the warning letter buttressed the argument in his op-ed that Bezos is part of a financial elite whose companies are sapping workers of their power and share of the wealth they help generate.He told Grant as much in an email about the disciplinary measure: “I said, ‘In a way it helps prove the point.’”"
34,THE WORLDPOST,Why We Need A National Hurricane Memorial And Museum,"Scott Knowles, ContributorProfessor of history, Drexel University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-irma-disaster-memorial_us_59badc76e4b02da0e1405aa9,"Right now, we lack a focused way to remember and learn from our mistakes.",2017-09-15,Hurricane Irma churns through the Caribbean on Sept. 5.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59badcc31c0000240079e807.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"As of today the death toll from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma stands at 151 and is likely to rise. Estimates are still murky, but experts predict combined totals in property losses might run up to $200 billion, though that is a conservative guess. Harvey, Irma, Sandy, Irene, Ike, Katrina, Wilma, Ivan, Charley and Andrew — we know their names. They are the 10 costliest hurricanes in American history. The combined death toll of this wrecking crew stands at around 2,000 people — and the costs come to almost $500 billion. These totals cannot even begin to calculate the psychological and political impact that Atlantic hurricanes have exerted on American life over the past 30 years. But we do not have a focused place where the world can gather to mourn and to learn from these disasters. That should change with the creation of a National Hurricane Memorial and Museum.There are local memorials and museums to many of these storms. The Katrina Memorial on Canal Street in New Orleans is one example — 3 years after Katrina an elegant grouping of six mausoleums was raised to contain the unidentified remains of more than 80 victims of the disaster. Another example, just below the London Avenue Canal, is the Levee Exhibit Hall and Garden. Standing on the foundation of a home destroyed by Katrina’s floodwaters, this memorial serves as a solemn educational outpost, raising hard questions about the history of the levee system on the lower Mississippi River. And in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, there’s a museum downtown and a stunning memorial cemetery plot for the unidentified victims of the 1889 flood. Ten miles upriver the National Park Service maintains a park and learning center at the site where the dam broke, unleashing a wall of water that killed over 2,200 people in the towns below. Just like the hundreds of local September 11 memorials scattered across the nation, hurricanes and floods have inspired sites of reflection in local communities, reflecting their personal stories and concerns.As a nation we excel in memorializing war and terrorism. There are scores of national military parks, battlefields and cemeteries around the country, plus the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum and three September 11 memorials and museums. Usually these are taxpayer-funded sites, with significant contributions from private foundations and corporations. In memorializing these events and tragedies, Americans participate in an age-old process, marking the names of the fallen and connecting their sacrifices across time to broader commitments: nation, ideology, military service. These memorials — even if they mark distant events — still evoke empathy, and they generally house archives and artifacts that provide rich educational sources for visitors and scholars.Hurricanes are different from wars. But who can deny the suffering of victims or the increasingly urgent and dangerous calls for service from first responders? The United States Coast Guard helped direct more than 4,500 rescue missions in Hurricane Harvey alone, for example. It’s time to finally drop the “natural” term when we talk about disasters. The levee system of New Orleans, the dam above Johnstown, the drainage system of Houston, the shoreline development of Florida — these are not “natural.” They are the products of intense American industrialization and a long period of land development in inherently hazardous terrains. Since World War II, Americans have flocked to the coasts in staggering numbers. In doing so, they have helped build the economies of coastal states, and they have also ballooned the size of formerly modest cities like Miami and Houston. They have also placed themselves at risk, often in ways that reflect underlying social stratifications by race and by class. The poor, the politically disenfranchised, the elderly and sick — they pay a much higher price for disaster than anyone else, and their names are heavily reflected in the rolls of the victims.No, “nature” hasn’t gotten angrier. It’s just that “natural” no longer even makes sense as a concept for disasters. Holding on to “natural” is a convenient way to place disasters outside of our choices, our politics — it’s a myth at best and a lie at worst, intended to protect developers and real estate values.This unmasking of the “natural disaster” means that we also need a coherent, national commitment to remembering storm deaths, injuries and sacrifices. Right now, we lack a focused way to remember and learn from our mistakes. Other nations have shown the way forward, breaking out of the mold of a soldiers and battles-focused approach to memorials.Take, for example, the Holocaust memorials and museums of Europe or the Hiroshima and Nagasaki memorials and museums in Japan. These sites focus on the victims of war: the human struggle for survival and the lessons to be learned from imperialism, fascism and mass violence. Similarly, Japan today is working towards building national memorials in the three prefectures affected by the earthquake, tsunami and radiation disasters of March, 2011. Here again, the attempt is to mark the deaths of those who should not have died, to lift their loss to a matter of national consequence and to offer spaces for mourning and for learning to avoid future such disasters.This is exactly the approach we should take with a National Hurricane Memorial and Museum. The long-planned National Hurricane Museum and Science Center in Lake Charles, Louisiana was scrapped only in June of this year, unable to raise the funds necessary to move forward. New Orleans seems like the ideal place for such a memorial and museum, perhaps with smaller, affiliated sites across the coastal south and northeast. Names of victims should be inscribed and a museum should be raised — a space to collect the archival materials related to these disasters and to hold public discussions on our national agenda for reducing the unnecessary suffering of weather disasters more generally. Furthermore, such a museum would be the ideal place to foster a national dialogue on the connection between individual hurricanes and the slow disaster of climate change that is increasing their violence and frequency. It could be that a generation from now we would rename it the National Climate Change and Hurricane Memorial and Museum.For now, it’s enough to make a statement of national unity: we respect the dead, we learn from their deaths to reduce suffering for the living and we commit to disaster reduction for future generations."

The levee system of New Orleans, the dam above Johnstown, the drainage system of Houston, the shoreline development of Florida — these are not “natural.” They are the products of intense American industrialization and a long period of land development in inherently hazardous terrains.

37,GREEN,Team Trump's Plan For America's National Monuments: Shrink Size And Expand Hunting,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zinke-order-public-lands_us_59bbfce7e4b0edff971baa15,An order by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke aims to increase fishing access on national monuments and other public lands.,2017-09-15,"U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke waits to take the stage with President Trump for a speech on infrastructure in Washington, D.C., in June.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bc27db1c00003a0079eaf6.jpeg?cache=7DuuHnaeIf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON —Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signed an order Friday to greatly expand hunting, fishing and target shooting at America’s protected national monuments and on other public lands.The move appears at least partially aimed at appeasing hunting and fishing groups that have grown frustrated with the former Montana congressman as he has prioritized energy development over conservation. It also comes as the public awaits details about which national monuments Zinke has sent to President Donald Trump’s chopping block — and by how much the administration will try to shrink each site. Along with increasing public access for such activities, Friday’s order aims to “improve wildlife management and conservation” and put “a greater emphasis on recruiting and retaining news sportsmen conservationists,” including children, veterans and minorities, according to the Interior Department. It directs the agency’s bureaus to come up with a plan to open up access on land they manage and “amend national monument management plans to ensure the public’s right to hunt, fish and target shoot.”Zinke said in a statement that his order is “the latest example of how the Trump Administration is actively moving to support hunting and other forms of outdoor recreation on public lands.” “Hunting and fishing is a cornerstone of the American tradition and hunters and fishers of America are the backbone of land and wildlife conservation,” he said. “The more people we can get outdoors, the better things will be for our public lands.”Among those who applauded Friday’s announcement was Collin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation. “Restoring wildlife habitat and expanding opportunities for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreation will help increase wildlife populations and connect millions of Americans with our nation’s natural treasures,” O’Mara said in a statement accompanying the agency’s release. “Secretary Zinke’s order demonstrates his commitment to collaborate closely with conservation organizations and state agencies to achieve these critical conservation outcomes.”O’Mara’s comments are starkly different than two months ago, when he told HuffPost that conservation had taken a clear back seat and that Zinke and the administration were “re-litigating the past instead of talking about the future — on everything.”“I think the jury is still out,” O’Mara said in July. “I think that we have someone that shares values with sportsmen and is a sportsman himself, but now we need action. Talk’s not enough.” Land Tawney, president and chief executive of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a Montana-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting public lands and preserving opportunities for hunting and fishing, said Friday that he supports the intent of Zinke’s order and looks forward to seeing how it is implemented. Tawney was also among those who expressed disappointment with Zinke back in July, saying, “we keep on waiting for the Theodore Roosevelt Zinke to show up.”Zinke has described himself as an “unapologetic admirer and disciple” of President Theodore Roosevelt. In his order Friday, Zinke wrote that the decision follows “in the footsteps of President Roosevelt’s commitment to conservation stewardship.” Also voicing support for Zinke’s decision Friday were the National Rifle Association, Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), whom Zinke threatened after she voted against a measure to begin debate on a Republican-backed bill to repeal Obamacare. “For too long, sportsmen’s access to our federal lands has been restricted, with lost opportunity replacing the ability to enjoy many of our best outdoor spaces,” Murkowski said in a statement, adding the order “will go a long way to reversing that trend and help grow the next generation of hunters, fishermen, and recreational shooters.” But the Center for American Progress and The Wilderness Society — pro-conservation groups that have been vocal opponents of the Trump administration’s monuments review — were quick to dismiss the order as a “red herring” that accomplishes very little, noting that national monuments managed by the Bureau of Land Management are already open to hunting and recreational fishing.“This is a do-nothing secretarial order: the public already has the right to hunt and fish on America’s public lands and it is the states – not the feds – that have primary authority to regulate hunting and fishing in these areas,” Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in an emailed statement.Zinke’s latest order comes approximately three weeks after he submitted to the White House a report recommending that Trump weaken protections for a number of national monuments, although details about the proposed changes have not yet been made public. In April, Trump sparked outrage when he signed a pair of executive orders threatening 27 national monuments — most famously, the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument in southern Utah. The New York Times reported at least four monuments are on the chopping block. Sixteen presidents have used the Antiquities Act to designate 157 monuments. Since announcing its review, the Trump administration has repeatedly said that recent administrations have abused the law, signed by Roosevelt in 1906, to lock up millions of acres. But it has offered little to support its claim. “Secretary Zinke is trying desperately to create a distraction from his proposal to dramatically reduce the size of America’s national monuments, which would be the largest elimination of protections for wildlife habitat in U.S. history,” Lee-Ashley said. Friday’s order extends a secretarial order Zinke signed his first day on the job to increase outdoor recreation opportunities, including hunting and fishing, on federal land."

40,POLITICS,Trump Again Proves His Claim About Waiting For 'Facts' After Charlottesville Was Garbage,Paige Lavender,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-london-attack-response_us_59bbf331e4b02da0e141705e,"He's quickly issued strong statements on other violent incidents, but didn't want to make a ""quick statement"" on Charlottesville.",2017-09-15,"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about the bombing in London as he attends a photo opportunity in the Rose Garden of the White House on Sept. 15, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bbf66b1c00003a0079ea56.jpeg?cache=539MYgtfh3&ops=crop_0_36_3500_2047%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. President Donald Trump explained his botched response to a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month by saying he needed “the facts” before broadly denouncing violence from racist groups.But Trump has repeatedly shown he’s not interested in waiting for the facts when it comes to other acts of terror.Just hours after a bomb exploded in a West London Tube station on Friday ― with no information publicly available about potential suspects in the attack ― Trump attributed the violence to “loser terrorists” and “sick and demented people.” He also said his travel ban, which affects people from six Muslim-majority countries, “should be far larger, tougher and more specific.”A police spokesperson told CNN that Trump’s comments about Scotland Yard were “pure speculation” and “unhelpful.” U.K. officials widely criticized Trump’s comments.“I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday.London Mayor Sadiq Khan, whom Trump had harshly criticized in June after a different attack, said he was “not going to go there.”Less than a week after the Charlottesville protests on Aug. 12, Trump also issued an explosive statement against “Radical Islamic Terror” in the wake of an Aug. 17 attack in Barcelona, Spain, telling people to “study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught.”That story ― which has no basis in fact ― is one Trump told on the campaign trail, when he spoke of Pershing executing Muslim insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900s with bullets dipped in pig’s blood.As The Washington Post points out, he was quick to call the Barcelona attack, during which a van plowed into a crowd of people, “terror.”But after the violence in Charlottesville, where an alleged white supremacist had plowed a car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters, killing one woman, Trump had blamed “both sides,” and said, “You can call it terrorism, you can call it murder, you can call it whatever you want.”Trump received a wave of bipartisan criticism after his initial comments, and he made several attempts to walk them back, explicitly condemning white supremacists two days later.But he has continued to undermine that statement ever since. At a rally on Aug. 22, he spent more than 10 minutes rereading his comments on Charlottesville, defending statues of Confederate leaders and attacking the media, which he accused “of trying to take away the history and our heritage.”On Thursday, Trump signed a resolution condemning white supremacy, but also reiterated his initial comments on the Charlottesville protests, arguing that “a lot of people” have said he was right to condemn “both sides.”“You look at really what’s happened since Charlottesville, a lot of people are saying, and people have actually written, ‘Gee, Trump might have a point,’” Trump said, while reflecting on his discussion with Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) about “the brutal history surrounding the white supremacist movement and their horrific treatment of black and other minority groups,” according to the senator’s office.“I said, ‘You’ve got some very bad people on the other side also,’ which is true,” Trump added.Trump hardly showed restraint prior to Charlottesville. It took him less than a day to respond to terrorist attacks in Paris and in Manchester, England. He also used a prior attack in London to plug his travel ban.He has also said he can “predict” terrorism, saying he “can feel it.” After a gunman who claimed allegiance to the self-described Islamic State attacked a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016, killing 49 and wounding scores more, Trump bragged about “being right on radical Islamic terrorism.”Based on his actions, it appears Trump’s claim that he doesn’t “want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement” only applies to white supremacists.

More than likely, they’re also among the core backers who helped propel him to victory over his more mainstream Republican rivals.Trump recently announced he was rescinding DACA but has since given conflicting statements ― some in favor ― on congressional efforts to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, a group sometimes known as Dreamers.Such an effort is broadly popular. Nearly three-quarters of Americans consider the U.S. “a nation of immigrants,” and most believe immigration is a good thing for the country. A 58 percent majority favor allowing undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay in the country, with a similar percentage favoring a broader pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Trump voters aren’t as positive: By a 15-point margin, 54 percent to 39 percent, they oppose allowing Dreamers to stay. But that’s far below the near-universal support they often show for Trump’s decisions. (Republicans, meanwhile, support DACA by a narrow 4-point margin.)Trump voters who oppose the program feel much more strongly than those who support it, however. Three in 10 strongly oppose DACA, with just 11 percent strongly supporting it.While there are relatively few differences between the Trump voters who do and don’t back DACA in age, education or income, there’s a difference in how they feel about the president. Trump voters who currently “strongly approve” of the president’s job performance oppose DACA by a 33-point margin. Those who only “somewhat approve” of the president, by contrast, are 7 points likelier to support the program than they are to oppose it.Trump’s most fervent supporters take a dim views of immigration overall. They’re split on whether immigration is a good or bad thing for the country. Thirty-nine percent say that immigration into the U.S. has a negative effect on them personally, compared with just 21 percent of Trump voters who approve only somewhat of his job performance and just 15 percent of all Americans.As other surveys suggest, there’s another thing that group likely has in common: Many are probably among the core group of supporters who helped him become the Republicans’ nominee in 2016.Hard-line views on immigration were among the touchstones differentiating Trump’s primary supporters from the Republicans who fell in line only after he became the party’s official standard-bearer. The president’s initial backers, researchers found, were considerably more likely than other Republicans to consider immigration a very important issue and to hold hostile attitudes toward immigrants. Just a fifth of Republicans who supported Trump in the 2016 primary support amnesty for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, polling shows, compared with 37 percent of those who voted for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and nearly half of those who backed Ohio Gov. John Kasich. It remains to be seen exactly how Trump’s latest statements in support of a congressional effort to protect Dreamers will shift opinions, both among his most hardcore and nativist supporters, and among those with less inflexible or well-defined views.“For what it’s worth, I’ve seen/done enough polling that suggests most Republicans are A-OK [with] DACA [especially] if they’re told Trump backs it,” Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson noted Thursday on Twitter. Neil Newhouse, a pollster for the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies, also shared polling that he said indicated Trump’s base would follow him if he decided to extend DACA.In a recent paper, two Brigham Young University political scientists found that citing liberal statements by Trump on topics including immigration was enough to significantly shift Republicans’ opinions in that direction, although the effect was least pronounced among the most politically knowledgeable respondents.“Trump brings out a high degree of party loyalism among Republicans. They are quite moved by his position, regardless of the content,” Jeremy Pope, one of the authors, told HuffPost in an email. “While I would not say that everyone will be moved by his positions, I think a very significant fraction of Republicans will be quite responsive to whatever position Trump takes, giving him a great deal of freedom to adjust his position on any number of issues, immigration included.”One recent survey, however, found less evidence of Trump’s words having an impact. A YouGov survey taken earlier this month found that 47 percent of Republicans supported DACA after reading a moderately positive statement from Trump, virtually the same as the 46 percent who didn’t read any such message. Among another group who saw a negative statement from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, 39 percent approved.“Trump’s own partisans are divided down the middle, and it doesn’t make much difference what you tell them,” YouGov’s Doug Rivers concluded after looking at the results.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 12-14 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bae2611a00002400f06bb6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A leader of the German far-right, anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is under fire this week over accusations that she illegally employed a Syrian refugee.The German newspaper Die Zeit reported on Wednesday that Alternative for Germany’s Alice Weidel, one of the party’s two top candidates in the country’s election this month, gave cash payments to a Syrian woman to do housework at Weidel’s home in Switzerland.Weidel, who lives with her Swiss partner Sarah Brossard and two sons in Biel, Switzerland, allegedly paid the Syrian woman the equivalent of just under $26 an hour but had no formal contract for the arrangement. The wage is around standard in Switzerland, according to Die Zeit.Weidel has denied the report, tweeting that it is “fake news,” but the story has gained traction in the German media. Weidel’s lawyer issued a statement to Die Zeit after publication of the article, saying that the Alternative for Germany leader has friendly relations with an asylum seeker who was a guest at her house, but that the person was not employed there.The Die Zeit report also comes amid another scandal involving a racist email allegedly from Weidel, which claims Germany is being “overrun by culturally alien peoples such as Arabs, Sinti and Roma.”The email calls the ruling government “pigs” who are puppets of the governments that won World War II. Weidel’s lawyer denied that she wrote the leaked letter, which German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported was sent to one of her associates in 2013.Alternative for Germany, also known as the AfD, has extremely strict views on immigration ― often using xenophobic and Islamophobic rhetoric surrounding the Syrian refugee crisis as a means of stirring up support for the party. Weidel has said that Germany’s immigration policy would destroy the country and called for a parliamentary investigation into Merkel’s move to take in asylum seekers during the refugee crisis.The AfD’s other top candidate, 76-year-old Alexander Gauland, also drew outrage on Thursday when he said in a speech to supporters that Germany had the right to be proud of “the achievements” of its soldiers in both world wars.Party officials have also previously faced criticism for downplaying Nazi crimes and objecting to Germany’s continued atonement for its past atrocities. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel earlier this week compared AfD party members to Nazis, an insult very seldom used in German politics.But despite criticism, the AfD has carved out a significant portion of support from the German electorate since its founding in 2013. Opinion polls released on Thursday show that the AfD is currently on track to become Germany’s third largest party following the country’s election on Sept. 24. The AfD will be far behind Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, however, in an election that is essentially a lock to give Merkel a fourth term."

The good public servants at EPA stand up every day for the health of our families, clean air and water, and our climate. The least I could do was to stand with them, and call on Congress and the White House to save the US EPA! The press conference also included Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, National Wildlife Federation CEO Collin O’Mara, and leaders of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents EPA staff. I want to share the message I delivered at the press conference with all of you - here are my remarks:In my role as director of the Beyond Coal campaign of Sierra Club, I work with with families all across the nation who’ve been directly affected by coal pollution - from parents of kids with asthma to entire neighborhoods with contaminated drinking water. All of those families look to the Environmental Protection Agency as their best defense - to let them know if the air and water are safe, and if it’s not, to ensure it gets cleaned up. Yet now, because of budget cuts and political interference from the White House, all of that is at risk. As our country deals with the direct negative effects of the climate crisis through hurricanes Harvey and Irma, we cannot afford to cut back on a vital agency that has the power to help protect some of our most vulnerable communities and help them get the just, equitable recovery they deserve. We cannot turn our backs on those whose lives, jobs, and communities depend on the clean air, clean water, and public lands that we all have a right to. These deadly storms are especially devastating because they are hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest, hurting low-income communities and communities of color, and making more dangerous the toxic air and water many of these neighborhoods and workers face every day.These hardest-hit communities live in a toxic zone that has been built out by chemical companies and the fossil fuel industry, from Corpus Christi to New Orleans. Texas has the nation's largest concentration of refineries. Already, the toxic chemical and fossil fuel infrastructure throughout the Gulf Coast are making families, first responders, and workers sick, with refineries and rigs causing untold and unmitigated damage to nearby neighborhoods, to those who work them, and to those who have lived among them for decades. Hurricane Harvey exposed these flooded communities to new risks as its winds & waters threaten toxic sites and Superfund sites in its path. All of these communities watched with bated breath, hoping and praying that these facilities didn’t explode, leak, malfunction, or contaminate flood waters already polluted with sewage and waste. And they’ve been counting on EPA to keep their communities safe.Unfortunately, that vital protection is now at risk. Under Trump’s budget, the EPA is slated for a funding reduction of 31 percent and a workforce reduction of 25 percent, including eliminating the Office of Environmental Justice, the Office of Public Engagement and all 14 climate partnership programs. While Congress has restored some of that funding, the EPA still faces debilitating cuts.And it’s not just budget cuts that threaten EPA’s ability to do its job. The agency can also be hollowed out by political appointees who make life miserable for people working there and then fail to replace them when they leave.We’re hearing of EPA staff reporting working conditions that are truly jaw dropping. They’re being told not to bring enforcement actions against polluters, to rewrite and gut strong public health safeguards, to refuse to provide documents to the public, and to not create written records of what’s happening inside the agency.Between the budget cuts and this political interference, the EPA simply will not be able to fulfill its mission -- which means every American family, including yours and mine, will be at greater risk of breathing polluted air or drinking contaminated water.The hardworking staff at the EPA work tirelessly every single day to make sure that we can hold corporate polluters accountable for trying to cut corners that leave us with dirty air, dirty water, destroyed lands, and communities underwater. Their work is essential to keep all communities safe and healthy, protected from deadly and dangerous pollution. When we need to know whether rising waters are contaminated and dangerous, we need the EPA. When factories or power plants release spills into our waterways, we need the EPA. When chemical plants catch fire in the wake of storms, we need the EPA. When kids in a neighborhood start coming down with high rates of asthma, or cancer -- and it could be any of us, your child or mine -- we need the EPA. There’s a real danger that the next time we face recovery from a big storm, or some other pollution disaster, the EPA won’t be there when we need them, because the agency will have been reduced to a skeleton crew.We count on the EPA for the health and safety of our families, and the Sierra Club will do everything in our power to ensure the agency can do its job without political interference. We call on Congress and the White House to fully fund and staff the agency. In the wake of these catastrophic storms, we need the EPA now more than ever. Congress and the White House, the American people have a message for you -- let the EPA do its job."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bac8191900002500563c82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember the golden age of the gay male athlete? Me neither. Don’t look now, but it’s been four years, and the revolution never actually came.It is beyond debate that nearly every professional athlete has at least one gay teammate. Gallup reported that last year, 4.1 percent of the American public identified as LGBT, or approximately 10 million people. That averages out to 2.2 players on every 53-man NFL roster; 0.5 players on 13-man NBA rosters; and one on every 25-man MLB roster.In 2013, it seemed that sports was primed for major change on LGBTQ issues. NBA veteran Jason Collins came out, as did Major League Soccer’s Robbie Rogers, and University of Missouri defensive end Michael Sam, prior to being drafted by the St. Louis Rams. Surely, more pioneers were about to emerge. But none did.“It felt like, oh, here we go,” said Cyd Zeigler of the website Outsports. “And then …”Zeigler and I were kicking around possible reasons. He is probably the foremost writer on the issue, and I spent much of the past decade in pro sports locker rooms. I frequently observed, and sometimes wrote about, what I saw as deeply embedded homophobia; it was evident in how guys tossed around the word “fag,” and in the conversations I had with Christian athletes who said they did not agree with the gay “lifestyle.” When I mentioned all this, Zeigler pushed back hard.“The media is a problem and this interview is an example of that,” he said. “Most of your questions are about how hard and bad it is. They’re negative.”He makes a point, and we’ll circle back to it. But in interviews with Zeigler and other prominent figures in the LGBTQ sports community, it was clear that everyone’s first answer to the big question ― Why hasn’t significant change happened in men’s sports? ― was that no one quite knew, but all were surprised by the lack of progress over the past four years.Some speculated that the conservative blowback after Sam kissed his boyfriend live on ESPN, and the fact that he never officially made it onto an NFL team’s roster, might have served as accidental deterrents. The divisive political climate in the Trump era hasn’t helped. A casually homophobic locker room culture persists, sowing fear among gay athletes about how teammates would handle their sexuality. And the strong presence of a certain strain of Christianity, especially in baseball, complicates any gains.“It’s easy to generalize and say, ‘Oh look at how great it is to be gay in 2017,’” said Billy Bean, Major League Baseball’s vice president for social responsibility and inclusion, and a former player who did not come out publicly until after retiring.“But I think that we are in a very, very volatile time,” Bean continued, “and maybe last year, you had five players who were much closer [to coming out] than they are this year, because the way the world and our country seems to be divisive toward a whole multitude of things.” Rogers, who plays for the Los Angeles Galaxy, is currently the only openly gay male athlete on a major U.S. professional sports team. Women’s sports are a different scene: As Rogers pointed out, women’s soccer has several stars who are out. “You have Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe, and all the women are doing really well,” he said.The WNBA also has prominent LGBTQ players. Earlier this year, star Sue Bird came out and announced she was dating Rapinoe. Men’s sports ― defined as they are by an old-school macho culture ― lag behind; can you imagine an NFL quarterback announcing that he’s dating an NBA point guard?Rogers came out after many years of wondering if it would leave him excluded from locker room culture, which so often involves anti-gay slurs and graphic sexual chatter about women. But it turned out that his experience was far more positive than he expected, and that teammates quickly stopped using casually homophobic language. “I just remember how scary it was for me when I was closeted, and what the locker room was like before that, and the things you hear,” he said. “It slowly chips away and scars people. You’re just fearful. Very afraid. I’ve heard for all my career homophobic things, but when I came out, it just totally stopped.”Rogers has since heard occasional taunts from fans, and engaged in a few difficult conversations with opposing players about their religious objections to homosexuality. But his teammates have supported him. So why haven’t others followed?“I’m surprised,” Rogers said. “I felt like with Michael and Jason and myself … I was predicting that maybe every year someone would come out. But in men’s sports, it’s just me right now.” One deterrent, he said, is an outdated view of manhood, and the fear of not fitting in.“From a very young age, we’re raised to be part of this team, and part of this atmosphere, and to be good teammates,” Rogers said. “At least in boys’ sports, it’s like a little club. I didn’t want to be on a team and be an outsider. I didn’t want guys walking on eggshells around me, or whispering. I tried so hard to just fit in.”“There is still that stereotype of what is a male professional athlete,” he added. “And at the moment ― although it’s changing ― gay is not part of that stereotype, obviously.”Bean adds that jobs in pro sports are difficult to earn, and an athlete’s physical prime is brief. It is stressful enough to try to hold onto a roster spot without becoming a pioneer or spokesman.“By the time a player gets to that level, there are so many things at stake,” Bean said. “When you see you’re one season away from getting a four-year contract, or even getting the chance to play every day … I know what’s in the mind of a player who is just not ready to put it all out there, and isn’t ready to not only become a role model for millions of people, but also put his personal life out there for the consumption of a lot of people who really don’t have any interest in taking care of that person.”In other words, it’s easy for a pundit or advocate to tell an athlete to speak out, and risky for the athlete to actually do it. He is busy watching video of his performances, traveling, answering to the media, working his way out of slumps, trying to please his coaches and hang on to his job.But despite all this, Zeigler notes the many stories he has published on Outsports that followed the same basic arc: An amateur athlete is terrified to come out, takes the plunge, and is amazed by the love and support that flows from teammates.In order for this to happen more frequently at the pro level, Zeigler said, gay men have to realize that many of their worries are based more in fear than reality. This year alone, five college football players ― including two in Division I ― are out, and none have reported problems.“There are two ways to accelerate this,” Zeigler said. “One, people have to stop using [homophobic] language, and they have to stop talking about sex with women all the time in the locker room. Those are two easy things that affect every gay athlete. Just check their language, be more professional. One of your teammates is gay, period, and how do you think that makes them feel? And then gay people just have to come out. That’s their role in this. Just come out and be out.”Zeigler and I went back and forth on this for a bit. I wanted to buy into his optimistic message, but couldn’t help but think of my years in locker rooms observing casual homophobia and right-wing religious views. “Most of us are still Neanderthals,” one New York Mets player said to me in 2011.The bigots are not exactly hiding. In 2012, the Los Angeles Times quoted the since-retired outfielder Torii Hunter saying that if he had an openly gay teammate, he would be “uncomfortable because in all my teachings and all my learning, biblically, it’s not right.” Two years later, he recorded a radio ad for Arkansas Republican gubernatorial candidate Asa Hutchinson, complimenting Hutchinson for wanting to keep marriage “between one man and one woman.”Another prominent former baseball star, Lance Berkman, has taken bigotry in the name of religion even further, campaigning against an equal rights ordinance in Texas that would have prohibited discrimination based on gender, race, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity. Discussing the issue of transgender people’s access to the bathroom of their choice, Berkman said that because he was the father of four daughters, he did not want “troubled men to enter women’s bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.”On another occasion, Berkman said, “You get called a bigot and intolerant and all that stuff … To me, tolerance is the virtue that’s killing this country. We’re tolerant of everything.”This year, the St. Louis Cardinals invited Berkman to speak at their “Christian Day” event.Hunter, meanwhile, has long been a darling of the media. A few years ago, several members of the Baseball Writers Association of America’s New York chapter pushed for him to receive the organization’s annual “Good Guy Award.” Other members raised concerns about Hunter’s anti-gay comments, and he did not ultimately receive the award. But his very nomination shows the lack of seriousness with which many in sports regard homophobia. One can imagine how gay players feel about Berkman and Hunter not only holding these views, but remaining well-liked and accepted by people who hold power and influence in the industry. It’s hardly an incentive to reveal sensitive personal information. But Zeigler believes that I interpret the climate too negatively, and that a great deal of homophobia fades when being gay is less abstract, and humanized by an actual friend or teammate. By writing about the environment for gay athletes as hostile, rather than describing it as more complex, I and other journalists could even be reinforcing the fears of gay athletes and preventing them from coming out.Point taken. And to be fair, Rogers’ experience in MLS does largely support Zeigler’s view. Bean, who played from 1987 to 1995, also notes progress in sports culture.“We’re moving this conversation in a way that is different from the 1980s and ’90s, trust me,” Bean said. “The way that we used to talk, or the talk that was allowed. The way we talked about women. All that stuff is changing, and we’re giving each other a really solid place that will allow for these kind of decisions to happen more freely.”But big social change does not happen without interruption, or complication. Rogers certainly did not expect to be the lone openly gay man in American pro sports by 2017.As he puts it, “I think people feel more empowered to be racist, to be homophobic, to be sexist at the moment. But I know [more athletes will come out]. I just don’t know when, because it’s been a while.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified Asa Hutchinson as a gubernatorial candidate in Texas, rather than Arkansas."
50,QUEER VOICES,What Happened To The Golden Age Of The Male LGBTQ Athlete?,"Andy Martino, On Assignment For HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/male-lgbtq-athletes_us_59baba13e4b086432b052cfe,And what did I do to make it worse?,2017-09-14,"Billy Bean, Major League Baseball’s vice president for social responsibility and inclusion, speaks at the 7th Annual PFLAG National Straight For Equality Awards Gala on March 30, 2015 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bacc521a00007100f06b60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember the golden age of the gay male athlete? Me neither. Don’t look now, but it’s been four years, and the revolution never actually came.It is beyond debate that nearly every professional athlete has at least one gay teammate. Gallup reported that last year, 4.1 percent of the American public identified as LGBT, or approximately 10 million people. That averages out to 2.2 players on every 53-man NFL roster; 0.5 players on 13-man NBA rosters; and one on every 25-man MLB roster.In 2013, it seemed that sports was primed for major change on LGBTQ issues. NBA veteran Jason Collins came out, as did Major League Soccer’s Robbie Rogers, and University of Missouri defensive end Michael Sam, prior to being drafted by the St. Louis Rams. Surely, more pioneers were about to emerge. But none did.“It felt like, oh, here we go,” said Cyd Zeigler of the website Outsports. “And then …”Zeigler and I were kicking around possible reasons. He is probably the foremost writer on the issue, and I spent much of the past decade in pro sports locker rooms. I frequently observed, and sometimes wrote about, what I saw as deeply embedded homophobia; it was evident in how guys tossed around the word “fag,” and in the conversations I had with Christian athletes who said they did not agree with the gay “lifestyle.” When I mentioned all this, Zeigler pushed back hard.“The media is a problem and this interview is an example of that,” he said. “Most of your questions are about how hard and bad it is. They’re negative.”He makes a point, and we’ll circle back to it. But in interviews with Zeigler and other prominent figures in the LGBTQ sports community, it was clear that everyone’s first answer to the big question ― Why hasn’t significant change happened in men’s sports? ― was that no one quite knew, but all were surprised by the lack of progress over the past four years.Some speculated that the conservative blowback after Sam kissed his boyfriend live on ESPN, and the fact that he never officially made it onto an NFL team’s roster, might have served as accidental deterrents. The divisive political climate in the Trump era hasn’t helped. A casually homophobic locker room culture persists, sowing fear among gay athletes about how teammates would handle their sexuality. And the strong presence of a certain strain of Christianity, especially in baseball, complicates any gains.“It’s easy to generalize and say, ‘Oh look at how great it is to be gay in 2017,’” said Billy Bean, Major League Baseball’s vice president for social responsibility and inclusion, and a former player who did not come out publicly until after retiring.“But I think that we are in a very, very volatile time,” Bean continued, “and maybe last year, you had five players who were much closer [to coming out] than they are this year, because the way the world and our country seems to be divisive toward a whole multitude of things.” Rogers, who plays for the Los Angeles Galaxy, is currently the only openly gay male athlete on a major U.S. professional sports team. Women’s sports are a different scene: As Rogers pointed out, women’s soccer has several stars who are out. “You have Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe, and all the women are doing really well,” he said.The WNBA also has prominent LGBTQ players. Earlier this year, star Sue Bird came out and announced she was dating Rapinoe. Men’s sports ― defined as they are by an old-school macho culture ― lag behind; can you imagine an NFL quarterback announcing that he’s dating an NBA point guard?Rogers came out after many years of wondering if it would leave him excluded from locker room culture, which so often involves anti-gay slurs and graphic sexual chatter about women. But it turned out that his experience was far more positive than he expected, and that teammates quickly stopped using casually homophobic language. “I just remember how scary it was for me when I was closeted, and what the locker room was like before that, and the things you hear,” he said. “It slowly chips away and scars people. You’re just fearful. Very afraid. I’ve heard for all my career homophobic things, but when I came out, it just totally stopped.”Rogers has since heard occasional taunts from fans, and engaged in a few difficult conversations with opposing players about their religious objections to homosexuality. But his teammates have supported him. So why haven’t others followed?“I’m surprised,” Rogers said. “I felt like with Michael and Jason and myself … I was predicting that maybe every year someone would come out. But in men’s sports, it’s just me right now.” One deterrent, he said, is an outdated view of manhood, and the fear of not fitting in.“From a very young age, we’re raised to be part of this team, and part of this atmosphere, and to be good teammates,” Rogers said. “At least in boys’ sports, it’s like a little club. I didn’t want to be on a team and be an outsider. I didn’t want guys walking on eggshells around me, or whispering. I tried so hard to just fit in.”“There is still that stereotype of what is a male professional athlete,” he added. “And at the moment ― although it’s changing ― gay is not part of that stereotype, obviously.”Bean adds that jobs in pro sports are difficult to earn, and an athlete’s physical prime is brief. It is stressful enough to try to hold onto a roster spot without becoming a pioneer or spokesman.“By the time a player gets to that level, there are so many things at stake,” Bean said. “When you see you’re one season away from getting a four-year contract, or even getting the chance to play every day … I know what’s in the mind of a player who is just not ready to put it all out there, and isn’t ready to not only become a role model for millions of people, but also put his personal life out there for the consumption of a lot of people who really don’t have any interest in taking care of that person.”In other words, it’s easy for a pundit or advocate to tell an athlete to speak out, and risky for the athlete to actually do it. He is busy watching video of his performances, traveling, answering to the media, working his way out of slumps, trying to please his coaches and hang on to his job.But despite all this, Zeigler notes the many stories he has published on Outsports that followed the same basic arc: An amateur athlete is terrified to come out, takes the plunge, and is amazed by the love and support that flows from teammates.In order for this to happen more frequently at the pro level, Zeigler said, gay men have to realize that many of their worries are based more in fear than reality. This year alone, five college football players ― including two in Division I ― are out, and none have reported problems.“There are two ways to accelerate this,” Zeigler said. “One, people have to stop using [homophobic] language, and they have to stop talking about sex with women all the time in the locker room. Those are two easy things that affect every gay athlete. Just check their language, be more professional. One of your teammates is gay, period, and how do you think that makes them feel? And then gay people just have to come out. That’s their role in this. Just come out and be out.”Zeigler and I went back and forth on this for a bit. I wanted to buy into his optimistic message, but couldn’t help but think of my years in locker rooms observing casual homophobia and right-wing religious views. “Most of us are still Neanderthals,” one New York Mets player said to me in 2011.The bigots are not exactly hiding. In 2012, the Los Angeles Times quoted the since-retired outfielder Torii Hunter saying that if he had an openly gay teammate, he would be “uncomfortable because in all my teachings and all my learning, biblically, it’s not right.” Two years later, he recorded a radio ad for Arkansas Republican gubernatorial candidate Asa Hutchinson, complimenting Hutchinson for wanting to keep marriage “between one man and one woman.”Another prominent former baseball star, Lance Berkman, has taken bigotry in the name of religion even further, campaigning against an equal rights ordinance in Texas that would have prohibited discrimination based on gender, race, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity. Discussing the issue of transgender people’s access to the bathroom of their choice, Berkman said that because he was the father of four daughters, he did not want “troubled men to enter women’s bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.”On another occasion, Berkman said, “You get called a bigot and intolerant and all that stuff … To me, tolerance is the virtue that’s killing this country. We’re tolerant of everything.”This year, the St. Louis Cardinals invited Berkman to speak at their “Christian Day” event.Hunter, meanwhile, has long been a darling of the media.

51,POLITICS,Republicans Find More Ways To Avoid Criticizing Trump’s Dealmaking With Democrats,Igor Bobic and Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-donald-trump-daca-deal_us_59bacbdee4b02da0e1403890,"Deal or no deal, many GOP lawmakers say they support the president.",2017-09-14,"House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday that ""no deal was made"" regarding immigration during a Wednesday night dinner with Democratic leaders and President Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bacd1d1900002500563c97.jpeg?cache=coU24JfLRl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After President Donald Trump appeared to set up Republicans for another deal with Democrats, this time on the GOP’s most scorching hot-button issue ― immigration ― congressional Republicans were once again putting their faith in Trump on Thursday.Save the initial Twitter bluster from some conservative commentators and Republicans with the strongest views against immigrants, GOP lawmakers were mostly downplaying the tentative deal and standing behind Trump, with the president and his allies casting doubt there was any deal at all.“There’s no agreement,” Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Thursday, adding that he had spoken with Trump and the White House chief of staff just hours before.“It was a discussion, not an agreement,” Ryan said, and Trump seemed to back that up, tweeting on Thursday morning that “no deal was made.”That didn’t appear to be the takeaway for Democrats, however, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reporting that while the president and Democratic leaders didn’t have a firm agreement on a bill, they did have “an agreement to move forward,” even asserting that Trump may have agreed to an eventual pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.“We all agreed on a framework: Pass DACA protections and additional security measures, excluding the wall,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Thursday. “We agreed that the president would support enshrining the DACA protections into law.”On Wednesday night, Trump invited “Chuck and Nancy, as he’s taken to calling them, to a dinner meeting at the White House. The invitation came a week after Trump bypassed GOP congressional leaders to reach a deal with Democrats to keep the government funded and increase its borrowing limit for another three months.Following Wednesday’s dinner, Democratic leaders announced that the president had agreed in principle to legislation that would shield the country’s 800,000 so-called Dreamers ― young undocumented immigrants ― from deportation. In exchange, they said, Democrats would agree to beef up border security, but they did not agree to fund a new wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.By Thursday morning, Trump was downplaying any suggestion that an arrangement had been made with Democrats. But, at the same time, he appeared to confirm Schumer and Pelosi’s account of the meeting ― and contradict his spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.“The wall will come later,” Trump said before boarding Air Force One.“Mitch [McConnell] is on board, Paul Ryan’s on board,” Trump added. “We all feel, look, 92 percent of the people agree on DACA, but what we want is very, very powerful border security, OK?”Upon landing in Naples, Florida, Trump again reversed course, attempting to soothe supporters by stating that he is “not talking about amnesty. We are talking about taking care of people.”But whichever way this game of “deal or no deal” shakes out, it appears Trump will maintain the support of rank-and-file Republicans in Congress.“I certainly support the president. I think that he’s going to negotiate with whomever he can to get a majority of votes to pass legislation,” Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) told HuffPost Thursday, adding that Trump is “very popular in my district.”Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), normally a staunch opponent of legislation that would let undocumented immigrants stay in the United States, said it is perfectly fine for the president to be negotiating with Democrats on DACA.“He can negotiate. I think it’s very appropriate,” Wilson said. “But I think he’s going to find out that the people he’s dealing with aren’t dealing in good faith.”Still, Wilson said he trusts Trump and his dealmaking abilities. “He knows how to negotiate,” he said. “That’s why he’s president.”Trump’s overtures to Democrats on immigration ― as well as the flurry of contradictory statements from the president and White House officials throughout the day ― confounded lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Still, the president’s top allies, such as Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), applauded him for advancing his agenda in a bipartisan fashion.“I call this ‘Phase two’ of Trump’s presidency. He is taking control. Phase two is getting things done,” said Collins, who was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump’s presidential campaign.Immigration hardliners, such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), did warn that Trump supporters would be “disillusioned beyond repair” if he struck a deal with Democrats to protect Dreamers from deportation. “Trump leads with DACA Amnesty 2017,” he tweeted.But King, perhaps the most aggressive opponent of immigration in Congress, was the exception Thursday, not the rule.Rep. Phil Roe (Tenn.) and other rank-and-file Republicans are reserving judgment until a final deal is reached, but they are also suggesting that an immigration agreement addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is, in Roe’s words, “going to have to be a bipartisan deal.”Trump announced earlier this month he would be rescinding DACA, the 5-year-old Obama-era executive action that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to remain in the country. It is up to Congress, he said, to find a legislative solution that purports with the Constitution within the next six months, after which DACA recipients will begin to lose protections in larger numbers.Democrats are pushing for the Dream Act, a bill that would allow certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States before they turned 18 to gain legal status. It has bipartisan support in both chambers, but only in small numbers: Four Republicans are backing it in the Senate and four in the House.“The Dream Act has major hurdles to overcome to be enacted both in the House and in the Senate,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Thursday.In the Senate, reaction has been a bit more mixed, with some Republicans claiming Trump is undermining the GOP position in negotiations, some offering praise for the president, and others wondering why Trump is pushing deals at all.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who supports giving Dreamers legal status, urged Trump to focus on repealing and replacing Obamacare first because of a looming deadline this month.“We’ve got six months to deal with the Dream Act kids,” Graham said during an interview on Fox News. “You’ve got 17 days to repeal and replace Obamacare.”Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who leads the committee that handles immigration matters, tweeted at Trump that he “undercut” bipartisan efforts to come to an agreement on a legislative solution on DACA.And Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake (R), normally an outspoken Trump critic, offered the president some rare approval by tweeting “kudos.”But the reluctance of Republicans to criticize Trump and their willingness to find new ways to somehow defend his empty promises and contrary actions was best on display with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). Johnson told HuffPost Thursday that he always viewed “the wall” as a “metaphor” for border security.“When you’re in campaign mode, you’re using rhetoric, you’re using shorthand,” Johnson explained.Outside Congress, immigration hardliners did accuse Trump of betraying his voters. Right-wing news outlet Breitbart News lashed out at the president with a banner headline that read “Amnesty Don,” and Fox News host Sean Hannity warned Trump it would be “over” for the president if he abandoned his immigration promises, though he also bizarrely found ways to blame McConnell.In general, the responses from Republicans seemed to follow this general rule: The more anti-immigrant you are, the harsher your reaction ― even if that meant you were once one of Trump’s biggest fans. For right-wing author Mickey Kaus, the apparent deal led him to encourage one-time Trump supporters to burn their Make America Great Again hats. And conservative provocateur Ann Coulter ― the 2016 author of a book titled In Trump We Trust ― seemed to be rethinking her once-ironclad support. “Who DOESN’T want Trump impeached?” Coulter wondered.The answer still seems to be the Republican Congress.Elise Foley contributed reporting."

If he does away with it, it's one more tool gone that was put in place to fuel bipartisanship.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b9bfdf1c0000240079e58b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is hinting at a potential major change in the way the Senate advances judicial nominees ― one that would strip Democrats of the ability to block many of President Donald Trump’s lifetime court picks.In an interview with The New York Times, McConnell said he doesn’t think senators should be able to use “blue slips” to block U.S. Court of Appeals nominees. These are literally blue pieces of paper that senators turn in to the Judiciary Committee to signal that they’re ready for a nominee from their home state to get a hearing. Per long-standing tradition, the committee chairman won’t give a hearing to a judicial nominee until both senators from a nominee’s home state submit blue slips. If even one of those senators refuses to turn in a blue slip, that nominee goes nowhere.McConnell said Wednesday, for the first time publicly, that he supports keeping the rule in place for U.S. District Court nominees but not for appeals court nominees, the most powerful judges on the federal bench after the Supreme Court.“My personal view is that the blue slip, with regard to Circuit Court appointments, ought to simply be a notification of how you’re going to vote, not the opportunity to blackball,” he told the newspaper.Blue slips are one of the few tools afforded to the minority party in the Senate. Both parties have used blue slips to block judicial nominees that they don’t like, but Republicans arguably abused the rule during President Barack Obama’s tenure. On several occasions, GOP senators refused to turn in blue slips for nominees they had recommended to Obama in the first place, just to prevent the Democratic president from filling a court seat.McConnell was among those who did that.When Senate Democrats were in the majority under Obama, they honored the blue slip rule even when Republicans used it to block Obama’s nominees. McConnell’s latest comments suggest he may not be inclined to do the same for them, now that Trump is in the White House and Republicans control the Senate. The blue slip rule is not a hard rule so much as a tradition, so if he wanted Republicans to stop honoring it, it would be easy.Of course, this is all just idle talk for now. McConnell, who is still somewhat of an institutionalist, may just be making the statement to appease conservative groups clamoring for this change. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has made similar comments about blue slips but has yet to stop honoring the rule.A few Democrats have put Grassley to the test recently, though. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) announced he would not turn in his blue slip for one of Trump’s circuit court nominees from his home state, David Stras, saying he was too conservative. Oregon Sens. Ron Wyden (D) and Jeff Merkley (D) announced they won’t be turning in their blue slips for circuit court nominee Ryan Bounds. Their grievance is that the White House bypassed their state’s judicial recommendation process by picking Bounds.It’s unclear if Grassley sees those instances as grounds for eliminating the blue slip rule for circuit court nominees.Trump is already incredibly well-positioned to fill up the nation’s federal courts with his judicial picks. He’s got piles of vacancies to fill, a Republican-led Senate eager to help him and conservative groups steadily feeding him nominees. Easing the blue slip rule to cut Democrats out of part of the process would just make it easier for them. But it would also open the door to Democrats doing the same thing to Republicans when they regain the Senate majority, and it would erode bipartisanship in the process.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who chaired the Judiciary Committee during Obama’s tenure and upheld the blue slip tradition, told HuffPost in June that Grassley “made it very clear” to him this year that he appreciated that Leahy honored the blue slip rule for Republicans when Obama was president. He said Grassley told him personally that he planned to honor it, too.“I take him at his word,” Leahy said. “I’ve known him for over 30 years. He’s never broken his word to me.”"
53,POLITICS,Senator Franken Will Not Return His 'Blue Slip' On The Nomination Of David Stras,"Nan Aron, ContributorPresident, AFJ and AFJAC",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senator-frankens-courage_us_59bae3d8e4b06b71800c37c3,"Franken has taken blistering heat from the right, which is howling that he has “abused” the blue slip tradition.",2017-09-14,<p>Senator Al Franken at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bae56c1a00001500f06bbb.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In recent days, Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota did a simple, reasonable thing, that in the context of the current cravenly-led Senate stands as a monumental act of courage: he announced he would not return his “blue slip” on the nomination of David Stras to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.Since then, Franken has taken blistering heat from the right, which is howling that he has “abused” the blue slip tradition. Not so. Franken has used the slip as it was intended, to signal that he has looked at Stras’s record and does not believe that record justifies proceeding with a nomination to the federal bench. Indeed, Senator Franken is using the same longstanding practice Republicans used when President Obama was president. During the Obama years Republicans exercised their right to halt 18 judicial nominations by withholding the blue slip, and Senate Judiciary Committee chairmen of both parties respected the blue slip process in every instance.And there is plenty of justification to oppose Stras. In his announcement of his blue slip decision, Franken zeroed in on Stras’s adherence to philosophies of two ultraconservatives on the Supreme Court, Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. Scalia, Franken noted, “embraced a rigid view of the Constitution that favored powerful corporate interests, was blind to the equal dignity of LGBT people, and often refused to acknowledge the lingering animus in laws that perpetuate the racial divide.”Franken went on to express his concern that “a nominee nurtured by such an ideology” could be expected to “reliably rule in favor of powerful corporate interests over working people, and that he would place a high bar before plaintiffs seeking justice at work, at school, and at the ballot box.” He is right.We have studied Stras’s record, and there is plenty of cause for concern.As a Minnesota state Supreme Court Justice, Stras twice joined rulings that smoothed the way for a proposed Voter ID law for Minnesota, when he voted to let the measure appear on the ballot with a title and text that had been legally challenged as misleading. Voter ID laws are, of course, one of the most insidious ways in which the voting rights of people of color are attacked and diminished. Stras stood squarely on the wrong side of this issue and thankfully, the people of Minnesota ultimately defeated the measure at the ballot box.In other cases, Stras took positions that were gratuitously harmful to people in vulnerable positions. He dissented from a ruling of the Minnesota Supreme Court that trial judges had the right to allow expert testimony that conflicted with the defendant’s claim of consensual sex. The experts had testified that a lack of detectable injuries, and a delay in reporting, are common in rape cases: critical information that the court needed to hear. In another case Stras, disagreeing with a majority of the state Supreme Court, would have prevented a police officer from suing the City of Minneapolis for age discrimination because the statute of limitations to sue had run out while the city took more than a year to investigate the officer’s original complaint.There’s more, including a deeply troubling claim by Stras that Supreme Court decisions in the areas of school integration, LGBTQ rights and abortion rights represent court “ventures into contentious areas of social policy,” rather than milestones in advancing critical constitutional rights. It bears noting also that Stras went out of his way to praise a New Deal-era Supreme Court justice who believed that Social Security was unconstitutional.It’s true that Stras’s resume makes him look as if he is conventionally qualified for a seat on the federal bench. But look beyond the CV at what we can glean about the nominee’s values, and there are serious questions about whether he is committed to upholding the rights of all Americans; Franken clearly gets that. Moreover, as Franken rightly pointed out, this nomination was made without consultation with either home-state senator – neither Franken nor Sen. Amy Klobuchar. What the White House must do now is simple: go back to the drawing board and pursue bipartisan consultation in the identification of another nominee for this seat. That is how the process is supposed to work, and we look forward to seeing that happen now, for the sake of Minnesotans and all others residing within the eighth circuit.Finally, we should point out that since there was not one single occasion during the Obama years on which a federal judicial nominee advanced without blue slips from both home-state senators, scheduling a hearing for Stras in the Senate Judiciary Committee now, over Franken’s objections, would be an unconscionable slap in the face to a home-state senator. Unlike the spurious accusations against Franken, such a move would be a real case of abusing the blue-slip tradition, and something we hope we never see."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59baa5571a00002400f06ad7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Wednesday, the White House released a statement and photo from President Donald Trump’s meeting with South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. The statement said the two spoke about improving race relations, among other important topics, but most people could only focus on one thing: Trump’s navy blue suit jacket and black pants. It drew quite the response from some people on the internet: First of all, it’s important to keep in mind that there are far more important things to criticize the president for (such as his defense of white supremacists in Charlottesville, his travel ban to bar refugees from Muslim countries, his ban of new transgender service members, etc.). His choice of suits shouldn’t be at the top of that list. Secondly, while most Twitter users are united in their disapproval of Trump’s blue and black outfit, he isn’t technically violating any White House style rules.

That combination of strength and duration hasn’t been recorded over the Atlantic Ocean before. The storm appears to be heading toward the coast of Florida, and mandatory evacuations have been ordered in the Keys. Much of the rest of the state is bracing for emergency. Residents of South Florida began taking early precautions nearly a week in advance. Among them: buying tremendous quantities of bottled water.The emergency guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is to keep on hand at least one gallon of water per person and pet, presumably not counting fish. Many Floridians descended on grocery stores, where aisles of bottled water were reportedly dwindling or already empty as early as Monday — five to six days before the storm is projected to potentially make landfall.That early grocery rush could leave people without bottled water. Making matters worse, prices of bottled water on Amazon have reportedly increased since news of the hurricane broke. Even at regular prices, preparing for the CDC-recommended two weeks with cases of bottled water conceivably could cost a family of four with one dog more than $500 if they could only find 16-ounce bottles.RELATED: Hurricane Irma: ‘Everything Is Under Water, I Mean Everything’Certain corners of the internet have surfaced a technique for water preservation that is applicable in just such an instance. As long as the municipal water system is still intact, “tap water” can be run from a faucet into a storage vessel — a jug, if you will. A canteen or large bottle will also work, as will a food-grade watertight sack.Factory-bottled water costs around 2,000 times as much as artisanal-bottled water. The former is usually not recommended to be stored for longer than two years, while the latter can be stored for up to six months.“Well, I don’t have a jug!” some people might say.RELATED: When Hurricane Warnings Are Lost in TranslationThe nice thing about jugs is that they are purchasable and reusable. They keep until whenever you need them, and they are environmentally less costly to ship than cases of bottled water. This means less burning of fossil fuel, and so less carbon flowing into the atmosphere, and so less warming of the oceans, and so less intensification of the very weather patterns that bring about the need for stockpiling water.Disaster-preparedness experts recommend that people invest in quality vessels if possible. Choosing the optimal way to store gallons of water for any given home isn’t necessarily obvious, and it depends on geography. Sources in the San Francisco Bay Area have informed me that many households maintain full tanks of water for use after the next earthquake. Among the popular options are large, polyethylene barrels, some of which are equipped with taps (like kegs) and hold up to 55 gallons of water. Water can be safely stored in these kegs for years, according to some experts, when they’re well cleaned and sealed.Of course, making space for a large sturdy barrel in a city where real estate costs something like $8,500 per square foot is a privilege not afforded to all. The same problem of space presents itself in New York, where some apartments are barely larger than bedrooms, and in my experience almost none have water barrels. Keeping a 55-gallon barrel of water on a high shelf to save space creates its own set of risks upon arrival of a natural disaster.RELATED: How Hurricane Irma Is Sucking Florida’s Beaches DryIn cases where storage is limited, collapsible five-gallon containers can be purchased cheaply and easily stored in even a modest-sized crack in a wall. Hurricanes afford time for preparation that earthquakes do not, namely time to fill one’s vessels.Even if the municipal water system does fail or become contaminated, as some did in Texas in the wake of Harvey, tap water can be made potable in various ways. The CDC advises adding a tiny bit of bleach, one teaspoon of 5.25-percent sodium hypochlorite per gallon of water. If anything, grocery stores should be selling out of bleach.For preventing dehydration, water alone should be sufficient, unless you’re fasting and sweating profusely or have cholera or another sort of diarrhea. Those conditions could leave people with electrolyte deficiencies, in which case oral rehydration solution can be purchased and kept on hand, of the same formulation that is used by the World Health Organization during cholera outbreaks. Since dehydration is among the leading causes of death globally (often due to infectious diarrhea, outbreaks of which are common after a natural disaster), oral rehydration solution has proven to be one of history’s most effective, life-saving medical interventions.If you find yourself without any sort of bottled water — artisanal or factory — and your water supply is contaminated and you have no bleach or ability to boil or otherwise purify water, then there is usually some drinkable water in your hot-water heater and in the tanks of your toilets. The tanks, not the bowls.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Why Happy People Cheat, The First White President"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59bac6291c0000240079e7ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Safety concerns in Chicago have led to a surge in the number of black women receiving a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Since Illinois began issuing these licenses in 2014, the number of black women who obtain a permit has increased each year in Cook County, the Chicago Tribune reported. In 2014, about 800 black women received a permit. So far this year, nearly 1,400 got a concealed carry license.Though the more than 4,000 black women who have a permit make up only a small percentage of overall applicants in Cook County, they had the highest rate of growth than any demographic from 2014 to 2016 at 67 percent. Javondlynn M. Dunagan of South Side Chicago told DNAinfo that she overcame her fear of guns after divorcing her husband, who was a cop. She began to feel uneasy not having a gun in the house and started taking firearm safety classes in 2013, and noticed she rarely saw black women. In January 2016, she opened JMD Defense & Investigations, a gun club that educates and empowers women, especially black women.Several defense groups catered to black women are popping up around the country. Trigger Happy Firearm Instruction in Savannah, Georgia, the Black Women’s Defense League in Dallas and Armed Empress in Atlanta are just a few.Marchelle Tigner, founder of Trigger Happy Firearm Instruction, noted the increased likelihood of domestic violence against black women in an interview with The Associated Press."

The request was so unusual it sparked an “inquiry” by the Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General.A spokesperson for the Treasury Department said Mnuchin’s request was made to ensure that the secretary would have a secure line with which to communicate as a member of the National Security Council. Once the department found a different way to ensure secure communication, the request was withdrawn.“It is imperative that he have access to secure communications, and it is our practice to consider a wide range of options to ensure he has these capabilities during his travel, including the possible use of military aircraft,” a Treasury spokesman said in a statement to The New York Times.President Donald Trump defended Mnuchin on Thursday.“I’ve known him for a long time,” the president said after touring hurricane damage in Florida. “He’s a very straight shooter.”The Treasury Department’s inspector general is already looking into Mnuchin’s travel with his wife, actress Louise Linton, on an Air Force jet to Louisville and Fort Knox, Kentucky, last month that coincided with the solar eclipse. At their Fort Knox stop, they were close to where the eclipse occurred in totality.Mnuchin, a multimillionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, and his wife came under fire last month when Linton posted a photo to Instagram showing them descending from the jet’s staircase. She tagged the designer brands she was wearing in the image, and attacked a person who criticized her for using American tax dollars for the trip.Linton eventually apologized for her response and the post was deleted from her account. Mnuchin also made clear that his wife’s portion of the trip was paid for by him, not the government.After Linton flaunted their lavish lifestyle on social media, ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also launched an investigation into the couple’s Kentucky trip to see if they planned it around viewing the eclipse.This article has been update with a comment by Trump.

By Tuesday afternoon, the city’s downtown area, and tourist-friendly locales like Miami Beach, were largely back up and running, and a sense of relief and normalcy had begun to return.But residents of Little Havana ― one of Miami’s largest and poorest neighborhoods ― have not been as lucky. In this neighborhood, where 90 percent of the roughly 53,000 residents are Hispanic and the median income is well below the Miami average, many are still waiting for the same signs of recovery present in the city’s wealthier neighborhoods.Many businesses and gas stations in Little Havana remained closed on Wednesday. It was common to see locals gathered outside in an attempt to escape the stuffy heat of their homes and apartments that still lacked air conditioning. Working traffic signals were a rare occurrence. And in an area where most will soon enter their fifth day without power, Little Havana residents who have already withstood the storm are growing increasingly anxious about how much longer they can weather its aftermath.Jaritza Suarez, 18, has been at home with her two younger sisters and mother since before Irma arrived and has been without power for four days. Post-storm price surges have made what little gasoline they have been able to find prohibitively expensive. And even though the local supermarket is open, Suarez and her family can’t cook without electricity, forcing them to go to fast-food places like Wendy’s, where her mother works. The ice-cold showers are also bad, but the worst part is trying to sleep through the sweltering heat. “It’s so humid, so humid,” Suarez said. “It would have been better at least if it was windy, but it’s just hot. And then during sleep we’re just sweating.”Other residents also reported having trouble sleeping. A teenage girl who lives near Marlins Park, home to Miami’s Major League Baseball franchise, said she and her sister chose to sleep in their parents’ car on Tuesday night, because the night air was cooler than their crowded apartment.Bereft of power, Little Havana turns into a pocket of darkness at night, the only visible light coming from downtown skyscrapers and high-rises, which either never lost power during the storm or have already had it restored.“It’s hard not to be envious when you look around and see lights everywhere.” said Kris Williams, who lives along the Miami River in Little Havana. “Meanwhile, you’ve got a candle that’s burning. It’s frustrating.” Williams said he’s seen only one electrical truck in the neighborhood since Sunday, and it was driving north toward an area that already had power. Suarez, meanwhile, said she hadn’t seen any, fostering a sense of neglect in a neighborhood where the feeling isn’t altogether unfamiliar.“I feel like we don’t matter or something,” she said. “I guess we don’t have that much people, and we don’t have that much big businesses around, so they’re doing the rest first and leaving us behind.”Hurricane Irma initially left more than 5 million Floridians without power in the 35-county area Florida Power and Light serves. That was a new single-event record for FPL, which said Tuesday that it managed to restore power to more than 40 percent of those who lost it in the first 24 hours after the storm. The company has 20,000 employees working to restore power across the state, spokeswoman Florencia Contesse said. But they must first start by getting power to critical facilities including hospitals, police and fire departments, and other emergency services, she said.Andrés Echevarría, a 34-year-old producer for Univision who lives in Little Havana, said he understands the situation FPL faces. It isn’t willful neglect, he said, but an issue of location. It’s true that downtown Miami has seen a resurgence following the storm, but that’s because there are fewer trees to take down power lines, he said. “The tree roots grow sideways, not down,” Echevarría explained. “So when you have these strong hurricane winds, they’re more likely to topple over. The trees here hit cars, houses, power lines ― navigating the road is like a labyrinth.”Contesse echoed the same issue, saying clearing vegetation has been “one of the biggest challenges we’re seeing.” “We’re out there,” Contesse said. “Everyone is working around the clock.” FPL, she added, expects power to return to most ― if not all of ― South Florida by Sunday. Other places hit hardest, like Key West, could take until Sept. 22 to restore power.Still, Echevarría said he’s worried. Nearly a quarter of Little Havana’s population is above the age of 60. And while Echevarría can stomach the sticky heat, his 70-year-old neighbors and many like them can only take it for so long, especially as the neighborhood’s residents have worked to clear debris and downed trees on their own.Such lingering danger after the storm was apparent elsewhere in South Florida on Wednesday. Eight people died at a nursing home in Hollywood, Florida, after their air conditioning system was knocked out following the storm. Officials evacuated the remaining tenants from the “extremely hot” facility, said Raelin Storey, a spokeswoman for the city.“The older Cuban population here is already sweeping up streets and cleaning up,” Echevarria said about Little Havana. “They’re self-sufficient. But they’re getting increasingly anxious. You can see the stress in their eyes.”"

But they must first start by getting power to critical facilities including hospitals, police and fire departments, and other emergency services, she said.Andrés Echevarría, a 34-year-old producer for Univision who lives in Little Havana, said he understands the situation FPL faces. It isn’t willful neglect, he said, but an issue of location. It’s true that downtown Miami has seen a resurgence following the storm, but that’s because there are fewer trees to take down power lines, he said. “The tree roots grow sideways, not down,” Echevarría explained. “So when you have these strong hurricane winds, they’re more likely to topple over. The trees here hit cars, houses, power lines ― navigating the road is like a labyrinth.”Contesse echoed the same issue, saying clearing vegetation has been “one of the biggest challenges we’re seeing.” “We’re out there,” Contesse said. “Everyone is working around the clock.” FPL, she added, expects power to return to most ― if not all of ― South Florida by Sunday. Other places hit hardest, like Key West, could take until Sept. 22 to restore power.Still, Echevarría said he’s worried. Nearly a quarter of Little Havana’s population is above the age of 60. And while Echevarría can stomach the sticky heat, his 70-year-old neighbors and many like them can only take it for so long, especially as the neighborhood’s residents have worked to clear debris and downed trees on their own.Such lingering danger after the storm was apparent elsewhere in South Florida on Wednesday. Eight people died at a nursing home in Hollywood, Florida, after their air conditioning system was knocked out following the storm. Officials evacuated the remaining tenants from the “extremely hot” facility, said Raelin Storey, a spokeswoman for the city.“The older Cuban population here is already sweeping up streets and cleaning up,” Echevarria said about Little Havana. “They’re self-sufficient. But they’re getting increasingly anxious. You can see the stress in their eyes.”"

It’s a nightmare she fears many in Texas, Florida and the Caribbean have only just begun.“God help them,” Vailakis-DeVirgilio told HuffPost, adding that when it comes to securing insurance money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency she expects those hurt by the back-to-back, record-breaking hurricanes will “get raked over the coals.”Vailakis-DeVirgilio and her husband had been paying into the National Flood Insurance Program for nearly a decade when the storm surge from Sandy inundated their home in Broad Channel, New York. The damage was extensive. The walls of their newly renovated seaside cottage were blown out, and the water “rocked and twisted” the house, knocking it from its foundation, she said. The couple did what it was supposed to: They filed a flood claim with FEMA, which oversees the federal flood insurance program — established by Congress in 1968 to provide low-cost insurance to people living in flood-prone areas. As they would soon find out, being an NFIP policyholder doesn’t necessarily mean that rebuilding in the wake of a natural disaster will happen quickly. A few months after filing their claim, the family was cut a “lowball” check for $69,000, Vailakis-DeVirgilio said. Unsatisfied, the family hired an attorney. It would be more than 2½ years of fighting FEMA and the insurance company — while her husband Lenny was undergoing treatment for liver cancer and hepatitis C — before they received an offer they found acceptable. That settlement remains confidential.Since receiving the money they were owed, the couple has dealt with numerous other issues that have prevented them from rebuilding, including a contractor who defrauded them of more than $40,000 and numerous issues with permits, she told HuffPost. Vailakis-DeVirgilio, her husband and their 15-year-old daughter have moved four times since the Sandy disaster and are currently living in a rental home three doors away from their vacant property. Vailakis-DeVirgilio’s husband, a former New York City schoolteacher, has drained his retirement account. And had it not been for her job, working a condensed three-day workweek on a computer help desk, she says she would never have been able to wage such a battle.“This is a full-time job,” she said.Vailakis-DeVirgilio was among a number of Superstorm Sandy victims who traveled to Washington this week to warn the victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma that their problems have only just begun and to urge them to be vigilant as they fight to recover. “The storm is the easy part,” George Kasimos, founder of Stop FEMA Now, a citizen advocacy group fighting to reform NFIP, said during a news conference Wednesday at the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill.The NFIP, which is now almost $25 billion in debt, was set to expire Sept. 30. But with national attention on the struggling program and little time for constructive reform, Congress passed legislation extending it until Dec. 8. The punt was tucked into an agreement struck by President Donald Trump and Senate Democrats to provide billions of dollars in disaster aid for Hurricane Harvey, raise the debt ceiling and keep the government from shutting down. Stop FEMA Now is among a number of groups calling for an overhaul of NFIP. Its members say it’s time that the program protected homeowners from outrageous premiums, pushed money to storm victims rather than insurance companies and government contractors, and held insurers and engineers accountable for fraud. Augie Matteis Jr.’s law firm represents more than 1,200 clients in New York and New Jersey who opted to reopen insurance claims in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. Nearly five years after the disaster, 900 of those clients are still waiting for a reimbursement, he said, adding that Irma and Harvey victims need look no further for a glimpse of what they’re up against. “When is this mess going to end?” Matteis asked. “This is the proverbial swamp of Washington that people talk about. Somebody needs to stand up now and make FEMA pay these claims fairly — not next year, not next month, but right now.” What was once a self-sustaining program has been walloped in recent years by an increasing number of claims following costly natural disasters, including Sandy and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In fact, 1 percent of the roughly 5 million policyholders account for 25 to 30 percent of all claims, according to Scientific American. The Government Accountability Office has labeled the program as “high risk,” citing “structural weaknesses in how it’s funded.” And in a report published Sept. 1, the Congressional Budget Office found that the program is operating at a $1.4 billion annual shortfall. In a call with reporters before the Stop FEMA Now news conference, Roy Wright, FEMA’s deputy associate administrator for insurance and mitigation, said the agency had taken steps in recent years to refocus the program on policyholders, to be more transparent and to make the appeals process more fair. He said he was committed to ensuring policyholders are paid “every dollar” that they are owed. Losses from Hurricane Harvey alone are expected to cost NFIP $11 billion. So far, 84,000 Harvey victims have filed claims with FEMA, and the flood insurance program has divvied out $177 million in advanced payments — a figure Wright said he expected to “rapidly” climb. Then there’s Hurricane Irma, which pummeled islands in the Caribbean before moving on to the Florida Keys and the U.S. Southeast. Although still early, Irma will only further stress a program that, as The Naples Daily News in Florida reported, has just $1.5 billion on hand and $5.8 billion in borrowing authority. Among those who shared their personal horror stories Wednesday was Diane Mazzacca, whose 1,400-square-foot home in Beach Haven West, New Jersey, was flooded with 4 feet of water during Sandy. She said she’s been fighting an initial payout offer of $27,000 and has yet to receive a full reimbursement. Her advice for anyone affected by Harvey or Irma: “Put on your big girl pants, because it’s going to be a long, bumpy ride.” “My heart breaks for everybody that has been hit with these floods,” Mazzacca said, holding back tears. “I know that their task at hand is going to be beyond stressful.” Phil Nufrio, a professor of public policy, administration and emergency management at Metropolitan College of New York whose Seaside Park, New Jersey, home was damaged by Sandy, said people will be “undercut” and “shorted” by the agency. “Take pictures. Tons of pictures,” Nufrio said. “Keep your receipts, organize your receipts, because you are going to go through a quagmire of government bureaucracy.” Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) joined the group of Sandy survivors in calling for a reform of the NFIP. He said the program is “essential” for America’s coastal communities and has been successful in driving safer building standards. Instead of vilifying it, it’s time to fix it, he said. “We cannot let the program lapse,” he said. “It will be a disaster for the American people.” MacArthur also stressed that while all eyes are on Texas and Florida right now, FEMA’s job “is far from being done” in New Jersey and New York. Like others who spoke Wednesday, Vailakis-DeVirgilio said she’s all for reforming NFIP to make it more sustainable and holding insurance companies accountable. But she sees a bigger issue that can’t be ignored: climate change.“It’s not just ‘let’s just move people.’ We have to do more than one thing,” she said of fixing NFIP. “I’m a registered Republican. Climate change is real. I’m a climate refugee, my whole family is. We can either take the bull by the horns and be at the forefront of technology and the economy of climate change and how we can correct it, or we can let the rest of the world — like China — do it.”Vailakis-DeVirgilio also fought back tears when asked about the people whose lives and homes have been devastated by Harvey and Irma. “If I could go down there and help every single one of them I would,” she said. “Right now I have to focus on getting [my family] home.”Willa Frej contributed to this report.

The senate must confirm appointees.In March, former FEC chair Ann Ravel, a democrat, resigned, leaving the commission with three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent. The loss of Ravel has not affected commissioners’ ability to hold meetings or take action, an FEC spokesperson said.Trainor would serve “the remainder of a 6-year term expiring April 30, 2023,” according to the White House, replacing Republican commissioner Matthew Peterson, who was nominated by President Trump to become a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.The nomination was panned by transparency groups, including Issue Oneand ReThink Media, which called for Trainor to recuse himself in any future FEC probe of Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election should he receive senate approval. The FEC may be pressured into reviewing Russia’s activity, The Washington Post noted.An unabashed Trump supporter, Trainor was featured in an Austin American-Statesman story in January flaunting Trump-Pence memorabilia.Nine months later, Trainor hasn’t lost his Trumpian leanings.He recently blocked his Twitter account from public viewing, but a number of his archived tweets collected by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine were shared by Center for Public Integrity reporters.Trainor’s recent social media activity includes a half dozen Trump retweets and other conservative and religious endorsements, including a Federalist Society tweet about a Rand Paul interview.ReThink called on senators to consider the implications of Trainor’s appointment. It’s unclear when the Senate Rules Committee will hold a hearing.Issue One also urged senators “to publicly and fully vet” a nominee with such antagonism for openness and oversight in campaign finance.“(Trainor’s) prior stances on the regulation of dark money, his clashes with the Texas Ethics Commission and support for the Texas Senate defunding the body raise serious concerns as to whether he will be fully committed to enforcing the law, or like former FEC commissioner Don McGahn, more interested in nullifying long-standing election regulations and laws,” said Meredith McGehee, Issue One’s chief of policy, programs and strategy.In 2015, Trump told TIME magazine that he wanted more transparency in campaign financing, which doesn’t appear to be the priority of his first FEC nominee."

Over the last two years, however, this Oakland, CA couple turned the tables by documenting their own personal journey toward creating a family through foster-adoption. The result? A delightful and thought-provoking web-based docu-series called “The F Word.” In this special RaiseAChild “Let Love Define Family®” series installment for HuffPost Queer Voices, contributing writer Danielle Lescure visited with the San Francisco bay area filmmakers to understand their initial vision, challenges, and personal motivations. Premiering September 14th and streaming for free on Indie Lens Storycast new YouTube channel, “The F Word” transports viewers directly into Nicole and Kristan’s living room to witness the tender and trying times behind becoming the parents they long to be. Over the course of six short episodes, the show offers an often humorous and sometimes heartbreaking look at navigating the unpredictable waters of parenthood through the foster care system. Together since 2011 and married in 2013, the couple knew they wanted children and had discussed pursuing adoption from the early days of their relationship. But the more deeply they delved into training and educating themselves, the more they felt there were pieces of the puzzle missing in preparing prospective parents. “We were both really drawn to the idea of fostering to adopt from the beginning and knew it was the path we were most likely gonna take to create a family,” said Kristan. “We started and completed our required training class for people who want to become foster parents, in April of 2015. By the time it was over we honestly didn’t feel any more prepared. We really wanted more authentic conversation about what it means to be in the system whether you’re a child, a birth parent hoping to reunify, or a foster and potentially adoptive parent. So that was when we decided to take it upon ourselves to find those voices in our community and talk directly to them. This is what you’ll see in Season Two of “The F Word,” while the first season is really about our own journey to parenthood.” “We were so hungry for information and community around this and understanding what it looked like and what some of the challenges would be,” said Nicole. “I just so desperately wanted to see that story and figured that since I’m a filmmaker, we should just turn the camera on ourselves and tell it.”Their social worker was supportive of recording their progress through the process and, naturally, plays a pivotal role in their real-life experience throughout the series.“We took our sweet time filling out all of the paperwork, the fingerprinting, the physicals, and everything that’s required to become a foster parent. I actually think our social worker had given up on us completely,” laughed Kristan. “And when we finally showed up in her office to hand everything in, she cornered us and was like, ‘Okay, we’re doing the home study next week!’” And thus began the rollercoaster ride that would lead to their eventually fostering a child. Though each of the six episodes is only 8 to 12 minutes long, their story actually takes place over a period of almost a year and a half. Possible placements change on a dime; hopes are raised and dashed. “For me, one thing that surprised me was how quickly you can fall in love with a child,” Kristan confessed. “That caught me off guard, even though it probably shouldn’t have.” With many of these raw emotional moments caught on camera, the couple leaned heavily on one another and their dedicated crew for support in creating a safe space during those intimate conversations. “At the beginning, one morning our apartment was really messy and that was when Nicole went through with the camera and filmed it all and I got really upset. ‘Just give me 10 minutes to clean the apartment,’” said Kristan. “We had a conversation about how we were gonna put a lot of messy things on camera and were we really ready for that? I think once we had that conversation, it just made everything else more comfortable, because ultimately there’s no one else that I’d want to go through this experience with.”“We owe a lot to our amazing crew,” she continued. “They’re all local Bay Area documentary filmmakers, but they’re also part of the community of people that we would turn to. They made it really easy to be comfortable on camera and to share those vulnerable moments.”“As the director I knew that I could take that hat off completely and lose myself in the moment because I could trust that I had the best people for the job in the room,” added Nicole. “This has been a hard learning process for me, learning how to let go and be vulnerable.” Beyond their own personal narrative, the pair recognizes a chance to present an honest look at the foster care system and the ways in which the LGBTQ community can be encouraged to strengthen and improve an imperfect institution. The F Word episode 1 partners with RaiseAChild. To access resources and guidance on how you can adopt from foster care, visit RaiseAChild.org.“As a documentary filmmaker, I feel ethically bound to try to truth tell. It’s my profession,” Nicole stated. “More often than not, fost-adoption is rooted in trauma. It’s also profoundly beautiful and meaningful and transformative. We’re totally in this honeymoon phase with this baby right now, but we also have an eye towards the future.”“One thing that’s on my mind is that queer people interested in adoption, have an opportunity,” she continued. “On the one hand it’s an opportunity to have the life-changing experience of becoming a parent, but on the other it’s an opportunity to help reform a broken system and not just walk away once we have our own individual placement. I think that’s our collective responsibility, to be a part of that change. What are the ways we can contribute to making sure that there are fewer foster kids experiencing a total hell while going through life in the system. So much of what they experience is just completely devastating, and that’s an injustice. Especially for the queer community, my hope is that we can continue to build our families while also thinking critically about the ways we can improve this system together as a community. And sometimes that means helping a child reunify with their biological family. Adoption isn’t the answer for every child.” Though the subject matter seems heavy, it is deftly handled with a light-hearted touch and there is plenty of joy and laughter. Additionally, the women felt an episodic series made all the information easier to digest. “I think, honestly, the biggest reason we made a short-form series instead of a feature documentary was we thought we’d capture a totally different kind of audience if these pieces were short, accessible, and free on a channel that everybody had access to,” Nicole said. “We might be able to bring in some viewers that have never thought about these issues before or thought about them but didn’t necessarily want to dedicate 90 minutes of their time to a story about them. You can watch these 10 minute pieces on your coffee break. I find myself watching short content more than I find myself sitting down to watch features. Anybody can take off five, ten minutes when they need a little breather and want something new.” Funding for the series was made possible through ITVS, the Independent Television Service, which funds and airs documentaries on public television. “The F Word” will be one of the first shows helping ITVS launch its brand new Indie Lens Storycast channel on YouTube. Filming is already underway for a second season and a Kickstarter campaign will go live after the first season’s finale in October. In the meantime, Nicole and Kristan are happily focused on fostering their long-awaited baby boy. Reflecting back on the road they’ve traveled, they marvel at how many more layers of love they’ve uncovered within themselves, with one another, and as a family. “You have that incredible experience of falling in love all over again with your partner and discovering everything you’re capable of together and that’s so affirming and incredible,” shared Nicole. “And fostering has really forced us to live in the present because we don’t know how much time we’ll have with this beautiful child. We just know that we’re grateful for every moment we do have with him. We’ve learned that there are really two ways to look at this. One is to focus on the hand-wringing experience of not knowing what the future holds and feeling constantly anxious and fearful of what’s not in your control. But the other perspective is to live in the present and feel that gratitude for every day you’re lucky enough to be caring for him. We’ve learned to ground ourselves in that way of thinking.” But the couple also sees sharing their journey as part of a bigger picture of hope, support, and encouragement for other prospective foster and adoptive parents. “In the beginning we started this because we were finding a lack of transparency in the system and we just wanted to hear more authentic stories. And we knew they existed and that was when we started going in search of them ourselves, as we began to share our own story,” said Kristan. “We want to do this right and that means looking at the uncomfortable truths and having an open and honest and ongoing conversation about how we can reform the system, and how we can all become just a little bit better educated walking into this experience,” said Nicole. “And it’s exciting for us to be growing that support system and becoming part of a community comprised of other foster families. It’s growing and expanding every day. We’re so lucky to be able to do that.” RaiseAChild is proud and thankful that Kristan and Nicole chose our organization as the exclusive partner of the premier episode of “The F Word.” RaiseAChild is a national 501 (c) 3 nonprofit dedicated to building loving families for foster children™.

Over the last two years, however, this Oakland, CA couple turned the tables by documenting their own personal journey toward creating a family through foster-adoption. The result? A delightful and thought-provoking web-based docu-series called “The F Word.” In this special RaiseAChild “Let Love Define Family®” series installment for HuffPost Queer Voices, contributing writer Danielle Lescure visited with the San Francisco bay area filmmakers to understand their initial vision, challenges, and personal motivations. Premiering September 14th and streaming for free on Indie Lens Storycast new YouTube channel, “The F Word” transports viewers directly into Nicole and Kristan’s living room to witness the tender and trying times behind becoming the parents they long to be. Over the course of six short episodes, the show offers an often humorous and sometimes heartbreaking look at navigating the unpredictable waters of parenthood through the foster care system. Together since 2011 and married in 2013, the couple knew they wanted children and had discussed pursuing adoption from the early days of their relationship. But the more deeply they delved into training and educating themselves, the more they felt there were pieces of the puzzle missing in preparing prospective parents. “We were both really drawn to the idea of fostering to adopt from the beginning and knew it was the path we were most likely gonna take to create a family,” said Kristan. “We started and completed our required training class for people who want to become foster parents, in April of 2015. By the time it was over we honestly didn’t feel any more prepared. We really wanted more authentic conversation about what it means to be in the system whether you’re a child, a birth parent hoping to reunify, or a foster and potentially adoptive parent. So that was when we decided to take it upon ourselves to find those voices in our community and talk directly to them. This is what you’ll see in Season Two of “The F Word,” while the first season is really about our own journey to parenthood.” “We were so hungry for information and community around this and understanding what it looked like and what some of the challenges would be,” said Nicole. “I just so desperately wanted to see that story and figured that since I’m a filmmaker, we should just turn the camera on ourselves and tell it.”Their social worker was supportive of recording their progress through the process and, naturally, plays a pivotal role in their real-life experience throughout the series.“We took our sweet time filling out all of the paperwork, the fingerprinting, the physicals, and everything that’s required to become a foster parent. I actually think our social worker had given up on us completely,” laughed Kristan. “And when we finally showed up in her office to hand everything in, she cornered us and was like, ‘Okay, we’re doing the home study next week!’” And thus began the rollercoaster ride that would lead to their eventually fostering a child. Though each of the six episodes is only 8 to 12 minutes long, their story actually takes place over a period of almost a year and a half. Possible placements change on a dime; hopes are raised and dashed. “For me, one thing that surprised me was how quickly you can fall in love with a child,” Kristan confessed. “That caught me off guard, even though it probably shouldn’t have.” With many of these raw emotional moments caught on camera, the couple leaned heavily on one another and their dedicated crew for support in creating a safe space during those intimate conversations. “At the beginning, one morning our apartment was really messy and that was when Nicole went through with the camera and filmed it all and I got really upset. ‘Just give me 10 minutes to clean the apartment,’” said Kristan. “We had a conversation about how we were gonna put a lot of messy things on camera and were we really ready for that? I think once we had that conversation, it just made everything else more comfortable, because ultimately there’s no one else that I’d want to go through this experience with.”“We owe a lot to our amazing crew,” she continued. “They’re all local Bay Area documentary filmmakers, but they’re also part of the community of people that we would turn to. They made it really easy to be comfortable on camera and to share those vulnerable moments.”“As the director I knew that I could take that hat off completely and lose myself in the moment because I could trust that I had the best people for the job in the room,” added Nicole. “This has been a hard learning process for me, learning how to let go and be vulnerable.” Beyond their own personal narrative, the pair recognizes a chance to present an honest look at the foster care system and the ways in which the LGBTQ community can be encouraged to strengthen and improve an imperfect institution. The F Word episode 1 partners with RaiseAChild. To access resources and guidance on how you can adopt from foster care, visit RaiseAChild.org.“As a documentary filmmaker, I feel ethically bound to try to truth tell. It’s my profession,” Nicole stated. “More often than not, fost-adoption is rooted in trauma. It’s also profoundly beautiful and meaningful and transformative. We’re totally in this honeymoon phase with this baby right now, but we also have an eye towards the future.”“One thing that’s on my mind is that queer people interested in adoption, have an opportunity,” she continued. “On the one hand it’s an opportunity to have the life-changing experience of becoming a parent, but on the other it’s an opportunity to help reform a broken system and not just walk away once we have our own individual placement. I think that’s our collective responsibility, to be a part of that change. What are the ways we can contribute to making sure that there are fewer foster kids experiencing a total hell while going through life in the system. So much of what they experience is just completely devastating, and that’s an injustice. Especially for the queer community, my hope is that we can continue to build our families while also thinking critically about the ways we can improve this system together as a community. And sometimes that means helping a child reunify with their biological family. Adoption isn’t the answer for every child.” Though the subject matter seems heavy, it is deftly handled with a light-hearted touch and there is plenty of joy and laughter. Additionally, the women felt an episodic series made all the information easier to digest. “I think, honestly, the biggest reason we made a short-form series instead of a feature documentary was we thought we’d capture a totally different kind of audience if these pieces were short, accessible, and free on a channel that everybody had access to,” Nicole said. “We might be able to bring in some viewers that have never thought about these issues before or thought about them but didn’t necessarily want to dedicate 90 minutes of their time to a story about them. You can watch these 10 minute pieces on your coffee break. I find myself watching short content more than I find myself sitting down to watch features. Anybody can take off five, ten minutes when they need a little breather and want something new.” Funding for the series was made possible through ITVS, the Independent Television Service, which funds and airs documentaries on public television. “The F Word” will be one of the first shows helping ITVS launch its brand new Indie Lens Storycast channel on YouTube. Filming is already underway for a second season and a Kickstarter campaign will go live after the first season’s finale in October. In the meantime, Nicole and Kristan are happily focused on fostering their long-awaited baby boy. Reflecting back on the road they’ve traveled, they marvel at how many more layers of love they’ve uncovered within themselves, with one another, and as a family. “You have that incredible experience of falling in love all over again with your partner and discovering everything you’re capable of together and that’s so affirming and incredible,” shared Nicole. “And fostering has really forced us to live in the present because we don’t know how much time we’ll have with this beautiful child. We just know that we’re grateful for every moment we do have with him. We’ve learned that there are really two ways to look at this. One is to focus on the hand-wringing experience of not knowing what the future holds and feeling constantly anxious and fearful of what’s not in your control. But the other perspective is to live in the present and feel that gratitude for every day you’re lucky enough to be caring for him. We’ve learned to ground ourselves in that way of thinking.” But the couple also sees sharing their journey as part of a bigger picture of hope, support, and encouragement for other prospective foster and adoptive parents. “In the beginning we started this because we were finding a lack of transparency in the system and we just wanted to hear more authentic stories. And we knew they existed and that was when we started going in search of them ourselves, as we began to share our own story,” said Kristan. “We want to do this right and that means looking at the uncomfortable truths and having an open and honest and ongoing conversation about how we can reform the system, and how we can all become just a little bit better educated walking into this experience,” said Nicole. “And it’s exciting for us to be growing that support system and becoming part of a community comprised of other foster families. It’s growing and expanding every day. We’re so lucky to be able to do that.” RaiseAChild is proud and thankful that Kristan and Nicole chose our organization as the exclusive partner of the premier episode of “The F Word.” RaiseAChild is a national 501 (c) 3 nonprofit dedicated to building loving families for foster children™.

Frank Vincent settled back and enjoyed it.Vincent, who died Wednesday during open heart surgery at the age of 78, was best known for playing Phil Leotardo, the New York mob boss who became Tony Soprano’s chief antagonist in the final season of HBO’s “The Sopranos.”Phil wasn’t generally a lot of laughs, though his arguably most famous “Sopranos” scene was staged with very dark humor.Enraged and offended that his fellow mobster Vito Spatafore (Joseph Gannascoli) was gay, as if this would soil the otherwise pristine moral reputation of the Lupertazzi crime family, Phil arranged to have Vito killed.The unsuspecting Vito is brought to a room with the several fellows who will soon beat him to death. Just before that transpires, Phil bursts out of the closet.With that one gesture, before he has said a word, he has announced Vito’s crime, declared his guilt and pronounced his sentence.Get it?Vincent was perfect for Phil. He had the looks and he could summon both the attitude and the cold eyes that said he really, truly, genuinely didn’t care what happened to you. Or you.Phil didn’t kick off Frank Vincent’s career as a mob character. It was more like Phil was the pinnacle, that his earlier career had all built up to Phil.Vincent’s first role was in the low-budget 1976 Mob flick “The Death Collector,” and he got his foothold in the acting biz by playing shady guys in three Martin Scorsese movies: “Raging Bull,” “Goodfellas” and “Casino.”His extensive TV and film resume was sprinkled with titles like “Rubout,” “Made Men” and “Witness to the Mob.” When he guested on “NYPD Blue,” he played a character called The Rat.He played an associate of The Dapper Don in the TV film “John Gotti” and he played his “Casino” character, Frankie Marino, in the “Streets Dreams” video by rapper Nas.Okay, it wasn’t all Mob, all the time. He appeared in two Spike Lee films, he played Aristotle Onassis and most recently he voice Jon Gabagooli in the animated series “Mr. Pickles.”But where some actors known for exuding menace say they yearn for a role in a family sitcom, Vincent didn’t seem to mind hanging out where the jobs were.He told interviewers he loved all of the nuances to Phil Leotardo, like the way he didn’t think Tony Soprano could be a real mobster because he was from Jersey, not New York.Perhaps ironically, Vincent got his start in show biz as a comedian, half of a two-man stage act with Joe Pesci. Robert DeNiro saw their act and hired them both, which worked out pretty well all around.Over the years Vincent became what’s known in the film and TV biz, with respect and affection, as a character actor. The fact we remember his characters says that, all due respect to the late Vito Spatafore, he made the right call."

For weeks my legs had hurt and I was always tired. Then I developed bruises all over my body. My parents took me to the doctor, where blood tests showed I had cancer.I remember being so scared. My parents were worried – where could I receive the best treatment? How much would it cost? They were ready to go anywhere and pay anything to help me get well.Friends of my family knew about St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. At St. Jude, families never pay for treatment, travel, housing or food, and families without insurance are never asked to pay. When my parents learned they would never receive a bill, they could not believe it was true.I felt so blessed from the moment I arrived at St. Jude. I realized even then that it was a place where people loved me and took care of me.Little did we know then that the journey in front of me would be long and difficult.Initially my leukemia was low-risk, so I was able to do two-and-a-half years of chemotherapy treatment while traveling back and forth from Mexico to St. Jude. After treatment, I was able to return home and go back to school and see my friends.But two years later, just after I turned 12, we learned the cancer was back. This time, it was classified as high-risk. I underwent another 2.5 years of chemotherapy.Treatment was more difficult this time, but my doctors and nurses were always by my side. The love, care and happiness we received made a big difference in our lives and my well-being.But then, just as my treatment was finishing, we learned the cancer had returned again. My chances for survival diminished. But St. Jude never waned in its support of me. This time I had chemo and radiation therapy.It was a difficult time, but I knew I had to keep going. Giving up wasn’t an option. And once again, my care team and my family were there for me. St. Jude was my home away from home.I finished treatment in 1995 and have been cancer-free ever since. Three times I underwent treatment, and my family never received a bill for anything. My family was so grateful – this meant they could focus on getting me well.My journey was not an easy one, but it’s led me to where I am today: I am married and the mother of a beautiful daughter, Tayde Sofia. She is so precious to me, because when I was undergoing treatment, I worried I’d never have the chance to become a mother.St. Jude gave me my life back three times. And now I am helping to give back to the hospital that helped save my life.

Most gun owners support the current restrictions and have little interest in undoing them, according to polling. But there’s another constituency that clearly stands to benefit from the push.Sales at gun companies have plummeted in the first eight months of Donald Trump’s presidency. The new measure would open up a revenue stream potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year.For the last 80 years, the sale of silencers, also known as suppressors, has been closely monitored under the National Firearms Act, where they are classified alongside weaponry like machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. Federal law requires any prospective buyer of a silencer to first pay a $200 transfer fee, submit to fingerprinting and pass an FBI background check, a process that can take around a year to complete.Republican lawmakers and the gun lobby have been working over the past few years to eliminate these barriers. The Hearing Protection Act, introduced in both houses of Congress earlier this year, seeks to make the process of buying a silencer similar to that of buying a handgun. Under the measure, individuals in many states would be able to purchase a silencer from a gun store or other federally licensed dealer after passing an instant background check. Gun control advocates say the proposed law would still leave certain unlicensed sellers able to sell the devices without any background check.The Hearing Protection Act has been wrapped into a larger legislative package called the Sportsmen Heritage And Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, which is expected to get a House vote as early as this month. The GOP-controlled House appears likely to pass the legislation; it faces a much less certain future in the Senate. Much of the debate over silencers has so far centered around safety. Supporters of the legislation say they’re working to protect the eardrums of hunters and recreational shooters, who routinely expose themselves to high-volume gunfire. Opponents believe loosening the regulations would be dangerous, because criminals could obtain silencers more easily as well.Under the current law, silencers hardly ever factor into routine U.S. gun violence, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. To gun enthusiasts, this shows the devices could be made more widely available without hurting public safety. To opponents, it proves the effectiveness of the regulations.There’s less disagreement over the economics of deregulating silencers. People on both sides of the issue acknowledge there’s a massive, largely untapped market for suppressors, which cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to over $1,000 for high-end models.As of February, some 1.3 million silencers were registered in the U.S., according to the Justice Department. That’s nearly 400,000 more than in 2015. But with an estimated 300 million firearms in the hands of U.S. civilians, there’s still a huge potential for market growth if the SHARE Act is passed. “I think a safe bet is that the suppressor industry could multiply by 10 times,” Knox Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association, told HuffPost.His lobbying group, founded in 2011, has been active in drafting pro-silencer legislation at both the state and federal levels. A 2016 ASA blog post says that Michael Williams, the organization’s former general counsel, was “lead author” of the Hearing Protection Act.Silencers surged in popularity over the last few years of Barack Obama’s presidency, despite the tight restrictions. Industry experts think that many gun owners rushed to buy silencers before July 2016 when an ATF rule change added more background check and registration requirements for the equipment. Sales continued to spike in the run-up to the 2016 election, as gun enthusiasts stocked up on weaponry in anticipation of a victory by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who they believed was likely to advocate for stricter firearms laws.Some suppressor manufacturers capitalized on this increased demand. Utah-based SilencerCo, the largest maker of suppressors in the U.S., saw its sales grow 600 percent between 2014 and 2016, a representative told HuffPost in March. The company sold 100,000 suppressors in 2016, almost all to civilians.But silencer sales, along with firearms sales more broadly, have experienced a rapid decline in recent months ― a “Trump slump.”“When Trump won and said he wasn’t going to push tougher regulations, you saw demand plummet and it really hasn’t recovered yet,” said Kevin Cassidy, a financial analyst at Moody’s.For corporations like American Outdoor Brands, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, the overall downturn has been devastating. In a September earnings call, the company reported a $100 million drop in firearms revenue compared with the same quarter last year, a decrease of nearly 50 percent, according to The Guardian’s Lois Beckett. Its stock price has spiraled down by 40 percent over the last three months.During that earnings call, American Outdoor Brands president and CEO James Debney suggested the corporation’s recent purchase of Gemtech, a suppressor manufacturer, was cause for optimism, especially in light of the possible congressional action to make silencers easier to buy.“We view this acquisition as somewhat opportunistic, allowing us to enter the suppressor category prior to the potential favorable changes in legislation and at a time when the market is particularly soft,” Debney said, according to The Guardian.But investment in the silencer business may not pay off without Congress’ help. Sales have been sliding at a number of the largest suppressor manufacturers, and industry leaders suggest many prospective buyers are holding off on purchases in anticipation of a regulatory rollback. Some companies have met the dip with mass layoffs. SilencerCo let go of hundreds of employees in February, and other companies such as Wisconsin-based Griffin Armament have also reportedly downsized.So the firearms industry could use a boost. In a press release this week, the National Rifle Association called the silencer measure one of its “top legislative priorities.”Gun control advocates call the timing of the forthcoming vote anything but coincidental.“Gun companies see their sales plummeting under this administration, and that’s why the gun lobby is trying to bail them out and make it easy for anyone to buy a silencer without a background check,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, in a statement to HuffPost. “Plain and simple, this bill is a giveaway to the gun lobby. Its sole purpose is to increase gun industry profits, even at the expense of public safety.”Some Democratic opponents of the bill have similarly accused its supporters of kowtowing to the gun lobby.“The National Rifle Association thinks Congress owes them more armor-piercing rounds and gun silencers on the streets, and today our Republican colleagues showed they’re happy to do what they’re told,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, which voted to advance the SHARE Act on Wednesday. “I’ve been here since 2003, and passing these bills in the name of ‘helping sportsmen’ is one of the most cynical excuses I’ve ever heard.”Although deregulating silencers would undoubtedly increase firearms profits, it’s unclear how substantially it would affect an industry that does billions of dollars of business each year.“It could help ease some of the pain in the gun industry, but it’s not going to fundamentally change the trajectory of gun and ammunition sales. They’ll still be under pressure,” said Cassidy, the financial analyst.Just because lawmakers are acting in ways that would benefit the firearms industry doesn’t mean they’re doing so for that purpose, said Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association. He argued that many Republican voters support looser gun laws and that they supported Trump in part because he vowed to pursue a pro-gun agenda. Williams also claimed that around 250,000 people had sent messages to Congress on the issue of deregulating silencers using a form on his organization’s website.While this may be true for some areas of gun policy, polling suggests the silencer issue is far from settled even among firearms enthusiasts. In a survey of gun owners conducted earlier this year, nearly three-quarters said they wouldn’t back looser restrictions on silencers. The poll was conducted by Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun violence prevention group launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).Even if the SHARE Act ends up being a financial boon to gun manufacturers, Williams sees no problem with that.“Our companies definitely want to make money ― every company wants to make money ― but I find it curious and interesting that so many of these legislators are trying to turn that into a bad thing,” he said. “At the end of the day, these are companies that are providing strictly American-made products, creating hundreds, if not thousands, of American jobs.”"

Utah-based SilencerCo, the largest maker of suppressors in the U.S., saw its sales grow 600 percent between 2014 and 2016, a representative told HuffPost in March. The company sold 100,000 suppressors in 2016, almost all to civilians.But silencer sales, along with firearms sales more broadly, have experienced a rapid decline in recent months ― a “Trump slump.”“When Trump won and said he wasn’t going to push tougher regulations, you saw demand plummet and it really hasn’t recovered yet,” said Kevin Cassidy, a financial analyst at Moody’s.For corporations like American Outdoor Brands, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, the overall downturn has been devastating. In a September earnings call, the company reported a $100 million drop in firearms revenue compared with the same quarter last year, a decrease of nearly 50 percent, according to The Guardian’s Lois Beckett. Its stock price has spiraled down by 40 percent over the last three months.During that earnings call, American Outdoor Brands president and CEO James Debney suggested the corporation’s recent purchase of Gemtech, a suppressor manufacturer, was cause for optimism, especially in light of the possible congressional action to make silencers easier to buy.“We view this acquisition as somewhat opportunistic, allowing us to enter the suppressor category prior to the potential favorable changes in legislation and at a time when the market is particularly soft,” Debney said, according to The Guardian.But investment in the silencer business may not pay off without Congress’ help. Sales have been sliding at a number of the largest suppressor manufacturers, and industry leaders suggest many prospective buyers are holding off on purchases in anticipation of a regulatory rollback. Some companies have met the dip with mass layoffs. SilencerCo let go of hundreds of employees in February, and other companies such as Wisconsin-based Griffin Armament have also reportedly downsized.So the firearms industry could use a boost. In a press release this week, the National Rifle Association called the silencer measure one of its “top legislative priorities.”Gun control advocates call the timing of the forthcoming vote anything but coincidental.“Gun companies see their sales plummeting under this administration, and that’s why the gun lobby is trying to bail them out and make it easy for anyone to buy a silencer without a background check,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, in a statement to HuffPost. “Plain and simple, this bill is a giveaway to the gun lobby. Its sole purpose is to increase gun industry profits, even at the expense of public safety.”Some Democratic opponents of the bill have similarly accused its supporters of kowtowing to the gun lobby.“The National Rifle Association thinks Congress owes them more armor-piercing rounds and gun silencers on the streets, and today our Republican colleagues showed they’re happy to do what they’re told,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, which voted to advance the SHARE Act on Wednesday. “I’ve been here since 2003, and passing these bills in the name of ‘helping sportsmen’ is one of the most cynical excuses I’ve ever heard.”Although deregulating silencers would undoubtedly increase firearms profits, it’s unclear how substantially it would affect an industry that does billions of dollars of business each year.“It could help ease some of the pain in the gun industry, but it’s not going to fundamentally change the trajectory of gun and ammunition sales. They’ll still be under pressure,” said Cassidy, the financial analyst.Just because lawmakers are acting in ways that would benefit the firearms industry doesn’t mean they’re doing so for that purpose, said Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association. He argued that many Republican voters support looser gun laws and that they supported Trump in part because he vowed to pursue a pro-gun agenda. Williams also claimed that around 250,000 people had sent messages to Congress on the issue of deregulating silencers using a form on his organization’s website.While this may be true for some areas of gun policy, polling suggests the silencer issue is far from settled even among firearms enthusiasts. In a survey of gun owners conducted earlier this year, nearly three-quarters said they wouldn’t back looser restrictions on silencers. The poll was conducted by Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun violence prevention group launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).Even if the SHARE Act ends up being a financial boon to gun manufacturers, Williams sees no problem with that.“Our companies definitely want to make money ― every company wants to make money ― but I find it curious and interesting that so many of these legislators are trying to turn that into a bad thing,” he said. “At the end of the day, these are companies that are providing strictly American-made products, creating hundreds, if not thousands, of American jobs.”"

More than 1,000 of them have been identified as unaccompanied, and the organization expects that figure to rise.“The first thing you see here in the different Rohingya camps is the large number of children,” Jean Lieby, UNICEF Bangladesh chief of child protection, said Tuesday in a statement.The types of threats they face, Lieby said, are endless. They’re weak and hungry. They’re exposed to numerous diseases. They’re traumatized and in need of psychological protection. Mothers aren’t giving birth in safe environments. Conditions for Rohingya children within Myanmar’s Rakhine state are no better. The World Food Program estimated in July that 80,000 Rohingya children under the age of 5 will suffer from acute malnutrition in the next year.Tensions between Myanmar’s government and the stateless Rohingya population date back to the 1970s but have reached alarming levels of intensity in recent years. The government now systematically cracks down on the Rohingya in response to militant attacks. U.N. Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein on Monday went as far as to call the crisis a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”Bangladesh, meanwhile, is struggling to cope with a mass influx of refugees in a compressed time period. “Just to give you an idea: 220,000 people entered Bangladesh in only 6 days ― between 4 and 10 September,” Lieby said. “We have no indication that this influx will stop soon. This is a growing humanitarian crisis and children are at the heart of this crisis.”UNICEF has opened a supply hub in Cox Bazar in southern Bangladesh, but is appealing for more assistance.Myanmar’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has remained conspicuously silent on the crisis. She canceled a planned trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, with her office citing ongoing terror attacks.The U.N.

But the de facto leader and Nobel laureate has come under fire for her inaction and failure to condemn the violent, widespread and ongoing persecution of Rohingyas.The Rohingya are a Muslim minority group from northern Rakhine state. They’re classified as illegal immigrants rather than citizens, and have extremely limited rights in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. They have long been victims of state-sponsored discrimination and possible crimes against humanity, according to the U.N.Rohingya militants attacked government security posts in late August, which sparked a massive military retaliation and a flow of refugees into neighboring Bangladesh. Human rights organizations have reported state-sponsored rape, arson, killings and brutality against Rohingyas in the following weeks."

Me and my husband at the time lost everything we owned that wasn’t in our car, but we considered ourselves fortunate: Our 17-month-old son and his paternal grandparents survived. They were driven to safety by a neighbor minutes before our house burst into flames. Twenty-five people died in the firestorm, two at the foot of our driveway.We would feel the effects of the fire for months. We had to find a temporary place to live with a toddler when thousands of others were looking and rents were skyrocketing. We had to decipher insurance policies, file and contest claims. We had to figure out whether to rebuild, and when. And we had to do all this while juggling work and disrupted child care, continuing to pay bills even though the stuff we were paying off was now a pile of ashes. Still, we were lucky. As law professors, we had financial and legal resources to meet these challenges.Most people hit by Harvey and Irma don’t have these means. And in many cases, they are navigating overwhelming loss under far more complicated circumstances — with no income, no healthcare, child support obligations to meet, even vulnerable immigration statuses. In their efforts to stay afloat in this very different kind of flood, the vast majority of Harvey’s and Irma’s victims will have almost no access to legal help.Aware of the legal crisis Harvey has left in its wake, lawyers in Texas have joined the ranks of first responders. Legal aid services have set up booths in shelters to provide information and advice. Attorneys across the country will also be able to help. Under ordinary circumstances, they wouldn’t be allowed to: Like every other state, Texas has a rule that only in-state lawyers can provide legal services to Texans. But after Harvey, the Texas Supreme Court issued an emergency order to temporarily allow out-of-state lawyers to provide pro bono assistance to hurricane survivors.“Lawyers defend their rules as ethical requirements, but they’re not.”This is a welcome dispensation, but it also raises a question: Why limit this benefit to the aftermath of Harvey? Large-scale catastrophes may hit hundreds of thousands at once, but just as many are hit by personal disasters requiring legal help every day.At any given time, as many as two-thirds of all American households are facing at least one problem that requires legal assistance — eviction, the need to pay or collect child support, a health insurance problem. On average more than 85% of these households get no legal help, according to surveys conducted in several states.The reason is straightforward: Legal services are expensive. The average rate of noncorporate lawyers in this country is between $200 and $250 an hour. That’s a nonstarter for most Americans, many of whom can’t cover $400 in unexpected expenses. Very few people with legal problems will get government-funded legal aid or help on a pro bono basis. Only one percent of all lawyers in the U.S. work for legal aid providers, and the average lawyer devotes less than three percent of her hours to pro bono work.Legal services are expensive partly because lawyers are highly trained professionals. But there is another, less obvious factor: Rules like the one in Texas prevent the legal market from bringing down costs.Lawyers create these rules through bar associations and get them adopted by state supreme courts. The rule against out-of-state lawyers, which has been put in place by courts in every state, introduces a barrier to entry and helps to limit economies of scale.It’s not the only example. For instance, there are rules that lawyers cannot be employed by, or enter into investment or contracting arrangements with, companies or organizations that are not owned by lawyers. Attorneys claim this is necessary to ensure that lawyers serve the interests of their clients rather than the profit motives of investors. But it means lawyers can’t partner with entities that have business expertise or the capacity to invest in technology and consumer research — things that might bring costs down. It also means that anyone looking to develop a new legal technology — a phone app that helps people file for benefits or interpret legal documents, say — cannot accept investment from venture capital firms.These rules introduce significant inefficiencies into the market that serve no one, not even the lawyers. By my calculations using census data, many lawyers who charge $200 or more an hour only net $35 to $40 an hour. A recent study on the billing data of lawyers at small law firms found that, for an eight-hour day, they collected payment for about an hour and a half of work.Lawyers defend their rules as ethical requirements, but they’re not. There are other ways to maintain legal ethics that would not radically limit the market. Fine out-of-state lawyers who give advice without adequate knowledge of local rules, for example, and make them hold malpractice insurance. This is how it’s done in the United Kingdom.If American lawyers really want to help people who are hurting, they should start by fixing their own rules."

It could be meaningless,” one GOP congressman says.",2017-09-13,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), at a news briefing on the GOP agenda at the Capitol on Wednesday, says tax reform will be the reason Republicans will keep their majorities.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b999e11c00003a0079e536.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Nine months into Donald Trump’s presidency, Republicans have little to show for their unified control of government. An Obamacare repeal looks unlikely. Trump’s border wall has been stymied. And spending deals have benefited Democrats more than they have the GOP.But Republicans are betting they can quickly turn around their legislative misfortunes with tax reform, the ever-elusive GOP promise to lower rates and ignite the economy. The problem is there are broad disagreements on what an overhaul should look like: what rates should be, who should benefit, whether tax cuts should be paid for, and how long any cuts should last.Despite all the unanswered questions, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) suggested Wednesday that he still believes Congress can get tax reform done by the end of the year, and Republicans are betting that the way forward is to just press ahead and ignore the obvious and unsettled disagreements.Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told the House GOP conference on Wednesday that Republicans will release a “consensus” tax document in two weeks ― one worked out among his committee, Senate Finance and the White House.Exactly what will be included in that document is unknown. When HuffPost asked Brady on Wednesday if the proposal would include the various tax rates for reform, Brady said they were “still hammering out the details.”While it’s hard to imagine the document wouldn’t include rates ― or at least some range of rates that can be tweaked ― it’s a less than fantastic sign for proponents of reform that Brady’s answer is not some version of “Of course!”Perhaps nothing is more emblematic of the cheery-in-theory, tortured-in-reality approach that Republicans have taken for tax reform than the budget. Neither the House nor the Senate has agreed to a budget document for tax reform, which would be the first step for approving an overhaul through reconciliation, a process that allows passage on a simple majority vote. But lawmakers are undeterred by that procedural issue, with Brady telling HuffPost on Wednesday that he expects the House to adopt a budget in October, once the Republicans who have been holding up the budget see some tax reform details.That’s a nice theory, but it’s also an easy leverage point for any member who doesn’t like whatever Republicans put forward on a tax overhaul: just withhold his or her vote in exchange for some carve-out or change, which could in turn affect another member’s vote.It’s not that Republicans are torn on what to do. Excluding the ill-fated border adjustment tax on imports that found significant opposition in Congress, leaders have generally had an idea of what reform would look like. The issue is that once Republicans reveal their document, there will be winners and losers. Charities may lose if lawmakers, as expected, double the standard deduction, disincentivizing itemized deductions and the charitable giving it encourages. Real estate investors, particularly ones who use so-called property swaps to defer paying taxes on their gains, could also be big losers, as could upper- and middle-class earners in high-tax states like New York and California if reform eliminates the federal deduction for state and local income taxes.Lawmakers who have been working on the proposal say the difficulty isn’t coming up with their ideas. “We have a full bill. That’s not a problem,” senior Ways and Means member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Showing it is the challenge.”Once Republicans release this document laying out the broad strokes of reform, lawmakers and interest groups will be able to attack from all sides. Conservatives may say the tax cuts aren’t ambitious enough. More moderate members ― somewhat ironically, by more traditional standards of fiscal restraint ― may have problems with how much the overhaul will increase the deficit. (Conservatives don’t seem to have a problem adding more money to the deficit, as long as it’s for tax cuts.) And individual loopholes, either the closing of them or their continued existence, will almost certainly draw opposition from even the most normally amenable lawmakers.And these problems are even more stark in the Senate, where any three Republicans could derail the effort, assuming all Democrats vote against the overhaul.Trump has begun seeking out individual Democrats to potentially vote for tax reform. His effort may be more fruitful than health care, where Democratic Senators had little problem voting against a Republican proposal that would have largely hurt their constituents. With tax reform, it’s future generations who may be more opposed to a short-term economic sugar high that increases the debt, not the current voters in, say, West Virginia or North Dakota.But that assumes Republicans can get much further into this process than where lawmakers currently stand. Paul Ryan said Wednesday he thought accomplishing tax reform would be the reason Republicans keep their majorities, but even lawmakers seemed to think that was an overblown, over-simplified rationale. Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) told HuffPost that if Republicans didn’t get tax reform done, the Earth wouldn’t “quit spinning on its axis” and Republicans may not lose the majority.“I don’t know that it’s necessarily an accurate correlation,” Bishop said. “It could be a part of a bigger picture. It could be meaningless.”Bishop felt like Republicans would get tax reform done, but he did suggest the Senate could be a roadblock“Can you find 50 lucid members in the Senate?” Bishop asked. "

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, during which the pastor made the anti-gay remarks.“Yes, Leviticus 20:13 calls for the death penalty for homosexuals,” Swanson said during a speech at the event. He said he was “willing to go to jail for standing on the truth of the word of God.”The pastor added that he didn’t think such a policy should be enacted immediately, but rather that gay individuals should have an opportunity to “repent.”If one of his own children were to marry someone of the same sex, Swanson said he would “sit in cow manure” at the entrance of the church.The pastor has also said that he believes Christians should be wary of letting their daughters attend college. “The university for the most part doesn’t understand a biblical vision for womanhood,” Swanson said during a 2012 episode of his show. He added that women should focus on being “a keeper in the home” and a “help-meet” for her inevitable husband.The pastor most recently made headlines by claiming that Hurricane Harvey was tied Houston having “a very, very aggressively pro-homosexual mayor.”Moore did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his appearances with Swanson. But the judge’s spokesperson, Brett Doster, told CNN: “Appearing in any interview is never an endorsement of the interviewer. Responding to CNN is a great example.”Moore has expressed his own anti-gay attitudes over the years. In a 2002 child custody case, he called being gay “an inherent evil” and “abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature’s God.”After the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across all 50 states in 2016, Moore was suspended as Alabama chief justice for telling judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples. It was the second time in his tenure atop the Alabama Supreme Court that he was suspended for judicial ethics violations.In his most recent appearance on Swanson’s show, which aired on Feb. 16, 2017, Moore didn’t address his beliefs about LGBTQ orientation or same-sex marriage. But he and Swanson discussed what they feel to be a lack of Bible-based leadership in the U.S.“Our problem today is we’re denying that there is even a God or that he has sovereignty over our country,” Moore told Swanson.The pastor later posed the question: “What does one do when God’s laws conflict with man’s laws?”Moore, who has also called Islam a “false religion,” responded that “God’s laws are always superior to man’s laws.”"

But Trump did not even nominate Long for the job until April 28, and Long didn’t begin at FEMA until June 20, after the start of hurricane season. And of the 23 slots available for political appointees at the agency, only 12 have been filled, counting Long’s. The other responsibilities are being handled by nonpolitical career employees.Trump didn’t even nominate people for the two other FEMA positions that require Senate confirmation until mid-July. One of those, Daniel Craig, withdrew his nomination after NBC News reported on a federal investigation of Craig during his earlier stint at FEMA from 2002 to 2005. The probe found that Craig appeared to have improperly lobbied his former co-workers within a year after leaving the agency, helping secure more than $1 billion in contracts for a client as part of the Hurricane Katrina recovery.It was FEMA’s performance during and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, in fact, that became a watershed moment for the agency. Then-President George W. Bush famously praised his FEMA administrator, Michael Brown ― “Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job” ― even as complaints spread that Brown and the agency had been woefully unprepared to manage the storm and the massive flooding it caused in New Orleans.The Katrina response, combined with a failed attempt to partially privatize Social Security and the continuing war in Iraq, largely ended Bush’s effectiveness in his second term and set up wave elections that brought a Democratic Congress in 2006 and a Democratic president in 2008.And it was that president who, taking the lessons of Katrina to heart, sought out the emergency management chief that Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) had appointed in that state. Eight years previously, Fugate was appointed to the top job at the Florida Division of Emergency Management, even though he’d served as deputy there under the previous governor, Democrat Lawton Chiles.Jeb’s older brother, by contrast, installed his campaign manager Joe Allbaugh to run FEMA in 2001. Allbaugh had recruited a good friend as his deputy ― even though Brown’s last job had been judging a show horse competition and he had no experience in emergency management. Brown came under withering criticism after Katrina and soon resigned.“Under the Obama administration, FEMA dramatically shifted to something much more responsive,” Vanderbilt’s Fraser said.Fugate brought with him the strategy he had developed in Florida, which emphasized pre-planning as storms approached and staging large quantities of relief supplies a short distance from expected landfalls. This was followed by efforts to restore a community’s food stores, gas stations and power grids as quickly as possible, and to bring in help from even far-away counties to minimize the length of time the state had to remain in the supply business.The Obama administration also adopted Florida’s practice of declaring disasters in affected areas quickly ― sometimes even in advance ― to hasten federal relief dollars.FEMA has retained all of these techniques under Long, including the near-instantaneous disaster declarations signed by Trump.“One of the strong commonalities between Fugate and Long is that they both had experience as state emergency managers,” said Tricia Wachtendorf, from the University of Delaware’s Disaster Research Center. “Certainly this is a positive factor for the current state of FEMA, both coming from Fugate’s lead and now with Long heading up the agency.”Even Tom Bossert, Trump’s homeland security adviser, was quick to compliment Fugate and the work he did to integrate the local, state and federal disaster response, although he also praised Trump’s FEMA pick, who has been in the field since college and ran Alabama’s emergency management agency for three years.“Craig deserves a lot of credit. He deserves a ton of credit for his leadership,” Bossert said, and then added, “But don’t underestimate Brock Long.”"

Ryan reportedly hates the Senate filibuster rule. McCarthy proposed ending the filibuster on spending bills.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b9b0a81c0000240079e56e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Senators are famous for not caring what their counterparts in the House think of their chamber. They often ignore legislation the House passes. They make their own deals on must-pass bills with little regard for the other chamber. And senators pay hardly any attention to the opinions of representatives when it comes to Senate rules.But it was of some note Wednesday when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) delivered prepared remarks proposing the elimination of the filibuster on spending bills, a move that would largely kill the 60-vote requirement and would likely be popular with House conservatives and President Donald Trump.What’s also of some note? According to one lawmaker familiar with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s private comments on the filibuster, the Wisconsin Republican is also no fan of it.“I can’t wait to get rid of this damn filibuster,” Ryan told a small group of lawmakers recently, according to this Republican, who reported that he was not in attendance but had heard the quote from reliable members who were there.Asked whether the speaker supports eliminating the filibuster on spending bills, Ryan’s office pointed HuffPost to some of the speaker’s comments on Wednesday during an Associated Press interview. Ryan was neither asked if he supported the filibuster nor did he say where he stood, but he did say he knew the 60-vote threshold could be frustrating for House members.Of course, Ryan or McCarthy’s opinion on Senate rules may not matter all that much in the Senate. There doesn’t appear to be 50 votes to change the filibuster rules in that chamber — a fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has told Trump repeatedly. But a continued public relations campaign — from Republican House leaders, the White House and the public — could eventually put the Senate in a bind.House members are increasingly bashing the Senate’s filibuster rules. Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) has been on a mission for years to eliminate the minority tactic. He said Wednesday that there was overwhelming support in the House to do away with it, even suggesting that Ryan was “reticent” to share his true feelings on the filibuster because he needed to maintain a strong relationship with McConnell, who has been a fan of the tactic.“There’s no one in this body that is more negatively affected by the Senate filibuster rule than the speaker of the House,” Franks said. “Because he’s in the absolutely impossible position of either appearing to cave to the Democrats when he really has no choice or allowing the government to shut down and doing his party irreparable harm.”Other Republicans told HuffPost on Wednesday that the Senate’s inability to move legislation through its chamber was untenable for Republicans.“‘E.T. phone home’ doesn’t cut it for me in my district,” Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost. “We’ve been saying all along that you need to put your physical presence on the ground because, you know, Democrats might be the opposition, but the Senate is always the enemy.”Republicans who do support the filibuster usually cite how Democrats, if they were in the majority, would basically be able to do anything with 50 votes in the Senate, 218 votes in the House and control of the White House. But even if Democrats controlled the government, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) thought it would be helpful for Republicans to not have “that particular weapon available.”“I don’t think you ever score political points by making life inconvenient for the American people,” Cole said, “and every time you don’t allow the normal function of government ... that’s politically counterproductive.”When HuffPost asked Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) for his thoughts, the former history teacher cited the Founding Fathers — who he said would be rolling over in their graves — and former Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed. “The tyranny of the majority is bad, but the tyranny of the minority is unendurable,” Bishop said, summing up Brackett Reed.“That’s why we became a majoritarian body. They never did,” Bishop said of the Senate. “They ought to.”"
83,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi: Republican Leaders Got Rolled On The Spending Deal,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pelosi-mcconnell-trump-debt-limit_us_59b88f58e4b0edff971768ea,"Mitch McConnell ""unwittingly"" helped Democrats gain leverage and win over Trump, says the House minority leader.",2017-09-13,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and President Donald Trump are actually starting to agree on things. What is happening?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b9509a1c0000240079e43e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) says there’s no need to make a fuss about President Donald Trump siding with Democrats in backing a three-month spending deal. But she’s blunt about one thing: Republican leaders just got rolled.“Yeah they did,” Pelosi told HuffPost in a Tuesday interview. “That’s what happened.”Pelosi was among the Hill leaders who met with Trump last week to hash out a deal on raising the debt limit, funding the government and providing Hurricane Harvey aid. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) were pressing for an 18-month extension on the debt ceiling, which would put off the issue until after the 2018 elections. They don’t like dealing with this issue since many conservatives won’t vote to increase the debt limit without spending cuts, and they need Democrats to get it done. It’s one of few areas of leverage Democrats have in the minority; Democrats could offer to help raise the debt ceiling in exchange for, say, a vote on the DREAM Act.In other words, the more times Congress has to vote to raise the debt limit, the more times Democrats have an opening to push for concessions.So when McConnell and Ryan urged Trump to support extending the debt ceiling for 18 months, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) proposed doing it for three months. Ryan said that idea was “ridiculous, irresponsible, stupid,” recalled Pelosi. “And then, we went into a meeting where the president agreed to that ‘irresponsible, ridiculous, stupid proposal.’”Trump’s decision to buck GOP leaders left McConnell on defense earlier this week, when he said Democrats were prematurely celebrating the short-term deal. He argued he actually outmaneuvered them, by including language in the newly passed bill that preserves the Treasury Department’s ability to apply “extraordinary measures,” allowing it to shift money within government accounts to extend the period of time before the next debt limit vote. That language means Congress won’t have to vote on a debt ceiling again until well into 2018, he said.The scenario still leaves GOP leaders with a debt ceiling vote ahead of next year’s election, though. In fact, the closer it gets to the November elections, it’s arguably an even more dicey vote for Republicans. Pelosi said she didn’t know what McConnell was talking about. “He’s cleaning up his act and you [reporters] are falling for it or something, I don’t know,” she told HuffPost. “That was like, what? Because he put extraordinary measures? No, we wanted extraordinary measures.” McConnell spokesman Don Stewart disputed Pelosi’s characterization of the meeting, saying that Democrats objected to keeping extraordinary measures in the bill and said the GOP leader did not set the bar for a short-term deal. He pointed to a statement that Pelosi and Schumer issued ahead of the White House meeting showing that they were planning to push for a three-month debt ceiling hike.“She’s giving you some revisionist history,” Stewart said, referring to the idea that McConnell was the first to float the three-month timeline.Asked how McConnell and Ryan reacted when Trump announced that he was with Democrats on the deal, Pelosi shrugged. “Silence, I think.”"
